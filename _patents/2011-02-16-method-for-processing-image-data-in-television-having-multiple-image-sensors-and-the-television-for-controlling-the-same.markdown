Field","One or more embodiments described herein relate to a display device.","2. Background","A variety of display devices have been proposed in order to meet consumer demand and provide new products and services. These devices include high-definition televisions, computer monitors and mobile terminals and as well as a myriad of others. In spite of their commercial success, many improvements are needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","30","40","40","100"]},"The content provider  manufactures various contents and provides them. Examples of the content provider  include a terrestrial broadcaster, a cable system operator (SO), a multiple system operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, and an Internet broadcaster, as illustrated in . Also, the content provider  may provide various applications in addition to broadcast contents.","The service provider  can provide contents provided by the content provider  by service-packaging them. For example, the service provider  of  can package first terrestrial broadcasting, second terrestrial broadcasting, cable MSO, satellite broadcasting, various kinds of Internet broadcasting, application, etc. and provide the packaged one to a user.","The network provider  may provide a network for providing a service to the client . The client  may construct a home network end user (HNED) to receive a service.","The client  may provide contents through the network. In this case, the client  may be a content provider contrary to the above. The content provider  may receive contents from the client . In this case, it is advantageous in that bidirectional content service or data service is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","203","205","204","206","207","208","209","210","212","211","214","213"]},"Moreover, a plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  are connected with the multimedia device , by a connection mode of a USB mode, for example. Also, although the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  are designed as separate modules in , the plurality of heterogeneous images sensors  may be designed in such a manner that they are housed in the multimedia device .","The network interface  receives packets from a network, and transmits the packets to the network. In other words, the network interface  receives services, contents, etc. from the service provider through the network.","The TCP\/IP manager  is involved in packets received in the multimedia device  and packets transmitted from the multimedia device , i.e., packet transfer from the source to the destination. The service delivery manager  takes the role of control of received service data. For example, if the service delivery manager  controls real-time streaming data, it can use RTP\/RTCP. If the service delivery manager  transmits the real time streaming data by using RTP, it parses the received packets in accordance with RTP and transmits the parsed packets to the demultiplexer  or stores the parsed packets in the SI&Metadata DB  under the control of the service manager . The service delivery manager  feeds the received information back to a server, which provides a service, by using RTCP.","The demultiplexer  demultiplexes the received packets to audio, video and PSI (Program Specific information) data and then transmits the demultiplexed data to the audio decoder , the video decoder , and the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , respectively.","The PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  receives and decodes PSI section, PSIP (Program and Service information Protocol) section or SI (Service Information) section, which is demultiplexed by the demultiplexer .","Also, the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes the received sections to make a database for service information, and stores the database for service information in the SI&Metadata DB .","The audio\/video decoders \/ decode the video data and the audio data, which are received from the demultiplexer .","The UI manager  provides a graphic user interface (GUI) for the user by using an on screen display (OSD), etc. and performs a receiving operation based on a key input from the user. For example, if a key input signal for channel selection is input from the user, the UI manager  transmits the key input signal to the service manager .","The service manager  controls managers related to the service, such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","Also, the service manager  makes a channel map and selects a channel by using the channel map in accordance with the key input signal received from the UI manager . The service discovery manager  provides information required to select the service provider that provides services. If a signal related to channel selection is received from the service manager , the service discovery manager  discovers a corresponding service by using the received information.","The service control manager  takes the role of selection and control of the service. For example, if the user selects a live broadcasting service like the existing broadcasting mode, the service control manager  uses IGMP or RTSP. If the user selects a video on demand (VOD) service, the service control manager  selects and controls the service by using RTSP. The metadata manager  manages metadata related to the service and stores the metadata in the SI&Metadata DB .","The SI&Metadata DB  stores the service information decoded by the PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , the metadata managed by the metadata manager , and the information required to select the service provider provided by the service discovery manager . Also, the SI&Metadata DB  may store setup data for the system.","The IG  is a gateway where functions required to access IMS based IPTV services are collected.","The plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  illustrated in  are designed to take a single image or a plurality of images of a person or object located in the periphery of the multimedia device . In more detail, the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  are designed to operate the single image or the plurality of images continuously, periodically, at a selected time, or at a specific condition only, as described later in more detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The sensors also include one or more second image sensors related to color data processing have drawbacks in that they have a slow recognition speed and are not robust to light condition. Accordingly, in order to solve the drawbacks of the image sensors, the multimedia device is designed to interact with a hybrid type image sensor module that is a hybrid type of the first image sensor and the second image sensor.","An IR camera or depth camera is used as the first image sensor. In more detail, a time of flight (TOF) type IR camera or depth camera and a structured light type IR camera or depth camera have been discussed. The TOF type IR camera or depth camera calculates distance information by using the time difference resulting from emission of infrared rays. The structured light type IR camera or depth camera calculates distance information by emitting infrared rays to a specific pattern and analyzing a modified pattern. The first image sensor is advantageous in view of depth data recognition and processing speed, and easily senses object, person, etc. even at a dark place. However, the first image sensor has a drawback in that it has low resolution at a long distance.","Moreover, a color camera or RGB camera is used as the second image sensor. In more detail, a stereo camera type color camera or RGB camera and a mono camera type color camera or RGB camera have been discussed. The stereo camera type color camera or RGB camera detects and traces the hand or face based on image time comparison information taken through two cameras. The mono camera type color camera or RGB camera detects and traces the hand or face based on shape and color information taken through one camera. The second image sensor is advantageous in that it has more improved resolution than that of the first image sensor, whereas the second image sensor has drawbacks in that it is vulnerable to peripheral lighting and it is difficult to recognize the corresponding object at a dark place. In particular, the second image sensor has a drawback in that it is difficult to recognize exact depth.","As illustrated in , the multimedia device is designed to have both the first image sensor and the second image sensor. The image sensors may be designed in such a manner that they are embedded in the multimedia device, or may be designed as separate hardware modules. First of all, as illustrated in (b) of , the first image sensor takes images that include users located in the periphery of the multimedia device. Detailed taking-images are illustrated in (), (), () and () of  in due order.","If image-taking and data analysis of the first image sensor are completed, as illustrated in (a) of , the second image sensor takes images of a face of a specific user. Detailed taking-images are illustrated in (), (), and () of  in due order.","The first image sensor of the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors according to one embodiment of the present invention takes first images located in the periphery of the multimedia device and extracts depth data from the taken first images. As illustrated in () of , the first image sensor can be designed in such a manner that a field of each object is displayed at different contrast ratios depending on the distance.","Moreover, the first image sensor can recognize a face of at least one user by using the extracted depth data. In other words, the first image sensor extracts body information (for example, face, hand, foot, joint, etc.) of the user by using the database, etc., as illustrated in () of , and acquires location coordinates and distance information of a face of a specific user as illustrated in () of . In more detail, the first image sensor is designed to calculate values x, y, and z which are location information on the face of the user, wherein the x means the location on a horizontal axis of the face in the taken first image, the y means the location on a vertical axis of the face in the taken first image, and the z means the distance between the face of the user and the first image sensor.","Also, among the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors according to one embodiment of the present invention, the second image sensor for extracting color images takes second images of the recognized face of the user, and is illustrated in () of .","If the first image sensor and the second image sensor illustrated in  are designed to adjoin each other, an error due to the difference in physical location may be disregarded. However, according to another embodiment, the second image sensor is designed to compensate for the coordinate information or distance information acquired by the first image sensor by using the information on the difference in physical location and to take the user by using the compensated coordinate information or distance information.","Also, if the first image sensor and the second image sensor are designed to be arranged horizontally from the ground, the information on the difference in physical location can be set based on a horizontal frame. The second image sensor, as illustrated in () of , extracts feature information from the taken second image. The feature information is data corresponding to a specific part (for example, mouse, nose, eye, etc.) for identifying a plurality of users who use the multimedia device. Moreover, the second image sensor may zoom in a zone corresponding to the face of the user based on the coordinate values (the values x, y, and z) obtained through image-taking of the first image sensor. This means a procedure of switching from () of  to () of .","If image-taking and analysis of the first image sensor and the second image sensor are completely performed, the multimedia device according to one embodiment of the present invention accesses a memory that stores data corresponding to the extracted feature information, and extracts information for identifying a specific user stored in the memory.","If the information for identifying a specific user exists in the memory, the multimedia device provides a service previously set for the specific user. On the other hand, if the information for identifying a specific user does not exist in the memory, the multimedia device is designed to display a guide message for storing the recognized user information in the memory.","As described above, according to one embodiment, the first image sensor is designed to detect user location information or coordinate information on the face of the user while the second image sensor is designed to recognize the face by using the data acquired by the first image sensor.","Moreover, according to another embodiment, the second image sensor is designed in such a manner that it is operated only in case of a specific condition. For example, if the distance information acquired by the operation of the first image sensor between the user and the first image sensor is less than a first reference value, or if a recognition rate on the face of the user, which is acquired by the operation of the first image sensor, is more than a second reference value, the face of the user located in the periphery of the multimedia device is detected and recognized by the first image sensor only.","On the other hand, if the distance information acquired by the operation of the first image sensor exceeds the first reference value, or if the recognition rate on the face of the user, which is acquired by the operation of the first image sensor, is less than the second reference value, the second image sensor is additionally used to recognize the face of the user.","According to another embodiment, the second image sensor is designed to perform zoom-in by using the distance information acquired by the first image sensor in the procedure of recognizing the face of the user and to take the face only by using face coordinate information acquired by the first image sensor.","Accordingly, the different types of heterogeneous image sensors are used as above, it is advantageous in that it enables long-distance face recognition and data processing speed is improved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The face detection includes a process of detecting a face zone within one image, whereas the face recognition is a process of recognizing whether the detected face corresponds to which specific user.
