{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Entity resolution involves identifying two or more records (or fields associated with the records) that are associated with the same entity, or person, and consolidating the respective records into a single record. When dealing with different sources for the records, the algorithms have to resolve the discrepancies between the sources of the records. For example, the field names and formats may be different between different sources. Entity resolution algorithms typically rely on user-defined functions that compare fields or records to determine if they match (e.g., are they likely to represent the same real-world person). When a match is found, the matching records or fields are typically combined into a single record. Often, when the records are combined, the associated fields may be combined as well and data may be lost (e.g., creating a new name based on two slightly different versions of the name in the two matched records).","The teachings of the present disclosure relate to methods and apparatuses for generating a fused view of one or more people. One such method includes receiving data from a plurality of disparate data sources. The plurality of data sources comprising data associated with a plurality of different people. At least two different data sources comprise data associated with at least one common person. The method also includes extracting a plurality of records. The plurality of records may comprise at least one record from each of the plurality of disparate data sources. Each of the extracted records may be associated with a corresponding real-world person and may comprise at least one feature associated with the corresponding person. The method additionally includes distributing the plurality of records to a plurality of computers. The plurality of computers are configured to identify one or more matches between the plurality of records based on at least one matching feature associated with two or more different records. The method further includes merging the at least one feature from each of the two or more different records of each corresponding match into one or more merged records. Each of the one or more merged records may correspond to a different match of the one or more matches. The method also includes generating at least one fused view. The at least one fused view may be associated with the at least one common person and may comprise at least a first merged record. The first merged record may comprise at least a first matching feature associated with two or more different records associated with the at least one common person.","Technical advantages of particular embodiments may include providing a single fused view for a particular person. The fused view may consolidate information about a single real-world person from multiple sources into a single fused view. Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","120","120","110","120","130","130","130","130","110","130"],"i":["a","d ","a","c "]},"As discussed in more detail below with respect to , ERRI computer  may comprise any computer or combination of components configured to generate a fused view for one or more people based on data received from a plurality of disparate data sources . In certain embodiments, ERRI computer  may extract records from the data received from data sources . The extracted records may be organized in a table (e.g., via HBase). For example, each record may be a different row and each feature may be a different column. A record may comprise each feature associated with a particular person from a particular data source. For example, each feature (e.g., name, friend's name, location, etc.) extracted from a particular person's user account or profile from data source may be entered into a corresponding feature column (each column is associated with a different type of feature). In some embodiments and\/or scenarios the data entered into a feature, such as a name or an address, may be Romanized and\/or parsed. This may allow ERRI computer  to introduce some uniformity to the data received from the disparate data sources . In some scenarios, the features may comprise non-textual information (e.g., a photograph of a person or a location).","In certain embodiments, ERRI computer  may distribute the extracted records to computers . The records may be distributed in a manner that may allow computers  to work in parallel. The distribution of the records may be such that additional computers  may be added as the number of records increases or in response to increases in urgency (e.g., to shorten response time to requests for a fused view). For example, in some embodiments the Hadoop framework may be used to allow linear scalability of system . In certain embodiments, ERRI computer  may provide one or more rules to computers . The rules may specify one or more requirements for finding a match between records. The requirements may comprise linking features with Boolean operators such as <AND>, <OR>, or <ANY>. For example, the rules may specify that a first feature <AND> a second feature must match for the records to be a match. The rules may, in some instances, combine multiple Boolean operators into a single rule. For example, the rules may specify that a first feature <AND> a second feature <OR> <ANY> of a third feature and a fourth feature must match for the record to be a match.","ERRI computer  may merge matching records identified by computers . In some embodiments, merging two or more records may comprise adding a unique user ID to the two or more matching records. In particular embodiments, merging two or more records may comprise combining the features from the two records into a new record. Both the matching records and the new merged record may include references to each other or a unique user ID indicating that they all correspond to the same real-world person.","In some embodiments, ERRI computer  may identify relationships between people based on the records (matched and unmatched records). The relationships may include explicit or obvious relationships, such as where one person is listed as a \u201cfriend\u201d of another person. The relationships may include implicit or non-obvious relationships, such as two people who live in the same area and work for the same company. In some embodiments, a certain number of associations may be needed before a relationship is found. ERRI computer  may also analyze patterns of relationships, such as patterns in joint travel to particular locations or patterns of communications with particular other people. In some embodiments, ERRI computer  may provide computers  with one or more rules, protocols, and\/or algorithms to allow computers  to identify relationships and relationship patterns.","Data sources  may comprise any of a variety of public data sources and (e.g., social networking websites, forums, blogs, chat rooms, etc.) and private data sources and (e.g., aviation no-fly lists, government watch lists, wanted lists, etc.). While public data sources -are illustrated as being connected to ERRI computer  through network  and private data sources -are illustrated as being connected directly to ERRI computer , any data source, whether private or public, may be accessed directly or via one or more networks (e.g., network ). The data received from data sources  may comprise a wide variety of different information types arranged and\/or formatted in different ways. For example, depending on the data source, a person may be identified by a screen name, an email address, the person's actual name, or some combination of the above. The information associated with each person may include information about the person's activities (e.g., travel, interests, etc.) and\/or about other people. In some embodiments and\/or scenarios ERRI computer  may receive private data from one of the public data sources or . For example, ERRI computer  may receive an email address associated with a profile, the email address may not be viewable by the public or it may not even be viewable by other people with a profile with the data source.","Computers  may comprise any number of any type of computer running any type of operating system. Computers  may be configured to work in parallel to identify matching features between the records extracted by ERRI computer . Computers  may use a variety of different algorithms, protocols, rules, and\/or schemas to identify matching features between records. Matching features may include identical or similar features. In certain embodiments, matches may be found despite typographical errors. Matches may include temporal and\/or spatial (or geographic) features.","Network  may comprise any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals, data, and\/or messages, including, but not limited to, signals, file transfer protocols, data or messages transmitted through WebPages, e-mail, text chat, voice over IP (VoIP), and instant messaging. Generally, network  may provide for the communication of packets, cells, frames, or other portions of information (generally referred to as packets herein) between the various components.

Herein, reference to a computer-readable storage medium excludes any medium that is not eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101. Herein, reference to a computer-readable storage medium excludes transitory forms of signal transmission (such as a propagating electrical or electromagnetic signal per se) to the extent that they are not eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101.","Particular embodiments may include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media implementing any suitable storage. In particular embodiments, a computer-readable storage medium implements one or more portions of processor  (such as, for example, one or more internal registers or caches), one or more portions of memory , one or more portions other data storage devices or components, or a combination of these, where appropriate. In particular embodiments, a computer-readable storage medium implements RAM or ROM. In particular embodiments, a computer-readable storage medium implements volatile or persistent memory or data storage. In particular embodiments, one or more computer-readable storage media may embody encoded software.","Herein, reference to encoded software may encompass one or more applications, bytecode, one or more computer programs, one or more executables, one or more instructions, logic, machine code, one or more scripts, or source code, and vice versa, where appropriate, that have been stored or encoded in a computer-readable storage medium.

In particular embodiments, encoded software is expressed in a higher-level programming language, such as, for example, C, Perl, or a suitable extension thereof. In particular embodiments, encoded software is expressed in a lower-level programming language, such as assembly language (or machine code). In particular embodiments, encoded software is expressed in JAVA. In particular embodiments, encoded software is expressed in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), or other suitable markup language.","Although not depicted, ERRI computer  may be coupled to a network. The term \u201cnetwork\u201d should be interpreted as generally defining any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals, data, and\/or messages, including, but not limited to, signals, file transfer protocols, data or messages transmitted through WebPages, e-mail, text chat, voice over IP (VoIP), and instant messaging. Generally, the network may provide for the communication of packets, cells, frames, or other portions of information (generally referred to as packets herein) between the various components. In some embodiments, ERRI computer  may connect to one or more data sources and\/or one or more computers through one or more networks (e.g., the Internet).","The following example may help illustrate at least one way in which the components of ERRI computer  may work together to generate a fused viewed associated with one or more people based on data received from a number of disparate data sources. In this example, processor  may load, or otherwise execute, collection logic . Collection logic may be loaded and executed periodically, upon the occurrence of a triggering event, at scheduled times, continuously, or a combination of two or more of the above.","Once executed, collection logic may receive data from any number of disparate data sources. These data sources may include both public and private data sources. For example, the public data sources may include social media sites and the private data sources may include government data sources. Moreover, in some instances collection logic may receive private data from public data sources. These disparate data sources may maintain data in different formats and contain different types of data (e.g., name, dates, addresses, etc.). Data collection logic may be able to extract different features from the data received from the various data sources. These features may be associated with particular people and may be arranged into individual records. Each record may correspond to a different account or user ID from each respective data source. Any information associated with the account or user ID may be placed into a different feature. In some embodiments, collection logic may arrange the extracted data into a table in which each row corresponds to a different record (e.g., a different user account from a different data source) and each extracted feature from the corresponding user account may go into a different column. Each column may contain the same type of information. For example, feature  may comprise any identified first name from any record. In addition to extracting the various features from the data from each of the data sources, collection logic may also be configured to normalize the data. For example, collection logic may Romanize and\/or parse people's names. As another example, collection logic may assign a particular geocode representing a geographic area. For example, a particular city may have a particular geocode. As another example, collection logic may parse a person's addresses including, but not limited to, email addresses, street addresses, home addresses and\/or work addresses. Collection logic may also be able to do trend literation of data collected and\/or received from disparate data sources. Collection logic may be running and collecting data independently of any matching that may be done. That is, collection logic may be continually receiving data and extracting records without matching logic necessarily searching for matches.","Whereas collection logic may be running continuously, matching logic may be loaded and executed periodically, at scheduled intervals, or upon receiving a request or detecting a triggering event. That is, matching logic may be run in a batch mode. In certain embodiments, matching logic may be configured to distribute the records to several different computers. The records may be distributed so as to allow the computers to process the records in a parallel fashion. For example, the records and\/or any matching logic may be divided into subsets, each computer working on a different subset. As another example, different computers may run different algorithms, the different algorithms may be running in parallel with one another.","Matching logic may also be configured to distribute one or more rules along with the data records. The rules may specify how one or more features are to be combined in order for a match to be found. For example, one rule may specify that two records may match if Feature  <AND> Feature  match Feature . Other types of rules may include combining one or more features through <AND>, <OR>, <ANY>, or any other operator that may be used to combine rules in a way to allow greater control over matching. In some embodiments, matching logic may also provide the computers with one or more algorithms, protocols, or logic configured to identify similar features. This may include, for example, identifying typographical errors, common variations of the same word, nicknames, or any other distinction between similar features. When two or more matching records are found, a unique user ID may be added to a new feature column of the matching records.","In some embodiments, matching logic may also be able to identify one or more relationships between the various people. The relationships may be identified based on one or more features within the corresponding records. For example, relationships may be found where a person identifies another person as a friend, where two people work at the same company at the same location, where two people share an address (e.g., work or home), or any other indicator or factor that may be indicative of two people knowing one another. Matching logic may also look for patterns within the relationships. Such as travel patterns or communication patterns. When a relationship is found, information about the relationship may be added to a new feature column for each of the corresponding people. This unique ID may correspond to an actual real-world person. That is, for any two records that have been determined to be associated with the same real-world person, a new unique user ID may be associated with that real-world person and added to each of the matching records.","Thus far, several different embodiments and features have been presented. Particular embodiments may combine one or more of these features depending on operational needs and\/or component limitations. This may allow for great adaptability of ERRI computer  to the needs of various organizations and people. Some embodiments may include additional or different features. In particular embodiments, the functionality of ERRI computer  may be provided by additional or different devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":"210"},"The method begins at step  where data from disparate data sources is received. The data may be received by the ERRI computer. Once received the data may be stored at the ERRI computer or at an external data storage device coupled to the ERRI computer. The disparate data sources may include different and\/or separate data sources maintained and\/or operated by different business and\/or government entities. For example, depending on the scenario and\/or embodiment, the disparate data sources may include two or more of the following data sources: social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, MySpsace, etc.), forums, blogs, government watch lists (e.g., wanted lists, terrorist lists, persons of interest lists, no-fly lists, etc.), or any other data source which may include information about real-world people. The received data may include data associated with a plurality of different people, some of the people may have data associated with them at more than one of the disparate data sources. The data may be received and\/or collected independent of any requests to generate a fused view (e.g., at step ). For example, new data may be received continuously, periodically, at scheduled intervals, or upon a triggering event (e.g., upon new data being added to one or more of the data sources).","At step  records are extracted from the data received from the plurality of disparate data sources. The extracted records may comprise one record for each person's user account or profile from each data source. For example, if one data source has three-thousand user accounts and a second data source has five-thousand user accounts, then the ERRI computer would extract eight-thousand records. Each record may comprise at least one feature associated with the corresponding user account. The features may include, but are not limited to, screen name, user ID, real name, address (e.g., home, work, email, IP, etc.), phone number (e.g., cell phone, home phone, work phone, etc.), location (current location, home location, work location, travel location, city, state, county, country, latitude and longitude, etc.), known acquaintances or relationships, non-textual information (e.g., pictures, maps, audio files or recordings, video clips, etc.), timing information (e.g., when they posted a message, when they went on a trip, etc.), tags or other meta data, data source specific features, or any other information that may be used to identify or classify either the person or the relationships the person has with other people. In some embodiments, the records may be extracted into a database or table, such as HBase. HBase may comprise a generic table in which each row is associated with a different record and each column is associated with a different feature. Depending on the data source, the feature associated with a piece of information may be explicit (e.g., the data source may have a name field) or the ERRI computer may have to recognize that a piece of informant is a particular feature (e.g., recognize that a particular string of text is a user name for another person).","In some embodiments, the ERRI computer may normalize the extracted data. For example, the ERRI computer may romanize and\/or parse names, add geocodes (e.g., unique codes based on predetermined geographical areas), parse addresses, transliterate, translate, and\/or perform any other type of normalization that may be helpful in allowing different features from different data sources to be compared for possible matches. The data may also be cleaned by filtering out garbage entries and\/or removing null fields and\/or duplicate data.","At step  a request to generate a fused view is received. The request may be generated in any of a variety of ways including both user entered requests and automated or computer generated requests. For example, a government agent that would like to identify all the records and relationships associated with a particular person, may send a request to the ERRI computer for a fused view associated with that person. As another example, the ERRI computer may be connected to, or a component of, a larger computer system designed to identify persons of interest. The larger computer system may use the steps illustrated in  as a way of condensing the information from the plurality of disparate data sources into a number of fused views associated with each of the individual people.","At step  the records are distributed to several computers configured to identify matches between the records. In certain embodiments, the records may be distributed in such a way as to allow several computers to work through a large amount of records in a parallel fashion. The number of computers to which the records are distributed may vary depending on operational parameters. The computers may be running different matching algorithms or they may be running the same algorithm for different subsets of the records. In some embodiments, the records may be distributed using the Hadoop framework.","Matching records may be identified based on the likelihood that two or more different records correspond to the same real-world person. That is, it is likely that many real-world people will have accounts or profiles with more than one social media site and that some people on various government watch lists may also have social media accounts. The computers may not be able to actually identify the real-world person, but they may be able to identify records that correspond to the same real-world person. A computer may be configured to identify the matches based on matching one or more features associated with the different records.","There may be more than one type of feature matching done by the computers. For example, the computers may be configured to do one or more of exact matching (e.g., the same information for the same features for two or more records); non-textual matching (e.g., matching facial features from pictures or voice signatures from audio files, etc.); similarity matching (e.g., textual, geo spatial, or temporal similarity matching); or any other type of matching between features of two or more records.","The matching algorithms, rules, and\/or protocols used to find matches may include any number of techniques for identifying matches despite the features not being exactly the same. In some embodiments, matches may be found where two different words are used to reference the same person, place, or thing. For example, a match may be found between Tom and Tommy or AAC and America Airlines Center. Matches may also be found despite typographical errors.","In some embodiments, a match having textual similarity may comprise using a user defined comparison algorithm with a threshold value and blocking strategy. Geo spatial similarity matching may comprise geo spatially encoded features that fall within the same grid designation. Temporal similarity matching may provide features that are within the same time block. In some embodiments, matching may employ feature sprawl. Feature sprawl may comprise the ability to combine features to be compared as one feature for matching. For example, referring to table , feature sprawl may be used to identify a match between Record  and Record  based on Feature  of Record  comprising the first name of \u201cTom\u201d and Feature  of Record  comprising the last name \u201cSmith\u201d and Feature  of Record  comprising the full name \u201cTommy Smith.\u201d Another type of matching may comprise feature set matching. Feature set matching may comprise the ability to handle mismatched feature naming, such as matching a first name feature from one person and a full name feature from another person.","At step  rules may be distributed to the computers. The rules may comprise algorithms, protocols, and\/or logic for the computers to use in identifying matches. In some embodiments, the rules may include requirements for how features should be arranged or combined in order to find a match. In certain embodiments, the rules may specify that one or more features may be combined using <AND>, <OR>, or <ANY>. For example, referring to table , a match may require that Feature  <AND> Feature  of two different records match. As another example, a match may require a similarity between <ANY> of Features  and  of two different records.","At step , features from matched records are merged into a merged record. Each merged record may comprise features from the two or more records that were identified as being matches. In some embodiments, the merged record may be added to the other records in a record repository and re-distributed at step . In some embodiments, when merging the features from the two or more identified matching records, the two underlying, or original, records are maintained within the plurality of records. In certain embodiments, when two or more records are merged, a unique identifier may be added to each of the matching records. The unique identifier may be associated with the match.","At step  one or more relationships are identified between people. The identified relationships may be added as a feature to the corresponding records of the associated people. In some embodiments, the relationships may be identified and maintained in a separate list of records or as separate records with the records extracted from the disparate data sources. Some possible types of relationships include, but are not limited to, employment relationships, school or education based relationships, travel relationships, neighbor or location based relationships, behavior based relationships, communication relationships, or any other relationship which may suggest that two or more people know each other.","At step  patterns are identified between the relationships of the people. For example, the extracted records may not include information from which it may be determined that a first person and second person have a relationship, but if the first person and a third person have a relationship and the second person and the third person have a relationship then a pattern may suggest that the first person and the second person have a relationship through the third person. Patterns in travel and\/or communication may also be identified.","At step , after the matched records have been identified and any relationships and patterns have also been identified, the updated merged records may be added to the existing plurality of records that were extracted at step . The method may then return to step  and re-execute steps  through . This may be repeated as many times as needed or specified. For example, in some embodiments this may be repeated until no additional matches are found. As another example, an operator may specify that the steps may be repeated a fixed number of times.","At step  a fused view is generated. The fused view may comprise a representation of the gathered features from the different data sources as well as the identified relationships and patterns associated with each person. This may allow the system to present a more complete representation of a particular real-world person based on all the information that has been gathered and analyzed from the disparate data sources.","While the embodiment depicted in  includes a certain number of steps, depicted in a certain order, it is to be understood that other embodiments may have more, fewer or different steps, and the steps may be rearranged or performed simultaneously. For example, in some embodiments, relationships and patterns may be identified after the ERRI computer has determined that all the matches have been found.","While various implementations and features are discussed with respect to multiple embodiments, it should be understood that such implementations and features may be combined, re-arranged, or modified in various embodiments. For example, features and functionality discussed with respect to a particular figure, such as , may be used in connection with features and functionality discussed with respect to another such figure, such as  or , according to operational needs or desires. Furthermore, the elements of ERRI computer  may be combined, rearranged or positioned in order to accommodate particular operational needs. In addition, any of these elements may be provided as separate external components to each other where appropriate. Particular embodiments contemplate great flexibility in the arrangement of these elements as well as their internal components.","Numerous other changes, substitutions, variations, alterations and modifications may be ascertained by those skilled in the art and it is intended that the present disclosure encompass all such changes, substitutions, variations, alterations and modifications as falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":["For a more complete understanding of particular embodiments and their advantages, reference is now made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
