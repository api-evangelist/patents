title: Method and apparatus for creating an adaptive application
abstract: An Adaptive Software Application consists of several types of modules, called Adaptive Units, which are highly parameterized such that they can adapt to varying business requirements by virtue of externally provided parameters. An Adaptive Application is assembled through repeated use of various combinations of different types of Adaptive Units. Large and complex business systems can be rapidly implemented through this approach. An Adaptive Unit includes interface components that can present information to and accept information from the outside world (such as a web page or a system interface), processing logic components that can manipulate and evaluate information based on received parameters received (such as comparisons and decisions including data dependency decisions), and data persistence logic components that retrieves, adds, updates, and deletes data targeting one or more Occurrence Databases. All three components of an Adaptive Unit are parameter driven. These parameters are not specific to any particular business.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","To date, software applications for businesses have required significant development time and once built cannot be easily modified to adapt to changes in business needs. Given the length of the development cycle vis-\u00e1-vis the length of the business cycle, this almost always leads to software systems that are outdated the moment they are completed.","For example, in the insurance industry computer systems exist to administer insurance policies for large insurers. These large software systems took years to implement and are not flexible enough to evolve with the business. As a result, most insurance companies today have out-of-date and inflexible systems and are confronted with excessive costs and delays in introducing new technologies and maintaining legacy systems. For example, the cost of handling year 2000 issues in the insurance industry was exorbitant. Consequently, many insurance companies seek to free themselves of their legacy system overhead and replace them with web-based solutions that are easy to use, support multiple insurance products, and keep up with changes in the business.","An insurance executive who decides to address these issues and surveys similar projects recently undertaken by other insurance companies will find an inadequate value proposition. The planned cost for such a project ranges from $10,000,000 to $50,000,000 just for software, consulting, and personnel expenses. The planned time to complete the entire system is 2 to 4 years without any tangible result for about 18 months. The project requires input from a number of knowledgeable business staff that will typically need to be dedicated to the project for months or years. In addition, the project has a very high risk of failure. Most projects far exceed the planned cost and time. Some projects are terminated with no result. Those that are implemented often lack the functionality and flexibility initially envisioned, resulting in yet another \u201clegacy\u201d system.","In an attempt to deal with their past inability to address the issues of speed, cost, and flexibility, software vendors have recently been emphasizing the \u201ccomponentized\u201d nature of their software. In theory, component-based software architectures enable customers to develop systems quickly by reusing components, ultimately reducing system maintenance costs.","While the advantages of this component rationale have been highly touted, the expected benefits have yet to manifest themselves. Current projects utilizing even the newest software products marketed in this manner are still facing implementation schedules of two to four years or more. In reality, considerable programming effort is required to implement component-based systems to coordinate the functionality of all the components. Components may be reused but the custom logic that binds them into an operational system must still be specified and coded requiring additional consulting and personnel expenses. Therefore, by itself componentized software is not a solution to the above problem.","One attempted solution to the problem has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,394, which discloses a method and system for database application software creation with minimal programming. This type of system consists of a surrogate environment, which is used to capture the requirements for the target application; a code generator, which synthesizes the code and creates the database for the target application based on the information from the surrogate environment, and the target application itself.","However, the use of this approach introduces a large overhead and imposes certain restrictions that are idiosyncratic to each code synthesizer. Most insurance companies prefer a system that does not use a code synthesizer.","The present invention is therefore directed to the problem of developing a method and apparatus for building software based systems for business solutions, which method and apparatus enable these software-based systems to be developed and fielded rapidly while providing the ability to accept modifications and new requirements in short order, yet reduce the associated costs of development and maintenance while avoiding the use of a code synthesizer.","The present invention solves these and other problems by providing an adaptive software application that consists of several types of modules, called Adaptive Units, which are highly parameterized such that they can adapt to varying business requirements by virtue of externally provided parameters. An Adaptive Application is assembled through repeated use of various combinations of different types of Adaptive Units. Large and complex business systems can be rapidly implemented through this approach.","According to one aspect of the present invention, an Adaptive Unit includes an interface component that can present information to and accept information from the outside world (such as a web page or a system interface), a processing logic component that can manipulate and evaluate information based on parameters received (such as comparisons and decisions as in the case of data dependency decisions), and a data persistence logic component that retrieves, adds, updates, and deletes data targeting one or more Occurrence Databases.","According to another aspect of the present invention, all three components of an Adaptive Unit are parameter driven. These parameters are not specific to any particular business. One embodiment for providing parameters to these components includes a Definition Database, which is detailed below.","According to still another aspect of the present invention unit there may be one or more Occurrence Databases depending on the number of business processes supported by the business application for which the Adaptive Application is being adapted. Typically, there is one Occurrence Database per business process.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the Occurrence Database includes generic (also referred to as meta model driven) tables that are not specific to any particular business.","The Adaptive Application disclosed herein accelerates business software implementation, reduces the cost of system development and system evolution, improves overall system quality and usability, enables a business to take advantage of previously unapproachable niche product opportunities, and mitigates project risks associated with large systems initiatives.","While the Adaptive Application invention can be employed for many types of business applications, an exemplary embodiment of an apparatus can be used for creating, managing and administering insurance policies, which is referred to as Policy Writer. This embodiment can be programmed in Java and HTML code. The system is highly portable and can utilize any JDBC compliant data base management system (e.g., DB2, Oracle, Sybase, MS SQL Server). The embodiment includes an XML oriented database architecture making it readily able to provide enterprise application integration with other systems and communicate externally with other business partners.","According to one aspect of the present invention, embodiments herein utilize software templates that make it possible to reuse all of the business logic without limiting the ability to customize these templates as needed. This represents a major leap to what is currently available in the marketplace.","The embodiment is a comprehensive policy administration system that offers unprecedented speed, flexibility, and functionality at an attractive price. It enables a significant reduction in planned costs, time, and resources.","Other aspects of the present invention will become apparent based upon a reading of the following detailed description in light of the attached drawings.","It is worthy to note that any reference herein to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","As stated above, the inventions herein are applicable to many types of business applications, including but not limited to insurance policy management, financial services and product design, management and implementation, legal services, industrial processes, architectural design, etc. to name only a few. Other applications will become apparent based on the description herein.","To facilitate an understanding of the various inventions herein, an embodiment relating to management of insurance policies will now be described. Many of the steps in creating the necessary application require interaction with the customer to determine the requirements of the particular application. These requirements are embodied in the navigational design of the web pages and the layout of the various web pages. Once the navigational design and layouts are complete, the inventions herein enable rapid development of the necessary web screens. This will become apparent in the following exemplary embodiment.","Overall Process for Creating Insurance Policy Management Application","The present invention includes inter alia an adaptive application that can be adapted to a wide variety of business applications, including insurance and financial services, to name only a few. The adaptive application includes the core modules needed to perform the main functionality of any business application.","Turning to , a process for adapting the software application to manage policies for an insurance company is shown therein. In this exemplary embodiment, the resulting application must create, manage and administer a variety of insurance products, some of which may be developed after the creation of this software application.","The first step  of adapting the adaptive application for an insurance company to manage its policies consists of identifying the screens needed for entering and modifying the information to describe the insurance products (e.g., what coverages, limits, deductibles are offered) to be managed by the application. Typically, this step is part of an interview process with the various employees and managers of the insurance company. In conventional software developments, this step is often employed later in the process, but the inventors have determined that by identifying these screens first, the application can be built more rapidly than heretofore possible.","Once the screens are identified, the web pages can be created. According to one aspect of the present invention, the inventors have identified that any web page needed in these business applications can be created from various combinations of Adaptive Units, which will be described in more detail below. By reusing the Adaptive Units in necessary and\/or desired combinations, any web page or screen can be created in a fraction of the time heretofore possible. This significantly speeds up the process of developing these types of large software applications. Moreover, while the Adaptive Units are described herein with respect to web pages, Adaptive Units can be configured to interact with other interfaces.","The Adaptive Units set forth herein provide three levels of functionality\u2014interfacing with a user, performing data manipulation and performing data persistence functions with the Occurrence Database. These functions will be described more completely later. There are several different types of Adaptive Units, which are discussed below. By combining each type of Adaptive Unit with other types, as necessary, any interface screen or device can be created, thereby removing the requirement for developing these separately.","For each screen identified in Step  (element ), next the Adaptive Units are created (element ), which are copies of Adaptive Unit Templates that apply to that screen. In this case, the user identifies the necessary functionality and uses the various Adaptive Unit types to create the necessary functionality of the interface.","A View Name is assigned to each Adaptive Unit by inserting it into the copied software (element ). Each Adaptive Unit uses this View Name to obtain all of its parameters. Some Adaptive Units may require two View Names. The View Name links externally supplied parameters to the particular Adaptive Unit, thereby enabling the Adaptive Unit to be adapted to a specific function desired by the user.","In the Definition Database, the necessary information associated with each View Name that has been assigned is created (element ). This information includes VIEW, ENTITY, ENTITY ANCESTRY, QUESTIONS, QUESTION RELATIONS, ANSWER OPTIONS, VIEW ITEMS, VIEW ITEM DEPENDENCY LINES, and VIEW ITEM DEPENDENCY VALUES (see FIG. ). All of these information elements are not specific to any given business process, and therefore can be filled with information necessary to any given business process. Thus, the Adaptive Units can receive parameters that are unique to each business process to which the application is being adapted through these information fields from, for example the Definition Database. This information could be provided by another method, such as via an application programming interface to name only one possibility.","Next, all the Adaptive Units are assembled into a \u201cProduct Definition\u201d application (element ). In other words, this Product Definition application is the first application for which the Adaptive Application was adapted. This Product Definition application creates the web pages or screens and functionality that were identified in step .","The Product Definition Application is then used to enter the information to describe each insurance product ().","Now the process moves to  (element ), which depicts the process for adapting the Adaptive Application into an application for creating insurance policies .","At this point it becomes necessary to identify the screens needed for entering and modifying the information to describe policies (e.g., insured's name, address, selected coverages, limits and deductibles) (element ).","For each screen identified in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Adaptive Units are created (element ), which Adaptive units are copies of the Adaptive Unit Templates that apply to that screen.","A View Name is then assigned to each newly created Adaptive Unit, by inserting it into the copied software (element ). The Adaptive Unit will use this View Name to obtain all of its parameters. As before, some Adaptive Units may require two View Names.","In the Definition Database, the necessary information associated with each View Name that has been assigned is created (element ). This information consists of two types. The cross-product information includes VIEW, ENTITY, ENTITY ANCESTRY, QUESTIONS, QUESTION RELATIONS, ANSWER OPTIONS, VIEW ITEMS, VIEW ITEM DEPENDENCY LINES, and VIEW ITEM DEPENDENCY VALUES. All of these information elements are not specific to any given business process, and therefore can be filled with information necessary to a given business process. Thus, the Adaptive Units for this business process can receive parameters that are unique to each business process to which the application is being adapted through these information fields from, for example the Definition Database. This information could be provided by another method, such as via an application programming interface to name only one possibility. The product specific information includes CONTRACT QUESTION BY PRODUCT, CONTRACT QUESTION BY PRODUCT OCCURRENCE, and CONTRACT ANSWER OPTION BY PRODUCT OCCURRENCE. These information elements make it possible to vary the definition parameters for one business process (in this case, Contract Sales) with respect to the elements of another business process (in this case, Product Development). As a result, in this embodiment, the parameters that govern the behavior of the Adaptive Application for selling contracts can be varied by product or a subcomponent of a product such as Coverage Type.","Next, all the Adaptive Units are assembled into the \u201cPolicy Writing\u201d application (element ).","Then, the Policy Writing Application is used to write policies (element ). Thus, this process  ends (element ).","System Components","The embodiments of the present invention include several elements: Adaptive Units, Definition parameters, and one or more Occurrence Databases.","According to one aspect of the present invention, the business is reduced to a linear flow of business processes. An occurrence database is assigned to each process of the flow. Links between subsequent processes in the linear flow of the business are established to provide details in subsequent processes that are determined by earlier processes of the overall business.","For example, in the insurance policy management business, a process for creating the insurance products is identified and an occurrence database is defined and associated with this process. A second process is identified as the insurance policy writing process that can only occur based on insurance products defined in the earlier process of product definition. This business process identification can then continue through the entire operation of the business.","Database",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","21","22","1","22"]},"The notation linking the various blocks is in standard form, which indicates the relationship between various blocks. For example, each entity may have zero (indicated by the zero in the line linking the two blocks), one (indicated by the one written across the line linking the two blocks) or more contract occurrences (indicated by the \u201ccrows feet\u201d symbol at the end of the link between the two blocks). Moreover, each contract occurrence has one and must have one entity. Thus, this notation depicts the relationship between the two blocks. Each block represents a table in the database. Each table may have one or more entries. The links between boxes are links between the tables in the database.","The Definition Database  includes an Entity table , to which there may be linked tables for Entity Ancestry , View , and Question . In turn, the View table may be linked to multiple tables of View Items , which may be linked to one or more tables of View Item Dependency Lines and which in turn may be linked to one or more tables of View Item Dependency Values . There may be links between the table of Questions and the View Item table , as well as to the Question Relation table and the Answer Option table ","Thus, in , the Occurrence Database  has a Master Business Process (BP) Occurrence Table , to which may be linked multiple tables of Business Process Occurrences , which in turn may have multiple tables of Business Process Answers and Business Process Ancestry ","One or more Business Process Occurrence tables may be linked to the Entity table .

The names are used in certain instances to provide more meaning to the reader than the generic names, however, these tables are not specific to any business and can be employed to adapt the Adaptive Application to any desired business.","The Entity Table specifies details of each entity defined in the logical model. For example, PRODUCT, PRODUCT COVERAGE, POLICY, POLICY COVERAGE are defined therein for a business process of PRUDUCT in the insurance business.","The Entity Ancestry Table specifies the parent-child relationship between two entities in the conceptual model. For example, there is a parent-child relationship between POLICY & POLICY LOCATION in the insurance business.","The Question Table specifies each \u201cQuestion\u201d associated with an Entity.

This provides a way by which a display element can be presented only under certain conditions. Dependency Line along with Dependency Value enables specification of any complex expression. The Dependency Expression is a complex Boolean expression with the left side operand is a Question and the right side operand can be a literal or a Question. The comparison operator can be one of <, >, <=, >=, <>, =. The operations can be grouped by appropriate parentheses. For example a valid expression is ((Coverage=C1 or C2 or C3) AND (Vehicle Type=T1 or T2 or T3)).","This Dependency Value Table defines the set of values that need to be satisfied with Dependency Line Primary Q. Each instance specifies one value of the OR expression (in the example C1, C2 and C3). Each value may be a constant or another Question (specified here as the Secondary Question).","The Master Product (BP1) Occurrence Table contains one record for every instance of a Product (BP1).","The Product (BP1) Occurrence Table contains one record for each occurrence of each entity in the Product (BP1) hierarchy.","The Product (BP1) Ancestry Table identifies the parent-child relationships between Product (BP1) Occurrences.","The Product (BP1) Answer Table contains the values for the individual attributes of a Product (BP1) Occurrence.","The Long Product (BP1) Answer Table contains the Product (BP1) Answer value if the Product (BP1) Answer's size exceeds 20 characters.","The Contract (BP2) Question by Product (BP2) Occurrence Table specifies the overriding values for presentation characteristics of a Question based on Product (BP1) Occurrence.","The Product (BP1) Answer Option Table specifies the possible values for the Answer of a Question relative to a particular Product (BP1) Occurrence Question.
