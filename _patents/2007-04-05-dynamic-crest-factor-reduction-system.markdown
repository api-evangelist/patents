Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to electrical and electronic circuits and systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for reducing crest factor in electrical and electronic circuits and systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","In Multi-Carrier Power Amplifier (MCPA) communication transmission applications, multiple carriers are typically combined in the baseband, intermediate frequency (IF) or radio frequency (RF) frequency range and the resulting signal is transmitted using a single power amplifier. An aspect for MCPA transmission is to transmit a signal at a very high efficiency while maintaining a low Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) to meet spectral mask requirements. ACPR is defined as the ratio of power in a bandwidth away from the main signal (the distortion product) to the power in a bandwidth within the main signal. The bandwidths and locations are functions of the standards being employed.","To achieve high efficiency power amplifier (PA) transmission, it is desirable to use semi-non-linear PAs, such as Class A\/B PAs. A challenge for MCPA signal transmission is due to the fact that the combined signal has a high crest factor (ratio of peak power to average power), where the peak power is significantly higher than the average power. A small portion of the combined signal can have very high peaks and when transmitted at high PA efficiency, these high-level signals reach into the saturated region of the PA's transfer function and the output of the PA has high intermodulation distortion (IMD). The high IMD level raises the ACPR levels.","To maintain low ACPR without any linearization techniques, the transmit signal level must be decreased sufficiently so that the peak amplitudes are not in the saturated zone of the PA, but this reduces the amplifier efficiency. For example, a four carrier W-CDMA (wideband code division multiple access) signal can have a crest factor exceeding 13 dB. If the crest factor is reduced by about 6 dB, the average power can be increased by 6 dB thus increasing the power efficiency by a factor of 4.","One approach to this problem is to limit the amplitude of either the baseband signal or the RF signal output of each channel using a look-ahead approach. However, it is difficult to generate signals with low crest factor and low ACPR inasmuch as limiting the amplitude increases out of band emissions (e.g. sidelobes) and thereby raises the ACPR level. Similarly, efforts to reduce the ACPR levels generally increase crest factor.","Another approach involves the use of unused CDMA codes to reduce the crest factor in the output signals. However, this approach requires knowledge of what is being transmitted so that the unused codes can be identified. This adds to the complexity, storage requirements and cost of the system.","Hence, a need remains in the art for an improved system or method for reducing the crest factor in communications systems while maintaining a low ACPR therefor.","Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for reducing crest factor in electrical and electronic circuits and systems.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a crest reduction system for gain leveling includes: an estimator for estimating a root-mean-square (RMS) level of a first signal carrier and an RMS level of a second signal carrier, each of the first and second signal carriers having an amplitude; a leveling setter for receiving the estimated RMS levels of the first and second signal carriers, for producing a first gain leveling factor and a second gain leveling factor for the first signal carrier by using the estimated RMS level of the first signal carrier, and for producing a third gain leveling factor and a fourth gain leveling factor for the second signal carrier by using the estimated RMS level of the second signal carrier; a first leveler for receiving the first signal carrier and the first gain leveling factor and for changing the amplitude of the first signal carrier by adjusting the first signal carrier according to the first gain leveling factor; a second leveler for receiving the second signal carrier and the third gain leveling factor and for changing the amplitude of the second signal carrier by adjusting the second signal carrier according to the third gain leveling factor; and a filter configurator for receiving the second and fourth gain leveling factors, for producing one or more first filter coefficients to further change the amplitude of the first signal carrier according to the second gain leveling factor, and for producing one or more second filter coefficients to further change the amplitude of the second signal carrier according to the fourth gain leveling factor.

Each Carrier Processor  has a different center frequency, but can have the same or different filter types to shape similar or different signal modulations. For example, Carrier Processor  for Channel  can be for WCDMA having 3.84 MHz bandwidth; Carrier Processor  for Channel  can be for cdma2000 having 1.2288 MHz bandwidth; Carrier Processor  for Channel  can be bypassed to accommodate signals that are already shaped; and Carrier Processor  for Channel  can be for OFDM having 5 MHz bandwidth. Likewise, each channel processor can have identical bandshapes.","Each channel carrier processor converts the baseband symbol stream x[m] to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal y[m] center at the frequency fwith reference to . The carriers are then combined by the Carrier Combiner  to produce a composite signal s[m] that contains multi-carriers. This signal may then be used to control the composite Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) and thus the EVM of each carrier.","Carrier Leveling Mode is controlled by the Carrier Leveling Setter , Carrier Levelers  and the Leveled Carrier Combiner . Carrier Leveling Mode provides a mechanism for setting and maintaining possibly different signal to distortion ratios for each individual carrier. In the main path, the carriers y[m] are adjusted by gains 1\/gin the Carrier Levelers  to force the carrier amplitudes to the desired levels. The outputs of the N Carrier Levelers, gained carriers z, z, . . . , zare combined using the Leveled Carrier Combiner  to produce the signal u[m]. This signal is fed to the Dynamic Amplitude Clippers and CFR Filters  for peak amplitude suppression and to the Signal to Distortion Controller  to control the peak amplitude suppression to maintain the desired SDR and thus the carriers' EVM.","An aspect of the Carrier Leveling Setter  is to control the amplitude of each carrier channel signal to establish the desired channel distortion or EVM. The power of each carrier is estimated using the Carrier RMS Estimator . Based on the carrier powers, the Carrier Leveling Setter  determines gain gand 1\/gthat will be applied at the CFR Filter Configurator  and the Carrier Levelers . The Carrier Levelers can be bypassed when adjustments to control SDR for individual carriers are not required.","Occasionally, a first Dynamic Amplitude Clipper  or a second Dynamic Amplitude Clipper \u2032 or both contained in Dynamic Amplitude Clippers and CFR Filters  (see, for example, ) can be disabled momentarily to produce a high PAR signal if the digital predistortion processor (DPD) needs a high peak signal to characterize the PA. Upon instruction the amplitude clipper or clippers occasionally halt the clipping process for a very short period of time to produce a non-clipped signal. This high-PAR signal allows the DPD system to characterize the PA at high power for effective linearization. Because the duration of this high PAR signal is short, it does not degrade the power amplifier performance significantly.","In one embodiment, with reference to , the Dynamic Amplitude Clippers , \u2032 are processes that suppress the peak amplitude of the composite transmit signal, without phase distortion. The Dynamic Amplitude Clippers can operate in either Static Mode or Dynamic Mode. In Static Mode, clipping is performed at a fixed level, regardless of the RMS level of the signal being clipped. Thus, as the signal's RMS level increases, more of the signal is clipped, and as it decreases, less of the signal is clipped. In Static Mode, the peak to average ratio of the signal will fluctuate with the RMS level of the signal. In Dynamic Mode, the ratio of the clipping level to the signal's RMS level is held constant, which leads to a constant peak to average ratio of the output signal regardless of the RMS level of the clipped signal.","Whether in Static or Dynamic Mode, this amplitude clipping function may produce both in-band and out-of-band distortion. The in-band distortion should be maintained to a desired SDR level, and the out-of-band distortion should be suppressed to below the spectrum emission mask (SEM) requirements. The Signal to Distortion Controller  maintains the SDR level by setting the amplitude clipping level. The CFR Filter Configurator  together with the CFR filters , \u2032 suppress the out-of-band distortion.","The CFR filters can be programmable filters which perform filtering to remove the out-of-band noise. To support changing signal characteristics, the filter coefficients are generated using the CFR Filter Configurator .","In one embodiment, the CFR Filter Configurator  implements filter coefficient combiner processes that determine the filters based on the amplitude of the carriers, carrier frequencies, carrier bandwidths, filter shapes and which carriers are on or off.","The Signal to Distortion Controller  monitors the signal to distortion ratio by comparing the input signal with the output signal. The SDR is computed, and a correction factor is determined, and is used to adjust the clipping thresholds in the Dynamic Amplitude Clippers , \u2032. If the SDR is too low then the amplitude clippers' thresholds are increased to improve the SDR to the required level. For example, if the measured SDR is lower than a desired level then a correction factor larger than 1 is applied. This would increase the clipping threshold to improve the SDR to the correct level; otherwise, a factor smaller than 1 is applied, and this would reduce the clipping threshold. In this fashion, the SDR can be maintained at the desired level. The Signal to Distortion Controller  can also be programmed to adjust the factor if the SDR is below the desired level, and not adjust the clipping threshold if SDR is higher than the level. Thus, the SDR Controller can prevent a small SDR while allowing fluctuations of SDR provided they remain above the desired level.","In one embodiment, the Dynamic Amplitude Clippers and CFR Filters contains back-to-back clipper\/filter pairs. For example, with reference to , Clipper\/Filter Pair  (i.e., clipper  and filter ) performs the majority of the crest factor reduction and noise filtering. As the highly clipped signal from the first Dynamic Amplitude Clipper  passes through the first CFR Filter , the signal experiences some PAR regrowth. Clipper\/Filter Pair  (i.e., clipper \u2032 and filter \u2032) removes some of this regrowth. Accordingly, the second Dynamic Amplitude Clipper \u2032 may be programmed with a slightly higher clipping level than that used in the first Dynamic Amplitude Clipper . The out-of-band noise introduced by the second clipper is removed with the second CFR Filter \u2032 coefficients, which are designed to minimize PAR regrowth due to the second filter.","Optionally included at the interfaces of each block are rate changing interpolators or decimators with the purpose of maximizing implementation efficiency.","As the result, the Carrier Processor and Crest Factor Reducer produce the multi carrier signal and provide the following features:","(1) Produces a low PAR signal;","(2) Maintains low ACPR through filtering;","(3) Maintains a desirable SDR or EVM; and","(4) Maintains performance despite signal fluctuations, power transitions, varying statistics, and carrier blanking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 4(","FIG. 4(","FIG. 4(","FIG. 4(","FIG. 4("],"i":["a","b","c","d","e"],"b":["500","700","700","800","800"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIGS. 5(","FIG. 5(","FIG. 5(","FIG. 5(","FIG. 5(","FIG. 5("],"i":["a","b","c","d","e","a","b","c","d","e"],"b":["5","5","5","5"],"sub":"k"},"Transmit Modem Interface","The Transmit Modem Interface  provides the interface between the Communication Modem System with the Crest Factor Reduction Processor .

embodiment of a CFR filter structure is shown in . The real and imaginary parts of the input signal I[m]+jQ[m] are passed through tapped delay lines  and , respectively, of length M, selected to support the filter h[m]'s spectral requirements. Since the taps of c[m] are even symmetric and the taps of c[m] are odd symmetric, pre-summing of the data in the tapped delay line is possible. Thus, the samples at the taps are fed to two summers: the adding summer , corresponding to c[m], and the subtracting summer , corresponding to c[m]. The outputs of these summers are passed to two multipliers  and  that form the products of the pre-summed signal and the filter coefficients. Since the signal is processed in this fashion, the number of multiplications required is decreased by a factor of two. To reduce the amount of hardware required to realize this filter, the pre-summing adders and multipliers may be shared across many taps. Thus, as the inputs to the adders sweep across the taps, the M\/2 coefficients are changed and the multipliers' outputs are combined with summers  and . The Q[m] signal is processed with identical circuitry. The output from the I[m] filter side and the Q[m] filter side are combined with adders (Blocks  and ) to produce I[m] and Q[m].","If the desired signal is symmetric over the origin (e.g., 0 Hz), then the filter is real. In that case c[m]=0 and only the filtering corresponding to c[m] is required. In this situation, the complexity of the filter is cut in half.","Depending on the spectral shapes of the filters h[m], the composite filter, c[m], may have spectral regions of excessive attenuation where the edges of the passbands of adjacent filters meet. This attenuation may degrade signal quality and increase the peak to average ratio of the transmitted signal. To improve performance, the attenuation may be removed by inserting nibble filters. Nibble filters may be implemented with the same (or substantially the same) hardware used for the noise suppression filters. Their generation is described below and illustrated in . For a system with Ncarriers, there may be as many as N\u22121 nibble filters.","In one embodiment, nibble filter coefficients are determined by computing the difference of an ideal filter response, i.e., one without the offending attenuation, and the response of the composite filter, c[m], in the vicinity of the attenuation. Separate nibble filters should be created for each area of undesired attenuation. In this way, nibble filters may be added or removed as neighboring filters, h[m], are added or removed.","Including the nibble filters, g[m], the expressions for c[m] and c[m] become",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00015","num":"00015"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["c","c"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"h","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"h","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"h","msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b3","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b3","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b3","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["N","c"]},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"}],"mo":["+","+","\u2062","+","+","+","+","\u2062","+"],"mi":["\u2026","\u2026"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"19"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["c","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"h","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"h","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"h","msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03c9","msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b3","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b3","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"g","msub":{"mi":["N","c"]}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"m"}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b3","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["N","c"]},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":["m","T"]}}}}],"mo":"\u00b7"}],"mo":["+","+","\u2062","+","+","+","+","\u2062","+"],"mi":["\u2026","\u2026"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"20"}}]}]}}},"br":{},"sub":"i "},"CFR Filter Configurator","An aspect of the CFR Filter Configurator  is to compute the set [C] of Ncomplex passband coefficients and Ncomplex nibble coefficients that are best used for the CFR Filter , \u2032.

In one embodiment of the present invention, this includes the following tasks.","(1) Determine signal type of each carrier. This information is used to reconfigure the carrier processors for different types of signals that may be present (e.g., WCDMA, cdma2000, etc.). This information is also sent to the CFR Filter Configuration Processors  which determines CFR filter coefficients.","(2) Determine frequency of each carrier. This information is sent to the NCO  to frequency-shift each carrier and to the CFR Filter Configuration Processors  to set the CFR filter center frequencies.","(3) Activate and deactivate carrier processors. This information turns off carrier processors and this information is sent to the CFR Filter Configuration Processor to reconfigure the CFR filter coefficients.","(4) IPDL processing. During Idle Periods in the Downlink (IPDL) carriers are momentarily turned off by the Communications Modem System by either zeroing the signal for the affected carrier or by sending off\/on signals to the Transmit Modem Interface . By either detecting the absence of a carrier by the Carrier RMS estimators  or by using the off\/on signals, the Carrier Processor Controller triggers filter recomputations in the CFR Filter Configurator . During IPDL periods, the CFR Filter Configurator  will zero out the appropriate filters and nibbles using the MUXes .","Timing and Control","In one embodiment of the present invention, the Timing and Control Processor  coordinates timing-critical tasks within the Dynamic Crest Factor Reduction system. The Timing and Control Processor  rapidly detects control information from the Transmit Modem Interface  such as Frame sync and control words. This processor may also coordinate with the time structure of the signal and at the correct time interrupt the Dynamic Amplitude Clippers , \u2032 to pause the clipping process. Timing and Control may also coordinate the transmit carrier disable. Based on this information, Timing and Control sends interrupts to the CFR Filter Configurator  to reconfigure the CFR filter coefficients.","While the present invention has been described in connection with certain exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, together with the specification, illustrate exemplary embodiments of the present invention, and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIGS. 4(","i":["a","b","c","d","e"],"b":["4","4","4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 5(","i":["a","b","c","d","e"],"b":["5","5","5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 10","sub":"s"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 17"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
