For example, a sensor device that detects information related to a user's health such as a pulse meter, a pedometer, a thermometer or the like is mounted in a wrist watch which a user wears at all times, and a server device analyzes information detected by the sensor device and offers information providing services such as health check-up and better health advice.","Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique that transmits a blood glucose level measured using a small blood glucose measure to a server device or the like through a mobile phone. Specifically, a transfer device that converts blood glucose data measured using a small blood glucose measure into a format that can be transmitted from a mobile phone terminal to a server device or the like is used. The transfer device is used with a connector between the small blood glucose measure and the mobile phone.","Further, Patent Literature 2 discloses a configuration of a network in which a PHS terminal receives biometric data such as a brain wave detected in earphones by near field radio communication and transmits the received biometric data to a server connected to the network.","Further, Patent Literature 3 discloses a configuration of a network in which data detected by a health condition sensor that detects the health condition of a user is transmitted to a monitoring device through a mobile terminal device. The monitoring device receives position information of the mobile terminal device at the same time. Therefore, when the health condition of a user gets worse, a person who monitors the user using the monitoring device can contact an appropriate medical institution based on the position information of the mobile terminal device.","PTL1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-368907","PTL2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-310561","PTL3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-198759","However, the above-described Patent Literature 1 needs to connect the dedicated transfer device between a small blood glucose measure and a mobile phone and thus has a problem that a user feels inconvenience when transmitting blood glucose data. In Patent Literature 2, the device configuration is simplified compared to that of Patent Literature 1 because biometric data is transmitted to a PHS terminal by near field radio communication. However, in Patent Literature 2, biometric data is detected using earphones. Because the earphones are placed in the head and their use is limited to listening to music or the like, it is not possible to detect various sensor data. Accordingly, a server needs to make analysis using limited sensor data, and therefore useful information for a user cannot be obtained in some cases. Further, in Patent Literature 3, although the monitoring device receives the data detected by the health condition sensor and the position information of the mobile terminal device, the position information is used only to check the position of the mobile terminal device, and therefore useful information for a user cannot be notified in some cases as in Patent Literature 2.","To solve the above problems, an exemplary object of the invention is to provide a mobile communication device and a communication method that can generate information more useful for a user who provides sensor data and transmit the information to the user.","A mobile communication device according to a first exemplary aspect of the invention is a mobile communication device that relays communication between a sensor device located in a neighbor area and a server device connected to a public network, including a biometric information receiving unit for receiving biometric information of a user wearing the sensor device from the sensor device, a sensor unit built in the mobile communication device, for detecting a change of state in the mobile communication device, and a public network communication unit for transmitting the biometric information and information about the change of state in the mobile communication device to the server device via the public network, and receiving health management information generated in the server device using the biometric information and the information about the change of state in the mobile communication device, wherein the biometric information receiving unit transmits the health management information received by the public network communication unit to the sensor device so that the health management information is displayed on the sensor device.","A communication method according to a second exemplary aspect of the invention is a communication method in a mobile communication device that relays communication between a sensor device located in a neighbor area and a server device connected to a public network, the method including receiving biometric information of a user wearing the sensor device from the sensor device, detecting a change of state in the mobile communication device, built in the mobile communication device, transmitting the biometric information and information about the change of state in the mobile communication device to the server device via the public network, receiving health management information generated in the server device using the biometric information and the information about the change of state in the mobile communication device, and transmitting the health management information received by the public network communication unit to the sensor device so that the health management information is displayed on the sensor device.","A sensor device according to a third exemplary aspect of the invention is a sensor device located in a neighbor area of a mobile communication device, including a sensor unit for detecting biometric information of a user wearing the sensor device, a communication unit for transmitting the biometric information to the mobile communication device, and receiving health management information generated using the biometric information and information about a change of state in the mobile communication device, and a display unit for displaying the health management information.","A sensor network system according to a fourth exemplary aspect of the invention is a sensor network system including a sensor device located in a neighbor area, a server device connected to a public network, and a mobile communication device that relays communication between the sensor device and the public network, wherein the sensor device detects biometric information of a user wearing the sensor device, and transmits the biometric information to the mobile communication device, the mobile communication device detects a change of state in the mobile communication device, and transmits the biometric information and information about the change of state in the mobile communication device to the server device via the public network, and the server device generates health management information using the biometric information and the information about the change of state in the mobile communication device, and transmits the health management information to the sensor device through the mobile communication device so that the health management information is displayed on the sensor device.","According to the invention, it is possible to provide a mobile communication device and a communication method that can generate information more useful for a user who provides sensor data and transmit the information to the user.","(First Exemplary Embodiment)","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.

First, the sensor unit  of the wrist watch  detects a change of state by its sensor function (S). Next, the communication unit  transmits sensor data detected by the sensor unit  to the mobile phone terminal  by near field radio communication (S). The mobile phone terminal  receives the sensor data by the terminal server in the external access management unit  through the biometric information receiving unit  (S). Then, the sensor data integration management unit  integrates, or associates, the sensor data received from the wrist watch  and the sensor data detected in the sensor unit  with each other and stores the integrated data into the sensor information storage unit  (S). Further, the sensor data integration management unit  outputs the integrated data to the external access management unit . The external access management unit  transmits the integrated data to the server device  through the public network communication unit  (S). The sensor data management and analysis unit  of the server device  analyzes the received integrated data and generates health management information (S).","After that, the sensor data management and analysis unit  transmits the health management information to the mobile phone terminal  through the communication unit  (S). The health management information is information about a suitable amount of exercise, such as \u201cJog at the speed of about C km\/h to raise the pulse rate from A to B over a specified period\u201d, for example. Then, the external access management unit  of the mobile phone terminal  displays the received health management information on a display unit (not shown) (S). The external access management unit  then transmits the health management information to the wrist watch  as a target value to keep good health (S). The sensor management unit  of the wrist watch  displays the received health management information on the display unit  (S). A user wearing the wrist watch can thereby check the health management information.","As described above, by using the mobile phone terminal  according to the first exemplary embodiment of the invention, the wrist watch  and the server device  can access the URL set to the terminal server in the mobile phone terminal .

Further, the mobile phone terminal  can transmit the sensor data detected in the wrist watch  and the sensor data detected in the sensor built in the mobile phone terminal  to the server device . The server device  can thereby generate the health management information using those sensor data, and therefore it is possible to provide effective health management information compared to the case of using the sensor data detected in the wrist watch  only.","Further, compared to the case where the mobile phone terminal  operates with an application created specially for communicating with the wrist watch  and the server, transmitting and receiving data, and displaying and accumulating data and the like, the present invention that uses the terminal server has the following advantages. In the case where the terminal server receives data transmitted from the wrist watch  and communicates with the server device , processing such as transmitting the data received from the wrist watch  and the data detected by the sensor built in the mobile phone terminal  in synchronization with each other to the server device  and transmitting the health management information received from the server device  to the wrist watch  does not require explicit involvement by a user such as a user's operation on the mobile phone terminal . Thus, the processing is executed automatically on the background behind the operation of the mobile phone terminal  without any special user operation. Users are thereby free from an inconvenience of operation, and there is thus an advantage that users can easily manage their health on a daily basis.","Further, although the wrist watch  is used as an example of the sensor device  in the above description, a variety of equipment may be used as the sensor device  as long as it can execute Web API of the external access management unit  using an HTTP message.","For example, measured data of a user may be transmitted from home health instruments such as a blood-pressure meter, a body fat monitor and a body composition meter to the mobile phone terminal  and used for generation of the health management information.

The processing of Steps S to S is the same as the processing of Steps S to S in  and not redundantly described.","After that, the server device  receives a request for execution of a health analysis service from a personal computer or the like (S). The health analysis service is a service to receive advice for maintaining good health in a personal computer or the like.","Then, the server device  transmits a signal for requesting transmission of sensor data collected most recently to the terminal server in the mobile phone terminal  (S). The sensor data integration management unit  of the mobile phone terminal  transmits the integrated data to the server device  through the public network communication unit  (S). Steps S to S are the same as Steps S to S in  and not redundantly described.","As described above, by using the mobile phone terminal  according to the second exemplary embodiment of the invention, it is possible to respond to a request for transmitting sensor data which is made by the server device . This is because the mobile phone terminal  includes the terminal server and can thereby accept an access from the server device . Further, by creating Web contents in the terminal server of the mobile phone terminal  and making an access to the terminal server from a home personal computer or the like, it is possible to display and check the sensor data and the health management information.","The present invention is not restricted to the above-described exemplary embodiments, and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, the invention is not limited to these embodiments.
