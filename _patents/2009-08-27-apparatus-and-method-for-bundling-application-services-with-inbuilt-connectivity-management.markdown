{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61\/138,103 entitled \u201cSystem and Methods to Facilitate Connections to Access Networks\u201d filed Dec. 16, 2008, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","This disclosure relates generally to apparatus and methods for connectivity management. More particularly, the disclosure relates to bundling application services with inbuilt connectivity management.","Wireless connections are used to provide flexible, mobile, and easily deployed connectivity between various user devices and communications infrastructure. Various types of services may be provided to users such as voice, data, multimedia, Internet access, video, messaging, etc. Typically, when a user connects a user device to a wireless communication system, the device uses a priori credentials and subscription data for wireless access. This information is often associated with a connectivity agreement between the wireless user and a service provider, which limits the wireless access to a particular communication system. The pre-determined connectivity agreement has the disadvantage of service inflexibility and static provisioning.","Alternatively, a wireless user could temporarily connect to a communication system provider by completing various forms and authorizing payment information to gain access to the service provider. This has the disadvantage of forcing the user to be actively involved in establishing temporary connectivity agreements. In addition, the user must trust the network service with its confidential payment information, e.g. credit card data.","In another example, a wireless device may have dedicated access to a particular website where a service provider pays for the access. However, if the user desires to use the device in a location which does not have network access provided by the service provider, then the service provider must arrange for such access with other service providers, for example, in another country. Thus, each of the current connectivity arrangements has disadvantages for the user in the form of inflexibility, not being able to gain access or having to give up confidential information for access.","Disclosed is an apparatus and method for bundling application services with inbuilt connectivity management. According to one aspect, a method for bundling application services with inbuilt connectivity management comprising launching a software application; detecting a need for connectivity to use the service associated with the software application; establishing connectivity; determining whether connectivity is established; and executing the service associated with the software application utilizing the established connectivity.","According to one aspect, an access terminal for bundling application services with inbuilt connectivity management comprising a software application for detecting a need for connectivity to use the service associated with the software application; a processor for launching the software application; a communications component for establishing connectivity per directions from the software application and for determining whether connectivity is established; and wherein the processor executes the service associated with the software application utilizing the established connectivity.","According to one aspect, an apparatus for bundling application services with inbuilt connectivity management comprising means for launching a software application; means for detecting a need for connectivity to use the service associated with the software application; means for establishing connectivity; means for determining whether connectivity is established; and means for executing the service associated with the software application utilizing the established connectivity.","According to one aspect, a computer-readable medium storing a computer program, wherein execution of the computer program is for: launching a software application; detecting a need for connectivity to use the service associated with the software application; establishing connectivity; determining whether connectivity is established; and executing the service associated with the software application utilizing the established connectivity.","Advantages of the present disclosure include enabling handling of connectivity as a characteristic of a service or an application rather than as a characteristic of a device to provide access flexibility to a user. Additionally, connectivity can be sold in small chucks on a pay-as-needed basis, thus, enabling efficient modularization of a service business and a connectivity business.","It is understood that other aspects will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein it is shown and described various aspects by way of illustration. The drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various aspects of the present disclosure and is not intended to represent the only aspects in which the present disclosure may be practiced. Each aspect described in this disclosure is provided merely as an example or illustration of the present disclosure, and should not necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the present disclosure. Acronyms and other descriptive terminology may be used merely for convenience and clarity and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.","While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with one or more aspects, occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more aspects.","Current user applications are hosted on various user devices. In one example, user applications are implemented by a software program executed by a computing device with associated memory and input\/output interfaces as part of the user device. The user device may be, for example, a laptop computer, a palm computer, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), etc.","For example, the user application may require data exchange with a network which connects with other devices or systems. In one example, the network may be part of the Internet to enable global connectivity. The network connection may be arranged and paid for by the device user. However, in some cases, the users are unwilling to pay for network connectivity. In another example, users may not have the necessary skills or are unwilling to arrange and configure the network connectivity. The decoupling between the user application and network connectivity may make it difficult for service providers to provide user applications with ubiquitous connected convenience as the user applications may work only if the user device has network access. Current practice is that connectivity is always directly or indirectly associated with a device. Wireless communication systems have created service-specific devices, where the connectivity is tied to the device, creating unnecessary inflexibility for the user. Thus, there is a need to decouple connectivity from the device.","This present disclosure provides techniques which enable a new connected service experience. In the present disclosure, each enabled user application and\/or service provider (sometimes also referred to as an application service provider (ASP)) can arrange connectivity for their network service on their own. With this solution, the required connectivity for the network service is no longer a specific characteristic of the user device where the user application is hosted, but is a characteristic of the user application or network service itself. In one aspect, the user device must still contain the physical capability for connectivity, for example, with a wireless modem. The present disclosure includes the capability of the application and service provider to communicate, detect, and purchase connectivity needs. It enables handling of connectivity as a characteristic of a service or an application, rather than as a characteristic of a device itself.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems with various access techniques such as, but not limited to, code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), etc. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95, and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM).","An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems may additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, e.g., 802.xx wireless local area network (WLAN), Bluetooth and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.","One skilled in the art would recognized that the examples of access techniques and wireless communication systems mentioned herein are examples and that other access techniques and wireless communication systems may be used without affecting the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, various aspects or features will be presented in terms of the wireless communication systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various wireless communication systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.","In one aspect, applications which could be covered by the present disclosed connectivity management techniques include, but is not limited to, an Internet browser, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) client, navigation software, gaming application, social network website, communications application, etc. User devices include, but are not limited to, cellular phone, smart phone, laptop computer, personal computer (PC), netbook, smartbook, mobile Internet device (MID), personal digital assistant (PDA), navigation device, gaming device, tracking device, infotainment system, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","106","102","106","102","106","102"]},"The wireless communication system  may include a client negotiation component  to negotiate connectivity with a corresponding network negotiation component  for access terminal  to access network .

In one example, the software application executes the inbuilt connectivity management to take steps to establish the required connectivity. In one example, the step of establishing the required connectivity uses at least one parameter associated with the software application. In another example, the communication component  establishes connectivity per directions from the software application. In one aspect, the step in block  for establishing connectivity may be implemented several alternate ways. In one example, the inbuilt connectivity management comprises information necessary for connectivity establishment and ability for providing the information to an entity within the user device which executes the connectivity establishment signaling via the connectivity network, or comprises information to an entity within a user device to execute a connectivity establishment signal via a connectivity network.","In one example, information is provided through an application programming interface (API) between the software application and an entity within the user device responsible for establishing connectivity. In another aspect, the inbuilt connectivity management comprises information which identifies a connectivity agent that negotiates on behalf of the software application. The connectivity agent may be reachable via the connectivity network and may be identified by, for example, its fully qualified domain name (FQDN), service address, or Internet protocol (IP) address. In one aspect, the connectivity agent may be situated anywhere within the wireless communication system  (shown in ). In another aspect, the connectivity agent resides or is associated with the service provider  (shown in ).","In another aspect, the inbuilt connectivity management comprises information (a.k.a. specific information) to be passed to the connectivity agent. The information (a.k.a. specific information) may be application and\/or connectivity agent specific and may be protected between the application and the connectivity agent. In another aspect, the inbuilt connectivity management comprises information about the characteristics of the required connectivity. In one example, the characteristics may be connectivity negotiation instructions. In another aspect, the inbuilt connectivity management comprises information for negotiating the required connectivity with the connectivity network, information for paying the negotiated connectivity to the connectivity network, or information for requesting a payment agent to pay the negotiated connectivity to the connectivity network.","In another aspect, the inbuilt connectivity management comprises information regarding payment methods. For example, a payment method may be a token accepted by a connectivity network selling chunks of connectivity, identity of a payment agent, information to be delivered to the payment agent to pay the connectivity network on behalf of the software application, payment executed via a payment agent, a credit card number or a pre-established credit or debit amount, etc.","In one example, connectivity is purchased (or sold) in chunks (i.e., connectivity chucks) according to the needs of the user. In one example, the connectivity chunk is defined in terms of allowed data volume. In another example, the connectivity chunk is defined in terms of allowed connectivity time. In one example, the price of the connectivity chunk is based on characteristics (e.g., such as but not limited to, data rate, error rate, availability, etc.) of the connectivity chunk. Also, for example, a connectivity chunk available for purchase may be measured in Megabytes per minute (i.e., MB\/min). A buyer is free to purchase an amount of connectivity at a time and use it for establishing the current application service and\/or for use at a later time for establishing additional application services. In one example, the price of the connectivity chunks is based on characteristics of the associated connectivity. The associated connectivity may be defined, for example, in terms of the relative priority, quality of service (QoS) or other specific connectivity treatment. In one aspect, the connectivity chunk is associated with specific connectivity wherein the specific connectivity could be defined in terms of allowed connectivity peers.","Following block , in block , determine whether connectivity is established for the software application.

In one example, the price of the connectivity chunks is based on characteristics (e.g., data rate, error rate, availability, etc.) of the connectivity chunks. The connectivity service expires when the purchased connectivity chunks are consumed. However, the connectivity server may inform the connectivity agent about the expiration of the connectivity service, and the connectivity agent may extend the connectivity service by purchasing additional connectivity chunks. In one example, the connectivity agent may send to the connectivity server a query regarding the characteristics (e.g., pricing information) of the connectivity chunks that are available for purchase.","One skilled in the art would understand that the steps disclosed in the example flow diagram in  can be interchanged in their order without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.
