title: Collaborative alert management and monitoring
abstract: Methods, systems, and computer program products for dynamically monitoring, processing, and managing alerts are described herein. In an embodiment, the method operates by receiving messages that are either alerts or responses to existing alerts. The messages are parsed to determine if whether they are alerts or responses to alerts. Actions including updating alert states and storing alert data are executed, and then the method sends notifications regarding the alert messages and responses to a collaboration list of registered subscribers that dynamically expands over time based upon alert escalations. The method then determines whether additional messages have been received; and performs actions associated with these additional messages until there are no remaining alerts or alert responses to process. The method stores updated alert and response data in a repository so that the alerts and responses can be monitored and managed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is generally directed to managing alerts from initial notification through resolution within business intelligence systems, and more particularly directed to collaboratively managing alerts and responses to alerts in a collaboration model.","2. Background","Conventional alert management systems use publish and subscribe models, but lack an architecture that allows collaborative management and distribution of alerts. Traditional alert management products enable users to publish and track alerts, but lack functionality to enable alert stake holders to collaboratively manage alerts during their entire lifecycles. The conventional approach to alert handling is to spread alert management over several products and components as opposed to a unified alert management system.","Traditional alert management systems are distributed amongst often unrelated components that are unable to present unified historical alert information to users for analysis. These systems typically do not compare current alerts with historical patterns to detect problems or opportunities automatically. Most alert management applications to date have focused on alert tracking and reporting and are not integrated with a business activity monitoring system.","SYBASE\u2122 BIZTRACKER\u2122 is an example of a currently available business activity monitoring solution with an alert management component. Current alert management systems and components lack a system-wide conceptual perspective for collaboratively managing alerts. Further, current methods and systems have not implemented a cohesively managed alert management subsystem.","Accordingly, what is needed are systems, methods, and computer program products that allow collaborative alert management by allowing users to track alerts as alerts transition from state to state in an alert lifecycle. What is further needed are systems, methods, and computer program products that support alert state management and alert lifecycle tracking.","The present invention includes system, method, and computer program product embodiments for managing, aggregating, tracking, and correlating alerts. Methods and systems to manage, monitor, aggregate, and publish alerts are presented. The system, method, and computer program product embodiments disclosed herein perform alert management, publication, and monitoring. An embodiment of the present invention includes a Unified Alert Service (UAS). The UAS is a component that uses a publication and subscription model to manage the distribution of alerts. According to an embodiment of the invention, there are two main types of alerts supported by the UAS. These two main types are managed alerts, wherein UAS maintains at least state information pertaining to the alert; and unmanaged alerts, wherein UAS maintains a record of the alert but does not actively track the unmanaged alert's state.","Embodiments of the invention provide managed alert functionality such as a means of responding to an alert and alert escalation. Alert escalation is a means of notifying a new set of users of an alert via escalation channels. New alert messages or instances come in on one or more channels, which users can express interest in via subscriptions. Subscriptions represent an intersection between a user, a channel, and a target. A target represents a transport type (i.e., email) used to deliver notifications associated with alerts and responses. Responses to a managed alert trigger notifications. Notifications regarding responses are delivered to users who have expressed interest in the corresponding alert. In embodiments of the invention, a user indicates interest in an alert by subscribing to one or more channels. For example, a user may register interest in a set of alerts by establishing registered subscriptions to one or more channels.","The present invention provides systems, methods, architectures, and computer program products for dynamic, extensible, and collaborative alert management. Embodiments of the present invention provide additional functionality beyond currently available alert management systems, such as web-based graphical user interfaces that allow users and administrators to respond to alerts and an administrative console which allows administrators to configure alert escalation, whereby alert notifications are sent to new sets of users via escalation channels. According to an embodiment of the invention, a response to a managed alert triggers a notification which is delivered to registered subscribers, wherein registered subscribers are users who have expressed interest in the corresponding alert via a subscription to one or more channels. According to an embodiment of the invention, a graphical user interface allows configuration of channels, wherein channels are virtual names that alerts can be affiliated with.","An embodiment of the present invention builds on the Alert Management Component of the SYBASE\u2122 BIZTRACKER\u2122 product.","Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments thereof, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is noted that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described herein. Such embodiments are presented herein for illustrative purposes only. Additional embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings contained herein.","The features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and\/or structurally similar elements. Generally, the drawing in which an element first appears is indicated by the leftmost digit(s) in the corresponding reference number.","1.0 Overview of the Invention","The present invention is directed to systems, methods, and computer program products for managing, aggregating, and correlating alerts. In an embodiment, the invention operates by use of a Unified Alert Service (UAS). As used herein, an alert is a message sent to an UAS that includes alert information. Alert messages may be system alarm messages triggered by a system fault, a server reboot (scheduled or unscheduled), a server crash, a server shutdown (scheduled or unscheduled), a software program exception, a data file access violation, a database access violation, deletion of database records, a security breach (i.e., entry of a certain number of invalid passwords), and other events that users have expressed interest in.","In an embodiment, UAS makes use of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) architecture and utilizes message driven JavaBeans for messaging as well as other JavaBeans for managing alert state information. An embodiment of the present invention uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for formatting alert messages and as the format for alert data transmission. For example, UAS may use standard extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) as a means of transforming alert data where possible.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the UAS will also use Java logging facilities for debugging and logging information. For example, UAS may log various amounts of information ranging from method calls to informational messages by taking full advantage of the range of levels supported by the Java logging facility.","UAS relies on the security of a MyAlerts Console, Alert Server Configuration graphical user interface (GUI), application servers hosting the UAS, and other information technology (IT) infrastructure in order to handle security.","UAS is used to deliver and manage Alerts. It provides a powerful mechanism for alert delivery, alert management, and target instances support.","The basic concepts and components of the UAS include a target instance, channels, alert types, subscriptions, and messages, wherein messages are either alerts or responses to existing alerts. These concepts and components are described below. UAS supports message state management and alert event lifecycle tracking as an alert moves through an alert state. Supported alert states include one or more of Active, Complete, Unmanaged, and Suppressed. For example, when a managed alert is generated, it is in an Active state; and after the issue associated with the alert is resolved, the state might change to Completed. Some users, such as managers, may only wish to receive notifications when alerts reach the Complete state so that they can track metrics for completed alerts without receiving notifications of prior states in each alert's lifecycle. The UAS processes unmanaged Alerts by only sending the initial Alert notification to all relevant subscribers and providing no further Lifecycle processing of the Alert instance.","Additionally, managed alerts can have an external Status associated with them. The list of possible statuses can be defined for an Alert Type and are controlled by the Notification messages sent to the UAS by a user for an Alert instance. As an example, an administrator may define alert statuses for an alert type that include Escalate, Work In Progress, Still Failing, Top Priority, Escalate Now, and Complete. A Status has an associated Alert state (one or more of Active, Complete, and Escalate) that the Alert instance transitions to when the Status is selected by a user during the Alert Lifecycle Management process. In the case of the Escalate state, Alert escalation is triggered but the Alert remains in the Active state. A special Status called Reactivate is available for Completed Alert instances. The Reactivate status can always be selected by users to make the Alert instance Active again. Default statuses include Escalate Now and Complete, which cause associated default Alert state changes to occur when received in a Notification message for an Alert instance.","1.1 Unified Alert Service Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","125","122","120","120","110","105"]},"Alert Lifecycle Manager  processes subscriptions to determine Alert recipients for an alert. This is done by determining the intersection of subscription channels with the channel list in the alert information. The information in each subscription can include substitution variables which are resolved using the alert contents. In an embodiment, substitution variables are used to allow a single subscription to refer to a list of alert targets contained in the alert information itself, thus allowing a one-to-many recipient relationship defined by the alert sender instead of the one-to-one relationship of the usual Subscription instance. The processed list of recipients is referred to as a collaboration list. The collaboration list is passed to Alert State Manager  as the current recipients for this alert instance. The collaboration list can grow as subsequent alert escalations occur over time. Alert Lifecycle Manager  then requests that Alert State Manager  builds a DriverAlert for each alert recipient's target and passes the DriverAlerts onto multiple Target Type Managers . Each Target Type Manager  is responsible for a set of targets of a given type. Target types can include one or more of JavaMail or JMS. Target Type Manager  then delivers the alert notification to its final destination.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the UAS allows collaboration lists of Alert notification recipients to dynamically expand over time as Escalations occur, and provides \u2018communities\u2019 of participants for resolving an alert (i.e. resolving the fault associated with the Active Alert instance).","Responses are handled in a similar fashion. Response Message Handler  picks up response messages off response queue  and hands it off to Alert Lifecycle Manager , which requests that Alert State Manager  to update UAS database  and Alert Lifecycle Manager  updates its internal state. The Alert Lifecycle Manager  depends on the Alert State Manager  for the state of each Alert. Thus, the Alert Lifecycle Manager  state is transient. Alert Lifecycle Manager  then delivers an alert notification with updated state information to the registered subscribers for the alert via Target Type Managers .","According to an embodiment, Alert Lifecycle Manager  requests all alert notifications from Alert State Manager , which uses the current collaboration list for that Alert instance. In this way, Alert State Manager  controls notices delivered to the dynamically expanding and managed list of collaborators. In an embodiment, collaboration list comprises a group of registered subscribers responsible for resolving an alert. In another embodiment, the collaboration list comprises a group of registered subscribers interested in an alert.","Alert State Manager  maintains the list of targets for notification delivery which is processed by the Alert Lifecycle Manager  and passed to the appropriate Target Type Manager .","A registered subscriber can be any client subscriber and is not synonymous with an end-user or human user. A user subscribes to a channel and a target, but users can have as many subscriptions to channel and target combinations as needed. It is possible for a user to receive multiple notifications for a single alert or alert escalation based upon multiple, overlapping subscriptions. A subscription is the intersection of a user, a channel, and a target. Although a subscription may reference only a single target, a target can also be a substitution variable that references a list of targets and associated parameters in the original Alert message. The user and channel cannot be a substitution variable.","A new alert instance will come in on one or more channels. In an embodiment, Alert Lifecycle Manager  processes alerts based upon newly triggered alerts coming in on one or more channels by determining which users, if any, are subscribed to these channels. Target Type Managers  then determine which targets to send notifications to based upon the targets in the subscriptions. Alert State Manager  maintains a list of targets for notification delivery which is processed by Alert Lifecycle Manager  and passed to the appropriate Target Type Manager .","When alerts are escalated, subscriptions for the escalated channels are determined by Alert Lifecycle Manager  for the escalated alerts, and the UAS Engine requests that Alert State Manager  add the new recipients to the list of Collaborators for the Alert instance. The Alert Lifecycle Manager then causes a notification to be sent to all recipients in the newly expanded list of Collaborators.","Other configurations of the alert processing components depicted in  will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).","In one embodiment, Alert Message Handler  is a message driven JavaBean that is responsible for accepting alert messages from JMS queue  and then making the appropriate calls via a client application programming interface (API) to Alert Lifecycle Manager  so that the alert can be persisted, by Alert State Manager  and its state can be managed if it is a managed alert. In an embodiment, Alert Lifecycle Manager  is configured to perform tasks related to subscription processing and alert distribution to targets. Alert storm suppression and alert escalation are also performed by Alert Lifecycle Manager . Alert suppression and escalation is discussed in greater detail in section 3.2 below.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, response message handler  is a message driven JavaBean configured to accept response messages from JMS response queue  and make the appropriate calls via a client API to Alert Lifecycle Manager  so that in order to persist the response, via Alert State Manager , and update the state of the alert. According to an embodiment, each response is associated with an existing, active alert by an alert ID, wherein the alert ID uniquely identifies the alert instance.","Response Message Handler  is significantly similar to Alert Message Handler  in function with the exception of the calls that will be made against Alert Lifecycle Manager . In an embodiment, Response Message Handler  can reuse message reception code available in Alert Message Handler  and Response Message Handler  merely implements its own class for interacting with Alert Lifecycle Manager .","According to an embodiment of the invention, Target Type Managers  are message driven JavaBeans that listen on a topic for alert and response messages intended for a certain target type. When an alert or response message intended for a target type is detected, a Target Type Manager  then delivers the corresponding notification using the method corresponding to the target type for the message being processed. Target Type Manager  serves a similar purpose as drivers in UAS architecture . Each Target Type Manager  is also responsible for delivering alert notifications to a certain target type such as JavaMail. Each target type supports a set of parameters that are defined in UAS database  and this information is used to drive configuration of target instances as well as subscriptions for a target instance.","One of the primary differences between current alert management systems and the embodiment of the present invention depicted in  is that target type managers  can handle several target instances of the same target type. A driver may represent a single target, but this does not require a user to package and deploy a new application on the application server to handle a new target. The UAS can handle multiple alert targets for each alert type. The improvement provided by embodiments of the present invention is that UAS architecture  places no limit on the number of target instances that can be handled by a Target Type Manager . An advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that the number of target instances does not degrade system performance and has little bearing on system configuration. Another advantage of embodiments of the invention is that the majority of the code in existing drivers is shared among most drivers so that changes will be made to most drivers in one place in order to convert them to the new Target Type Manager  model.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, substitution variables provide the ability for a subscription to be variable. This may be accomplished by using variables in the variables section of the Alert XML code to produce virtual subscriptions at delivery time. In one embodiment, variables used for this purpose are AMS_EMAIL_ADDRESS and AMS_USER_ID. These variables are grouped together using the group attribute of the variable.","2.0 Components of the Unified Alert Service","According to an embodiment of the invention, a Unified Alert Service (UAS) provides a mechanism to allow users to collaboratively manage outstanding alerts. For example, a mechanism described herein is a UAS comprised of components responsible for managing alerts generated and sent by other components. Besides a human user who needs to manage alerts, a software application or agent sometimes needs to manage alerts. Accordingly, unless specifically stated, the \u201cuser\u201d as used herein does not necessarily pertain to a human being. In one embodiment of the present invention, each alert can have a current status of either active, not managed, completed, or escalated. UAS allows users to manage and monitor alerts during the life cycle of alerts, from initial notification of an alert condition to alert resolution (i.e., completed state).","In an embodiment, a collaboration network is dynamically created by users self-subscribing to channels that have associated alerts which are issued by software components. The UAS is composed of a runtime engine and several administration and user tooling user interfaces (UIs). Software components introduce alerts into the UAS engine by sending it the Alert message containing the Alert ID, an initial list of channels over which the alert will flow, and optional enriched content. The basic components supporting the UAS collaboration model are described in the following paragraphs.","The UAS provides receive-response messaging, wherein the UAS can receive an alert message, and subsequently respond to form a closed message loop.","2.1 Alert Suppression",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["332","748","332","748","748","748"]},"2.2 UAS Runtime Behavior",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","200"]},"In step , client application  sends a JMS message  to the UAS inbound queue . Alert Lifecycle Manager  then picks up JMS message  from UAS inbound queue  and forwards JMS message  to Alert State Manager . In step  Alert State Manager  fetches the inbound Java Message Service (JMS) message , parses the message, saves the message details  in UAS repository , and forwards the message to Target Type Manager . The alert life cycle is subsequently managed by Alert Lifecycle Manager .","In step , Target Type Manager  checks the subscriptions to alert , and then delivers the alert by sending notifications  to each user that subscribes to channels that alert  arrives on. Users express interest in channels via one or more registered subscriptions. Each subscription includes a transport type . As depicted in , transport types  can be one or more of JavaMail, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email, facsimile, JMS, Java Management Extensions (JMX), instant messages, text message, alphanumeric pages, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, script, null target instances, and other electronic communications means to receive and send alert messages.","In step , UAS Runtime Management Console  captures data  forwarded by Alert State Manager  so that a user can view, manage, and respond to the alert. As depicted in , UAS Runtime Management Console  is comprised of a UAS Administration interface  and a UAS console . UAS Administration interface  is described in detail in section 2.4 below.","2.3 Administration Interface","UAS also provides web console administration which allows users to view and manage alerts anywhere via a web-based user interface (UI).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["224","224","224","226","228","228","226"]},"In an embodiment, UAS administration console  includes several web-based graphical user interfaces: roles configuration , target instance configuration , channel configuration , runtime properties configuration and maintenance configuration . UAS console  includes user interfaces for subscription configuration  and message lifecycle management . These interfaces are described in the paragraphs below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["330","330","226","330","330","441","441"]},"According to an embodiment, roles configuration interface  depicted in  allows users to manage either of these roles by editing the configuration assigned to each role.","UAS enables alert escalation. For example, users can manually escalate alerts by setting certain response types using channel configuration interface . Alerts can also be automatically escalated when a pre-defined duration of time elapses (i.e., an escalation \u2018timeout\u2019). Escalation timeout periods can also be nested whereby alerts are configured to go through multiple escalations after expiration of multiple, successive timeouts.","In an embodiment, the time duration for alert escalation is a tunable parameter that can be adjusted by administrators and users via the web console. UAS allows users and administrators to restrict delivery of alerts by use of notification filters. For example, alert delivery can be restricted to a specific alert state, or those that meet the criteria of a user-defined XML Path Language (XPath) filter. The criteria may be set via the web-based UI by administrators and users.","2.4 Subscriptions","A subscription identifies a single user, channel, and notification target.","Notification targets can include one of an email address, a short messaging system (SMS) destination, queued XML, a Web Service invocation, and others designated destinations for alert notifications. According to an embodiment of the present invention, users can subscribe to as many subscriptions as needed. In an embodiment, a subscription is an entry identifying the desire for a user to receive Alert Notifications on a specified target sent to a specified channel. A subscriber is not necessarily a person as a subscriber can be any client. Subscriptions represent the intersection or nexus between a user ID, a channel, and a transport technology. Channels are described in detail below. The UAS can be thought of as a collection of atomic subscriptions, wherein users can have multiple subscriptions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["338","502","504"]},"A user can also create a notification filter using subscription configuration interface . By setting an appropriate filter level using Filter field , users then receive only messages that conform to the filter level. For example, a user can configure a custom filter by defining an XPath expression. In an embodiment, when a user has successfully set up a subscription using subscription configuration interface , a test message is sent to the subscription target instance entered into target instance .","2.5 Targets","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a target is the destination for an Alert Notification and source for an Alert Response. A target is associated with a specific target type, wherein a target type is a definition template for a particular target technology. In an embodiment, multiple targets can be derived from a specific target type.","2.5.1 Target Instance","Target instances are concrete alert destinations. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a target instance is the type of transport technology used to send and receive alert notifications. For example, UAS users can choose one or more of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email, facsimile, Java Message Service (JMS), Java Management Extensions (JMX), instant messages, text message, alphanumeric pages, Short Message Service (SMS), script, null target instances, and other electronic communications means to receive and send alert messages.","In an embodiment of the invention, alerts are delivered based on a publication and dynamic subscription model. For example, an alert may be published to a channel, and a user can express an interest in the alert by subscribing to that channel. The alert is subsequently delivered over various transport technologies, wherein the transport technologies include one or more of email, JMS, SMS, and JMX. UAS provides for target transformation. For example, UAS implements an XSLT transformation for alerts with email or JMS targets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["325","325","226","325","228","642","441"]},"JMS, JMX and Java Mail target instances support XSLT transformation, which allows the original alert message to be displayed in different formats. For JMS and JMX targets, users can set the Destination field  to be an XML Path Language (XPath) expression to support a variable target. If a user requires XSLT transforms, a Templates button (not depicted in ) can be pressed in order to import an appropriate transform template: either the existing XSLT template or a new XSLT expression to be input by the user. UAS users can select a target instance using target instance configuration interface , and depending on the target instance, UAS is able to transform alert messages. Alert content is formatted by UAS based on the display abilities of the selected target instance. For example, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) content can be provided for email target instances and Extensible Markup Language (XML) for JMS target instances. If a target instance is unavailable for some reason (i.e., due to an email server being down), UAS provides a mechanism to guarantee the delivery of the notification to the end user.","2.6 Alert Type Definition","According to an embodiment of the invention, an alert type definition identifies the notification text for an alert instance and an unlimited list of statuses an alert instance can be in or have. In accordance with an embodiment, alert instances are associated with an Alert Type in the Alert XML message. If the Alert Type is not identified in the Alert XML message, then the alert instance is unmanaged. A typical alert may have a list of response types\/statuses including Active, Complete, and Escalate. The Response type list can be added to or changed, but must include at least one response type with a state transition to Complete. In an embodiment, a definition template is used to define special processing for alerts identified as a certain type. Alert types classify alert messages so that UAS can manage the lifecycle of alert messages based on a specific alert type.","Alert types are used to determine how Alert Lifecycle Manager  will process alerts associated with that Alert type. In this way, Alert types assist with processing groups of alert messages for each specific Alert type. According to an embodiment, alert types have different response types. These response types drive alert messages from one state to another in a lifecycle. For example, response types may include one or more of Active, Complete, and Escalate. In an embodiment, alerts have full lifecycles that include the following states: Active; Complete; Cancel, Unmanaged, Obsolete, and Suppressed. Response types can drive alerts into Active or Complete states. Other alert states such as Cancel, Unmanaged, Obsolete, and Suppressed are internal to Alert Lifecycle Manager . For example, when a managed alert is initially generated, it is in an Active state, and after the issue associated with the alert is resolved, the alert state will be set to Complete.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["332","332","120","746"]},"For security purposes, administrators can restrict what Alert instances a user receives. Alert instances are associated with certain alert types. Administrators can assign a user role to an alert type. In an embodiment, a role can be entered into user role field  to assign a particular user role to an alert type. When Alert Lifecycle Manager  processes Alert instances associated with that alert type, only users that are members of the roles defined for the alert type are added to the list of Collaborators.","As discussed in section 2.2 above, to prevent an \u2018alert storm,\u2019 administrators can specify a suppression period to ignore duplicate alerts. The suppression period entered in the suppress period field  defines the time duration to ignore duplicate messages. According to an embodiment of the invention, there are four types of time suppression period time units that can be entered into suppress period : day, hour, minute and second.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the Add Typical Response button  can be used to add three default response types. Additionally, to add a custom response, an administrator can click the Add Response button  and choose the type of response required. Then an administrator can use alert type configuration interface  to edit the detail information of the response type. State  represents the message state after a user responds to an alert message at run-time with a given response type.","2.7 Channels","A channel represents a virtual destination to which user can subscribe to receive alerts. An alert action sends an alert message to a specified UAS channel. According to an embodiment, an Alert message contains a list of associated UAS Channels. Channels are virtual and therefore not associated with or limited to a specific transport technology such as email or JMX. Subscriptions, as described above, drive the transport technology used to deliver alert messages, not channels.","UAS uses a channel to pull end users out of specific transport technology and thereby make alert message destinations more meaningful. UAS uses channels to associate Alert messages with Subscriptions. This enables an alert message to be abstracted from the specific transport technology used to deliver the message.","According to an embodiment, a channel definition identifies the list of other channels an alert will escalate to after being in an unresolved state for a given period of time. Since an escalation channel is just another channel and can therefore have a list of escalation channels itself, a multi-level escalation tree can be created.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","800","800","441"]},"In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a administrator can use interface  to define additional channels that Active Alerts flowing on this channel will escalate to after an escalation period has expired without the Alert state becoming Complete. For example, if a user has subscribed to multiple channels with different targets, after expiration of an escalation period entered in Escalation Period field , an alert that had initially been sent to one target such as a user's work email address, the escalated alert will be sent to another target, such as a user's home email address. As would be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s), other channels could contain completely different users, such as the next level of management in the user's organization. Another example is an escalation channel used to notify a higher management level when alerts associated with key systems remain unresolved (i.e. Active). An escalation period entered into Escalation Period field  represents the duration that automated escalation are processed. There are at least four types of escalation period time units: days, hours, minutes, and seconds. According to an embodiment, if an administrator does not use interface  to choose at least one escalation channel, an error will appears and prompt the administrator to save a configuration with an escalation channel entered into Escalation Channels field . This is true only if there is an Escalate response type defined. Otherwise, escalation channels are optional.","2.8 Unified Alert Service Engine","The main component driving the collaboration model is the Unified Alert Service (UAS) engine. Conceptually, the UAS engine can be thought of as a combination of Alert Lifecycle Manager  and Alert State Manager . The UAS engine manages all active alerts sent to it from software components by performing the following functions.","The UAS engine maintains the current collaboration network for each alert instance (i.e. the current list of targets from initial and escalated channels).","The UAS engine receives and processes alert status updates from targets. Alert status updates can include one or more of \u201cchange to status \u2018X\u2019\u201d, \u201cescalate immediately,\u201d \u201cattach included information,\u201d and others status updates.","The UAS engine sends notices to targets as alert statuses and escalation levels change. Theses notices include: the alert id, text, status description, attached information, available responses, and escalation level.","The UAS engine escalates alerts which have exceeded the timeout threshold defined for associated channels. This has the result of expanding the current collaboration members for an alert instance. In an embodiment, alert escalation is the process of re-issuing Alert Notifications to one or more escalation channels, wherein an escalation channel is the channel used when an Alert is escalated. During alert escalation, subscriptions are identified for intersections with the escalation channels and any new collaboration members which have been added to the collaboration member list. The escalation notice is then sent to the entire list.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","336","900","336"]},"2.9 UAS Maintenance",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 2"],"b":["1000","1060","1060","1060","205","1066","1066"]},"Administrators can also use Import and Export Configuration buttons  to import an existing UAS configuration and export a current UAS configuration, respectively. For example, according to one embodiment, Import and Export Configuration buttons  can be used to export an existing UAS configuration to an XML file or import a UAS configuration from an XML file.","In an embodiment, Runtime properties configuration and Maintenance configuration interface  allows administrators to choose from at least five Alert States : active, cancel, complete, obsolete, and suppressed.","3.0 Structural and Operational Embodiments","This section describes a method and system for alert management and distribution according to embodiments of the invention as illustrated in .","3.1 Alert Management Method","This section describes a method and system for alert management and distribution according to embodiments of the invention as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},"More particularly, flowchart  illustrates the steps by which an alert management system receives keys and other fields, applies rules to the data, and performs actions. Flowchart  is described with reference to the embodiments of . However, flowchart  is not limited to those example embodiments. Note that the steps in the flowchart do not necessarily have to occur in the order shown.","The method begins at step  wherein a client application sends message into the UAS inbound alert\/response queue. Depending on the type of message, the message will either be placed into the inbound alert queue  (i.e., if the message is an alert) or response queue  (i.e., if the message is a response to an active alert instance). In an embodiment, responses are associated with existing alert instances by a unique alert ID.","In step , a message handler fetches and parses the message queued in step . If the message is an alert, the message is fetched and parsed by alert message handler . Similarly, if the message is a response to an active alert, the message is fetched and parsed by response message handler .","In step , an evaluation is made regarding whether the message is an alert based on the parsing in step . If it is determined that the message is not an alert (i.e., the message is a response), control is passed to step . If it is determined in step  that the message is an alert, control is passed to step .","In step , the alert state is updated in the UAS repository  based upon the contents of the response and the updated alert state is saved with alert data in the UAS repository in step . In an embodiment, the alert state may be updated in UAS database . After the alert state is updated in the UAS repository, control is passed to step .","In step , an evaluation is made regarding whether there are collaboration list entries for the response message. In this step, when a response comes in on one or more channels, it is determined which, if any, collaboration list entries exist for the response. If it is determined that no there are no collaboration list entries corresponding to the response message, then control is passed to step . If it determined there are collaboration list entries that correspond to the response message, then control is passed to step .","In step  alert data fetched and parsed in step  is saved in UAS repository  and control is passed to step . In an embodiment, the alert data may be saved in UAS database .","In step , an evaluation is made regarding whether there are subscriptions to the alert message, based on the registered subscribers for alert messages. In this step, when a new alert instance or response comes in on one or more channels, it is determined which, if any, users are subscribed to these channels. If it is determined that no there are no subscriptions corresponding to the alert message, then control is passed to step . If it determined there are subscriptions that correspond to the alert message, then control is passed to step .","In step , the transport type is determined for notifications based upon the target types in the subscriptions identified in step . In an embodiment, step  is performed by Target Type Manager  to determine the appropriate target transport technology (i.e., one or more of JMS, JMX, JavaMail, Script, Null, SMS, SMTP email, Instant Message, alphanumeric page, and text message) before control is passed to .","In step , a notification of the alert or response is sent to each subscriber identified in step  via the corresponding transport types identified in step , and control is passed to step .","In step , data needed to view, manage, and respond to the alert is captured and control is passed to step . In an embodiment, data is captured for later viewing and manipulation via UAS console  and UAS administration interface  within UAS Runtime Management Console .","In step , an evaluation is made regarding whether there are more messages queued in the inbound alert\/response queues. If it is determined that more messages are queued, then control returns to step . Accordingly, the process described above involving steps - is repeated until there are no more messages on the inbound alert\/response queue. The reiterations of steps - stop when it is determined in step  that there are no additional alerts remaining in the inbound queue  and response queue  to be processed. When it is determined that no additional alerts are in inbound queue  and no more responses are in response queue , control is passed to step  where the UAS engine waits for the next alert or response.","The lifecycle of an alert does not end with step . For example, a user may still be working on an alert after step  and may complete it and send a corresponding response at a subsequent time. In step , if there are no more messages to process, the UAS engine will wait on the inbound queue  and response queue  until an alert or response arrives.  illustrates how the UAS process, but does not depict the full lifecycle of an alert.","3.2 Target Types","Target types are described in this section with reference to the embodiment of .

However, the Alert State Manager is not limited to that example embodiment. In an embodiment of the present invention, Alert State Manager  is a stateful session JavaBean that is responsible for maintaining in memory state of individual alerts as well as persisting alerts and responses to the UAS database. Alert State Manager  is also responsible for maintaining timers for the escalation of alerts as well as for alert suppression to prevent alert storms. Additionally, Alert State Manager  is responsible for sending alert notifications, which have either originated from Alert Message Handler  or that have been triggered as a result of a response or escalation, to the topic used by Target Type Managers .","In generating the alert notification, Alert State Manager  must fill in subscription information for each target instance and set the AMS_TARGET_TYPE and AMS_TARGET_NAME message properties so that the proper Target Type Manager will receive the message and so that the proper target instance metadata will be used to deliver the notification.","In an embodiment, Alert State Manager  includes an initialization means when the UAS server starts so that the state of active alerts can be retrieved from the UAS database. For example, with reference to the embodiment illustrated in , Alert State Manager  may include an initialization module configured to fetch alert states for any active alerts from UAS database . This may involve use of a Java servlet.","3.4 Alert Lifecycle","The Alert Lifecycle is described in this section with reference to the embodiment of . However, the Alert Lifecycle is not limited to that example embodiment. The alert lifecycle refers to the process that a managed alert goes through before reaching completion. The lifecycle for an alert has several important aspects or features.","The first aspect deals with alert suppression, which is a means of preventing alert storms. Alert suppression occurs when an alert message is received in which the Suppression Key in the alert message is the same as an existing alert and the alert type has a value greater than 0 for the suppression period and the timer that is measuring this period has not expired. Suppressed alerts are recorded in the UAS database  unless the system is configured not to store suppressed alerts. In an embodiment, suppressed alerts that are recorded in UAS database  are viewable in a web client interface.","The second aspect deals with alert escalation, which is a means of notifying a second group of users when an alert has not been completed during a specified time period. Alert escalation occurs when a channel for a given alert has a configured escalation channel and timeout period and the alert has not been completed prior to the expiration of the timeout period.
