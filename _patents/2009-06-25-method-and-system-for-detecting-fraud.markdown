title: Method and system for detecting fraud
abstract: A system and method for detecting fraud when facilitating a payment transaction over a global wide area network. The method comprises receiving a sale information, receiving a payment information from a buyer, and analyzing a transaction information for fraud. If the analyzing indicates fraud, an enhanced transaction information is communicated to a human for fraud analysis. In one embodiment, the method comprises performing rule-based analyses to determine whether the transaction appears to be fraudulent. Rule-based analyses may include suspect data rules and velocity rules. Velocity rules generally determine whether there has been excessive activity that may lead to a conclusion that the transaction may be fraudulent. Suspect data rules are used to determine whether the billing, shipping, selling addresses, telephone numbers, and account numbers, and other data are in a syntactically correct format and whether they exist. In one embodiment, the method further comprises performing simple screening of the transaction information. In one embodiment, the method further comprises seeking approval from a third party such as a financial institution based on the payment information. The method may be implemented as part of a system that includes personal computers, server computers, and other personal computing devices, some of which may communicate over the Internet, and others which may communicate via dedicated communication lines.

No. 09\/615,638, filed Jul. 13, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,610,216, entitled \u201cA METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTING FRAUD\u201d, the application of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates to detecting fraud in a networked system that facilitates a payment transaction between two parties. More specifically, the invention relates to a system and method for detecting fraud in which an Internet web site serves as a payment facilitator when a first party wishes to pay a second party for goods, services, etc.","Traditionally, classified advertisements and other newspaper, specialty paper, and magazine advertisements and listings provide a way for a seller of goods or services to advertise in an attempt to obtain a buyer for the goods or services. However, when a transaction is agreed upon, the buyer and seller enter an awkward time, particularly when the transaction takes place across a great geographical distance. The persons and smaller businesses taking advantage of classified advertisements and similar listings do not typically accept payment by credit card or bank debit card. Checks and money orders are generally used. The buyer may send a check or money order by letter to the seller, and the seller may either simultaneously with the sending of the funds or upon receipt of the funds, send the goods to the buyer. The buyer and seller must trust one another. Each runs the risk of encountering a swindle and being the victim of fraud. The same applies when services are purchased over a great distance. In addition, there is a delay in the buyer receiving the goods or services when the seller waits for a check to be mailed and then clear before shipping the item or activating the service.","On-line sale facilitating systems have given new life to person to person long distance sale of goods and services. Rather than selling via local magazines, specialty papers, and newspaper classifieds and listings, persons are using on-line sale facilitating systems to sell locally, nationally and internationally via the Internet.","The Internet and personal computers have become ubiquitous in modern society. Although the Internet has existed in various forms for many years, the Internet became popular as a mass communication vehicle with the introduction of the world wide web. The world wide web is, from the user's perspective, a way of easily identifying a remote computer, connecting to the remote computer, and viewing information stored on the remote computer. Remote computers that provide a vehicle for the sale of goods and services have become very popular. These systems are referred to herein as sale facilitating systems. EBAY\u00ae is an example of a sale facilitating system. However, even with this new technology, buyers and sellers must still trust one another as each still runs the risk of encountering a swindle and being the victim of fraud while funds and goods are exchanged by mail.","While using the Internet, hidden from the user are the various communications protocols that make the Internet function. Various committees and ad hoc groups known as working groups coordinate and control the Internet. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the protocol engineering and development arm of the Internet. Working groups under the IETF determine the rules and protocols for the underlying functionality of the Internet and publish them as requests for comment, commonly referred to as RFCs. Each working group makes its RFCs available via the Internet at various web sites. Information is communicated over the Internet via the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). Many personal computers utilize the point to point protocol (PPP) to communicate with an internet service provider to obtain a link to the Internet. More information is available from T. Socolofsky and C. Kale, , RFC 1180, January 1991, http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc1180.txt; R. Fielding et al., 1.1, RFC 2616, June 1999 (Draft Standard), http.\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc2616.txt; and W. Simpson, Editor, --, RFC 1661, http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc1661.txt.","To make on-line and off-line purchases easier, payment facilitators that allow buyers to purchase from sellers via credit cards and debit cards eliminate the uneasiness of long distance purchases originating from traditional classified advertisements, on-line classified advertisement, on-line sale facilitating systems such as EBAY\u00ae, and others. To make their service safe and secure, payment facilitators should check for potential fraudulent transactions when processing payment transactions.","A system and method for detecting fraud when facilitating a payment transaction over a global wide area network. The method comprises receiving a sale information, receiving a payment information from a buyer, and analyzing a transaction information for fraud. If the analyzing indicates fraud, an enhanced transaction information is communicated to a human for fraud analysis.

In one embodiment, the communications between the seller computer and the payment facilitator computer are made secure by use of encryption and security techniques such as secure HTTP, secured sockets layer (SSL) encryption, and\/or the transport layer security (TLS) protocol. More information on SSL is available from Netscape Communications of Mountain View, Calif. and additional information concerning TLS is available in E. Rescorla, , RFC 2818, http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc2818.txt, May 2000.","In one embodiment, the negotiations and agreement to sell may have occurred on a computer system via a sale facilitating system such as EBAY\u00ae. In this embodiment, the sale information may be provided via a direct communications link to the sale facilitating system. In another embodiment, the sale negotiations and agreement between the buyer and seller may have occurred by mailed correspondence or by telephone, and may have been initiated by viewing an offering of goods or services for sale by a classified advertisement on-line, classified advertisement or listing in a newspaper, specialty paper, or magazine, or by any other method that connects buyers with sellers. In this embodiment, the buyer and seller agree to use the payment facilitator system, and the seller then begins the payment transaction process by connecting to the payment facilitator web site.","After receiving the sale information, the payment facilitator system prepares an invoice and emails the invoice to the buyer, as shown in blocks  and . In one embodiment, the invoice includes at least a description of the goods or services the buyer agreed to purchase and the sale price, and may include further information such as the seller's contact information, namely the seller's email address, mailing address, telephone number, etc. In another embodiment, the payment facilitator may prepare an invoice, and email a notification to the buyer that an invoice is ready for retrieval at a specified location within the payment facilitator web site such as at a specified uniform resource locator (URL) or uniform resource identifier (URI). In response to receiving or viewing the invoice, the buyer then communicates with the payment facilitator web site, and the buyer provides payment information to the payment facilitator system, as shown in block . In one embodiment, the payment information includes a billing address information, a shipping address information, and a financial account information. The financial account information must include one of a credit card account number, a debit card account number, a bank account number, etc. and may include related information such as an expiration date, an issuing institution name and address, etc. The billing and shipping address information may include the name of a person, street address, city, state, zip code, and day and night telephone numbers. The payment information may also include the buyer's email address, screen name, account name, or other identifier and identifying information. In one embodiment, the buyer's IP address is saved and stored with the payment information and\/or with the transaction information. The IP address may be gleaned from examination of incoming packets of data from the buyer when the buyer is communicating with the payment facilitator system.","Upon receipt of the transaction information, the payment facilitator system analyzes the transaction information for fraud, as shown in block . How this is achieved is discussed in more detail below with regard to . A check is then made to determine whether the transaction appears to be fraudulent, as shown in block . If the transaction does not appear to be fraudulent, the payment facilitator system debits the buyer's account and sends an email message instructing the seller to complete the sale, as shown in block . In response to such an email message, the seller then sends the good(s) to the buyer in an agreed-upon manner. In one embodiment, the payment facilitator system then credits the seller's financial account upon receipt of an email note from the buyer confirming completion of the sale or after a specified period of time, as shown in block . In this embodiment, the seller's account is credited when the buyer confirms that the good(s) have been received. Alternatively, in this embodiment, if the buyer fails to confirm receipt of the good(s) and does not inform the payment facilitator system that the good(s) were not received, the seller's account is credited for the sale. In another embodiment, the payment facilitator system may send an email message to the buyer asking the buyer to confirm receipt of the goods. This message could also state that if no response to the email message is received, the buyer's account will be debited and\/or the seller's account will be credited if no response is receive within a specified period of time.","If the transaction appears to be fraudulent, as shown in block , the payment facilitator system sends appropriate email messages to the buyer and\/or the seller, putting the sale on hold, as shown in block . The payment facilitator system then communicates information about the payment transaction and fraud information to a human investigator, as shown in block . The human investigator then investigates the transaction, starting with the fraud information provided as a result of the earlier fraud analysis, to determine whether the transaction is fraudulent or appears to have a high possibility of being fraudulent. The fraud investigator then takes whatever action the fraud investigator deems appropriate, such as communicating with the buyer and\/or the seller by email or telephone, contacting local police authorities, contacting the FBI, etc. The fraud investigator may cancel or allow the sale based on the results of the investigation. If the investigator allows the transaction, actions according to blocks  and  discussed above are then executed.","In one embodiment, after the buyer and seller agree on a sale, the sale information may be communicated to the payment facilitator system by the buyer. In this embodiment, the seller may have already registered with the system, and the buyer provides pertinent sale information to the payment facilitator system. This sale information may include the payment information regarding the buyer as discussed above regarding block , as well as specific information identifying the sale transaction such as a description of the goods or services the buyer agreed to purchase and the sale price, and may include further information such as the seller's contact information, namely the seller's email address, mailing address, telephone number, etc. The payment facilitator system then sends an email sale confirmation request to the seller. In various embodiments, the seller may respond to the email to accept the sale transaction, or the seller may accept the sale transaction by communicating with the payment facilitator system via an internet web interface either independently or by following a URI or URL contained in the email sale confirmation request. In another embodiment, no email sale confirmation request, and the payment facilitator system provides a screen notification to the seller the next time the seller logs on to the sale facilitator system. The screen notification may be a text display or an iconic display, or any other user interface technique. The flow of actions then continues with block  as discussed above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402"]},"The fraud detection software then checks whether the transaction is blacklisted, as shown in block . If the transaction is not blacklisted, the fraud detection software seeks approval from the financial institution implicated by the financial account specified by the buyer, as shown in block . In one embodiment, this involves communicating with a financial institution such as a credit card issuer, bank, etc. computer via a dedicated line to obtain approval for the transaction. The fraud detection software then receives a response from the financial institution and checks to determine whether the transaction is approved, as shown in block . In practice, the financial institution or third party that provides financial account approval returns one of a plurality of codes. In one embodiment, the fraud detection software determines whether the code returned should be classified as an approval or rejection. In another embodiment, the fraud detection software may classify the code as a requiring further information and automatically issue email messages to the buyer or seller requesting information clarifying the response from the financial institution. In this embodiment, one example may be for the fraud detection software to automatically send an email message requesting that the buyer confirm the billing address, the buyer's name, or other portion of the transaction information to which the fraud detection software is directed by the error code. Such a recovery system eliminates false positives when a simple typo was made by the user. In one embodiment, if the transaction is blacklisted or if the transaction has not been approved, the fraud detection software rejects the transaction, as shown in block . In one embodiment, when a transaction is rejected, appropriate email messages are sent to the buyer and the seller informing them that the payment transaction has been rejected.","If the financial institution approves the transaction, the fraud detection software performs rule-based analysis, assigning a score for the transaction based on rule violation, as shown in block . The list of possible rules is endless. Generally, certain information gleaned from the transaction information is compared with other information. This other information may be generally available address look-up information to determine whether the seller's address and the shipping and mailing addresses of the buyer exist, or may be more complex database queries and retrievals of information obtained from the history of transactions that have been processed by the payment facilitator system. In another embodiment, the historical information may also be obtained from a database maintained by a sale facilitating system in addition to or in place of historical information obtained from the payment facilitator system.","Analyses for whether the addresses and other information contained within the transaction information are syntactically correct or whether the addresses or other identifying information exists may be referred to as suspect data rules. Example suspect data rules include the following:\n\n","Analyses which require more complex analysis of databases of the payment facilitator system and\/or a sale facilitating system may be referred to as velocity rules. Generally, velocity rules check to see if there has been an inordinate amount of activity involving some piece of the transaction information. That is, the rules cause the fraud detection software to determine whether there has been excessive activity that may lead to a conclusion that the transaction may be fraudulent. In one embodiment, velocity rules may involve analysis of transaction volume over a given period of time for the buyer and\/or seller, transaction dollar value totals for the buyer and\/or seller for a given period of time, etc. In another embodiment, velocity checks may also include analysis of how frequently the specified financial account number or buyer has been declined authorization. In general, determining that there has been excessive activity with one seller may evidence that an innocent seller may be the target of a fraudulent buyer or group of buyers. On the other hand, excessive seller activity may also evidence that the seller is involved in committing a fraud. Although evidence of fraud may exist, it may be difficult to classify whether the fraud was committed by the buyer or by the seller. Therefore, if evidence of fraud appears to be present in a transaction, the transaction is sent to and examined by a fraud investigator so that false positives are minimized.","A more specific example of a velocity rule is determining whether the seller's account has been used beyond some determined threshold during some set period of time. Another example is determining whether the buyer's credit card has been used for a number of transactions exceeding a predetermined acceptable number of daily (or hourly or weekly, etc.) transactions. Further examples of velocity rules follow:\n\n","This list includes just a few of many possible rules. In one embodiment, the dollar amounts and numbers may remain constant and may only be changed by a system operator. In one embodiment, the amounts and thresholds may be automatically adjusted based on the kind of goods sold, the kind of seller, and other variables. The dollar amounts and thresholds listed above are examples and may be any dollar amounts or thresholds that serve as accurate indicators of a possible fraudulent transaction.","In another embodiment, the rule-based analysis may check for fraud by issuing queries regarding information provided by the buyers and sellers, checking blacklists of various information included with the transaction data, checking with external credit bureaus, etc. by communicating with one or more third party database servers, one or more third party blacklist servers, one or more external credit bureaus, etc. in addition to checking the database of the payment facilitator system and the sale facilitating system. In one embodiment, the same financial institution that was consulted to approve the transaction may also serve as a third party database server, third party blacklist server, external credit bureau, etc. with which the rule-based analysis interacts to execute and evaluate rules.","A numerical value is associated with each rule. Each time a rule is found to be violated, the score for the transaction is incremented by the amount associated with the rule. The fraud detection software sets a threshold such that after the rule analyses have been completed, when a score exceeds the threshold, the transaction is considered potentially fraudulent. The numerical values may be weighted according to the particular rule and need not be uniform. In some embodiments, a transaction that violates one velocity rule may cause the threshold to be exceeded, while violating one suspect data rule may not cause the threshold to be exceeded. After the rule analysis is performed, the fraud detection software checks to determine whether the score total exceeds the threshold, as shown in block . If the threshold is exceeded, the fraud detection software routes the transaction information and rule violation information to a human investigator, as shown in block . In one embodiment, the routing is achieved via email. In one embodiment, the rule violation information may be a code designating which rules were violated, a textual description of the rules violated, or both. The code may be any combination of letters, numbers or symbols that uniquely identifies the rule violated. If the score total does not exceed the threshold, as shown in block , the fraud detection software accepts the transaction. With regard to block  of , a transaction is considered fraudulent when the score total exceeds the defined threshold as in Block  of .","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes can be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
