title: Automatic computer program customization based on a user information store
abstract: Software programs, such as an operating system or other application programs, are automatically customized to a specific user(s) based on data corresponding to the specific user(s) that is maintained in a user information store. In one embodiment, the information store is a unified store that is accessible by multiple programs including the operating system. Thus, new information or information changes can be made available to multiple programs by the user adding (or changing) the information only once. In another embodiment, the operating system image to be installed on a computer is pre-populated with user-specific information at the factory. The user-specific information can be integrated into the operating system at the factory or alternatively upon an initial boot of the computer by the user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/560,676, filed Apr. 27, 2000, entitled \u201cAutomatic Computer Program Customization Based On A User Information Store\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates to installing programs on computers, and more particularly to automatically customizing a program based on a user information store.","Conventional computers generally execute one or more software programs, such as operating systems, productivity applications, educational applications, recreational applications, etc. Before such a software program can be executed by the computer, it typically must be installed on the computer, a process which usually involves copying one or more files from a distribution medium (e.g., a CD ROM) onto a storage device (e.g., a hard disk) of the computer, as well as possibly informing the operating system of the newly installed program.","A current trend in computer development and design is towards an increase in user-friendliness. Making software, and thus the computers that run the software, easier to use increases the number of people that will actually use the computers and software. Furthermore, by improving the user-friendliness of a computer or the installed software the overall user experience in using that computer or software can correspondingly be improved.","One way in which user-friendliness is improved, for both software and the computer as a whole, is allowing for user-customization of the software. For example, the user's name, street address, electronic mail address, display preferences, etc. can be provided to the software. This allows the software to address the user at a personal level (e.g., by name) and operate in a manner that is more to the user's liking.","Unfortunately, such user-customization typically must be performed manually by the user and typically must be repeated for multiple software programs. For example, the user must add his or her name to each of multiple programs, add his or her street address to each of multiple programs, add his or her email address to each of multiple programs, etc. This manual information entry, especially when repeated numerous times, becomes burdensome on the user and thus reduces the user-friendliness of the computer.","Furthermore, requiring manual entry of such user information reduces the \u201cout of box\u201d experience for the user. The \u201cout of box\u201d experience refers to the user's experience the first time he or she uses his or her new computer (i.e., when he or she takes the new computer out of its box, plugs it in, and turns it on). One solution to improve the \u201cout of box\u201d experience would be to have the user information immediately available to the user for this first use of the computer, such as by having a manufacturer add the user information for the user. Unfortunately, such manufacturer-entry of the user information is an expensive process and can be cost-prohibitive. Thus, it would be beneficial to improve the \u201cout of box\u201d experience for the user in a different manner.","The automatic program customization based on a user information store described below addresses these and other disadvantages.","Automatic program customization based on a user information store is described herein. Programs, such as an operating system or other application programs, are automatically customized to a specific user(s) based on data corresponding to the specific user(s) that is maintained in a user information store.","According to one aspect, the information store is a unified store that is accessible by multiple application programs as well as the operating system. Thus, new information or information changes can be made available to multiple applications by the user adding (or changing) the information only once.","According to another aspect, the operating system image to be installed on a computer is pre-populated with user-specific information at the factory. The specific information can be integrated into the operating system at the factory or alternatively upon an initial boot of the computer by the user. By pre-populating the operating system image to be installed on the computer with the user-specific information, the computer is customized to the user the first time he or she uses the computer.","According to another aspect, the user information store is used to determine what functionality the operating system is to include. By way of example, certain functionality may only be installed on the computer if the user has a particular profession, hobby, or interest identified in the user information store. By way of another example, a special tutorial may be included and automatically run when the computer is turned on if the user is a novice computer user.","In the discussion below, embodiments of the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more conventional personal computers. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various embodiments of the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, gaming consoles, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. In a distributed computer environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Alternatively, embodiments of the invention can be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. For example, at least part of the invention could be implemented in one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), one or more programmable logic devices. (PLDs), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110"]},"Operating system  is the fundamental software control program for computer , performing various functions including providing a user interface, managing the execution of one or more applications -, and controlling the input of data from and output of data to various input\/output (I\/O) devices. Operating system  can be any of a wide variety of conventional operating systems, such as any of the \u201cWINDOWS\u201d operating systems available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Application programs  represent one or more of a wide variety of software application programs that can be executed on computer . Examples of such application programs include educational programs, reference programs, productivity programs (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets, databases), recreational programs, utility programs (e.g., communications programs), etc. Application programs  may be installed on computer  by the user, or alternatively pre-installed by the manufacturer or distributor of computer .","BOM  is a compilation of customization information for one or more users (or prospective users) of computer . In one implementation, any data describing the identity of a user or hardware preferences of a user that the operating system or an application program allows to be customized can be included in the user information of BOM . BOM  is used to customize software programs (including operating system  and\/or application programs ) to the particular user(s) of computer . As multiple different programs can obtain information from BOM , BOM  is referred to as a \u201cunified\u201d information store. BOM  is stored in a known location on computer  or a remote location accessible by computer , such as with a known name in a particular directory (e.g., the root directory) of a primary hard disk of computer , a known name at a particular remote server, etc.","Operating system  can optionally be a \u201ccomponentized\u201d operating system. In a componentized operating system, the operating system functionality is separated into multiple different components, each component including one or more files. Each component has a corresponding manifest that identifies which other components, if any, that particular component is dependent on. Additionally, an operating system bill of materials (OS BOM) is also included that identifies which components are installed on (or to be installed on) a computer as the operating system. This identification can be direct (e.g., the component names or identifiers are listed) or indirect (e.g., one or more components are identified because of their inclusion in a manifest corresponding to another identified component). In a componentized operating system, BOM  can be included as one of the components installed on a computer (e.g., referred to as an identity component). Alternatively, BOM  can identify which components are installed on (or are to be installed on) the computer.","Regardless of whether operating system  is a componentized operating system, BOM interface  provides an interface between BOM  and setup application  as well as operating system  (and optionally one or more of application programs ). BOM interface  allows operating system  and\/or application programs  to retrieve data from BOM , modify data in BOM , and\/or add data to BOM . In one implementation, BOM interface  is implemented as an Application Programming Interface (API). Alternatively, operating system , application programs , or setup application  may access BOM  directly rather than via interface .","Setup application program  is an application program that integrates the information from BOM  into operating system . Setup application  executes during installation of operating system , or alternatively at other times, such as the first time computer  is turned on (i.e., booted) by the user. Setup application  retrieves various information for one or more users of computer  from BOM  and customizes operating system  based on the retrieved information. Although illustrated as a separate application, setup application  may alternatively be part of operating system  or another application program. In some implementations, setup application program  continues to operate as an integration manager after installation of operating system , managing subsequent updating of operating system .","Setup application  can integrate information from BOM  into operating system  in a variety of different manners. Information from BOM  can be used to directly alter a setting in operating system . For example, the user's name stored in BOM  may be input to operating system  so that operating system  can address the user by name. By way of another example, the user's preferred desktop theme stored in BOM  may be input to operating system  to change the current desktop theme setting of operating system .","Information from BOM  can also be used to determine what functionality is included in operating system . By way of example, certain functionality of the operating system may be specifically installed (or not installed) based on the user-specific information, such as installing particular files or components providing enhanced graphics features if the user-information indicates the user is a graphic artist or an educator, etc. By way of another example, if BOM  indicates that a user is not very familiar with computers, then particular files or components that target beginning or novice users can be added to the operating system and the operating system modified to execute such applications when booted.","BOM  can optionally include user information for multiple users. Many current operating systems support multiple users, allowing different user names (or \u201clogon\u201d names) to be created for each of the users. Each user is then able to have his or her own settings, such as desktop theme, name and address, etc. When handling multiple users, setup application  requests operating system  to create multiple user names, one for each user identified in BOM . Setup application  then provides the user information corresponding to each user to operating system  in order to customize the operating system  settings for that particular user using the information in BOM .","In the illustrated example, BOM  is added to computer  by the manufacturer or distributor of computer . Alternatively, situations can arise where the manufacturer or distributor does not add BOM  to computer  (e.g., computer  is purchased from a local retailer who has little or no knowledge of who the purchaser is). In such situations BOM  is added to computer , after the consumer acquires the computer, in any of a wide variety of manners. For example, upon initial boot setup application  may copy (e.g., via a network interface card or modem) BOM  from a remote location to computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["120","122","124","124","124"]},"Computer  is similar to computer  of , and includes operating system , one or more application programs , setup application program , and BOM interface . Client computer , however, does not include a BOM. Rather, BOM  is included on computer . Thus, BOM  is accessed via communications link .","Depending on the nature of communications link  and the information in BOM , default information may be used by setup application  and then changed when BOM  is retrieved from computer . For example, communications link  may be the Internet and BOM  may include the user-specific information for computer  to access the Internet. In this situation, setup application  includes default Internet connection information (e.g., a toll-free access number for an Internet Service Provider managed by the manufacturer of computer ) to be able to make a connection to computer  and retrieve BOM . Upon receipt of BOM , the default information used by setup application  is overwritten as necessary as part of the integration process.","Computer  can be a server computer that is accessible to multiple different users via communication link , and may optionally maintain multiple different BOMs  for different users. Alternatively, computer  may maintain a BOM  that is accessible by only a single user via communication link . BOM  can be accessible to a user regardless of what computer the user is using. By way of example, computer  may include an operating system and BOM interface (analogous to computer ) and operate as a desktop computer. Computer , on the other hand, may be a portable computer that accesses the single BOM  maintained by the desktop computer. Thus, only a single BOM  is maintained for the user, and is shared by multiple applications executing on the user's desktop computer and portable computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["140","108","2"]},"BOM  includes customization information for one or possibly multiple (x) users  and . BOM  includes user information  for one user and user information  for another user. User information  includes user identity information  and hardware information , while user information  includes user identity information  and hardware information . User identity information  and  each include data describing the identity of the corresponding users. Any of a wide variety of information describing a user can be maintained as user identity information  and , such as name, initials, home address, business address, state of residence, country of citizenship, electronic mail (email) address, age, social security number, date of birth, organization name, profession, hobbies, interests, computer expertise, telephone number, etc.","Hardware information  and  include data describing hardware preferences of the corresponding users. Any of a wide variety of information describing hardware preferences can be maintained as hardware information  and , such as color preferences, speaker volume preferences, desktop background preferences, desktop theme preferences, display preferences (e.g., resolution and number of colors), language preferences, Internet service provider (ISP) identifier and access information (e.g., telephone number and logon identification), whether telephone features (e.g., call-waiting) should be disabled, preferred default printer, time zone setting, whether particular end user license agreements (EULAs) have been accepted by the user, computer name, what specific hardware to install on the computer at boot time, etc.","BOM  is available to any program and thus operates as a unified information store. Any changes made by one program to BOM  are available to all other programs, thereby alleviating the user of having to enter the same changes into multiple programs.","Additionally, the user information  and  can optionally include program-specific information. Information specific to a particular program can be written to BOM  by that particular program, or alternatively by another program (e.g., operating system ). A program can store any user-customizable settings in BOM , allowing the settings to be automatically customized for another computer accessing BOM .","It should be noted that not every BOM (nor the user information for different users within the same BOM) need include the same information. The information included in a BOM for a particular user can vary based on the operating system and\/or application programs being used by the user, the amount of information that the user is willing to divulge and have stored in the BOM, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"170"},"The computer order  is routed to a hardware assembly station  at which point multiple hardware components  are assembled to build the computer . The assembly of hardware components may be automated, performed manually, or a combination thereof. The assembled computer is then submitted to a software installation station . At software installation station , the operating system  and various application programs  are copied to computer . This copying of software programs (application programs  and operating system ) may be done individually or alternatively as a combined process (e.g., pre-generated software images including operating system  and various combinations of application programs  may be used to copy multiple programs to computer  concurrently).","User-specific information  is also added to computer  as a BOM, resulting in an operating system image on the computer that is pre-populated with the user-specific information. This user-specific information  can be integrated into operating system  (or other applications) at software installation station , or alternatively such integration may occur at the first boot of the computer by the user. The customized computer , with user-specific information  installed on it, is then provided to the user.","The order of manufacturing illustrated in  is exemplary only, and various alternative orders can be implemented. By way of example, operating system  and user-specific information  may be installed on or copied to a hard disk drive prior to adding the drive to the computer at hardware assembly station .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["172","178"]},"Initially, a consumer request for a computer is received, act .

The user-specific information can be obtained in any of a wide variety of manners. In one implementation, the consumer is queried for the user-specific information at the time the request is submitted by the user. For example, if the consumer orders the computer over World Wide Web on the Internet, then Web pages with additional questions may be presented to the consumer and the answers to these questions used as the user-specific information. By way of another example, if the consumer orders the computer by email, then a reply email message with additional questions may be sent to the consumer. When the consumer responds to the reply email message, the answers in the response are used as the user-specific information.","Alternatively, the information may be obtained from the computer from which the request is submitted. For example, if a consumer orders a new computer over the Internet using his or her current computer, the BOM on his or her current computer can be copied (or retrieved via a BOM interface) and used as the user-specific information for the new computer.","The requested computer is then assembled (if necessary), act .
