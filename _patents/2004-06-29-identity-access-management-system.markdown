{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to an identity access management system, and more specifically, the invention relates to methods and systems for protecting against identity theft.","2. Background Art","Identity theft has become an important concern. A significant contributing factor is that an individual's social security number and other confidential identifying data are required on many application forms. As a result, individuals may lose control over what is applied for in their names.","Particularly with the growth of the Internet, the opportunity exists for a person to represent himself or herself, improperly and without authorization, as another person. This may be done, for instance, to make purchases, to obtain credit or debit cards, or for other purposes. This misrepresentation may be done by using, for example, a stolen social security number or bank account number or other confidential, personal identifying number.","Procedures are available to address the improper use of credit and debit cards. For example, a pairing of two tokens may be used to identify a card and by extrapolation the card holder. Also, with modern chipcards, the chip may contain an encrypted token and the card holder may supply another token, usually a personal identification number (pin). The combination of these tokens is used by the authorization system to identify the card. It is not possible to say that the proper card holder is using the card, though, because anyone could have the card and the pin. Nonetheless, this procedure, referred to as Authentication, does, to a significant degree, limit the fraud.","While Authentication is thus useful, it does not address the issue of a person attempting to obtain improperly a credit or debit card in the name of another person by using stolen or fraudulently obtained personal identification numbers.","An object of this invention is to provide an improved method and system for managing access to personal identity.","Another object of the invention is to provide a procedure for confirming the identity of a person using personal identification data.","These and other objectives are attained with a method and system for managing access to and verifying personal identity. In this method, a person is provided with a private key that uniquely identifies that person, and that person uses the private key to access an identity management system. The person then uses the identity management system to specify a desire to establish a business relationship with at least one business entity.","After this is done, the user can contact that business entity. The business entity is provided with a private key that uniquely identifies the business entity. That business entity then receives a request to establish a business relationship with the entity from a person alleging to have the personal identity. The business entity then accesses the identity access management system using the private key, and that entity then determines if a person having the personal identity has used the identity access management system to specify a desire to establish a business relationship with the business entity.","Further benefits and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed description, given with reference to the accompanying drawings, which specify and show preferred embodiments of the invention.","The present invention, generally, provides a method and system for managing access to and verifying personal identity. In accordance with the invention, and with particular reference to , a person is provided, at , with a private key that uniquely identifies that person, and that person uses the private key, at , to access an identity access management system. The person then, at , uses the identity access management system to specify a desire to establish a business relationship with at least one business entity.","After this is done, the user can contact that business entity. The business entity is provided, as represented at , with a private key that uniquely identifies the business entity. That business entity then, at , receives a request to establish a business relationship with the entity from a person alleging to have the personal identity. The business entity then, at , accesses an identity access management system using the private key; and that entity, at , then determines if a person having the personal identity has used the identity access management system to specify a desire to establish a business relationship with the business entity.","As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention may be used in many different specific applications. The invention is particularly well suited to help insure that individuals who request a service, such as a credit or debit card, are who they represent themselves to be.","With reference to , individuals, represented at , would have a private key that, for example, correlated to their social security number. The private key along with an individual's password would be needed for an individual to access and make selections within the identity access management system . An individual wishing to establish credit with a particular lender  would first add the lender and possibly other information, such as the lender retention record and a unique request code, to the list, which is kept in manager , of entities with which the individual wishes to establish relationships.","The individual would then fill out an application, generally as is done today, including a lender request code created by the individual. The company who extended the application to the individual would use credit agencies, in much the manner that they are used today. The credit agencies, represented at , along with the credit worthiness rating they provide, would check the identity access management system  to determine, by checking the lender request code, if the individual had in fact registered interest in establishing a business relationship with the lender. An unauthorized person, represented at , would not have the proper registration in manager , and would thus be denied the services by the service extender .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","42","32","44","46","50","30","46","52","30"]},"Other types of mailing services, such as an overnight mailing service, could also be used. Further, special U.S. Postal mailing services, such as certified and\/or return receipt mail could also be used to help ensure and track delivery to consumer . A home phone number specified by consumer  during registration, and the password provided by the web site or sent via e-mail subsequent to registration are not included in the mailed confirmation. Similarly, the account number included in the mailed confirmation is not provided by the IAM web site during registration, so as to provide a separation of identifying information at the IAM web site and in the mailed confirmation.","When consumer  receives the mailed confirmation, directions are included therewith instructing consumer  to call a telephone number, in one example a toll free telephone number, associated with the IAM in order to activate the IAM account registered at the IAM web site. The directions further instruct consumer  to call the telephone number, represented at , associated with the IAM only from the home telephone number, represented at , specified in the registration at the IAM web site. When consumer  calls the telephone number associated with the IAM, consumer  is requested by a Voice Response Unit (hereinafter referred to as \u201cVRU\u201d) to enter the account number provided in the mailed confirmation, and the password provided by the IAM web site or e-mailed during registration. When consumer  correctly enters the account number and password, the VRU verifies, using in one example a Caller ID system, that the call by consumer  is originating from the home telephone number specified at the IAM web site during registration.","The IAM account  is activated only if consumer  enters the correct account number and password, and the VRU can verify that the call by consumer  is originating from the home telephone number specified at the IAM web site during registration. Upon completion of an IAM account activation attempt, the VRU indicates whether IAM account activation has been successful by instructing consumer  to access the IAM web site for further instructions. An IAM account activation failure is indicated only by a disconnection of the call, so as to not provide a party attempting a fraudulent registration and\/or activation with clues as to how to successfully complete the activation. After a given number of unsuccessful activation attempts, in one example 3 attempts, the IAM account registration is revoked, and the account is deleted.","After successfully activating the IAM account  using the VRU, consumer  accesses the IAM web site , and uses the previously provided account number and password to sign on to the web site. Consumer  is informed that the password is expired, and instructed to enter a new password, represented at . After successfully entering a new password, an e-mail, represented at , is sent to consumer  confirming that the password has been successfully changed. Once consumer  has successfully changed the password and finishes signing onto the IAM web site, consumer  may, as represented at , specify a desire to establish a business relationship with at least one business entity using the IAM web site.","The desire to establish a business relationship with at least one business entity may be specified using a list, in one example a pull-down list, of business entities that have previously registered as service extenders  with the IAM. If consumer  wishes to specify a business entity that has not previously registered as one of service extenders  with the IAM, a text entry field is provided to allow consumer  to enter a name and other information related to the business entity, for example an e-mail or postal mailing address of the business entity. Once this information is entered, a notification, represented at , may be sent, for example by e-mail or the U.S. Postal Service, alerting the business entity to the desire of consumer  to establish a business relationship with the entity.","The IAM web site  displays a list of business entities with which consumer  has specified a desire to establish a business relationship. A method to remove business entities from this list is also provided, in one example by consumer  selecting a check box next to an entity with a pointing device such as a mouse. Consumer  may also specify an expiration period for each entry which corresponds to a business entity on the list. A default expiration period, in one example 90 days, may be specified, or different expiration periods may be specified for each entry on the list, for example by selecting among a plurality of radio buttons having respective values of 30, 60, and 90 days with a pointing device such as a mouse, or typing a value using a data entry field.","Subsequent to specifying a desire to establish a business relationship with a business entity using the IAM web site , consumer  may follow a routine process, in one example completing, signing, and mailing a credit card application, to make a request, represented at , for a product or service from the business entity. Upon receiving the request from consumer , the business entity performs a check, represented at , with the IAM to determine if consumer  has specified a desire to establish a business relationship with the business entity. The check may be performed by an employee of the business entity by signing onto the IAM web site and entering the name and\/or other identifying information of consumer  to run a query so as to determine if consumer  has, in fact, specified a desire to establish a business relationship with the business entity. The response, represented at , that a business entity receives to a check is simply a positive or negative indicator as to whether consumer  has specified a desire to establish a business relationship with the business entity; no additional information about consumer  is provided by the IAM in response to a check.","If a high volume of checks are to be performed, an Application Programming Interface (hereinafter referred to as \u201cAPI\u201d) to the IAM may be utilized to perform a check. The API would provide routines that perform a check over a secure network connection, in one example a Secure Socket Layer connection, to the IAM. The routines of the API could be linked to business entity supplied software that is utilized by employees of the business entity for processing requests from consumer  for products or services. In an alternative embodiment, the API could be used by special, trusted business entities, in one example credit reporting bureaus, to include in a report, in one example a credit report, information on all the business entities with which consumer  has specified a desire to establish a business relationship.","If a business entity has not already registered at the LAM web site, a registration, represented at , may be performed with a business entity account number and a temporary password being sent to the business entity at an e-mail address specified during registration. The business entity may complete the registration by using the account number and temporary password to specify a new password. A fee may be charged to the business entity for both registration and each check that is performed by using, for example, a credit card or by sending an invoice via the U.S. Postal Service to the business entity. Both business entity and consumer registrations are stored in at least one secure, encrypted database.","As indicated hereinabove, it should be understood that the present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. Any kind of computer\/server system(s)\u2014or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein\u2014is suited. A typical combination of hardware and software could be a general purpose computer system with a computer program that, when loaded and executed, carries out the respective methods described herein. Alternatively, a specific use computer, containing specialized hardware for carrying out one or more of the functional tasks of the invention, could be utilized.","While it is apparent that the invention herein disclosed is well calculated to fulfill the objects stated above, it will be appreciated that numerous modifications and embodiments may be devised by those skilled in the art, and it is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and embodiments as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
