{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to communication sessions, and more particularly, to rich call communication sessions offering keyhole frame image exchange between the communication session participants.","Over the last decade, there has been a merger of two of the most successful communications tools ever developed\u2014mobile communications and the Internet. The Internet has provided access to many kinds of services, information, and content through one common interface. Mobile communications has provided the concept of being reachable at any time and with the ability to reach other people or services quickly. Combining the freedom of the Internet with the reachability and immediacy of mobile networks, the Mobile Internet has been born.","Service creation for the Mobile Internet is based on an open content format, e.g., eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Service mobility through open content format provides accessibility of a consumer's personalized services through any access network or device, whereby service reachability through the open content format provides services that follow the consumer wherever he or she may go.","While services such as messaging and browsing continue to be important to today's Mobile Internet user, person to person communications will remain as one of the most important services offered by the Mobile Internet. As the Mobile Internet technology advances, communications will combine multiple media types and communication methods with presence and community information, not only to enhance person to person communication, but also to enhance multi-point to multi-point communication, i.e., conferencing. With the use of Internet Protocol (IP), for example, addition of rich media is facilitated through the use of standardized networking and signaling protocols.","A media enhanced call, i.e., rich call, may be defined as a voice or video conversation that is supported with concurrent access to an image, data, or other information during a single session. SIP will provide enabling technology for rich calls, where the Web and Mobile domains may be joined for true service mobility and access independence. SIP's support for rich calls will add \u201csee what I see\u201d, or \u201ckeyhole\u201d capability for consumers through a combination of voice, mail, Web browsing, instant messaging, voice over IP (VoIP), and other services. Although it is not necessary to employ VoIP or IP telephony service machinery for rich call servicing, it is expected that IP telephony and\/or IP multimedia will emerge as the technology of choice for the rich call environment.","Today, keyhole processing has been introduced into browsing services, whereby the server that is hosting the visited Web site may offer content other than that provided by the extensible markup. Such content, for example, may include live video feeds from traffic cameras dispatched throughout the city where the consumer resides. In such an instance, however, a server to person topology exists, whereby a server within the network provides the video feed directly to the person that is currently visiting the Web site. Future keyhole processing within the Mobile Internet will not only involve such a server to person topology, but alternate multi-domain environments will also be involved in keyhole processing. The multi-domain environments will include, for example, a Personal Computer (PC) or other hardware platform involved with a mobile terminal during a person to person communication session, or conversely a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to mobile terminal communication session.","As person to person communications improve, versatility and consumer satisfaction continue to grow. Accordingly, conventional person to person communication sessions involving multi-domain environments continue to require refinement. One such area of improvement relates to communication sessions involving video data that may be required to be exchanged between the communication session participants.","Accordingly, there is a need for continued improvement in the communications industry for enablement of rich call sessions in a multi-domain environment.","To overcome limitations in the prior art, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a system and method that allows keyhole frame images to be transmitted from a hosting terminal to a receiving terminal during a communication session, where the keyhole frame images may be modified by the receiving terminal.","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method of exchanging data between participants of a communication session comprises establishing a voice connection between participants of the communication session, activating a keyhole frame within a display of a hosting terminal that is in proximity to a first participant, establishing a stream connection between the first participant and a second participant, streaming image data contained within the keyhole frame from the hosting terminal to a mobile terminal proximately located to the second participant via the stream connection, and establishing data connections between ones of the participants of the communication session and the mobile terminal.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a keyhole frame processing system comprises first and second mobile terminals wirelessly adapted to establish a voice connection between them and a hardware platform wirelessly coupled to the second mobile terminal and adapted to establish a data connection between the second mobile terminal and the hardware platform. The hardware platform comprises a display and a keyhole frame application adapted to place a keyhole frame anywhere within a viewable area of the display. The keyhole frame application is further adapted to transmit image data contained within the keyhole frame to the second mobile terminal via the data connection.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a mobile terminal is wirelessly coupled to a network which includes a hardware platform capable of transmitting video content to the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal comprises a memory capable of storing at least a keyhole frame module and a processor coupled to the memory. The processor is configured by the keyhole frame module to enable projecting the video content to a display of the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal further comprises a transceiver that is configured to facilitate the image exchange with the hardware platform. The keyhole frame module is further adapted to generate edit commands to change the video content displayed by the mobile terminal.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon which are executable by a mobile terminal for exchanging video content with a hardware platform performs steps comprising establishing a first connection with a second mobile terminal to provide voice communications between the mobile terminal and the second mobile terminal, establishing a second connection with the hardware platform, where the hardware platform is proximately located with the second mobile terminal. The steps further comprise receiving video data from the hardware platform via the second connection and providing commands to the hardware platform that affect the video data received from the hardware platform. The commands are provided via one of the first connection or second connection.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a hardware platform comprises means for establishing first and second connections with a mobile terminal, means for exchanging voice communications with the mobile terminal via the first connection, means for generating video data contained within a keyhole frame, the keyhole frame being defined by keyhole frame parameters to lie within a display region of the hardware platform, and means for providing the video data to the mobile terminal via the second connection.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon which are executable by a hardware platform performs steps comprising establishing first and second connections with a mobile terminal, exchanging voice communications with the mobile terminal via the first connection, generating video data contained within a keyhole frame, where the keyhole frame is defined by keyhole frame parameters to lie within a display region of the hardware platform. The steps further comprise providing the video data to the mobile terminal via the second connection, where external commands are received that change the keyhole frame parameters.","These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with greater particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of a system and method in accordance with the invention.","In the following description of the exemplary embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, as structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Generally, the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus allowing keyhole frame images to be transmitted to a receiving terminal during a communication session. The keyhole frame is movable and resizable throughout the display of the hosting terminal, whereby the image captured by the keyhole frame is transmitted to the receiving terminal during the communication session. Modifications to the image may be directed by the receiving terminal either through voice commands sent to the hosting terminal from the receiving terminal, or alternatively through cursor\/pointing device commands actuated from the receiving terminal itself. All modifications effected on the keyhole frame image at the hosting terminal are viewed in real time at the receiving terminal.","A rich call is perceived to relate to a consumer's immediate, personal, person to person communication needs. Some of these needs can already be satisfied today with telephony services, such as the basic voice call, voice mail, and call forwarding services offered by carriers employing, for example, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technologies. The key in a rich call, however, is the consumer experience: the value and potential of combining telephony with other elements to provide enriched services. Voice calls, for example, may evolve into rich calls, during which audio, video, image, or other data can be shared.","The present invention improves upon the current state of the art of person to person communication, through the activation of keyhole frame processing. In general, a keyhole frame may be activated by a user, whereby a portion of the display that lies within the keyhole frame may be captured for subsequent transfer\/storage within the communication device being used, e.g., Personal Computer (PC), Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), mobile terminal, etc. The keyhole frame may be of any size and shape desired by the user and it may be negotiable depending on the terminal capabilities, e.g., screen size, at any time before, during, or after the communication session. Other person(s) in communication with the user may view whatever the user has selected to be captured by the keyhole frame. The keyhole frame may represent a portion of the user's display, or conversely, may represent any other file\/application that the user wishes to share with the other persons involved in the communication session.","The shared keyhole frame may be shared through any number of wired network topologies such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). Wireless cellular networks utilizing multiple access technologies such as, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and GSM may also be employed to share the keyhole frame. Still further, proximity technologies like Bluetooth, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), InfraRed (IR) may also be used to facilitate keyhole frame exchange according to the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112"]},"Initiation of call  from mobile terminal  to mobile terminal  is performed by any one of a number of methods currently available. For example, the user of mobile terminal  may select the user of mobile terminal  from a buddy list or dynamic phone book, which includes presence and any other information that the user of mobile terminal  wants to publish about himself. The user of mobile terminal  may instead access mobile terminal  through Web page access of the user's name and number so that the user's context and location may be taken into account prior to call setup of call .","During call , the call participants may toggle between different media types, such that while the audio portion of call  is transpiring, live video or snapshots may be exchanged. The present invention further allows sharing of a user's display view, allowing, for example, the display or a portion of the display of PC  to be projected onto the display of mobile terminal , while call  is in process. In particular, keyhole frame  may be selected by the user of PC  to allow the user of mobile terminal  to see what the user of PC  wants him to see.","In order to illustrate an exemplary usage of rich call network , a scenario will now be explored whereby the user of mobile terminal  is a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the user of mobile terminal  is the secretary of the CEO. The secretary has prepared some material for a presentation that the CEO will be giving on a particular business trip, while the CEO is en route to the presentation venue. Call  is established between the secretary and the CEO to initiate a person to person communication session. The person to person communication session is then augmented by second call , initiated by the secretary between PC  and mobile terminal , to provide a conduit for delivery of streamed view  to the CEO.","In particular, streamed view  is the projection of the contents of keyhole frame  onto the display of mobile terminal . Thus, while the secretary and the CEO are conducting voice communication via call , the secretary may allow the CEO to see a portion, e.g., keyhole frame , of the display of PC  via call  to supplement their conversation. Thus, the CEO's rich call experience is improved in accordance with the present invention.","Resident within PC  is a frame application in accordance with the present invention, that allows a portion of the display of PC , e.g., , to be captured and subsequently streamed to mobile terminal , or any other terminal connected to rich call infrastructure . The size of keyhole frame  may have been previously optimized through the use of presence or capability information exchanged during the call setup of call  or , depending upon the ability of rich call infrastructure  to host negotiated capability information for call . Conversely, the use of profile information subscribed to by PC  in relation to the capabilities of mobile terminal  may be used to initially set the size of keyhole frame  in accordance with the display size of mobile terminal .","If the initial resolution of projection  of keyhole frame  is not adequate for the CEO's purposes, the CEO may make a verbal request via call  for the secretary to adjust the resolution of keyhole frame . In such an instance, the secretary may then either \u201czoom in\u201d or \u201czoom out\u201d in accordance with the CEO's needs. Alternatively, or additionally, if the CEO wishes to view a differently sized portion of the display of PC , then the secretary may simply adjust the size of keyhole frame  to match the request. In any event, a rendering application within PC , or alternately within rich call infrastructure , may then receive the adjusted size\/resolution of keyhole frame  and conform the resulting video stream to the pre-negotiated display size of mobile terminal . Applications within PC  may also adapt to the size of keyhole frame  once it has been determined, such that visibility of the application may be optimized at the remote end, e.g., mobile terminal .","Once keyhole frame  has been adequately projected onto mobile terminal , the CEO may view the presentation materials produced by the secretary. Any updates to the presentation materials may then be communicated verbally via call  by the CEO for subsequent update by the secretary on PC . As each modification is being performed by the secretary, streamed view  is being projected onto the display of mobile terminal . In other words, as visual data within keyhole frame  changes, the display of mobile terminal  also changes to reflect the modifications made by the secretary, so that the CEO has real time review of the modifications being made. Keyhole frame  may also be arranged to follow the active cursor on the PC  screen. In such an instance, keyhole frame  is automatically centered around the active cursor, so that the CEO may experience a centered view of the modifications taking place on PC , thus obviating the need for the secretary to manually center keyhole frame  around the content being modified. Once all of the modifications have been implemented, the presentation is instantly in its final version, since no further review is required by the CEO.","In an alternate embodiment in accordance with the present invention, keyhole frame  may represent a file or application, such as a word processing or a presentation generation utility. In such an instance, the frame displayed by such a file or application becomes keyhole frame , whereby each keystroke and pointing device input performed by the secretary on keyhole frame  becomes visible to the CEO on the display of mobile terminal . Initially, the secretary is given control over any editing processes being performed on the file. However, the secretary may pass control over to the CEO, such that the CEO is given control over the editing process. In this case, although the file being edited is local to PC , the editing input is nevertheless being generated at mobile terminal . Thus, if the secretary does not understand the verbal modification instructions given via the voice call, the CEO may demonstrate his instructions visually by causing the visual content of keyhole frame  to be modified by cursor\/pointing device actions performed on mobile terminal . In this way, the rich call communication session allows simultaneous modifications to the visual content of keyhole frame  by each member of the communication session (there may be more than just two), where only a single copy of the file being edited is required.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","206","202","206","202","218","220","204","204","206","202"]},"For purposes of exemplifying the present invention, block diagram  is discussed in terms of a content transport mechanism between mobile terminal  and hardware platform , whereby rich call connection  is utilized as the communication conduit between the two devices. Rich call connection  may represent a wired and\/or a wireless connection. Wired implementations of rich call connection  may include, for example, POTS, DSL or ISDN, whereas other, non-telecommunications based wired implementations may simply use the Universal Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire, specifications, for example. Wireless, non-cellular implementations of rich call connection  may include WLAN, Bluetooth, Infrared, etc., whereas cellular implementations utilizing TDMA, CDMA, W-CDMA, GPRS, etc. may be used as required by the particular application.","In operation, hardware platform  may be a device having content capture\/receipt capability  that is used for generation of keyhole frame  and its contents as illustrated in . Content capture\/receipt  provides video data, whereby the images may be presented in still and\/or video mode. In still mode, only a single image is transferred via path  to First-In First-Out (FIFO) buffer . In video mode, multiple images arranged in back to back frame sequence are transferred to FIFO buffer  at a rate that conforms with the bandwidth requirements of rich call connection . FIFO buffer  buffers the content blocks, while content delivery\/receipt  prepares for their subsequent transfer to mobile terminal  via path  through rich call connection . Path  is used by content receipt\/delivery  to acknowledge receipt of the images transmitted from content delivery  via rich call connection  as well as to provide edit commands associated with the received video content as discussed below. Buffer and synchronization block  is used to provide the proper frame alignment and playback speed as required by presentation . Presentation  represents any Application Programming Interface (API) that is executing on mobile terminal  including image processing software required by mobile terminal  for subsequent display.","The images transferred via rich call path  may be formatted and rendered in accordance with the capabilities of the display (not shown) of mobile terminal . Additionally, the images may be transferred in any one of a number of video formats to include Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG), MPEG version 4 (MPEG-4), Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), to name only a few. In addition, vector graphics files may be transmitted, where creation of digital images is facilitated through a sequence of commands or mathematical statements that place lines and shapes in a given two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. In vector graphics, the file that results is created and saved as a sequence of vector statements. For example, instead of containing a bit in the file for each bit of a line drawing, a vector graphic file describes a series of points to be connected. Alternatively, the vector graphics file may be converted to a raster graphics image by content delivery\/receipt  prior to transmission, so as to increase portability between systems. Additionally, animation images are also usually created as vector graphic files, using content creation products that allow creation of 2-D and 3-D animations that may be sent to content receipt\/delivery  as a vector file and then rasterized \u201con the fly\u201d as they arrive by presentation .","Control data may also be transferred via rich call connection  between mobile terminal  and hardware platform . In particular, as a result of the data displayed by presentation  on the display (not shown) of mobile terminal , the user of mobile terminal  may wish to make changes to the data displayed. Since only the graphical representations of the data contained within content capture\/receipt  are presented by presentation , commands may be sent from content receipt\/delivery  to command processor  to effect changes on the data that is stored within content capture\/receipt .","Such is the case, for example, when the data presented by presentation  is the contents of a word processing file contained within content capture\/receipt . If modifications are to made by mobile terminal , then authorization to make such modifications is granted by hardware platform  via rich call connection . Accordingly, data modification commands are transmitted by mobile terminal  to hardware platform  via path  to effect such changes to the data. In response, the updated graphical representations of the edited data are provided to mobile terminal  from hardware platform  via path .","In an alternate embodiment, changes to the data stored within content capture\/receipt  may be effected by hardware platform  itself, where the graphical representations of the changes to the data are immediately provided to mobile terminal  via path  for subsequent display by presentation . In this way, as modifications to the data are being made at hardware platform , the user of mobile terminal  is immediately made aware of them.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","208","302","304","104","308","304","114","302","114"]},"Video configuration parameters  may also represent cursor and pointing device control placement parameters provided by mobile terminal  after PC  has granted modification rights to mobile terminal . In such an instance, for example, keyhole frame  contains content to be edited by mobile terminal . Any control input generated by mobile terminal  that is construed by video configuration parameters  as being file edit commands, are provided to file Input\/Output (I\/O) , so that the appropriate file content may be updated and thus incorporated by video feed .","Video configuration parameters  may also represent cursor and pointing device control placement parameters that are provided by PC . In such an instance, for example, keyhole frame  contains content to be edited by PC , based on verbal commands received from mobile terminal  via call . Any control input generated by PC  that is construed by video configuration parameters  as being file edit commands, are provided to file Input\/Output (I\/O) , so that the appropriate file content may be updated. Accordingly, any changes to the file currently being displayed by keyhole frame , whether they be locally generated by PC  or remotely generated by mobile terminal , are immediately reflected in keyhole frame .","Video encoder  receives the video content represented by keyhole frame  at a configurable frame rate. Video encoder  then implements video compression methods that exploit redundant and perceptually irrelevant parts of the video frames received from video configuration . The redundancy can be categorized into spatial, temporal, and spectral components; where spatial redundancy relates to correlation between neighboring pixels; temporal redundancy relates to objects likely to appear in present frames that were there in past frames; and spectral redundancy addresses the correlation between the different color components of the same image. Video encoder  achieves video compression by generating motion compensation data, which describes the motion between the current and previous image of two consecutive video frames. Video encoder  may seek to establish a constant bit rate for video bit stream , in which case video encoder  controls the frame rate as well as the quality of images contained within video frame . Video encoder  groups video bit stream  and header  into video frame  and then streams video frame , and subsequently formed video frames, to mobile terminal  via call , where header  provides specific information about the file format such as video coding type, length of frame, frame identifier, etc.","Video encoder  may implement a video COder\/DECoder (CODEC) algorithm defined by ITU-T H.263, which is an established CODEC scheme used in various multimedia services. H.263 provides a wide toolbox of various encoding tools and coding complexities for different purposes. A definition of the tools to be used and the allowed complexity of the mode are defined in CODEC profiles and levels, such as Profile , Level , also known as the H.263 baseline, has been defined as a mandatory video CODEC. Video encoder  may also support decoding of video bit-stream content conforming to MPEG-4 Visual Simple Profile, Level . Other proprietary video coding formats, such as RealVideo  and RealVideo , may be used that are recognized by the RealOne Player utility.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","410","402","410","402","410"]},"In such an example, meeting group  and the senior production manager are not equipped with standard video conferencing equipment, but are equipped with imaging capable mobile terminals  and . In addition, image processing capable PC  is provided in proximity to meeting group . PC  and mobile terminal  are also equipped with proximity connection capability to facilitate communication via link . Proximity link  may be represented by a Bluetooth, WLAN, IR, or other proximity communication link as required by the particular application.","PC  and mobile terminal  are interconnected through rich call infrastructure  via path . PC  is equipped with a keyhole framing application as discussed above in relation to . Such a keyhole framing application allows video data to be exchanged between PC  and mobile terminal , such that the images captured by mobile terminal  and subsequently transferred to PC  via Bluetooth connection  may be streamed to mobile terminal  via rich call path .","In order to ultimately create the virtual meeting, voice path  is created as a call from mobile terminal  to mobile terminal . A user of mobile terminal , for example, may invoke his buddy list in order to locate the identification number associated with mobile terminal . Once located, a voice call is initiated by mobile terminal  to mobile terminal  to establish voice connection . Once a connection is established, a second call is placed by PC  to mobile terminal  to establish streaming path . PC  is executing the keyhole framing application which has been configured to: capture imaging data received from mobile terminal  via proximity connection ; format\/render the data in accordance with capabilities associated with mobile terminal ; and stream the rendered data to mobile terminal  for subsequent display. Once communication paths  and  have been constructed, the virtual video conference may commence as planned.","A third communication path  may then be established via rich call infrastructure , such that a second video stream may be established between PC  and mobile terminal . Communication path  is configured to allow files to be shared between meeting group  and the senior production manager, as discussed in relation to  above, in order to facilitate the video conference. As such, any file that may be communicated between PC  and mobile terminal  may be simultaneously viewed by meeting group  via PC  and by the senior production manager via the display of mobile terminal . Thus, the senior production manager is actively involved with the virtual meeting through the combination of voice call  and video streams  and , whereby video streams  and  are selectively toggled onto the display of mobile terminal  by using keypad, pointing device, or voice commands from mobile terminal . The senior production manager may then communicate edit commands associated with the shared file to meeting group  via call  for subsequent input by meeting group . Alternatively, the senior production manager may insert his own edit commands into the shared file directly from mobile terminal . In either case, the result of the edit commands are simultaneously viewed by meeting group  via the display of PC  and viewed by the senior production manager via the display of mobile terminal  in accordance with the present invention.","It should be noted that other sources of rich call data  may be exchanged with mobile terminal , while mobile terminal  interacts with calls -. Other meeting groups, for example, located in different locations than meeting group  may also provide voice\/data to mobile terminal  to supplement the virtual meeting. In such an instance, mobile terminal  is able to simultaneously receive all voice communications in full duplex mode, while maintaining the ability to toggle between multiple video feeds , , and .","Flow diagram  of  illustrates an exemplary method in accordance with the principles of the present invention. In step , a voice connection is established, as discussed above in relation to , between a hardware platform and a mobile terminal. In step , the desirability to activate a keyhole frame is determined by the hardware platform. If a keyhole frame is desired, then a user of the hardware platform, e.g., PC, PDA, or other computing device, formats the frame size, resolution, etc. to conform with the capabilities\/desires of the mobile terminal as in step .
