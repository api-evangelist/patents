No. 61\/018,883 titled \u201cPRESENTATION OF ORGANIZED PERSONAL AND PUBLIC DATA USING COMMUNICATION MEDIUMS,\u201d filed on Jan. 3, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The subject matter of this application is generally related to electronic messaging (e.g., \u201cemail\u201d).","Electronic messaging systems can be used to transmit information between users. Content can include the body of a message along with one or more attachments. Conventional messaging systems provide few organizational tools for presenting information associated with an attachment. For example, a conventional messaging system such as Yahoo\u00ae mail can be used to display attachments without the need to open or display the underlying message in which the attachment was received.","In some implementations, email may be organized and navigated by attachments. In these implementations, email may be navigated and organized by chronological list of emails. An attachment may be selected and metadata associated with the attachment may be displayed including, but are not limited to, related attachments, related people, related conversations, revision history and the like.","In some implementations, attachment profile may be displayed based off implicit user actions such as, for example, viewing an email that contains an attachment or opening an attachment. When an email containing an attachment is opened or an attachment is opened through a native application, an attachment profile may be automatically displayed which may provide context to the attachment.","In some implementations, an attachment to an email message may be identified. Metadata associated with the attachment also may be identified that may include information selected from a group comprising related attachments, related people, related conversations or revision histories. The attachment and the metadata may be stored in an searchable database.","In some implementations, content on a web page that is linked to or from within an email may be identified. In some implementations, the content in a searchable database may be aggregated. In some implementations, an action of a user that relates to the content in the searchable database may be identified. In some implementations, the related content may be retrieved and the retrieved content may be presented to the user.","In some implementations, a time period in which one or more messages are to be monitored may be identified. One or more user actions of a user associated with the one or more messages may be monitored. Training data based on the one or more monitored user actions may be developed. One or more subsequent messages may be presented to the user based on the training data.","In some implementations, a computer-readable medium may be provided. The computer-readable medium may include instructions stored thereon, which, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to perform operations comprising: displaying a sidebar tool to facilitate a selection of an message attachment information view and a personal profile information view; displaying content associated with one or more message attachments when the message attachment information is selected; and displaying personal or public data of one or more users associated with the one or more message attachments when the personal profile information view is selected.","In some implementations, attachment profiles may be displayed alongside emails, such as in implementations which utilize sidebar, or alongside attachment content in various applications such as, for example, Microsoft\u00ae Word, Adobe Acrobat\u00ae, in a web browser such as Firefox\u00ae and the like.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","As used herein, the term \u201cparticipant\u201d refers to a user of the described system. As used herein, the term \u201csubject\u201d refers to the sender, receiver, creator, or subject of a communication medium. As used herein, the term \u201cinformation viewer\u201d includes any method to display personal and public data.","The following sections describe ways to manage, search, and browse attachments and integrate such information with external communication systems as well as methods for collaborating on the development of attachment materials.","In some implementations, the participant may view comprehensive profile and content information concerning an email attachment using an attachment information viewer or other viewers capable of receiving and presenting such information to the participant. The participant may view the email attachment information and the person profile information on a same computing system or platform. The participant may switch between the person profile view and the email attachment information view if desired. In some implementations, the participant may utilize a sidebar tool which allows the participant to switch between the email attachment information and the person profile view within the sidebar tool.","In some implementations, the participant may execute the email attachment information view using one of the following example techniques. One of ordinary skill would appreciate that other techniques also may be used. Such techniques include, but are not limited to: (1) selecting an email attachment that is associated with a subject's person profile, and launching using an email attachment information viewer; (2) hovering over the file attached to an email in the email viewer, and launching using an email attachment information viewer; (3) executing a search query from within the system's search mechanism for attachments, selecting an attachment from the search results and launching using an email attachment information viewer through the selected attachment; (4) executing a search query from within a third party system such as, for example, a desktop search system, an online search system, a web-based email application, an enterprise search system, an enterprise document management system, an online document management system, an enterprise resource planning system, a customer relationship management system, a social networking system or other systems with search mechanisms capable of leveraging the email attachment search mechanism through an integration mechanism such as, but is not limited to, Application Programming interfaces (API's) or Web Services provided by this system; selecting an email attachment from the search results; and launching using an email attachment information viewer or other viewers; (5) browsing a categorized list of all email attachments residing on a participant's email client or email server; selecting an email attachment from the search results; and launching using an email attachment information viewer or other viewers; and (6) browsing a categorized list of files (including email attachments) returned by a third party system such as, for example, a desktop browse system, or an enterprise data browse system, an enterprise document management system, an online document management system, an enterprise resource planning system, a customer relationship management system, a social networking system, other systems with browse mechanisms capable of leveraging an email attachment browse mechanism through an integration mechanism such as, but is not limited to, Application Programming interfaces (API's) or Web Services provided by this system; selecting the document from the browse results; and launching using an email attachment information viewer or other viewers. In other implementations, the participant may search and browse email attachments, persons (i.e. subjects) and the like on the same system. One such implementation of the system is the sidebar implementation.","In some implementations, using the email attachment information viewer (or other viewers that may receive and present the same information), the participant may, but is not limited to: (1) view a thumbnail that represents the content of an attachment where a content viewer may be launched to preview the content (as will be discussed further below under the section \u201cEmail Attachment Content Viewer\u201d); (2) explore when an attachment was first sent or received; (3) determine from whom or to whom an attachment was first received or sent to; (4) view a list of emails containing an attachment; (5) view when an attachment was last viewed and opened by a participant; (5) view the mime type of an attachment (e.g., PDF, JPEG, Word document, MP3, WAV, etc.); (6) view the size of an attachment; (7) view a thumbnail of an attachment; (8) view the name of the author of an attachment; (9) view a textual description of an attachment; (10) view whether the attachment has been scanned for known computer viruses; (11) view other pertinent information unique to an attachment's mime type; and (12) view information about the local repository, network repository or online repository from which an attachment was sent or created.","In some implementations, a participant may view summary information related to an email attachment by, without limitation: (1) hovering over an email attachment in an email client's email content viewer to allow a window to be populated for displaying summary information associated with the email attachment; (2) hovering over an email attachment in the person profile viewer to allow a window to be populated for displaying summary information associated with the email attachment; (3) hovering over an email attachment in the search results set returned by the system's search mechanism to allow a window to be populated for displaying summary information associated with the email attachment; (4) hovering over an email attachment in the search results set returned by a third party system such as, without limitation, a desktop search system, an online search system, an enterprise search system, an enterprise document management system, an online document management system, an enterprise resource planning system, a customer relationship management system, a social networking system or other systems with search mechanisms to allow a window to be populated for displaying summary information associated with the email attachment; and (5) hovering over an email attachment in the browse results set returned by the system or a third party system such as, without limitation, a desktop browse system, an enterprise data browse system, an enterprise document management system, an online document management system, an enterprise resource planning system, a customer relationship management system, a social networking system, or other systems with search mechanisms to allow a window to be populated for displaying summary information associated with the email attachment.","In some implementations, when a participant receives an email attachment, the participant may view which subject or person sent it, and which other subject(s) or persons received the same email attachment. In these implementations, the system also may indicate to the participant whether the sending and receiving subjects or persons are internal or external to the participant's group or organization. The participant may click on a subject or person to switch to a person profile view. In the person profile view, the participant may view an email conversation (or email thread) that has taken place that is related to the email attachment. Additionally, the participant may click a \u201cPrint\u201d action mechanism to command the system to consolidate and print emails or threads related to the conversation.","In other implementations, a participant may click a \u201cForward Conversation\u201d action mechanism to command the system to consolidate emails or threads (e.g., including attachments) related to the conversation into a single email, and forward the consolidated emails or threads to other subjects or persons.","Yet in other implementations, a participant may view a list of other email attachments that are related to an email attachment. In these implementations, an attachment-to-attachment relationship may be established explicitly by the participant or implicitly by the system based on, without limitation, the following qualifiers or relationship types: (1) manually designating that two or more email attachments are related; (2) email attachments that are part of an email conversation or thread; (3) email attachments having similar content; (4) email attachments that were attached to the same email; (5) email attachments that have the same content author; and (6) email attachments that were sent by the same subject.","A participant also may view a list of files containing similar content residing on the Internet such as, without limitation, web pages, web sites, Wikipedia\u00ae, online blogs, online document management systems, social networking systems, online video streaming and repository systems, online image repositories, e-commerce sites, governmental agencies (e.g., Library of Congress) and the like. The participant also may view a to-do list of items, instant messaging conversations, calendar events, phone call logs, web conferencing transcripts and recordings related to an attachment.  shows an example attachment view  of people , messaging conversations , and email attachments .","In some implementations, a participant may search for email attachments using the system's search mechanism. The system's search mechanism may return one or more persons (or subjects), emails, web search results, and email attachment matches to the participant. The participant may enter one or more search keywords or phrases into the system, and the system may perform a search based on the input queries for email attachments containing matching metadata (e.g., subject, sender, title, etc), content, summary information and the like. The participant may optionally restrict a search for email attachments by specifying, without limitation: (1) a date range in which an email attachment was received or sent; (2) a subject or person who sent or received the attachment; (3) an attachment mime type or file name extension; and (4) a voting status (as will be discussed in greater detail below in \u201cEmail Attachment Collaboration\u201d).","A participant may browse for email attachments that have been categorized by the following dimensions, such as, without limitation, the subject(s) who sent it or who received it (additional qualification may include the subject(s) listed as high-priority or very important), the external organization (i.e. partner or customer organization) that originated it (additional qualification may include the organization(s) listed as high-priority or very important), user generated tags used to describe the attachment, the department or sub-organization that originated the attachment for attachments originated from internal groups (additional qualification may include the department(s) listed as high-priority or very important), attachment mime type, date range (e.g. received less than 2 days ago, less than 1 week ago, less than 1 month ago, etc.), attachment size, voting status and number of recipients.","A participant may view a thumbnail of the attachment on the email attachment information view. The thumbnails may be displayed for the following file types including, without limitation, a thumbnail image of the first page of a textual attachment (e.g. Word, TXT, HTML, XML etc), a thumbnail image of an image attachment (e.g. JPEG, GIF, TIF etc), a thumbnail image of the first page of a Power point attachment, a thumbnail image of an icon to represent an audio file (e.g. RAM, WAV, MP3 etc) which the system can show a different icon for each different audio file type, and a thumbnail image of a frame from the video file (e.g. AVI, FLV, GVI, WMV, MOV, etc.).","In some implementations, when the participant hover over a thumbnail in the email attachment information view, a window is populated with an enlarged view of the thumbnail. In these implementations, a sample of the content may be automatically displayed on the enlarged pop-up. For example, an abbreviated \u201cslideshow\u201d of different pages of the textual attachment may be presented. As another example, an image may be rendered at its original size and aspect ratio. As yet another example, an abbreviated \u201cslideshow\u201d of different pages of the power point attachment may be presented. As yet another example, a snippet from an audio file may be played. As yet another example, a short segment of a video file can be played. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that other implementations in addition to those discussed above also are contemplated.","In some implementations, the participant may hit a \u201cPlay\u201d or \u201cView\u201d action mechanism which may launch a content viewer. In this viewer, the participant may page through a slideshow view of a textual attachment (or set the slideshow to run automatically), or view an image attachment in its original size and aspect ratio. Additionally, the participant may zoom in and out of a specific portion(s) of an image, page through a slideshow view of a power point attachment (or set the slideshow to run automatically), listen to an audio file or watch a video which may allow the participant to go to a specific segment of the audio or video file for immediate playback.","In some implementations, the participant may select two or more email attachments and perform a document comparison on the system (without having to download the attachments and to open a separate document comparison application). In these implementations, the system may integrate with document comparison applications to provide document comparison capabilities natively in the system.","In some implementations, the participant may view an email conversation (or email thread) that has taken place that is related to an email attachment. The participant may click a \u201cPrint\u201d action mechanism and the system may consolidate and print the emails or threads in the conversation. The participant also may click a \u201cForward Conversation\u201d action mechanism and the system may consolidate the emails or threads related to a conversation into a single email, and forward the consolidated emails or threads containing the emails and attachments to other subjects or persons. The participant also may view an email conversation related to a document residing in other document collaboration systems. This may be achieved through a data integration between the system and these other document collaboration systems.","In some implementations, the participant may view an email attachment's collaboration history in this system's email attachment's information view. This attachment collaboration history may be captured by this system. The system may piece together the collaboration history of an attachment based on, for example, an analysis of the attachment's metadata, content changes, tracking of the copies of the attachment that was sent out to other subjects, and comparison of the attachment's content with similar documents residing in other repositories. This collaboration history may include, but is not limited to, change tracking (e.g., who made the revisions and when were the revisions made), document comparison (e.g., what change(s) were made relative to an earlier version), and document trail (e.g., whether there is a first version, an immediate version or final version of a document). The participant generally may view a visual representation of this document trail.","In some implementations, the participant may view an email attachment collaboration history in the system that was captured by other document collaboration systems. This may be achieved through a data and security integration between the system and these other document collaboration systems.","In some implementations, the participant may view who has received this attachment and which other subjects or persons have access to one or more files (e.g., as defined in document collaboration, content management system, and other collaboration and file repository systems) but who may not have received the file(s) over email. This may be achieved through a data and security integration between the system and these other systems.","In some implementations, the participant sending out an email attachment may request a vote or rating from one or more receiving subjects about the email attachment. The vote or rating may include, without limitation, \u201cAccept\u201d a document, \u201cReject\u201d a document, \u201cHighly Recommend it\u201d, \u201cHate it\u201d, \u201cLukewarm about it\u201d.","In some implementations, the participant and subjects or persons may comment on an email attachment. These comments may become visible to all subjects or persons who received the attachment. These subjects may view the comments together with, for example, the comment's date, author, parent and child relationships (e.g. a comment, \u201cthe child\u201d may be in response to another comment, \u201cthe parent\u201d). Alternatively, the participant or subject who created the comment(s) may choose to only display the comments to subjects internal or external to the organization, or only to specific\/named subjects or persons. Comments also may be visible in other document collaboration, content management, file repository, and collaboration systems. In an event that the recipients receiving such an attachment containing comments and\/or shared notes do not use this system, the comments may be appended to the email containing the email attachment so that such recipients may still view the comments and\/or shared notes.","In some implementations, the system may automatically distribute and synchronize email attachments to enterprise applications, enterprise systems and content management systems such as, without limitation, Enterprise content management systems, Desktop content management systems, Enterprise file server or repository systems, Enterprise application systems (e.g., deployed on-premise or hosted by a third party provider) such as, for example, Customer Relationship Management systems, Digital Asset Management systems, Enterprise Resource Planning systems, Product Data Management systems, Product Lifecycle Management systems, Supply Chain Management systems, Product Information Management systems, Marketing Automation systems, Product Management and Product Planning systems, and Project Management (PM) systems and the like, Online document repository, document sharing, collaboration sites, and Peer-to-peer and online document collaboration systems.","In some implementations, the participant may launch a web conferencing session directly from the system and the system may automatically upload the selected email attachment(s) onto the web conferencing session. In these implementations, web conference session related message board messages, voting results, notes, visual transcripts, audio transcripts and other related conference generated artifacts supported by the web conference system may be automatically uploaded or downloaded and associated with an email attachment. After a web conference, attendees may receive an email containing one or more file(s) that was (were) discussed, and the associated conference information (e.g., as described in the previous bullet) also may be received and presented appropriately (e.g., properly associated with the email attachment) to the subject by the system.","In some implementations, if the conference leader launches the session directly from the web conference system and uploads the document(s) from a desktop or other document repository system, the conference leader and the attendees may still receive an email containing the document(s) and the associated conference information as described previously after the conference session has ended. This information may be presented appropriately (e.g., properly associated with the email attachment) to the subject by the system.","In some implementations, the participant may create an email and save it as a draft document that may be circulated around to multiple subjects to be worked on as a work-in-process document. This supports collaborative email content creation.","In some implementations, the system may provide a locking mechanism which requires a subject or the participant to \u201ccheck out and lock\u201d the document while he or she is editing the document. In these implementations, others trying to access this document may view the document but may not edit the document until the subject or participant checks the document back in and releases the lock.","In some implementations, the participant and subject(s) may add comments or shared notes to the draft email for others to view.","In some implementations, the system may allow the participant and subject(s) to indicate that he or she is done either reviewing the document or have no more edits to make to the document. This can help the participant to know when the draft document is \u201ccompleted\u201d and is ready to be sent out to the appropriate subjects.","In some implementations, the subjects that receive the completed\/final email may view the list of people who were involved in creating the content in the email.","In some implementations, when the draft email is still in the work-in-process state, the participant and subject(s) may invite others to take part in the creation of the content.","In some implementations, the system may indicate which subjects are internal or external to the organization.","In some implementations, the system may provide the ability to the participant to define different levels\/types of access to the different subjects involved in the collaboration.","In some implementations, once an email has been completed, in addition to sending the email out to designated recipients, the participant may also publish the contents of the email to, without limitation, external websites, intranet sites, Wikipedia\u00ae sites, online blog sites, content management systems, online document repositories, online document sharing and collaboration sites, and peer-to-peer and online document collaboration systems.","In some implementations, the participant may synchronize email attachments to project management or task management systems. The participant also may associate an email attachment to a participant created task in the system. The system may automatically associate received email attachments to tasks based on, without limitation, file metadata including, for example, file naming conventions (e.g. all documents with \u201c_ProductLaunch2008\u201d as part of its filename are associated to a 2008 Product Launch Task), file descriptions, file keywords, and file mime type, subject(s) who sent the attachment (e.g. all email attachments received from Vendor ABC is related to the Product Sourcing Task), and email content and machine training\/learning (e.g., over time the system learns that the existence of certain keywords in an email delivering the document attachment results in the attachment being associated with certain task(s)). In these implementations, the participant may search and browse for all email attachments related to one or more tasks.","In some implementations, other systems may send and receive data, conduct transactions, synchronize security access and documents related to email attachments with this system through a set of published Application Programming Interfaces (API's) and Web Services. These other systems may include, but are not limited to, enterprise content management systems, desktop content management systems, enterprise file server systems, enterprise application systems (deployed on-premise or hosted by a third party provider) such as customer relationship management systems, digital asset management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, product data management systems, product lifecycle management systems, supply chain management systems, product information management systems, marketing automation systems, product management and product planning systems, and project management (PM) systems, online document repository, document sharing and collaboration sites, peer-to-peer document collaboration systems, enterprise and online search systems, enterprise and online content tagging systems, enterprise and online content recommendation systems, and email analytical and forensic systems.","In some implementations, content existing on the web which is linked to from within an email or other communication medium may be aggregated and treated as a personal knowledge base. In these implementations, content from these web pages may be searched by the participant or be displayed to the participant based on implicit user actions such as looking at an email sent by someone who has sent the participant hyperlinks in past communications.","In some implementations, when a participant searches a personal knowledge base (based on content behind hyperlinks), the system may also display results which exist outside of the personal knowledge base but may be accessible through a standard web search engine.","In some implementations, when a participant searches the web using a standard web search engine, the system may use the same keywords to automatically provide search results from the personal hyperlinked knowledge base.","In some implementations, since the content behind hyperlinks is constantly changing, the system may distinguish between the content that existed on the hyperlinked webpage when the hyperlink was initially sent or received as well as what exists on the hyperlinked webpage at the current time.","In some implementations, when searching the personal knowledge base, the content that is being searched may include, for example, the body of the message a hyperlink was sent with, and the result may display both the matching body text as well as the content behind the attending hyperlink.","In general, hyperlink referenced website content may be presented through search or implicit user actions. The content of the information is discovered and created by analyzing all the hyperlinks sent or received via email, IM, or other electronic medium. The content (web pages) on the web referenced by these hyperlinks is crawled by the system and stored. Alternative to crawling the content itself, the system may fetch information about the content of the pages from a remote provider serving content. This may be useful for speeding up crawling, minimizing the number of outbound connections. Also, the content may already be preprocessed or compressed by the provider to save local processing time or transmission time and storage space.","In some implementations, stored with the content of the web pages may include the metadata associated with the source of the hyperlink including, without limitation, the body text of the email, subject, sender, recipient, email date, carbon-copied recipients, attachments and the like. This information may be presented alongside search results matching words in email bodies, results matching people's names, or content matching keywords on the web.","In one implementation, the system may include some or all of the following features: the system may present relevant hyperlinked web data with content matching keywords that are typed in a search box; the system may present relevant hyperlinked web data with content matching keywords ranked using techniques such as term frequency, or TF-IDF (Term frequency\u2014inverse document frequency) where additional relevant results may be obtained by using a thesaurus or employing techniques such as LSI (latent semantic indexing) and presented automatically when viewing a body of text; the results of keyword searches in the hyperlinked web page content database may be presented alongside search results for the greater web; advertisements may be placed in, next to, or near hyperlinked web page search results based on the keywords used to search the hyperlinked web page content; and metadata associated with a hyperlinked web data result may be presented as part of the search result. This data may include, for example, the name of the person who sent the hyperlink referencing this data, the person who received it, when it was sent, how it was sent, who else received it, etc.","In some implementations, the system may find some or all of the hyperlinks in a corpus of communication text including, for example, email, instant messaging and online chat.","In some implementations, the hyperlinks may be followed by the system to extract the content existing on the web.","In some implementations, the content from the web may be crawled and the textual information may be indexed. In these implementations, the web may be crawled in real time as the content behind hyperlinks may be dynamic and may change since last indexing. Alternatively, the web may be crawled synchronously at a predefined interval.","In some implementations, a crawling and subsequent indexing occur during the first time a communication corpus is pointed at the system. The indexing and crawling may be redone at the users' discretion or automatically at some interval or based on other factors.","In some implementations, new hyperlinks sent or received may be followed and indexed as the links are received or at regular intervals.","In some implementations, text from web pages may be displayed when keywords matching search keywords are found in the text of a webpage. In these implementations, the matching webpage text may be presented with associated metadata such as, for example, the website name, time of last updating, time of last indexing, author of the email containing the hyperlink, date the hyperlink was sent, etc. In one implementation, the webpage text matches may be displayed alongside email text matches, contact name or address matches, regular web search engine result matches and the like.","In some implementations, the system may display visual cues before an email is sent to inform the participant of one, some or all of the individuals who may receive any given email. As an example, after a user clicks \u201creply all\u201d, writes a response, and sends the email, but before the message is actually sent, a list of pictures of the designated recipients may be displayed to the participant. This may be accomplished to reduce the number of unintended recipients on any given email. In one implementation, the list of recipient pictures may be displayed at anytime during the composition of a message after the recipient's email address has been entered.","In some implementations, the system may pull image information from different sources and associate the image information with a subject's person profile. Such sources may include, but is not limited to, social networking web sites, professional networking web sites, people search and information web sites, image submitted by the subject or the participant, employee directory systems and the like.","In some implementations, when the participant chooses a list of email recipients, the system renders a view to show the images of the recipients to provide a visual check for the participant to ensure that there are no unintended recipients on the list. One such implementation of a recipient image view may include a system side bar, but the system is not limited to such an implementation. If a recipient is an email group list, then a group icon may be shown instead of a person's image or an image of each person in the group may be displayed.","In some implementations, the system may require that the participant confirm each image as an intended recipient of the email prior to allowing the email client to send the message. The participant may confirm a recipient by clicking an indicator next to the recipient's image. In these implementations, the recipient image view may, for example, indicate which recipients are internal and external to the participant's organization, indicating which recipients are \u201chighly sensitive\u201d recipients (as defined by the user) (e.g., if the recipient list includes the CEO of a company, then the image view indicates to the participant that the CEO is part of the recipient list), or indicating which recipients are email group lists.","In some implementations, the system also may suggest other people the participant may want to include on an email. For example, if the recipient has an assistant carbon-copied on 80% of the emails he sends or receives, the system may recommend to the participant that he include the assistant in the CC field. This recommendation may be made when the original recipient's email address is entered into the \u201cTO:\u201d field or prior to sending the message. The additional suggested recipients may be displayed using pictures of the recipients or by listing their names.","In some implementations, the system may integrate a participant's work and personal email clients\/accounts. When the system resides on a participant's work email client (e.g. Microsoft Outlook\u00ae client), it may provide an information feed from the participant's personal email client (e.g., Gmail\u00ae) to let the participant know he has received emails on his personal email client or give the participant access to historical communication data. The data from these multiple locations may be aggregated and be displayed together as part of the person profile (e.g., recent attachments shows all recent attachments sent from Jane to the participant's gmail account and their Outlook account). The data from these disparate sources may also be kept separate but made accessible within the same information display such as in implementations which utilize a sidebar. The information display may be stand alone or integrated with a particular email client or communication application (e.g., instant messaging, webmail, etc.). One example may include a web browser extension where the information display appears when the user enters the web address of an associated web mail account. The same data that is accessible through an information display in a desktop email client would then be visible when using a webmail interface.","In some implementations, the system may provide, without limitation, the following information together with an email attachment: subject title of email, sender, date and time sent, preview of the content in an email, a list of people related to a subject, contact information for a subject and the like. In some implementations, these information also may be displayed in other desktop applications or in a web browser so the participant may easily request information from the system while using these other applications.","In some implementations, content from the system may be automatically displayed when content from a webpage or application relates to content stored in the system. As an example, a participant visits the blog of Matt Smith, and the system recognizes the name of the author from the text of the webpage or from associating a person in the system with a specific web address (e.g., Matt Smith's signature always contains the blog's web address). The system may then provide information about the participant's relationship with the author such as \u201cyou haven't emailed Matt in 2 weeks\u201d, \u201cThe last conversation you had with Matt was . . . \u201d, \u201cMatt is currently available online using Skype\u201d, \u201cYou and Matt have  friends in common on Facebook\u201d, etc.","In some implementations, the system may extract web URL's present in emails received from a subject and add the extracted URL's to the subject's person profile information view.","In some implementations, the system may rank the URL's based on the frequency of occurrence in the emails received from the subject. In other implementations, the system may rank the URL based on the uniqueness of a URL as it relates to multiple URL's in an email or in all emails received from a subject.","In some implementations, the participant may update the list of web URL's associated to a subject. Alternatively, the participant may update the list of web URL's associated to his own system person profile.","In some implementations, the participant may hover over a web URL associated to a subject, and the system will automatically create a pop-up to let the participant preview the content related to the URL. In these implementations, previewing allows the participant to view, for example, without limitation, a web page, a \u201cslideshow\u201d of different pages of the textual document, an image with its original size and aspect ratio, an abbreviated \u201cslideshow\u201d of different pages of the Power point document, or play an audio file, an video file, a streaming video and the like. In addition, the system may use a thumbnail to represent the web URL. This thumbnail may include, without limitation, the homepage of a company webpage or a web site, the latest entry in a blog, a static frame of an online video, an online advertisement, a subject's social network or professional network public page and the like. If desired, the participant may hover over the thumbnail to launch a preview of the URL content.","In some implementations, email status may be automatically determined from the activity of a user of the system. In these implementations, status indicators may indicate, without limitations, the number of emails a participant has sent or received during a time window, whether the participant has checked his email, whether the recipient has moved his mouse or entered keystrokes during a time period, the response time of the recipient to emails during a time window and the like.","In some implementations, the participant using the system may publish his\/her current status to other subjects using the system. In these implementations, the participant's status may be visible only to other subjects who may be connected to the participant by, for example, emails exchanged in the past over the current email client or other email clients, a connection on professional networking site, a connection on social networking sites, membership to the same online group, a connection on a instant messaging system and an explicit system connection manually created between the participant and the subject.","In some implementations, the status information may be defined by the system. For example, the status information may include, without limitation, busy, away from the computer, out of the office, in a meeting, out of town, returning on \u201cdate DD\/MM\/YYYY\u201d, and computer generated statistics about the participant's email activity (e.g., \u201cMatt has sent 10 messages in the last hour\u201d, \u201cMatt hasn't sent or read a message in 2 days\u201d, etc.) and the like.","In other implementations, the status information may be defined by the participant or free text entered by the participant. In these implementations, the participant may choose to hide status information from specific\/named subject(s) participants even though the participant and the subject(s) may be connected. Status information also may be subject-specific. For example, for subject Matt, Adam's status is \u201cAvailable\u201d, but for everyone else, Adam's status is \u201cBusy\u201d. Alternatively, status information may be subject-specific and automatically generated by the system. For example, the following information may be automatically generated by the system when a subject tries to reach a participant named \u201cAamir\u201d: \u201cYou've been trying to reach Aamir, and he has 10 unanswered emails from you. He's currently going through his emails and we expect that he will reply to your email soon\/in less than 1 hr\u201d.","In some implementations, the system may show a subject's status on a social networking website or instant messenger or some other system that allows a user to set and show a sharable status. This may be achieved through an integration between this system and those other systems.","In some implementations, the status messages may be displayed continuously in a list of the subject's top contacts, status messages may be displayed next the name of a person when the subject looks at an email from them, or the status message may be displayed when the subject enters the person's email address in the compose window of an email message.","In some implementations, the status message may have configurable \u201ccalls to action\u201d. For example, when composing an email to Matt, the status message may be set up to say: \u201cI'm going to be out of town until July 15, set a reminder to contact me on July 15by clicking here\u201d or \u201c . . . delay the sending of this message until July 15by clicking here\u201d.","In implementations in which a sender and a recipient are using the status message system, a sender may compose messages that would not be sent until some predetermined action has taken place on the recipient's system (e.g., upon the notification from the system that a participant is at his\/her computer, the participant switches a status from one state \u201cbusy\u201d to another state \u201cavailable\u201d, the participant sends more than 10 message in one hour, or the participant reads more than 10 messages in one hour).","In some implementations, the system may provide a side bar implementation of a payment, banking, and remittance information viewer and transaction support console.","In some implementations, an email address may act as a unique identifier for a payment and remittance system.","In other implementations, two or more individuals using the system may make payments between the systems without having to enter any additional login or credentials. In these implementations, payments may be made between systems without sending an email or encrypted payment information is sent in an file attached to an email which is recognized by the recipient's system and converted to a withdrawal or payment of funds. If a recipient receives a payment or payment request and isn't a user of the system, the recipient may be sent a hyperlink to a webpage where payments may be made and received.","In some implementations, the participant may view information related to online payment, online banking, and remittance information related to one or more subjects. For example, the participant may, without limitation: (1) view a list of online payment, online banking, and remittance systems that a subject uses; (2) view the preferred payment system(s) that the subject uses; (3) view the list of outstanding invoices or remittance requests received from and sent to the subject, (4) view the list of completed and pending payments and remittances that were made to or received from the subject; (5) view the total amount of payments sent to or received from a subject; (6) view the total amount of remittances sent to or received from a subject; (7) search and sort lists (where appropriate) based on, for example, viewing a list over a date range specified by the participant, sorting through a list by, but not limited to, date, amount, payment processing system, processing status, and sorting by transaction category or type; and (8) search for subjects based on, for example, subjects who have yet to make payments on invoices or sent money to fulfill remittance requests sent by the participant, subjects whom the participant has received outstanding invoices from or remittance requests from, subjects whom the participant has paid money or remitted money to, subjects who have in total (or over a period of time) paid or remitted money to the participant beyond a certain amount, and\/or subjects who have total outstanding invoices or unfulfilled remittance requests beyond a certain amount.","In some implementations, an online payment, online banking, and remittance system account information dashboard may be included. Through the dashboard, a participant may, without limitation: (1) view account related information with online payment, online banking, and remittance systems account on this system; (2) view the list of completed and pending money transfers (deposits and withdrawals) to the participant's accounts with online payment, online banking, and remittance systems; (3) view the participant's account balances with online payment, online banking, and remittance systems; (4) view, search and sort lists (where appropriate) including a list of system accounts sorted by account balances, a list of system account sorted by online system name and a list of system accounts sorted by system type (e.g. payment system, banking system, remittance system, etc.).","In some implementations, the participant may conduct transactions supported by online payment, online banking, and remittance systems. These transactions may include, but are not limited to, transferring money to and from their accounts, making payments and remitting money to others, creating and sending invoices and remittance requests to others, and buying and selling investment instruments.","In some implementations, in order to support online payments, online banking and remittance transactions in the system, the system may support data, transaction and security integration with third party systems including, but not limited to, online payment systems, online banking systems, online money remittance systems and peer-to-peer lending systems. In these implementations, the system also may support a set of published Application Programming Interfaces (API's) and Web Services to enable these integrations.","In some implementation, the system may be extended to mobile phones to enhance existing email clients associated with the mobile phones.","In some implementations, a mobile version of the system may be used to facilitate multi-object search and browse for emails, people and attachments on existing mobile email clients. Participant may launch the system search mechanism directly from the existing phone email client or as a separate application on the phone.","In some implementations, a mobile version of the system may be used to extract, relate and present threaded conversations and people information on existing mobile email clients. The participant may switch to this system's information view directly from the email client's email content viewer by clicking on this system's icon on the email or selecting the appropriate menu option (to launch this system) on the email client while viewing the email.","In some implementations, these existing email clients may include, but are not limited to, flurry email clients, MovaMail clients and Google\u00ae and Yahoo\u00ae Mobile email clients.","In some implementations, contact information extracted from emails by the system may be synchronized with the phone's personal information management system or third party mobile product information management systems.","In some implementation, the system also may be extended to mobile phones to enhance existing Smart phone and PDA phone email clients.","In some implementation, a mobile version of the system may be used to facilitate multi-object search and browse for emails, people and attachments on existing smart phone and PDA phone mobile email clients. Participant may launch the system mechanism directly from the existing phone email client or as a separate application on the phone.","In some implementation, a mobile version of the system may be used to extract, relate and present threaded conversation, people, attachment, and contact information on existing smart phone and PDA phone mobile clients. The participant may switch to this system's information view directly from the email client's email content viewer by clicking on this system's icon on the email or selecting the appropriate menu option (to launch this system) on the email client while viewing the email.","In these implementation, existing email clients may include, but are not limited to, Blackberry\u00ae email clients, Motorola\u00ae Good clients, Palm Treo\u00ae email clients, Apple\u00ae iPhone email clients, Windows\u00ae Mobile email clients and Google\u00ae and Yahoo\u00ae Mobile email clients.","In some implementation, contact information extracted from emails by the system may be synchronized with the phone's personal information management system or third party mobile product information management systems.","In some implementation, the system may integrate with Blackberry enterprise server edition for Microsoft\u00ae Exchange, Lotus\u00ae Notes Domino, Novell\u00ae Groupwise to support the synchronization of Xobni\u00ae extracted information between the mobile and desktop clients. The system may also integrate with the enterprise\/server editions of the Motorola\u00ae Good product suite.","In some implementation, the system may include its own data synchronization methods to ensure that desktop email clients are synchronized with mobile email clients. This applies to participants who are leveraging the enterprise\/server editions of the Blackberry\u00ae or Motorola\u00ae Good product suites.","In some implementation, the system may include keyword search. The participant may search for people or keywords from their electronic communication mediums. Selecting a people result may pull up a person profile. The participant may use this to quickly view recent email conversations with the subject, recent appointments with the subject, a list of people related to the subject, contact information for the subject, attachments related to the subject, etc.","In some implementation, the keyword search may also be used to display keyword search matches from a communication medium corpus such as email, IM, transcribed voice calls, etc.","In some implementation, the searches for people or keywords may be done on the client mobile device using a local data store and processor or done on a webserver with a remote data store where the results transmitted back to the mobile device.","In some implementation, the system may analyze emails in an email store that resides on a local email client, network server or an online email server to identify key attributes, habits, associations, activity profiles, current email client used and other relevant information about the participant and related subjects to enable advertisement targeting.","In some implementation, the system may create profile groups made up of anonymous participants whom advertisers may target advertisements at without revealing the identity of the participants. These profile groups may be created based on requirements dictated by the advertiser.","In some implementation, advertising effectiveness may be measured and different pricing models may be supported based on, without limitation, the number of impressions, the number of click-throughs, pay-per-action, pay-per-lead and other advertising metrics. In these implementations, the system also may support different pricing levels based on, but are not limited to, the time of day, the number of participants online at a specific time of day.","In some implementation, the system may analyze a participant's email content and actions (e.g. clicking on web links and time spent on those website) to build a profile of the participant. Based on this profile, the system finds subjects with similar profiles, determines the most frequent content, websites and products collectively viewed\/accessed\/bought by these subjects, and then recommends these top content and web sites to the participant.","In some implementation, the system may leverage Collaborative Internet Discovery networks and Recommendations Engines like, but not limited to, those provided by Aggregate Knowledge, Inc. and Loomia, Inc., to recommend content, websites and products to the participant.","In some implementation, the system may provide a set of Application Programming Interfaces (API's) and Web services to allow other relevant systems to perform a set of activities on the system and the participant's communication information store (e.g., email, IM, social network data, etc.). These activities include, but are not limited: (1) querying and analyzing the participant's email store and system information (e.g., who they sent messages to today, who their top contacts of the month are, what domains they are sending emails to, etc.); (2) conducting transactions, synchronizing data, and synchronizing security access with the system (e.g., a participant may send a Facebook\u00ae friend request to subjects whom they have exchanged a certain minimum volume of emails with); (3) querying statistics; (4) querying participant status information (e.g., that was either created by the participant or the system); (5) querying the participant's current activity on the system (e.g., as to whether they are currently using the system based on keyboard and mouse movements, what application they are using the mouse pointer to click on, where on the application they are clicking, etc.); (6) querying the participant's implicit and explicit social network (e.g., implicit social network may include for example anyone the participant has sent and received more than 20 messages from whereas explicit social network may include those the participant has identified manually as connection, friend, co-worker, etc.); and (7) querying the text and metadata associated with emails, IMs, transcribed phone calls, etc that is stored and used by the system.","In some implementation, these API's and Web Services may provide the means for other systems to extract Transcript information generated by the system.","In some implementation, the API's also may allow a third party system to access the interface by which the system displays data and information to the user. One instantiation of this interface may include a sidebar. The third party system may add display areas to the sidebar which may be cued on user clicking or typing actions (such as selecting an email or typing a search query). The third party system may add new text, buttons, pictures, etc. to existing sidebar display areas. The third party system may add new menu items to the system menus. The third party system may also add visual elements to displays of the system information displayed in a web interface.  shows an example API  that integrates a user interface  of a third party applications called \u201cinvite friends to Xobni.\u201d","In some implementation, the system may group emails into groups and rank these groups based on the number of unread emails. For example, the participant may view a ranked list of subjects (e.g., the ranking may be done based on the number of unread emails from the subject); the participant may view the ranked list of projects\/tasks (e.g., the ranking may be done based on the number of unread emails associated to the project\/task); the participant may view the ranked list of departments in the organization (e.g., the ranking may be done based on the number of unread emails coming from employees of the different department); and the participant may view the total number of emails from all internal and all external subjects that are in the queue to be read by the participant.","In some implementation, for each of the analytical views discussed above, the participant may \u201cdrill-down\u201d to the details (i.e. the list of emails or the specific email). For example, the participant may see that there are 30 unread emails from external subjects versus 2 unread emails from internal sources. The participant may click onto the \u201c30\u201d unread external emails, and see the list of emails, and may also click into each email. This may facilitate a data analytical approach to triaging a participant's unread emails.","In some implementation, the system may support a participant in performing activities related to, without limitations, email triage, viewing people connections etc. For example, from the person profile view, the participant may view which messages from a subject have been read or which are still unread. The participant also may mark a message or all messages from a subject as having been read. The participant also may view the list of all subjects that have been carbon copied on the email, and clicking a subject may take the participant to that subject's person profile page. If desired, the participant also may click (or some other appropriate action) on a subject's name listed in the body of the email or in the header of the email, and the system may open the person profile page for that subject.","In some implementation, the system may provide an \u201cActions\u201d area in the system that allows the participant to undertake certain actions with the current email that is being viewed on the email client. One such implementation of this \u201cActions\u201d area is in the sidebar implementation where an \u201cActions\u201d area may be included with the person profile page. The participant may file current email to a folder suggested by the system, forward an email that is contained\/attached in the current email and forward attachment(s) that is contained\/attached in the current email.","In some implementation, the system may be extended to the web feed feature previously described to provide the participant with ways to act on email content. The following are some samples, and hence are not limiting in nature: (1) an ISBN number where the system may provide a link to the page on amazon.com that has the information for the item; (2) web page link where the system may show a thumbnail of the web page that the participant may click to open in a browser screen; (3) EBay email where the system may provide a \u201cView this auction page\u201d action link; (4) a UPS tracking number where the system may provide a \u201cTrack this package\u201d action link; (5) an Amazon receipt\u2014the system may provide a \u201cView this order page\u201d action link; (6) YouTube\u00ae video where the system may provide a \u201cPlay Video\u201d capability; (7) a MP3 link where the system may provide a \u201cPlay Audio\u201d capability; (8) a LinkedIn\u00ae invitation where the system may provide the means for the participant to accept a friend invitation without having to go to the LinkedIn site; and (9) Facebook email where the system may show a message from an acquaintance or what an acquaintance may have written on the participant's Facebook wall without the participant having to go to the Facebook site.","In some implementation, the participant may search for email content to act on. For example, the participant may search for phone numbers in emails, and the system may return a search result list of numbers. From this list, the participant may click a number to call it via a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone client or other soft phone clients. The participant may also choose to save the phone number to an existing contact or to create a new contact.","As another example, the participant may search for physical addresses in emails, and the system may return a search result list of addresses. From this list, the participant may click an address and the system will open an online mapping system (such as Google Maps) to locate the address on the map. The participant may also choose to save the address to an existing contact or to create a new contact.","As yet another example, the participant may search for calendar event invitations (e.g. Microsoft Outlook event invitation), and the system may return a search result list of calendar event invitations. From this list, the participant may accept or reject the invitation.","As yet another example, the participant may search for appointment related information, and the system may return a list of emails that contain information that suggest the creation of an appointment, and the system will recommend creating an entry in the participant's calendar. The participant may create a calendar entry for a specific email directly from the search results list.","In some implementation, the participant may create and view \u201cTo-Do\u201d tasks related to a subject as part of the Person Profile information. The participant also may view calendar appointments or events that are related to a subject. The system may associate a calendar appointment with a subject because either the subject created the appointment\/event or is an invitee to the appointment\/event. The system may show the upcoming appointments\/events, their locations and time, or visually indicate (e.g. by flashing the appointment) to the participant that an appointment\/event is coming up (e.g. 10 minutes before it starts). The participant may view when the subject (or person) is available or busy, or invite the subject for an appointment\/event directly from the person profile information view.","In some implementation, the system may provide an email triage service that presents to the participant within a participant-defined amount of time (e.g. 30 minutes) emails that may need attention. Over time, the system may learn about the types of emails that may need the participant's attention. As part of the learning process, for each email presented to the participant during the triage time period, the participant may reply to the email, may come back to it later, or decide not to attend to the email. From these responses\/actions, the system may continue to get better at presenting the most important emails to the participant.","In addition, the participant may select and provide a set of past emails that will serve as \u201ctraining data\u201d for the system. The combination of mining the training data and learning from experience may give the system an accurate assessment of which emails need the most attention from the participant.","As part of this service, the system may provide email templates for standard responses. The system may predict the type of response (e.g. getting back in touch, apology for a late response etc) that an email might need, and propose an email response template that the participant may use and modify for the participant's purpose. The participant may choose to use the email triage service on an ad-hoc basis or to schedule it as an ongoing event (e.g. at 5 pm every Friday).","In some implementation, the system may provide a search and browse mechanism to help the participant search for and find a menu item or function supported by the email client that may be difficult to find or that the participant may have forgotten where it was located. The participant may perform activities including, without limitation, using keywords to search for the menu or function; browsing the categories of different menus and functions; and drilling down to the specific menu or function the participant is looking for (e.g., the system may organize the email client's menus and functions into easily identifiable and navigable categories); and saving some email client menus and functions as the most important ones and these will show up as a list in the search and browse mechanism page without the participant having to conduct a search or to browse to look for them.","In some implementation, when an important email arrives for the participant, the system may send a SMS (short message service) message to the participant's cell phone. In these implementation, the participant may designate emails from specific subjects as important. In addition, similar to the email triage service, the system may decide which emails (and by implication the types of content) are important to the participant. The system may learn from experience and from mining a training data set provided by the participant. When a system decides that an email is important, it may send an SMS message to the participant's cell phone, and the participant may respond with a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d via a SMS message to indicate whether the email was important.","In some implementation, the system may provide a \u201csharebox\u201d mechanism where participants may drag and drop emails or other content: attachments, contact information, pictures, etc. Such content may be automatically published to Wikipedia\u00ae sites, online blog sites, RSS widgets, social and professional networking sites, content syndication and distribution sites and mechanisms, or shared with other users in the same group or organization.","In some implementation, content may be displayed in a ticker or \u201cnews feed\u201d residing on the system (or email client) of other subjects who are connected to the participant via a social network site, professional network site, subscription to the participant's content feeds, an organization affiliation, and other connection means. Permissions also may be set so that content may be shared only with select individuals, other users of the system, \u201cfriends\u201d as identified by users on the system, \u201ccoworkers\u201d as identified by email address or directory service, \u201cfriends\u201d as identified by existing social networks or professional networks and the like. Content also may be sent between individual systems or a central server, or alternatively pushed onto individual systems where the content appears automatically. Of course, if desired, the content also may be pulled only when a users request data, such that sharebox updates may create notifications that may be sent as emails or other methods of notification.","In some implementation, the participant may add free text notes related to a person (i.e. subject). These notes may be exported to other desktop application systems such as, without limitation, Microsoft\u00ae Excel, Word, and other text processing applications. In addition, these notes may also be added to on-premise and hosted CRM systems and associated with the customer or partner record in the CRM system. In some implementation, these notes also may be shared with other subjects using the system. The participant may decide which subjects to share these notes with.","In some implementation, the participant may manually tag emails using free text terms. The system may also automatically tag the email based on an analysis of the email content. These tags may be used to facilitate the search for emails or to provide an email grouping mechanism to facilitating the participant in browsing these groups to find the email(s) the participant is looking for.","In some implementation, the participant may click on a \u201cSend Contact Information\u201d action mechanism, and the system may automatically create an email with a \u201csend contact information\u201d content template and the person's contact information. The participant may modify the email content before sending the email. This feature facilitates email introductions between people.","In some implementation, the system may infer the preferences (i.e., likes and dislikes) and inclinations of the participant and subjects by analyzing the email messages and attachments that they send and receive. The system may parse email content and relevant attachments to locate text such as, without limitation, \u201cI like\u201d, \u201cI prefer\u201d, \u201cI have\u201d, \u201cI want\u201d, \u201cI was concerned\u201d and \u201cI was annoyed\u201d.","In some implementation, the system also may develop profiles about the participant or subjects. Such a profile may be used to recommend content, products, services and activities to the participant and subjects. Likewise, such profiles may also be used by the system to understand what the participant and subjects already have, use or do, and the system may leverage these people to serve as recommenders or feedback providers for this content, product, services and activities. The system may harness these people to create a new consumer\/people influence channel for this content, product, services and activities.","In some implementation, the system may harness this group of people as a source of information to drive, for example, product development, service development, policy development, process development, content development, etc.","In some implementation, the system may analyze the participant's activities to identify the goal of the participant. For example, if the participant starts a search for the word \u201cmatt\u201d, then the system changes to a person profile for Matt. If the participant starts a search for \u201cmatt budget\u201d, the system displays an interface showing all the attachments and emails with the word \u201cbudget\u201d that were sent or received from Matt.","If a user is observed filtering messages from Matt, then filtering messages from Matt that contain an attachment, and then searching inside those attachments for the word \u201cbudget\u201d, the system may suggest a search command to the user such as \u201cmatt budget\u201d that would retrieve the information more quickly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","300","300"]},"Process  begins with identifying an attachment to an email message (). Metadata associated with the attachment may be identified (). The attachment and the metadata may be stored in an searchable database ().","In some implementations, a query associated with an attachment may be received. Upon receiving the query, the attachment may be located. Then, information associated the attachment (e.g., a preview of the attachment) may be displayed.","In some implementations, the identification of an attachment to an email message may include the identification of an email thread associated with the attachment; the determination of whether the email thread includes one or more additional attachments; and if it is determined that the email thread includes one or more additional attachments, consolidation of the attachment, the metadata and the email thread including the one or more additional attachments.","In some implementations, a collaboration history associated with the attachment using the metadata also may be determined.","In some implementations, storing the attachment and the metadata in an searchable database may include storing the collaboration history in the searchable database, the collaboration history being established based on one of an analysis of the metadata, content changes associated with the attachment, tracking of one or more copies of the attachment, or one or more content comparisons between the attachment and one or more similar attachments residing in the searchable database.","In some implementations, a voting status associated with the attachment also may be received. The voting status may be indicative of a characteristic of the attachment. Additionally, the identification of the metadata associated with the attachment may include the identification of the voting status, and the storage of the attachment and the metadata in an searchable database may include the storage of the attachment, the metadata and the voting status in the searchable database.","In some implementations, the attachment or email message may be parsed to identify one or more keywords. In some implementations, a personal profile for a user based on the one or more identified keywords may be developed. In some implementations, content (e.g., advertising content) may be presented to the user based on the personal profile.","In some implementations, one or more user queries may be received. The one or more user queries may include one or more search terms. In some implementations, at least one attachment associated with the one or more search terms may be identified.
