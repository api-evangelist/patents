On the other hand, with the advancement of speeding-up, a toner also having offset resistance, which is a contradictory property to a low-temperature fixing ability, is in demand. In order to accomplish both of these properties, a polyester blend system using an aromatic alcohol has been proposed. However, the aromatic polyester has a disadvantage in that the aromatic polyester has a rigid structure, so that the pulverizability upon the production of the toner is worsened, whereby not facilitating the pulverization from the viewpoint of the production of toners having smaller particle sizes with the advancement in high image quality.","In view of the above, a method including the step of blending a low-molecular weight polyester with a high-molecular weight polyester, using an aliphatic alcohol having excellent pulverizability as a monomer has been employed (see Patent Publication 1).\n\n","The present invention relates to a toner containing a resin binder and a colorant, wherein the resin binder contains a polyester (A) having a softening point Tm(A) of from 100\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 C., and a polyester (B) having a softening point Tm(B) of from 80\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 C., the softening point of which is lower than that of the polyester (A) by 5\u00b0 C. or more, each polyester obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component,","wherein the polyester (A) and\/or (B) is a polyester obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component consisting essentially of an aliphatic alcohol, wherein the alcohol component contains a dihydric alcohol component containing 1,2-propanediol in an amount of 65% by mol or more, and a carboxylic acid component.","While it is desired to satisfy both of low-temperature fixing ability and offset resistance in an even higher level, satisfaction of these properties would certainly accompany the lowering of the glass transition temperature, especially in a method including the step of blending a low-molecular weight resin, thereby resulting in worsening of the storage property such as the toner is undesirably aggregated.","Especially in a case where a low-molecular polyester is synthesized using an aliphatic alcohol, the resulting polyester is likely to have a low glass transition point and be deficient in storage property because of the structural characteristic of the aliphatic alcohol-based polyester.","Therefore, in a method including the step of blending a low-molecular weight polyester with a high-molecular weight polyester, using an aliphatic alcohol as a monomer, it would be difficult to satisfy the offset resistance and the low-temperature fixing ability at a high level, and secure storage property.","In addition, the polyester obtained from an aliphatic alcohol has a large number of ester bonds in the molecule, a disadvantage that the polyester has high hygroscopicity, thereby resulting in lowering of triboelectric chargeability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions is more likely to take place.","The present invention relates to a toner being excellent in any one of low-temperature fixing ability, offset resistance, triboelectric charge stability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions, and storage property.","The toner of the present invention exhibits excellent effects in any one of low-temperature fixing ability, offset resistance, triboelectric charge stability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions, and storage property.","The toner of the present invention contains at least a resin binder and a colorant, wherein the resin binder contains two kinds of polyesters having specified softening points, i.e. a polyester (A) and a polyester (B) given hereinbelow.","The polyester (A) is a polyester having a softening point Tm(A) of from 100\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 C., preferably from 120\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 C., more preferably from 130\u00b0 to 155\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 135\u00b0 to 155\u00b0 C. On the other hand, the polyester (B) is a polyester having a softening point Tm(B) of from 80\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 C., preferably from 80\u00b0 C. or higher and lower than 120\u00b0 C., more preferably from 85\u00b0 to 115\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 90\u00b0 to 110\u00b0 C., the softening point of which is lower than that of the polyester (A). The difference (\u0394Tm) of Tm(A) and Tm(B) is 5\u00b0 C. or more, preferably 10\u00b0 C. or more, more preferably from 15\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 C., and even more preferably 20\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 C. The polyester (A) having a high softening point contributes to the improvement in offset resistance, and the polyester (B) having a low softening point contributes to the improvement in low-temperature fixing ability, respectively, so that a combined use of both of the polyesters is effective in satisfying both of low-temperature fixing ability and offset resistance. A weight ratio of the polyester (A) to the polyester (B) in the resin binder, i.e. polyester (A)\/polyester (B), is preferably from 1\/9 to 9\/1, more preferably from 2\/8 to 8\/2, and even more preferably from 3\/7 to 7\/3.","Further, the present invention has a major feature in that the polyester (A) and\/or (B) is a polyester obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing a dihydric alcohol component containing 1,2-propanediol in an amount of 65% by mol or more, and a carboxylic acid component.","In the present invention, 1,2-propanediol, which is a branched alcohol having 3 carbon atoms usable in the alcohol component is effective in improving low-temperature fixing ability while maintaining offset resistance, as compared to those alcohols having 2 or less carbon atoms, and is effective in preventing the lowering of storage property accompanying the lowering of the glass transition temperature, as compared to those branched alcohols having 4 or more carbon atoms. Surprising effects that the toner can be fixed at a very low temperature are exhibited, thereby improving storage property.","The alcohol component may contain an alcohol other than 1,2-propanediol within the range so as not to impair the effects of the present invention. The 1,2-propanediol is contained in an amount of 65% by mol or more, preferably 70% by mol or more, more preferably 80% by mol or more, and even more preferably 90% by mol or more, of the dihydric alcohol component. The dihydric alcohol component other than the 1,2-propanediol includes aliphatic dialcohols such as 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycols having different carbon atoms, a hydrogenated bisphenol A, or an alkylene (2 to 4 carbon atoms) oxide (average number of moles: 1 to 16) adduct, and the like. The dihydric alcohol component is contained in an amount of preferably from 60 to 95% by mol, and more preferably from 65 to 90% by mol, of the alcohol component.","Here, it is preferable that the alcohol component of the polyester (A) contains 1,3-propanediol from the viewpoint of offset resistance. A molar ratio of 1,2-propanediol to 1,3-propanediol in the alcohol component of the polyester (A), i.e. 1,2-propanediol\/1,3-propanediol, is preferably from 99\/1 to 65\/35, more preferably from 95\/5 to 70\/30, even more preferably from 90\/10 to 75\/25, and even more preferably from 85\/15 to 77\/23.","Here, the alcohol component may contain an aromatic alcohol such as an alkylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, such as polyoxypropylene(2.2)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane or polyoxyethylene(2.2)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane. However, the alcohol component of the polyester (A) and\/or (B) consists essentially of an aliphatic alcohol, and it is preferable that both of the alcohol components of the polyesters (A) and (B) consist essentially of an aliphatic alcohol. The phrase \u201calcohol component consisting essentially of an aliphatic alcohol\u201d as used herein refers to an alcohol component containing an aliphatic alcohol in an amount of preferably 90% by mol or more, more preferably 95% by mol or more, even more preferably 98% by mol or more, and even more preferably 99% by mol or more.","On the other hand, it is preferable that the carboxylic acid component contains an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compound having 2 to 4 carbon atoms. The aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compound having 2 to 4 carbon atoms includes adipic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, and acid anhydrides thereof, and the like. Among them, it is more preferable that at least one aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compound selected from the group consisting of succinic acid, fumaric acid, citraconic acid, and itaconic acid is contained. These aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compounds are effective in the improvement of low-temperature fixing ability. In the present invention, among the above-mentioned aliphatic dicarboxylic acid compounds, itaconic acid is preferred.","The above-mentioned aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is contained in an amount of preferably from 0.5 to 20% by mol, and more preferably from 1 to 10% by mol, of the carboxylic acid component, from the viewpoint of the improvement in low-temperature fixing ability and the control in the lowering of the glass transition temperature. Since a polyester obtained by polycondensing an aliphatic carboxylic acid compound containing no aromatic ring with 1,2-propanediol has improvement in compatibility with a releasing agent, filming resistance can be even more enhanced by a combined use with the releasing agent.","Further, it is preferable that the carboxylic acid component contains a rosin. By containing a rosin having a polycyclic aromatic ring, hygroscopicity owned by a conventional aliphatic alcohol-based polyester is lowered, so that an effect against the lowering of triboelectric charges under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions is even more enhanced.","In the present invention, a rosin is a natural resin obtained from pine trees, of which main components are resin acids such as abietic acid, neoabietic acid, palustric acid, pimaric acid, isopimaric acid, sandaracopimaric acid, dehydroabietic acid, and levopimaric acid, and mixtures thereof.","The rosins are roughly classified into a tall rosin obtained from a tall oil produced as a by-product in the process of manufacturing pulp, a gum rosin obtained from a crude turpentine, a wood rosin obtained from stumps of pine tree, and the like. The rosin in the present invention is preferably a tall resin, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability.","In addition, the rosin may be a modified rosin such as an isomerized rosin, a dimerized rosin, a polymerized rosin, a disproportionate rosin, or a hydrogenated rosin. In the present invention, a so-called crude rosin without being modified is preferably used, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability and storage property.","It is preferable that the rosin is a purified rosin, from the viewpoint of improvement of storage property and odor.","The purified rosin in the present invention is a rosin from which impurities are removed by a purifying step.

In the present invention, peak intensities of three kinds of impurities of those listed above, 2-methylpropane, pentanoic acid, and benzaldehyde, which are detected as volatile components according to headspace GC-MS method, can be used as an index for a purified rosin. Here, the reason why that the volatile components are used as indexes, not in absolute amounts of impurities, is in that the use of the purified rosin in the present invention has an objective of improvement in odor against conventional polyesters using rosins.","Specifically, the purified rosin in the present invention refers to a rosin in which a peak intensity of hexanoic acid is 0.8\u00d710or less, a peak intensity of pentanoic acid is 0.4\u00d710or less, and a peak intensity of benzaldehyde is 0.4\u00d710or less, under measurement conditions for headspace GC-MS method described later.
