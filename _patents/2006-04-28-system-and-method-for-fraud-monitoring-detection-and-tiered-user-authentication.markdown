title: System and method for fraud monitoring, detection, and tiered user authentication
abstract: The present invention provides systems and methods for authenticating access requests from user devices by presenting one of a plurality of graphical user interfaces selected depending on a perceived risk of fraud associated with the devices. User devices are identified with fingerprinting information, and their associated risks of fraud are determined from past experience with the device or with similar devices and from third party information. In preferred embodiments, different graphical user interfaces are presented based on both fraud risk and, in the case of a known user, usability. In preferred embodiments, this invention is implemented as a number of communicating modules that identify user devices, assess their risk of fraud, present selected user interfaces, and maintain databases of fraud experiences. This invention also includes systems providing these authentication services.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","APPENDIX A","Data Items Useful in Device Fingerprinting","Rule Conditions Useful in Device and Location Fingerprinting","APPENDIX B"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60\/676,141 filed Apr. 29, 2005 and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","The invention relates generally to systems and methods for providing protection against identity theft over a computer network.","The growth in the volume of online transactions conducted by businesses and individuals over the Internet has been staggering. Sensitive private identity information is typically used for authenticating a user for conducting online transactions. The increased use of identity information for Internet transactions has been accompanied by an increased danger of interception and theft of that information. Identity theft occurs when someone uses the password, username, Social Security number, credit card number, or other identifying personal information of another without consent to commit fraud. According to a September 2003 Federal Trade Commission (FTC) survey, 27.3 million Americans have been victims of identity theft in the last five years, including 9.9 million people in the year 2002 alone. Identity theft losses to businesses and financial institutions in 2002 totaled nearly $48 billion and consumer victims reported $5 billion in out-of-pocket expenses, according to the FTC survey.","To enter into a transaction with an E-commerce server, a user typically needs to provide sensitive and confidential data including authentication data, data describing the transaction, and the like. This data is commonly entered by using a keyboard and\/or a mouse connected to a device local to the user that is running a web browser that is linked to the Internet (or other computer network).  is a diagram illustrating an exemplary system  used for entering user authentication and transaction data. In this example, the authentication information to be entered by a user comprises a user ID and password. In known systems, the user ID and password are composed of a string of characters entered via a keyboard  while executing a web browser on a computing device . A typical user entry interface  provided by the browser to the user on a display  is shown.","After entry, a user's sensitive information is typically transmitted to a remote server preferably in an encrypted form over secure connections. For example, the widely-used TCP\/IP communication protocol includes security protocols built on the secure socket layer (SSL) protocol to allow secure data transfer using encrypted data streams. SSL offers encryption, source authentication, and data integrity as a means for protecting information exchanged over insecure, public networks. Accordingly, many E-commerce servers and applications use SSL, or similar security protocols, to exchange data between remote servers and local user systems. If the entered authentication information is approved by the server, the user is permitted to send and receive data from the server's website.","The source of messages received at a web server is often determined from the IP address of the device from which the message is sent and\/or from a cookie included with data from the user. A cookie generally refers to a packet of information, often sensitive information, sent by a web server to a browser resident on the user's computer system for saving to a file and for transmitting back to the server whenever the user's browser makes additional requests from the server. The IP address is generally included in a message header, and the cookie is usually one that has been previously sent by the server, often at login. The server compares the user login data with the message IP address and the returned cookie to determine the identity of the user sending the message and whether the user is currently logged into the server. The IP address of the user is also confirmed.","Despite these known precautions, a user's sensitive information remains vulnerable because it is in a raw unsecured form between its entry by the user and its encryption prior to remote transmission. Also, sensitive data sent from the server is vulnerable during the period after its decryption and until its display. This unsecured information can be surreptitiously captured in a number of ways. For example, cookie hijackers copy sensitive information from cookies. Further, keyboard loggers and mouse click loggers are hidden software that intercept and copy mouse clicks and depressed keys after user entry but before processing by a browser or other software. Logger software can readily intercept the user's secure information. Keyboard loggers and mouse click loggers might also take the form of hardware connected between the keyboard and mouse cable and the computer or the hardware inside the keyboard and mouse device.","Even graphical user interfaces that represent on-screen keypads and keyboards with selectable graphics for user entry (instead or in addition to providing fields for text entry) are vulnerable to mouse click loggers, screen capture loggers, and other schemes. , , and  illustrates prior art examples of such interfaces. Each alphanumeric character in the graphical interface is represented by a unique graphical image, e.g., the pixels forming the number \u201c1\u201d. Screen capture loggers utilize optical character recognition (OCR) technology to decipher characters selected by mouse clicks and the corresponding alphanumeric graphics in order to ascertain the actual alphanumeric text characters of a user's ID and password. Sophisticated screen capture loggers might also utilize checksum and size characteristics of the graphic images in order to ascertain which the data item corresponding to a graphic image selected by a user's mouse click during data entry. In these ways, the screen capture loggers may acquire the personal information even when the graphical user interface has rearranged the order of alphanumeric characters on the keypad or keyboard.","Sensitive information can also be intercepted by espionage software, including snoopware, spyware, non-viral malware, hackers utilities, surveillance utilities, Trojan horses, etc. Espionage software aids in the unauthorized acquisition of information about a person or organization without their knowledge or consent. It typically installs itself on a user's computer without consent and then monitors or controls the use of the device. Every user keystroke, all chat conversations, all websites visited, every user interaction with a browser, every application executed, every document printed, all text and images, might be captured by the espionage software. Espionage software typically is capable of locally saving or transmitting the captured data to third parties over the Internet, most often without the user's knowledge or consent.","Another fraudulent acquirer of sensitive personal information is an \u201cover-the shoulder\u201d spy who surreptitiously reads a user's display to acquire the information.","Known anti-virus and anti-spyware software products attempt to enable a user to protect against such malicious software. However, use of outdated anti-virus and anti-spyware files provides minimal protection, at best, of computer data against outside threats. Consequently, a drawback of these products is that the information used by the anti-virus and anti-spyware program must be constantly updated to reflect newly discovered schemes in order to keep the protection current. In addition to keeping the virus information current, the system must be periodically scanned for potential infections.","Further, certain geographic locations are known to contain an inordinate number of identity thieves. It is therefore advantageous to know where an attempt to access a server originates from. IP addresses are one readily available source of location information. But IP addresses have drawbacks in that, for many users, the IP address is not constant. Known network protocols and facilities can lead to variable IP addresses. For example, proxy servers are used to provide a gateway between a local area network of an organization and the Internet. The local network is protected by firewall software installed on the proxy server. Proxy servers dynamically assign new IP addresses to a user device each time a new message is sent therefrom. As a result, there is no constant IP address assigned to an individual user device for users connected to the Internet via a proxy server.","Another source of IP address variability is the commonly used dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP protocol) which assigns IP addresses dynamically and automatically to the devices on a TCP\/IP network. A DHCP server assigns an IP address to a device from a list of available addresses when the device connects to the network. The device retains this IP address only for the duration of the current session. Some DHCP server systems can dynamically change the user's IP address during the session. The use of a proxy or DHCP server means that the IP address alone may not be enough to identity a particular user device.","Security systems and methods that protect against the above-identified risks should also meet the usability concerns of an average user. A service provider wants to encourage online use in a secure manner. But a cumbersome and prolonged user interface or a less user friendly interface might discourage or even intimidate and frustrate users, or cause user errors, or the like. Also a security system should institute precautions to prevent execution of a fraudulent transaction once it has been found that the user's information and\/or system is at risk of being compromised. A security system should also alert the service provider based on a particular device attempting to access the provider's system irrespective of the user.","Also, a security system and method should enable a service provider to strike a proper balance between security and usability of the system. In other words, a system and method is needed to enable a service provider to provide an easy to use and lower security interface when no security risk is identified, and a higher security interface when one is identified. Additionally, desirable security systems and methods should depend as little as possible upon human action to maintain their state of security. For example, it not advantageous to require users to keep and maintain tokens or digital certificates or the like. A token can be lost, damaged, stolen and the like.","But security systems protecting against the described threats and having the described properties are not generally known in the art. What is needed but currently lacking in the art is a security system and method with the following features and aspects:\n\n","The systems and methods of the present invention fill gaps in the prior art by providing improved authentication services.","An advantage of the systems and methods according to the present invention is that they provide information and selectable user interfaces for enabling a service provider to take action to authorize, deny, or put on hold online transactions in real time as a function of the risk presented by both the user and the device attempting to conduct a transaction.","Another advantage of the present invention is that it enables a service provider to identify possible in-process fraudulent authentication transactions, based on both user and device historical data analysis. Transactions can be approved, declined, or put on hold for verification based an a set of predetermined rules.","Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides both user and device based robust fraud monitoring and detection along with robust fraud analysis and risk assessment to give a service provider real time information needed to determine how and whether to allow a device to access the provider's system.","Another advantage of the present invention is the enabling of a selection of levels of secure user graphical authentication as a function of predetermined usability and\/or security concerns.","Another advantage of the present invention is that there is no dependence on tokens, cards and other similar hardware devices, digital certificates, anti-virus software, or personal firewall solutions for protecting end users against online identity theft.","Another advantage of the present invention is the acquisition and development of a blacklist and\/or white list that is device based rather than only user based.","Broadly stated, according to an embodiment, the present invention fingerprints a user's device by obtaining device identifying information that can be used to assess the fraud risk posed by a user at that user device. According to another embodiment, the present invention performs fraud analysis and alerting of the risk associated with the device being used to access a service provider's server. According to another embodiment, this invention includes a database of user devices and their historical known fraud risks available in a central repository. According to another embodiment, this invention presents user authentication interfaces selected from a plurality of user authentication interfaces that provide a plurality of levels of security and usability.","Accordingly, the present invention provides systems and methods for providing levels of fraud monitoring, detection, and a tiered user authentication comprising a fingerprinting module for identifying a user device that has requested connection to a server; an authenticator module for enabling selection from of a plurality of login graphical user interfaces as a function of predetermined selection criteria for presentation on the user device, wherein the selection criteria is in the form of rules regarding usability and security; a fraud analyzer and alert module for analyzing and assessing the risk associated with the user device as a function of historical tracking of use of the user device; and a device central repository for identifying legitimate and fraudulent users based on the fingerprinting module and other repositories of tracking information. This invention provides variously architected systems that implement the methods of this invention to provide authentication services to one or more service providers.","An example of the present invention's usability and security features is provided by users who have forgotten their login id or password. Such a user typically accesses a system from a limited number of user devices, and the fact that authentication attempts of this type were made from such a device is recognized by the present invention and can be used to present a helpful interface to the user. If the device is unknown to the system, this can signal that a hacker is trying to break into the system and can be used to present an authentication interface of heightened security. Additionally, such users typically enter his user\/password information that is almost but not entirely accurate. This can be recognized by the present invention and used to further guide user authentication. In preferred embodiments, these options are represented by rules processed by a rules engine.","A further example of this invention's usability and security features is provided by the ability to distinguish user behaviors. If an access originates from a user device that has not previously accessed a service provider (e.g., as detected by the absence of a device token stored on the user device), system rules can required that this access pass a higher level of authentication or challenge. However, the user may be a savvy user who routinely removes application tokens from their user device (almost 15% of Internet users). Further, on the basis of previous accesses, this user may be associated with a behavior pattern indicating routine access from not-readily-identifiable devices. Then, this user is preferably not challenged or subject to a higher level of scrutiny. In contrast, systems with authentication systems that do not adjust the authentication process on the basis past user behavior would always challenge such a user. Accordingly, the present invention provides a better user experience for all the users, whether they are savvy or not.","In further detail, the systems and methods of the present invention verify each user's computer and location (\u201csomething you have\u201d) along with behavioral usage patterns on a site to confirm identity (\u201csomething you are\u201d). These verifications are added on top of existing enterprise requirements for login\/password credentials (\u201csomething you know\u201d). This offers the enterprise several strong additional layers of anti-fraud protection.","The present invention includes secure cookies, flash objects and other technologies to recognize and to fingerprint the from which device a user access an application, whether it is a computer, laptop, mobile device or any other. These user devices thus become additional authentication factors without requiring any change in user behavior. Information concerning these user devices is fingerprinted and stored into a device token or device id for one-time use. The id or token is stored on the user device and saved in a database for later comparison with tokens retrieved from subsequent user device accesses. The token is invalidated if a user attempts to reuse it.","The present invention also includes user device tokens or device ids that have a unique number which is randomly generated by the methods of this invention. Such device tokens are then assigned to the particular user device, stored on the particular user device as persistent data (e.g., a cookie), and also stored so as to be accessible to the authentication services of this invention. The particular user device can be thereby identified upon a subsequent access by retrieving the device token from the user device and comparing the unique number with the stored information. If the data matches, this particular device is identified. Then a new unique identifier number is created and is stored on the user device and by the methods of this invention for use in a further access.","The present invention enables application service providers score risk for each online login and transaction and to increase authentication security in real time, at login and in session, for transactions that may be high risk or potential fraud. It evaluates the pre, post and in-session characteristics of each transaction to ensure fraud detection and transactional integrity. The methods then provide a service provider with scores, actions, and alerts. For example, if a transaction has a high risk score and is thus potentially fraudulent, one preferred action is to hold the transaction and to then seek secondary authentication or secondary challenge. The user is, e.g., asked to call service provider personnel to confirm the validity of the held transaction. Another action is to reject the transaction. Different actions may be appropriate to different transaction types. In the case of banking service providers, viewing account balances is acceptable but wire transfers are not acceptable; or in the case of ecommerce\/ASP service providers, download of sensitive documents may restricted based on the risk score. These actions are preferably invoked by rules evaluated during transaction evaluation.","The systems and methods of the present invention include the following features: device, location and user behavior (\u201cworkflow\u201d) fingerprinting; user profiling through capture and recording of user workflows; real-time risk scoring; real-time, rules-based fraud alerts and response; alerts; automatic internal flagging of suspicious activity; configurable, out-of-band end-user optional secondary authentication (via e-mail, SMS, voice print other); 3rd party integration via open APIs; support for shared authentication and fraud services infrastructure; case management tools for reviewing individual client logs; customer care tool for servicing inbound customer care; a dashboard for real time fraud and activity monitoring; reporting for risk management and trending analysis; and administration for system and rules configuration and maintenance. The methods and systems include the following components and features: rules engine; risk scoring\/forensics; real-time response; proprietary fingerprinting of devices, locations, workflows; models and rules; intelligent algorithms; and comprehensive administrative tools such as a dashboard, reports, and customer care","These and other embodiments, features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims and accompanying drawings.","Reference symbols or names are used in the Figures to indicate certain components, aspects or features shown therein, with reference symbols common to more than one Figure indicating like components, aspects or features shown therein.","This invention generally provides systems and methods that interface with service providing systems of online service providers and assists them in authenticating their user requests, especially user log on requests and transaction sequences (referred to herein as a user's \u201cworkflow\u201d). Briefly, this invention authenticates a user and a login request (referred to herein as \u201cpre-authentication\u201d) in a manner determined both by the identity of the device from which the authentication request originates this invention as well as by available information concerning the identity of the requesting user. User workflow sequences are authenticated (referred to herein as \u201cpost-authentication\u201d) using a user's transaction history. In both applications, the precise authentication processes and decisions can be directed by rules from the service provider.","Preferred System Configurations","The general structure and arrangement of preferred embodiments of these systems and methods are now described, following are more detailed descriptions of preferred embodiments of the component processes. Heading are used herein solely to aid clarity and without any intended limitation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["1302","1304","1306","710","720","1306","1308","1308"]},"In many preferred embodiments (but without limitation), the authentication processes of the invention are implemented with a client-server-type architecture (or, more generally, a distributed-systems-type architecture). Accordingly, the individual processes providing authentication services for a particular service provider application can both execute on the service provider's computer system or be distributed among other network-attached computer systems. Preferred distribution architectures include one or more authentication servers that at least host a device central repository (\u201cDCR\u201d) service.","The DCR receives, stores, and makes available online information  identifying user devices and the fraud risks associated with the user devices. This information can include blacklists and\/or white-lists of devices with higher risk of fraud and with lower risk of fraud, respectively. This information can be gathered from the authentication experiences of the service providers participating in an implementation of this invention, or from other concurrent and intercommunicating implementations of this invention, from 3'rd party data sources, and the like. Authentication servers can also host service provider applications.","Optionally, the authentication server can also host the actual authentication processes of this invention, which are then configured as server processes responding to requests from application executing remotely on service provider computer systems. Thereby in certain embodiments of this invention, the authentication server system also provides \u201cdevice-based authentication services\u201d as well as \u201cDCR services\u201d. A service provider server system, e.g., system , for example, need itself not run all (or any) authentication processes, but instead can access those processes it does not host (or all authentication processes) on the authentication server. In other embodiments, a service provider system can execute all authentication processes, and therefore need only access the authentication server for optional DCR services. In , system  does not itself perform pre-authentication processing, but does performs \u201cpost-authentication services\u201d.","In another preferred embodiment, authentication services, usually pre-authentication services can be performed on a firewall machine (or other type of network gateway machine). In , firewall  performs primarily pre-authentication services for service-provider system . If a user is authenticated, then that user can access service provider applications, e.g., applications A, B, C, D, and so forth. In certain instances, a firewall can perform all pre-authentication service processing; however, in most instances, it is advantageous for the firewall to act as a client to the authentication services of the authentication server. In fact, it may not be practical for a firewall to perform full pre-authentication processing even with server assistance, in which case it can perform a subset of authentication processing (referred to herein a \u201cbasic authentication services\u201d).","Basic authentication services can be limited to user device fingerprinting and confirmation of basic machine data, e.g., IP address, operating systems, device ID, and the like. As described subsequently, the user's computer is provided with a cookie that includes the identifying information of the machine. This cookie is reviewed by the firewall upon login to verify that it matches what the entity knows about the user. Discrepancies can be identified and scored to determine whether to allow access or not or whether to apply secondary authentication protocols, such as a security question, before allowing access. This embodiment is applicable to an entity such as an organization, company or law firm for authenticating remote log-ins from its employees, members or other users, where these employees or users number approximately 10,000 or less.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 13B","b":["400","600"]},"Authentication services are invoked when a server application or services provider computer system receives user request  that needs authentication. In the case of pre-authentication, the most common user request is a login request to access an application or system. Other requests usually handled by post-authentication services include, e.g., transaction requests involving large amounts of money. User requests can be received directly from communication subsystems, or alternatively, can be forwarded from the service provider application or system across an interface to the authentication processes.","In preferred embodiments, authentication services can be invoked through an externally available application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d).

The fingerprint process then gathers identifying information describing the device from which the user request originated and creates a device identifier (\u201cDevice ID\u201d). The Device ID (and optionally other device identifying information) is stored on the user device from which it can be retrieved and form part of the device identifying information to be used during a subsequent fingerprinting","Next, FAAS process  is invoked with the Device ID (and optionally other device and\/or user identifying information). This process evaluates its input identifying information and either can, e.g., recommend to the service-provider application or system that the request should be processed further or blocked from the system (referred to herein as \u201cactions\u201d). This process can also provide risk alerts and risk scores (referred to herein as \u201calerts\u201d and \u201cscores\u201d) describing the relative risks of the input request so that the service-provider application or system can themselves make such authentication decisions. FAAS evaluation preferably begins with retrieving forensic information related to the characteristics of the current request that are apparent in the input request information. Information sources can include system DCR services, which stores an authentication system's past authentication results, and third party data services, which can provide a wide range of data, e.g., geolocation data services providing likely geographical source of the current request. The input data and the retrieved forensic data is then analyzed by a rules-based decision process in order to determines output actions, alerts, and scores.","In other words, device id is usually available and then is the primary item to identify an authorized user. Even when the device id is recognized, the user can be required to provide additional security information before being allowed access. Other conventional security protocols (i.e., personal questions, selection of personal information from a multiple choice question, etc.) or even a higher level of security (i.e., telephone IP administrator, call to provide voice recognition, etc.) can be used. When a user knows in advance that a different computer will be used for access at certain times, e.g. business travel to a new location with use of a different computer contemplated, then this information can be provided to the entity and its IP administrator so that the rules for that particular user and time period can be changed to facilitate access to the system and its application.","If a request is to be further processed, a further exemplary action is the selection of preferred graphical (or other type) authentication interfaces (\u201cGUI\u201d) for authenticating a newly arrived user or an existing user making a request that needs particular authentication. Authentication interface selection criteria can be determined in accordance with the evaluated risk scores and any risk alerts. The selection criteria will then call for an interface with a security that is commensurate the risk of fraud. Also, the risk information can also be provided to the service provider system or application which can then perform, e.g., more thorough checking of authentication data or requesting the authentication services of this invention to re-authenticate the user or request. This can involve, e.g., seeking responses to details authentication questions, or obtaining biometric identification information (e.g., fingerprints, retinal scans, or the like), or obtaining voice prints, or the like.","Next, authenticator process  is invoked with the interface selection criteria, selects an particular user authentication interface from a user-interface database according to the criteria, and then presents the selected interface at the originating user device, and receives the data entered in response to interface presentation. The entered data is then used as part of the authentication decision by the service provider application  of processes of this invention. The server application, or the FAAS, or both together then decide whether on not to authenticate the current request.","The DCR process gathers the results of the current request-authentication processing and stores them in DCR database  in association with the identifying information (for example, the Device ID) for the originating user device. These stored processing results preferably include, at least, whether or not the request was validated or not and\/or whether or not the request was found to be fraudulent. Thereby, the DCR database can provide an historical record of the results of previous request-authentication processing to guide the FAAS in current authentication-request processing. The DCR database includes at least data obtained from the current service provider. Preferably, it also includes data from other service providers so that device risk information can be shared and the accuracy of authentication processing can be multiplied.","FDM  performs the actual gathering and assembly of the results of the current request-authentication processing. Data from the current request can optionally be supplemented by the third party data similar to that data already retrieved by the FAAS and\/or other data retrieved by the FAAS relevant to evaluating the current request.

Efficient handling of this information is advantageous, especially in commercial applications servicing a large number of concurrent users. Thus in many preferred embodiments gathered information is stored for online use in a condensed or summary form, and for offline use in nearly full or full detail. Online uses include, e.g., real time authentication and authentication update. Offline uses include, e.g., data mining, rule refinement, and so forth.","A preferred condensed or summary form is referred to herein as a fingerprint. First, possible values of a category of data or of an authentication criteria are divided into a number of \u201cbins\u201d. Then the category or criteria fingerprint of a particular user is a representation (e.g., as a binary token) of the gathered data which indicates only which bins have data and which do not. This representation can be optionally compressed using known techniques. Thereby, a user's authentication and transaction requests can be represented in several binary tokens.","For example, in a typical online business application, there may be 20 unique pre-identified sensitive transaction sequences (workflows). Each workflow can be characterized by, e.g., ten bins or variable with each variable having, e.g., ten bind of values. Therefore, a user can be characterized by a fixed number of possible fingerprints with each user having on average, e.g., ten unique fingerprints.","Preferred Functional Configurations","The function of the present invention are configured to provide consistent methods of checking the authenticity and security of a user-initiated request made to a service-provider application, e.g., a online store application, an online banking application, and the like. The methods receive a copy of the request itself or information describing and abstracting the substance of a current request. The input information is processed, and the methods output risk scores, risk alerts, and actions (or action recommendations). Risk scores and alerts are indicia of the likely risks that the current request is incorrect, or malicious, or fraudulent, and so forth. More specifically, the risk scores output are products of a number fraud detection inputs which are weighted and analyzed in real time using analytic processes customizable for individual service providers. Fraud detection inputs describe the user, the user's device, the location of the user's device, the workflow of transaction entered by the user, historical patterns of user accesses, and data from 3rd party data sources. This information is provided to service-provider applications and systems (\u201cusers\u201d of the invention) for use in their internal authentication processes. The methods of this invention can also recommend or initiate actions according to service-provider guidelines or rules. These actions are generally directed to gathering information for authenticating the request being processed.","Generally, the available, security-relevant information related to a user request (the \u201crequest attributes\u201d) is broken into related information groupings referred to as criteria so that each criteria preferably contains several pieces of data concerning a user request. Groups of rules, preferably criteria-specific, then evaluate the criteria, and the risk scores and actions that are output result from a combination and weighting of the results of the rule-based evaluation of each criteria. As a user request, and especially as a related group of user transactions, is authenticated by this invention and processed by service-provider applications, more or less criteria data are available and criteria have varying importance. For example, before a user is authenticated and granted access to a service-provider application, data relevant to workflow criteria (e.g., a sequence of related transactions by a user) is usually not available. On the other hand, when a user is engaged in requesting transactions, criteria related to initial authentication are usually less important. These periods are referred to as the \u201cpre-authentication\u201d period and the \u201cpost-authentication\u201d period respectively.","Preferred pre-authentication criteria include location information and device information, and preferred post-authentication criteria include user information and workflow information.

Different sets of models can be configured to support different transaction types, e.g. bill pay, money transfer, password change, email change, etc. Since the models are defined and written in XML, after the initial integration, no code changes are needed in the service provider applications. All models can be modified using a network interface or by replacing the XML definition file. Also, new models can be added seamlessly during operation of the methods of this invention.

A nested model is run only when a specific sequence of answers is returned from the primary model. Nested models therefore reduce false positives and negatives and serve to ensure overall accuracy of the risk score.

One exemplary method is known as \u201ctime over threshold\u201d. This method compares the value of a variable to a pre-defined threshold at each transaction and reports if the value has been out of range for too many transactions. Thus, rather than triggering a model each time the threshold is crossed, recent historical data is used to sort out persistent problems. Thus time over threshold eliminates unnecessary alert and actions. Another exemplary method is known as \u201cdeviation from normal\u201d. This method, instead of comparing current actions to fixed thresholds, employs uses historical data to establish normal for specific days, times, users, devices, workflows, and the like. It then assesses whether the current behavior is deviating from what is normally in similar circumstances.","Another exemplary method is known as \u201cevent state\u201d. This method maintains states for external object which store past alerts and actions. Then, a failing rule generates a single alert on the first failure. Subsequent failures will not generate additional alerts until a selected interval has passed from the first alerts. If the rule subsequently succeeds, the alert will be cleared. Another exemplary method is known as \u201cevent rate\u201d. This method generates alerts only after a selected event has occurred too many times in a part selected time interval. For example, if a login failure occurs more than three times in one hour, an alarm or alert is generated indicating that an intruder may be trying to access the system. However, subsequent login failures during the predetermined time period would not generate additional alarms, nor would less than three login failures. A further exemplary method is known as \u201cevent time over threshold\u201d. This method generates an alert when the rate of traps received exceeds a threshold rate for a period of time. For example, network links frequently go up and down, so it is distracting if an alarm is generated every time a link cycles. However, if the network link has failed for, e.g., ten or more minutes in an, e.g., hour, then availability may be is impacted and an alert generated.","Preferred Software Configurations","The individual components of the methods and systems of this invention, which have been briefly described above, are now described in more detail: the fingerprint process (with reference to ), then the FAAS process (with reference to ), then the authenticator process (with reference to ), then the DCR server (with reference to ), and lastly the FDM process (with reference to ). User devices are preferably identified using secure cookies, Flash cookies, and similar data tokens combined with other data items such as browser characteristics, device hardware configuration (e.g., as acquired using Flash calls), network characteristics, and the like. Device identifying data is evaluated by a configurable set of nested rules that identify a device and also check historical logins from this device for accuracy, including handling exception cases where cookies are disabled, out-of-sync cookies and also potentially identifying fraudulently stolen cookies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0139"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13A"],"b":["400","402","720","720"]},"In Step , device identity information for the user device is captured. This information can be captured by a client program already resident on the user device. For Internet applications, the client program is commonly a web browser. Alternately, a software module can be downloaded to the user device and executed to gather identifying information. For Internet applications, the software module can be a plug-in, a script, or an applet (e.g., a Java applet) downloaded by the web browser and executed. The identity information gathered is selected to identify the user device as uniquely as possible. Preferably, the device can be uniquely identified within those user devices that access the server application. If insufficient information is available for unique identification, the user device is identified as narrowly as possible, e.g., by the values of specific properties that vary widely among possible user devices. Identity information can be augmented by data generated by the fingerprinting process itself, e.g., a unique bit string, such as a large random number. Some or all of the device identity (along with identifying information generated by the fingerprinting process) information is stored in a data token referred to as a \u201cDevice ID\u201d. APPENDIX A to this section present particular examples of data elements and evaluation rules useful in a particular preferred embodiment of device fingerprinting.","Generally, the captured device identifying information includes the following. A first type of device identifying information is a secure, persistent data token that has been previously stored on the user device. Secure persistent data includes generally data elements that are encrypted, signed, or otherwise secured against modification, and that remain resident on the user device even when it is not accessing a service provider application. This data may have been previously stored on the user device by the service provider server application, in which case it often identifies the user who accessed the service provider. This data may also have been stored by the fingerprinting processes of this invention during the course of a prior identification of this device, in which case, it preferably includes the \u201cDevice ID\u201d.","Although, any technique that allows a remote application to store and retrieve persistent data on a user device can be used, it is preferred to use known and widely available techniques. One such technique is known as \u201csecure cookies\u201d. A standard cookie is a data packet sent by a web server to a web browser for saving to a file on the host machine. The data packet can be retrieved and transmitted back to the server when requested, such as whenever the browser makes additional requests from the server. A secure cookies refers to a standard cookie that has been secured against modification or tampering.","Another such technique is known as \u201cflash cookies\u201d. Graphical software applications and\/or plug-ins from Macromedia, and generally identified by the trade name \u201cFlash\u201d, are currently resident on many user devices. This software can create local shared objects, known as \u201cflash cookies\u201d, for maintaining locally persistent data on a user's device akin to the standard \u201ccookies\u201d stored by web browsers. Flash cookies can be stored locally on a flash plug-in user's device, are updatable, and have the advantage not being as easily removed from the user's device as are standard cookies.","A second type of device identifying information are the hardware characteristics of the user device and\/or of the user device's network connections. Many types of hardware characteristics can be gathered for device identifying purposes, including: IP addresses, adapter MAC addresses, local time and\/or time zone, network connection speed such as download and\/or upload times, microprocessor type and\/or processing and\/or serial number, and so forth. Software for gathering such information is described in the APPENDIX B to this section.","In step , the captured device identity information (ID), including any previously stored Device ID, is compared to identity information that has previously been stored by the FAAS process in a database referred to as a \u201cdevice\/profile history\u201d (see  in  where the device\/profile history is referred to as \u201cprofile history\u201d). The device history\/profile database includes record(s) associated with and describing previously recognized and\/or identified devices. If it can be established, test , that the captured device information corresponds to information previously stored for a device, the new identifying information updates the device history record for the device in step . One test is matching a unique bit string previously generated by the fingerprint and stored on the user device and in the device history. If there is no corresponding record in the device history database found during test , the a new record is created with the new identity information in step .","Lastly, a new Device ID token is created for the device in step , and in step  is sent to the user device and stored thereon, e.g., as a standard cookie or as a flash cookie. If no Device ID was found on the user device, a new Device ID token is created from the gathered identifying information. If a Device ID was found, it can be updated, e.g., with a new unique bit string, new timestamp, and so forth. At step , the process continues.","A feature of the invention relates to the replacement of the cookie on the user's machine upon each login. This provides further security so that even if a user's machine information is improperly acquired by a third party, even including that embodied in a previous cookie, the authentication system can identify that the user is not authorized and deny access to the system. Of course, access by a different computer often occurs for certain users, and secondary security protocols can be provided to allow access to authorized users. In addition, if access is allowed from a user on a different computer, this can be identified by the software with an implementation of a higher risk of security when the user tries to access applications or other files in the system. Cookies, and device token generally, are also stored for comparison with the token when later retrieved. Thus, stolen fingerprints, tokens, or device ids cannot be fraudulently reused.","The fraud analyzer and alert system (FAAS) process, which is invoked by the fingerprinting process, is described with reference to , illustrating an exemplary flowchart for this process, and with reference to , illustrating an exemplary implementation of this process. Generally, the function of the FAAS is \u201cto represent\u201d the user's and service provider's instructions concerning how best to carry out authentication in view of risk information relating to the device making an access request and optionally in view of the nature of the request. In the preferred embodiments, the user's and service provider's instructions are represented by rules. A rules engine component of the FAAS evaluates access requests in view of available fraud risk information in order to determine authentication interface selection criteria. In alternate embodiments, other techniques can be used to evaluate access requests and to determine interface selection criteria. For example, the rules and rules engine can be replaced by statistical analysis techniques, neural network techniques, and so forth. See, e.g., Duda et al., -2nd ed., 2000.","Turning to , FAAS  is illustrated and described with reference to its inputs, outputs, internal data structures, and processing components. Most external inputs are processed by the data sources processing module . This module receives external data and formats and\/or otherwise prepares it for use by the rules engine . One external input is the device identifying information just gathered by the fingerprinting process  concerning the device from which the current access request originates. This gathered information preferably includes (and\/or is encapsulated in) the Device ID and also can include IP addresses, secure and Flash cookies, CPU type, etc. This identifying information is used to cross reference the device\/profile history database  in order to determine if the current device has previously accessed the service provider system. If so, information stored therein and associated with the current device, e.g., risk information, is retrieved and input to the data sources processing module. The device\/profile database is updated with the current identifying information. Where a device cannot be uniquely identified, this information refers to a group of similar devices including the current device.","Another external input to the data sources processing module from the service provider system is transaction-based input . Transaction-based input  comprises input regarding the specific transaction being requested by a user device, e.g., purchase amount, transfer amount, type of transfer requested, for which a service provider or user may wish to handle specially by storing a rule in rules definition module . For example, the service provider may wish to receive an alert and\/or invoke a higher security authentication interface before purchase requests over a certain amount are sent to the server.","Another external input to the data sources processing module is from a flagged devices central repository (DCR) . The DCR is a database of historical fraud risk information derived from the service provider and preferably also from other service providers. The information is derived from the fingerprinting and FAAS processes.","The data sources processing modules also preferably receives data from external third-party data providers. These sources can include geolocation service  blacklist service , whitelist service , and so forth. A geolocation service  provides approximate geographic latitude and longitude corresponding to the user device IP address. Geolocation by IP address is a technique of determining the geographic latitude and longitude corresponding to a user by comparing the user's IP address with known locations of other nearby servers and routers. The geolocation service gives its subscribers another arrow in the quiver for battling Internet fraud. The third party blacklist service  typically provides a list containing IP addresses of suspected fraudulent users, e.g., addresses associated with suspected or known fraudulent activity. The third party whitelist service  typically provides a list of IP addresses that have a history of being legitimate, i.e., not associated with fraud.","FAAS processing is preferably performed by the rules engine . This rules engine can be constructed as known in the art to use a predetermined set of rules to determine authentication interface selection criteria. The data sources processing module is coupled to the rules engine in order to make external data readily form. The rules definition module  in order to provide stored rules and actions. Rules are stored in component  of the rules definition module; and actions associated with the rules are stored in storage . Rules can be supplied and stored by a service provider in order that authentication actions can be tailored to the service provider's requirements. The service provider service application  can optionally also have a direct link to the rules engine so that so that the rules engine to request additional authentication guidance from the service provider application.","An exemplary action is to specify a particular authentication interface selection. For example, a rule may specify that where there is receipt of a request from a user device for a transfer of an amount of money over a certain threshold and where the device resides in a location, determined by geolocation information, known for an larger than normal volume of fraudulent activity, the action to be taken is to present a predetermined higher security user interface to the user in order to provide more security against a possible fraudulent transaction.","The rules engine evaluates its input data (and input guidance if any) according to the stored rules and determines interface selection criteria according to the stored actions. The interface selection criteria specify the type of authentication interface that should be displayed to the user at the current user device in order to authenticate the current access request. These criteria can, in some embodiments, specify the specific interface to be displayed, or can, in other embodiments, specify interface characteristics, such as level of security.

Additional authentication, if needed, is performed  in accordance with the rules specified by the service provider. For example, optional step  can be where the service provider is a bank or other financial institution which seeks a higher security authentication interface for certain transactions.","Next, the rules engine and\/or service provider system or application, based on the received authentication information, e.g., username and password, entered by the user, decide whether or not to authenticate the user as valid. If the user is valid, processing continues  with the service provider application  at the service provider web server. If the user is not valid, the user is directed to an error message page . Typically, the service provider then blocks user access to the web server and terminates the session connection. Alternatively, the service provide may give the user additional opportunities to present valid user authentication information.","It should be appreciated that the service provider might not give the user an opportunity to use the user entry interface to input authentication information for validation. For example, if, based on the ID information, the user device is identified as posing a major risk of fraud, the system and method of the present invention enables the service provider to require via a rule that a fraud alert be sent to the service provider. The service provider may then respond by terminating the user's connection to the server before enabling entry of the user's authentication information via a user interface. The selection criteria for the initial user interface for display may be predetermined by the service provider.","It should also be appreciated that the user or service provider may request further authentication during the course of a valid already-authenticated session based on, e.g., the transaction being requested. For example, a bank or other financial institution may wish to invoke a higher security authentication interface during a session before transactions over a certain amount are sent to the server.

These memory speeds are measured by transferring the same data block twice. During the first transfer, a data block is loaded into cache; the second time data is transferred from the cache. The block size is increased repeatedly from 2 kB to 2 MB. The transfer speed drops considerably above a certain block size, indicating that the cache has reached full capacity. Cache size can be detected in this way. One could use a pair of MOV instructions in this test\u2014one of the most commonly used instructions. However transfers with a MOV instruction are slower than transfers via a MOVSD instruction, which is used in my second memory test.","Here's a part of an exemplary source code for use for this transfer:\n\n","EST contains source address, ED1 holds target address and ECX contains the number of repetitions. To transfer 4 K, 1024 repetitions are needed, because 32 bits (4 bytes) are transferred at a time. Instruction MOV EAX,[ESI] reads data from source address [ESI] in memory into EAX register in the processor. Second instruction MOV [EDI],EAX writes data from EAX back to target address in memory in [EDI]. Next two instructions ADD ESI,4 and ADD EDX,4 increment pointers to source and target address to point at next 4 byte, which we will transfer. Next instruction DEC ECX decrements the ECX register by one, so that the loop will be repeated only 1023 times. The fast instruction JNZ @WPEAT forces repetition of this loop until ECX reaches zero.","Cache memory is fast and small. It holds Frequently used data which can be accessed quickly in the cache. Cache memory was used on 386 motherboards for the first time. From the 486 processor on, two caches are used. There is a first level cache (L1), which is on-chip, and a second level cache (L2), which is usually on the motherboard. This second level cache is bigger, but slower than the other. In Pentium\u2014class processors the first level cache is divided into code and data cache.","Some on-die cache sizes:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0230","num":"0372"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00018","num":"00018"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Processor:","L1 cache","L2 on-die cache:"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Intel i486SX\/DXDX2","8","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["Intel i4 86DX4","16","kB","256","kb to 1 MB"]},{"entry":["Intel Pentium","16","kB(8 kB + 8 kB)","512","kB (Xeon to 2 MB)"]},{"entry":["Intel Pentium MMX","32","kB(16 kB + 16 kB )",{},{}]},{"entry":["Intel Pentium Pro","32","kB(16 kB + 16 kB )","128","kB"]},{"entry":["Intel Pentium II\/III","32","kB(16 kB + 16 kB )","256","kB"]},{"entry":["Intel Celeron","32","kB(16 kB + 16 kB ))",{},{}]},{"entry":["Intel Celeron A","32","kB(16 kB + 16 kB )","256","kB"]},{"entry":["Intel Pentium III E","32","kB(16 kB + 16 kB )","512","kB"]},{"entry":["AMD Am486DX\/DX2\/DX4","8","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["AMD Am5x86","16","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["AMD K5","24","kB (16 kB + 8 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["AMD K6\/K6-2","64","kB (32 kB + 32 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["AMD K6-I11","64","kB (32 kB + 32 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["AMD Athlon","128","kB (64 kB + 64 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["Cyrix Cx486SLC\/DLC","1","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["Cyrix Cx486S","2","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["Cyrix Cx486DX\/DX2\/DX4","8","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["Cyrix 5x86\/6xS6","16","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["Cyrix 6x86MX\/M-II","64","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["IDT WinChip\/WinChip2","64","kB (32 kB + 32 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["IDT WinChip3","128","kB (64 kB + 64 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["Rise mP6","16","kB (8 kB + 8 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["NexGen Nx586","32","kB (16 kB + 16 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["NexGen Nx686","48","kB (8 kB + 8 kB)",{},{}]},{"entry":["UMC 486","8","kB",{},{}]},{"entry":["IBM 486SLC","16","kB"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"MOVSD test works similarly to the first memory bench. It too measures memory transfer speed, respectively cache transfer speed, but uses MOVSD instructions. This instruction is faster than a pair of MOV instructions, because a modem processor will pre-fetch reads using burst cycles and write-combine data into burst cycles. The method of transferring the data block is similar: ESI contains a source address, ED1 holds a target address and ECX counts the number of repetitions. Then a REP MOVSD instruction is executed. The REP prefix means that the following instruction will be executed repeatedly. Number of repetitions is determined in ECX register, whose value is decreased on every iteration, until the value is zero. Then execution of the REP MOVSD loop finishes. MOVSD instruction moves data from source address [ESI] to target address [EDI] and increases both pointers (ES1 and EDI) to point to the next location.","Calculations","Five mathematical benchmarks are listed below:","A first benchmark calculates a large factorial using integer numbers, so this benchmark only uses the processor (no FPU). The factorial of 10001 is the product of all numbers from 1 to 10001:\n\n10001!=1*2*3* . . . 9998*9999*10000*10001\n","This factorial result is stored in 148 12 bytes (over 14 k3) of memory\u2014a 11 8496-bit number! The result will still fit into an on-die L1 cache in most processors. It will not reflect main memory performance.","A second benchmark calculates the first 30000 prime numbers. This benchmark uses only integer numbers again, so it tests just the processor, and uses about 120 Id3 memory, which is accessed only once. Caching isn't needed.","A lot of intelligent algorithms exist to determine primes, we could use the following:","Number n is prime, if it isn't divisible by numbers bigger than 1 and smaller than n. But it will be enough to find divisibility by numbers (or factors) h m 2 to the square root of number a. All even numbers beyond two can't be primes, because by definition they are divisible by the number two.","A third benchmark calculates the determinant of a 9\u00d79 matrix using Laplace transformation. This benchmark works with (regular) matrices of real numbers, so it will use both the processor and the FPU. A Laplace transformation is based on decomposition of an original matrix into smaller determinants, which are then decomposed etc, until a single number is obtained. In TestCPU this is done by recursive procedure calls. Here's a decomposition of a 3\u00d73 matrix as an example of this benchmark in mathematical terms:","Detecting a User's Modem Speed","Unfortunately, there is no simple way to just call a function and find out the exact speed of a user's Internet connection. The only realistic way to do this is to download a large file from the internet, and then monitor the progress of the download. By measuring how long it takes to download the file based on the size of the download, you can calculate an estimate of the user's connection speed (this is exactly what most browsers' download functions do). More importantly, this calculation isn't just the theoretical connection speed (i.e. 56 Kbps or 1.5 Mbps), it's a real world test between the user's computer and your Internet hosting environment.","However, most users would be really annoyed if they had to sit through an unnecessary download just so you have an idea of what their connection speed is like. So the way around it is to incorporate this monitoring check into a loader movie that preloads an actual download of an authentication interface to be presented to the user. This way, we can get a sense of the user's connection speed without inconveniencing them.","When you click on each of the buttons, you will see the progress of the file being preloaded into your cache.

Next, modem speeds are referred to in kilobits, or thousands of bits, so to find that number we take the total number of bits and divide them by 1000, Finally, we want to know the number of kilobits per second, so we take the total number of kilobits and divide it by the total number of seconds to get the number of kilobits per seconds.","So when the download is done and we are ready to move on to the actual authentication interface (Authenticator) movie, we have a text field all ready that contains a. fairly accurate description of the speed of a user's Internet connection."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing aspects and the attendant advantages of the present invention will become more readily appreciated by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 10B","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 10C","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 10D","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 10E","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 13A and 13C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 13B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A-D"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
