title: Three-dimensional metamaterials
abstract: A fabrication method is capable of creating canonical metamaterial structures arrayed in a three-dimensional geometry. The method uses a membrane suspended over a cavity with predefined pattern as a directional evaporation mask. Metallic and/or dielectric material can be evaporated at high vacuum through the patterned membrane to deposit resonator structures on the interior walls of the cavity, thereby providing a unit cell of micron-scale dimension. The method can produce volumetric metamaterial structures comprising layers of such unit cells of resonator structures.

DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to metamaterials and, in particular, to three-dimensional metamaterials that operate at infrared and optical frequencies.","Metamaterials are artificially structured materials in which both the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability \u03bc are tunable. Such materials can possess a negative index of refraction and are sometimes referred to as \u201cleft-handed,\u201d when the wave vector is antiparallel to the usual right-handed cross product of the electric and magnetic fields characteristic of naturally occurring materials. Metamaterials have electromagnetic properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with conventional right-handed materials, the most notable being the negative refractivity. These unconventional properties suggest a number of unique applications, including compact aberration-free lenses, subwavelength imaging, and cloaking. However, although materials with negative electric permittivity are readily available at low frequencies, including metals below the ultraviolet region and doped semiconductors in the terahertz and infrared regions, existing materials with negative magnetic permeability typically lose their magnetic activity at much lower frequencies. Therefore, until recently, artificial metamaterials having both negative permittivity and negative permeability in the same frequency range were difficult to realize in practice.","However, in the late 90s, Pendry proposed a practical split-ring resonator (SRR) structure that can be used to achieve a negative permeability in the vicinity of a magnetic resonance frequency. See J. B. Pendry et al. 47, 2075 (1999). When combined with continuous wires, one can simultaneously obtain a negative permittivity and a negative permeability, thereby exhibiting a left-handed index of refraction. See D. R. Smith et al., 84, 4184 (2000). As shown in  the simplest form of the SRR  is planar metallic ring  with a gap . The ring  has an outer dimension l and a metal linewidth w. The gap  has a width g. In essence, the SRR  is a small LC circuit consisting of an inductance L and a capacitance C. The ring  forms one winding of a coil (the inductance), and the ends form the plates of a capacitor. Electromagnetic radiation directed into the plane of the SRR induces a ring current I in the ring. Metamaterials comprise an array of such subwavelength metallic resonator structures within or on an electrically insulating or semiconducting substrate. Dense packing of SRRs, using lattice constants smaller than the LC resonance wavelength, creates a metamaterial that can exhibit a magnetic and electric resonance at the resonant frequency, \u03c9=1\/\u221a{square root over (LC)}. Two resonances are observed when exciting the SRR structure shown with incident radiation having polarization perpendicular to the gap (i.e., electric field E parallel to the arm containing the gap, as shown). The LC resonance corresponding to the ring current leads to a magnetic dipole moment perpendicular to the SRR plane and an electric dipole moment parallel to the incident electric field. A shorter wavelength Mie resonance is also excited, corresponding to an electric dipole oscillating in the arm opposite the gap. With incident radiation polarized parallel to the gap, only a Mie resonance corresponding to electric dipoles oscillating in the two arms parallel to the gap is observed. The resonances can be strengthened by adding additional, concentric rings, each ring having a gap, to the simple SRR structure. Other resonant structures can also be designed and implemented.","In principle, the resonator response is scalable from radio to infrared and optical frequencies. See D. R. Smith et al., 84, 4184 (2000); J. B. Pendry et al., 312, 1780 (2006); R A. Shelby et al., 292, 77 (2001); and C. Enkrich et al., 95, 203901 (2005). For the simple SRR described above, both the inductance and capacitance scale proportionally to SRR size, provided that all SRR dimensions are scaled down simultaneously and that the metal retains a high conductivity. Therefore, the resonant frequency scales inversely with a normalized size. Therefore, metamaterials have the potential to provide a scale-invariant design paradigm to create functional materials which can enhance our ability to manipulate, control, and detect electromagnetic radiation.","In practice, however, extrapolation of metamaterial concepts to shorter wavelengths has challenged every aspect of design, electromagnetic modeling, micro-fabrication and optical characterization. Material losses have scaled non-linearly with reduction in dimension, while the design space has focused predominately on planar SRRs, cut-wire pairs (CWPs), or fishnet-like structures. In particular, ohmic losses in metal become significant at optical\/IR frequencies. Fabrication of planar optical\/IR metamaterial structures such as SRRs and CWPs typically requires advanced lithography, such as e-beam, just to achieve patterning at these dimensions. For example, infrared metamaterials require linewidths in the hundreds of nanometers size scale, which is difficult for all but cutting edge lithography. See J. B. Pendry et al., 47, 2075 (1999); V. M. Shalaev et al., 30, 3356 (2005); and S. Zhang et al., 95, 137404 (2005).","Further, planar metamaterial structures are highly anisotropic. Therefore, many device applications require the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) metamaterials. Such 3D structures enable full coupling of incident electromagnetic radiation in two or three orthogonal directions. 3D metamaterial fabrication at microwave frequencies is aided by the ability to fabricate optimal resonator structures and then assemble them into the optimal 3D metamaterial geometry. However, the creation and assembly of 3D geometries at size scales required for IR and optical metamaterials is inherently difficult. In particular, the placement\/orientation of the resultant structure out of the plane of fabrication is not currently possible at scales suitable for IR and optical frequencies. The vision of truly isotropic 3D metamaterials operating in the IR and visible wavelength ranges will require breakthrough advances in fabrication to achieve relevant sub-wavelength dimensions. As a result, most published work on fabrication of 3D metamaterials in the optical\/IR wavelength range leverages e-beam written planar or stacked planar structures, while modeling has predominately focused on planar, stacked planar, and\/or 3D cubic structures.","The present invention enables the fabrication of 3D metamaterials with micron-scale characteristic dimensions. The method relies on standard lithography to create the canonical metamaterial resonator geometry (SRR, CWP, etc), but then uses a combination of processing sequence and directional projection evaporation to replicate the resonator geometry onto surfaces normal to the lithography plane. The invention also enables fabrication of resonators on curved surfaces with radius of curvature on the order of the size of the resonator. The result is a methodology for construction of complex 3D metamaterial structures. The process is scalable to large areas and can be stacked to achieve macroscopic 3D volumes of material.","The present invention is directed to a method for fabricating a three-dimensional metamaterial, comprising forming a patterned membrane over a cavity in a matrix material, wherein the patterned membrane comprises at least one mask opening that images a resonator structure, and depositing at least one resonator structure on an interior surface of the cavity through the patterned membrane. A patterned membrane can be formed over a cavity by forming the patterned membrane over the matrix material and then etching the cavity through the mask opening(s) by self-aligned cavity membrane projection lithography. Alternatively, the patterned membrane can be formed over a cavity by forming a cavity in the matrix material, depositing a sacrificial backfill material into the cavity, planarizing the surface of the deposited sacrificial backfill material, depositing a membrane layer on the planarized backfill material, patterning the membrane layer to provide the mask opening(s), and removing the sacrificial backfill material through the mask opening(s). The patterned membrane can then be removed, for example by a lift off process, to expose the cavity with the deposited resonator structures on the interior surface of the cavity. A volumetric array of metamaterial can be formed by forming a planar array of such unit cell cavities in a plane of the matrix material then building up additional planes of unit cells by a layer-by-layer process.","The invention is further directed to a three-dimensional metamaterial comprising a plurality of unit cells, wherein each unit cell comprises at least one resonator structure on an inner surface of a cavity formed in a matrix material. Multiple layers of planar array of unit cells can provide a volumetric metamaterial.","The method of the present invention enables the fabrication of metamaterial resonators on curved surfaces. In addition to providing a new route to fabrication of micron and sub-micron scale resonators with out-of-plane electrical current components, this method enables the fabrication of resonators with current distributions which are inherently non-coplanar. Given the dramatic demonstrations of metamaterial fabrication and optical behavior using planar \u201catomic\u201d components such as SRRs and cut-wire pairs, the fabrication of resonators with rationally designed arbitrary current distributions can provide more flexibility and performance in metamaterial designs. Creation of truly 3D current paths offers the potential to create atoms with custom designed magnetization vectors, where the resulting induced magnetization vector can be oriented along an arbitrary direction within the unit cell. The fabrication method requires only standard planar processing equipment, but can be used to create a wide variety of complex 3-D metamaterial structures.","The present invention is directed to three-dimensional metamaterials and methods for fabricating such metamaterials. The basic premise behind the membrane projection lithography (MPL) method of the present invention is to use standard planar fabrication techniques to create non-planar structures. The fabrication method enables creation of complex 3D geometries of canonical metamaterial structures. The method can be used to fabricate resonator patterns over large areas using standard semiconductor processing equipment and materials. In principle the method can be used to fabricate metamaterials with unit cell dimensions ranging from centimeters (i.e., RF and microwave metamaterials) to sub-micron dimensions. However, it is particularly useful for the fabrication of IR and optical metamaterials, with unit cell dimensions of approximately 0.1 to 5 microns. The method is flexible and straightforward.","Method of Fabrication by Membrane Projection Lithography",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["21","22","21","22","23","22","24","23","24","23","25","24","24","26","23","26","27","24"]},"A 3D metamaterial can be fabricated using consecutive off-normal and\/or normal depositions of a resonator material through the mask opening . The deposition method preferably comprises a high-vacuum deposition method (e.g., e-bean evaporation or physical vapor deposition) such that the deposited resonator structure accurately replicates the membrane pattern. For example, at step f, a first directional deposition  of the resonator material can be made with a deposition source tilted at 45\u00b0 away from the mask normal N (i.e., at 45\u00b0 into the plane of the figure), thereby depositing a first resonator structure  on the inside of the front wall of the cavity . The top of the membrane layer will also be coated with resonator material. At step g, a second directional deposition  of the resonator material can be made with the deposition source tilted at 45\u00b0 away from the mask normal N and spread out 90\u00b0 azimuthally from the first deposition in the plane of the figure), thereby depositing a second resonator structure  on another interior side wall of the cavity . At step h, two additional off-normal depositions and a normal deposition results in three additional resonator structures , , and  being deposited on the interior side, back, and bottom walls of the cavity . At step i, the coated membrane layer  can then be removed by selective etching of the membrane material , or by lift off of the release layer , to provide a unit cell  comprising a plurality of 3D resonator structures , , , , and  deposited on the inner walls of the exposed cavity .","Alternatively, a portion of a resonator structure can be deposited with each deposition. A composite resonator structure can thereby be fabricated by \u201ctiling\u201d the portions resulting from consecutive depositions at prescribed angles.","A planar array of such 3D unit cells can be formed in a single plane by forming an array of cavities in a matrix material and making consecutive off-normal and normal depositions through a patterned membrane comprising a mask opening above each cavity, as described above. All of the openings can image the same type of resonator structure, or the openings can image different types of resonator structures. For example, one row of openings can image a first type of resonator structure and a second row of openings can image a second type of resonator structure. Further, a volumetric array of unit cells can be formed by a layer-by-layer build up of additional planes of unit cells on a first planar array. To build up additional planes, at step j, another backfill material  can be deposited into the cavities  of each of the unit cells in the first planar array layer. The backfill material  need not be the same as the sacrificial backfill material . Further, the backfill material  may or may not be a sacrificial material. For example, it may be advantageous to create solid 3D metamaterials. Therefore, with the resonators already deposited on the interior walls, the cavities can be backfilled with a permanent backfill material, or the matrix material itself, for improved structural or electromagnetic performance. A second layer of unit cells can then be formed on the first layer be repeating the steps a through i to provide a second planar array layer  on the first layer . If sacrificial, the backfill material  can be then be removed from the first layer. Alternatively, a permanent backfill material can be left in the array layers. Additional layers can be formed by this layer-by-layer build-up process to provide a 3D metamaterial  comprising one or more layers of planar arrays, each plane with one or more 3D unit cells of resonator structures.","With the fabrication method described above, the cavity formation is completely decoupled from the membrane patterning such that these separate steps can be optimized independently for added application functionality. The cavity shape is determined lithographically and therefore is completely flexible (e.g., curved, cylindrical, spherical, ellipsoidal, cubic, prismatoidal, or conic shapes can be formed), depending on the electromagnetic behavior desired. The electromagnetic behavior can also be modified by adjusting the wall width, wall material, and cavity dimensions. The electromagnetic behavior is also affected by resonator structure, symmetry, and orientation, and the number of resonators per unit cell. The exemplary cross structure shown in  is symmetric with respect to projection along the coordinate axes of the cube. If the membrane mask layer is sufficiently thin compared to the lateral dimensions of the pattern, the cross is accurately reproduced on an interior side wall of the cubic cavity after a 45\u00b0 directional deposition. However, resonator structures such as a \u201cC\u201d shaped SRR do not possess this symmetry, and hence will be oriented differently on the different interior faces of cubic cavities. This broken symmetry will influence the electromagnetic behaviour of the resulting 3D metamaterial. Alternatively, it is also possible to expand the extent of the \u201cunit cell\u201d to include the four nearest neighbour cells, and pattern them in such a way that the adjacent interior faces of the cavities possess structures with the appropriate resonator configurations.","The details of the fabrication method will depend on the choice of matrix material, backfill material, and membrane material. Described below are examples of different material combinations that can be used with the method of the present invention. Other material combinations and fabrication variations will be will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","Polysilicon is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. Plasma etching is used to form a cavity in the polysilicon. The cavity is backfilled with sacrificial silicon dioxide and planarized using chemical mechanical polishing. Standard novolak resin photoresist is spun on the planarized backfill and patterned lithographically to image the desired resonator structure. With the membrane patterned, the underlying silicon dioxide can be removed chemically using either liquid or vapor phase HF, which will not dissolve either the photoresist membrane or the silicon matrix. After the evaporations depositing the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material from the resonator depositions, is removed. The void of the cavity provides access to the uncoated back side of the membrane, enabling a lift off process to remove the coated membrane. With a photoresist membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in this lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the photoresist while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","Plasma etching is used to form a cavity in the fused silica. The cavity is backfilled with polysilicon and planarized using chemical mechanical polishing. Standard novolak resin photoresist is spun on the planarized polysilicon and patterned lithographically with the desired resonator pattern. With the membrane patterned, the underlying polysilicon can be removed chemically using vapor phase XeF, which will not dissolve either the photoresist membrane or the fused silica matrix. After the evaporations depositing the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material, is removed. With a photoresist membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in a lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the photoresist while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","Polysilicon is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. Plasma etching is used to form a cavity in the polysilicon. The cavity is backfilled with polyimide and planarized using chemical mechanical polishing. A silicon dioxide release layer is deposited on the planarized polyimide backfill, followed by deposition of a low-stress silicon nitride membrane layer on the release layer. Photoresist is spun on and patterned lithographically with the desired resonator pattern. The oxide\/nitride stack is then patterned with reactive ion etching. With the membrane patterned, the underlying polyimide can be removed using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) developer, which will not dissolve the oxide release layer, the nitride membrane, or the silicon matrix. After the evaporations depositing the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material, is removed. Either liquid or vapor phase HF can dissolve the silicon dioxide release layer, taking with it the coated nitride membrane in a liftoff process. The HF completely dissolves the oxide while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","Polysilicon is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. Plasma etching is used to from a cavity in the polysilicon. The cavity is backfilled with a basic developable polyimide, which when baked below the imidization temperature, is dissolvable in standard basic (TMAH) photoresist developer. The polyimide backfill can be planarized using either an aqueous developer or oxygen plasma etch-back. PMMA is spun on and patterned using e-beam lithography to image the desired resonator pattern. The PMMA developer is a solvent-based methyl isopropyl ketone (MiK), which does not affect the polyimide backfill. With the membrane patterned, the underlying polyimide is dissolved out using standard TMAH photoresist developer. After the evaporations defining the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material, is removed. With a PMMA membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in a lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the PMMA while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","SU-8 is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. SU-8 is an epoxy-based negative photoresist. Optical lithography can be used to pattern the SU-8 with cavities. Therefore, after forming the cavities, the SU-8 can be flood exposed and hard baked to fully crosslink the polymer, making it immune to dissolution from solvents. The cavity is backfilled with a basic developable polyimide, which when baked below the imidization temperature, is dissolvable in standard basic (TMAH) photoresist developer. The polyimide backfill can be planarized using either an aqueous developer or oxygen plasma etch-back. PMMA is spun on and patterned using e-beam lithography with the desired resonator pattern. The PMMA developer is a solvent-based MiK, which does not affect the polyimide backfill. With the membrane patterned, the underlying polyimide is dissolved out using standard TMAH based photoresist develop After the evaporations defining the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is covered with the resonator material, is removed. With a PMMA membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in a lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the PMMA while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","Method of Fabrication by Self-Aligned Cavity Membrane Projection Lithography","In  is shown a schematic illustration of another fabrication method that uses self-aligned cavity membrane projection lithography (SAMPL). The method is capable of generating 3D metamaterials comprising generic resonator structures, such as SRRs and SWPs, on a micron\/sub-micron size scale on concave cavity surfaces with a radius of curvature approximately equal to the resonator structure lateral dimension. The description below focuses on the fabrication of curved cavities and the role of curvature in the electromagnetic response. However, the method can also be used for the fabrication of cubic unit cells, as described previously.","A starting matrix material  is deposited on a suitable substrate. At step a, a membrane material  is deposited on the matrix material . At step b, the membrane can be patterned using standard lithography (e.g., conventional contact lithography, semiconductor stepper, or e-beam lithography) to provide a mask opening  in the patterned membrane . At step c, the mask opening  provides an access port through which the matrix material immediately beneath the opening can be etched away, forming a cavity  in the matrix material beneath the membrane layer. The interaction of the mask pattern symmetry and the isotropy of the matrix material dissolution dictates the cavity shape; for highly isotropic dissolution through a highly symmetric mask pattern, the cavity can be nearly hemispherical, whereas for anisotropic etches or highly asymmetrical mask patterns, the cavity can be a more complex shape. Regardless, the mask opening  images a resonator structure positioned in a self-aligned manner over the resulting cavity . Directional evaporation can be used to deposit the resonator material on the inner surface of the cavity. At steps d-g, multiple depositions , , , and  can occur through the mask opening  at different orientations providing multiple resonator structures , , , and  deposited on the inner surface of the cavity . Finally, at step h, the membrane  can be removed, exposing the cavity  with the deposited resonator structures , , , and  on the inner surface. Multiple cells can be fabricated in a single plane and a volumetric array of unit cells can be formed by a layer-by-layer build up of additional planes of unit cells, as described above.","Polysilicon is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. Standard photoresist is spun on the polysilicon and patterned lithographically to image the desired resonator structure. With the membrane patterned, the underlying silicon immediately beneath the patterned membrane is removed chemically using vapor phase XeFor SF, which will not dissolve the photoresist membrane, forming a self-aligned cavity. After the evaporations depositing the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material from the resonator depositions, is removed. The void of the cavity provides access to the uncoated back side of the membrane, enabling a lift off process to remove the coated membrane. With a photoresist membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in this lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the photoresist while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","Polyimide is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. Standard photoresist is spun on the polyimide and patterned lithographically to image the desired resonator structure. The photoresist developer isotropically dissolves the polyimide immediately beneath the patterned membrane, resulting in a self-aligned cavity. After the evaporations depositing the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material from the resonator depositions, is removed. The void of the cavity provides access to the uncoated back side of the membrane, enabling a lift off process to remove the coated membrane. With a photoresist membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in this lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the photoresist while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.","Silicon oxide is deposited on a substrate with a thickness of the unit cell. Standard photoresist is spun on the oxide and patterned lithographically to image the desired resonator structure. With the membrane patterned, the underlying oxide immediately beneath the patterned membrane is removed chemically using vapor or liquid phase HF, which will not dissolve either the photoresist membrane, forming a self-aligned cavity. After the evaporations depositing the resonators on the inner walls of the cavity, the membrane, which is coated with the resonator material from the resonator depositions, is removed. The void of the cavity provides access to the uncoated back side of the membrane, enabling a lift off process to remove the coated membrane. With a photoresist membrane, acetone can be used to dissolve the coated membrane in this lift off process. The acetone completely dissolves the photoresist while leaving the underlying matrix material untouched.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","i":["a","d "],"sub":"2"},"It is apparent from the SEM images that the lateral dimensions of the cavity were too small to accommodate three non-overlapping replications of the mask pattern. This can be corrected by creating larger cavities, or evaporating at a more oblique angle of incidence. Nevertheless the resulting SEM images show a patterned dielectric with metallic resonators of various shapes positioned on its interior wall. Although the patterned membrane mask was formed using planar lithography, the projection deposition creates resonators which exist on the curved face of the cavity, and hence are inherently non-planar.","An alternative SAMPL method is to pattern the membrane with the full suite of resonator structures to be deposited in the unit cell in a single lithography step. With this alternative, the cavity is still self-aligned but only a single normally incident evaporation can be used to deposit multiple resonator structures in the cavity. A starting matrix material  is deposited on a suitable substrate. At step a, a membrane material  is deposited on the matrix material . At step b, the membrane  can be patterned using standard lithography (e.g., conventional contact lithography, semiconductor stepper, or e-beam lithography) to provide a plurality of mask openings  in the membrane. At step c, the mask openings  provide access ports through which the matrix material  immediately beneath the openings can be etched away to provide a cavity  beneath the membrane layer . The interaction of the mask pattern symmetry and the isotropy of the matrix material dissolution dictates the cavity shape; for highly isotropic dissolution with highly symmetric mask patterns, the cavity can be nearly hemispherical, whereas for anisotropic etches or highly asymmetrical mask patterns, the cavity can be a more complex shape. The mask openings image resonator structures positioned in a self-aligned manner over the cavity. Directional evaporation can be used to deposit the resonator material on the inner surface of the cavity. At steps d, a single directed deposition  through the mask openings  can be used to deposit an equal number of resonator structures  on the inner surface on the cavity  in a self-aligned manner. Finally, at step e, the membrane  can be removed, exposing the cavity  with the deposited resonator structures  on the inner surface.
