{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The subject matter disclosed generally relates to the field of robotics.","2. Background Information","There is a growing need to provide remote health care to patients that have a variety of ailments ranging from Alzheimers to stress disorders. To minimize costs it is desirable to provide home care for such patients. Home care typically requires a periodic visit by a health care provider such as a nurse or some type of assistant. Due to financial and\/or staffing issues the health care provider may not be there when the patient needs some type of assistance. Additionally, existing staff must be continuously trained, which can create a burden on training personnel. It would be desirable to provide a system that would allow a health care provider to remotely care for a patient without being physically present.","Robots have been used in a variety of applications ranging from remote control of hazardous material to assisting in the performance of surgery. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,458 issued to Wang et al. discloses a system that allows a surgeon to perform minimally invasive medical procedures through the use of robotically controlled instruments. One of the robotic arms in the Wang system moves an endoscope which has a camera that allows a surgeon to view a surgical area of a patient.","Tele-robots such as hazardous waste handlers and bomb detectors may contain a camera that allows the operator to view the remote site. Canadian Pat. No. 2289697 issued to Treviranus, et al. discloses a teleconferencing platform that has both a camera and a monitor. The Treviranus patent also discloses embodiments with a mobile platform, and different mechanisms for moving the camera and the monitor.","Publication Application No. US-2003-0050233-A1 discloses a remote robotic system wherein a plurality of remote stations can control a plurality of robotic arms used to perform a minimally invasive medical procedure. Each remote station can receive a video image provided by the endoscope inserted into the patient. The remote stations are linked to the robotic system by a dedicated communication link. The dedicated link is required to insure communication quality during the performance of a remote surgical procedure. Dedicated links are not practical for a robotic product that can be used by a number of operators.","A robotic system that includes a robot and a remote station that communicate through a broadband network. Control commands can be sent from the remote station to the robot through the broadband network. Reporting commands can be sent to the remote station from the robot.","Disclosed is a robotic system that includes a robot and a remote station. The remote station can generate control commands that are transmitted to the robot through a broadband network. The control commands can be interpreted by the robot to induce action such as robot movement or focusing a robot camera. The robot can generate reporting commands that are transmitted to the remote station through the broadband network. The reporting commands can provide positional feedback or system reports on the robot.","Referring to the drawings more particularly by reference numbers,  shows a robotic system . The robotic system  includes a robot , a base station  and a remote control station . The remote control station  may be coupled to the base station  through a network . By way of example, the network  may be either a packet switched network such as the Internet, or a circuit switched network such has a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other broadband system. The base station  may be coupled to the network  by a modem  or other broadband network interface device.","The remote control station  may include a computer  that has a monitor , a camera , a microphone  and a speaker . The computer  may also contain an input device  such as a joystick or a mouse. The control station  is typically located in a place that is remote from the robot . Although only one robot  and one station  are shown, it is to be understood that the system  may have a plurality of robots  and\/or a plurality of remote stations that communicate through the broadband network. In general any number of robots  may be controlled by any number of remote stations. For example, one remote station  may be coupled to a plurality of robots , or one robot  may be coupled to a plurality of remote stations .","The robot  includes a movement platform  that is attached to a robot housing . Also attached to the robot housing  are a camera , a monitor , a microphone(s)  and a speaker . The microphone  and speaker  may create a stereophonic sound. The robot  may also have an antenna  that is wirelessly coupled to an antenna  of the base station . The system  allows a user at the remote control station  to move the robot  through the input device . The robot camera  is coupled to the remote monitor  so that a user at the remote station  can view a patient. Likewise, the robot monitor  is coupled to the remote camera  so that the patient can view the user. The microphones  and , and speakers  and , allow for audible communication between the patient and the user.","Each remote station computer  may operate Microsoft OS software and WINDOWS XP or other operating systems such as LINUX. The remote computer  may also operate a video driver, a camera driver, an audio driver and a joystick driver. The video images may be transmitted and received with compression software such as MPEG CODEC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3","b":["12","12","50","52","50","54","56","38","58","40","60","62","40"]},"The speaker  is coupled to the bus  by a digital to analog converter . The microphone  is coupled to the bus  by an analog to digital converter . The high level controller  may also contain random access memory (RAM) device , a non-volatile RAM device  and a mass storage device  that are all coupled to the bus . The mass storage device  may contain medical files of the patient that can be accessed by the user at the remote control station . For example, the mass storage device  may contain a picture of the patient. The user, particularly a health care provider, can recall the old picture and make a side by side comparison on the monitor  with a present video image of the patient provided by the camera . The robot antennae  may be coupled to a wireless transceiver . By way of example, the transceiver  may transmit and receive information in accordance with IEEE 802.11b.","The controller  may operate with a LINUX OS operating system. The controller  may also operate MS WINDOWS along with video, camera and audio drivers for communication with the remote control station . Video information may be transceived using MPEG CODEC compression techniques. The software may allow the user to send e-mail to the patient and vice versa, or allow the patient to access the Internet. In general the high level controller  operates to control the communication between the robot  and the remote control station .","The high level controller  may be linked to the low level controller  by serial ports  and . The low level controller  includes a processor  that is coupled to a RAM device  and non-volatile RAM device  by a bus . The robot  contains a plurality of motors  and motor encoders . The encoders  provide feedback information regarding the output of the motors . The motors  can be coupled to the bus  by a digital to analog converter  and a driver amplifier . The encoders  can be coupled to the bus  by a decoder . The robot  also has a number of proximity sensors  (see also ). The position sensors  can be coupled to the bus  by a signal conditioning circuit  and an analog to digital converter .","The low level controller  runs software routines that mechanically actuate the robot . For example, the low level controller  provides instructions to actuate the movement platform to move the robot . The low level controller  may receive movement instructions from the high level controller . The movement instructions may be received as movement commands from the remote control station . Although two controllers are shown, it is to be understood that the robot  may have one controller controlling the high and low level functions.","The various electrical devices of the robot  may be powered by a battery(ies) . The battery  may be recharged by a battery recharger station  (see also ). The low level controller  may include a battery control circuit  that senses the power level of the battery . The low level controller  can sense when the power falls below a threshold and then send a message to the high level controller . The high level controller  may include a power management software routine that causes the robot  to move so that the battery  is coupled to the recharger  when the battery power falls below a threshold value. Alternatively, the user can direct the robot  to the battery recharger . Additionally, the battery  may be replaced or the robot  may be coupled to a wall power outlet by an electrical cord (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["12","12","110","112","110","12"]},"The robot  may have an pedestal assembly  that supports the camera  and the monitor . The pedestal assembly  may have two degrees of freedom so that the camera  and monitor  can be swiveled and pivoted as indicated by the arrows.","As shown in  the holonomic platform  may include three roller assemblies  that are mounted to a base plate . The roller assemblies  are typically equally spaced about the platform  and allow for movement in any direction, although it is to be understood that the assemblies may not be equally spaced.","The robot housing  may include a bumper . The bumper  may be coupled to optical position sensors  that detect when the bumper  has engaged an object. After engagement with the object the robot can determine the direction of contact and prevent further movement into the object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["120","120","124","126","120","128","130","124","126"]},"The transmission rollers  are coupled to a motor assembly . The assembly  corresponds to the motor  shown in . The motor assembly  includes an output pulley  attached to a motor . The output pulley  is coupled to a pair of ball pulleys  by a drive belt . The ball pulleys  are each attached to a transmission bracket . The transmission rollers  are attached to the transmission brackets .","Rotation of the output pulley  rotates the ball pulleys . Rotation of the ball pulleys  causes the transmission rollers  to rotate and spin the ball  through frictional forces. Spinning the ball  will move the robot . The transmission rollers  are constructed to always be in contact with the drive ball . The brackets  allow the transmission rollers  to freely spin in a direction orthogonal to the drive direction when one of the other roller assemblies  is driving and moving the robot .","As shown in , the pedestal assembly  may include a motor  that is coupled to a gear  by a belt . The gear  is attached to a shaft . The shaft  is attached to an arm  that is coupled to the camera  and monitor  by a bracket . Activation of the motor  rotates the gear  and sleeve , and causes the camera  and monitor  to swivel (see also ) as indicated by the arrows .","As shown in , the assembly  may further include a tilt motor  within the arm  that can cause the monitor  and camera  to pivot as indicated by the arrows . The tilt motor  may rotate a worm  that rotates a worm gear . The pin  is rigidly attached to both the worm gear  and the bracket  so that rotation of the gear  pivots the camera  and the monitor . The camera  may also include a zoom feature to provide yet another degree of freedom for the operator.","In operation, the robot  may be placed in a home or a facility where one or more patients are to be monitored and\/or assisted. The facility may be a hospital or a residential care facility. By way of example, the robot  may be placed in a home where a health care provider may monitor and\/or assist the patient. Likewise, a friend or family member may communicate with the patient. The cameras and monitors at both the robot and remote control stations allow for teleconferencing between the patient and the person at the remote station(s).","The robot  can be maneuvered through the home or facility by manipulating the input device  at a remote station . The robot  may be controlled by a number of different users. To accommodate for this the robot may have an arbitration system. The arbitration system may be integrated into the operating system of the robot . For example, the arbitration technique may be embedded into the operating system of the high-level controller .","By way of example, the users may be divided into classes that include the robot itself, a local user, a caregiver, a doctor, a family member, or a service provider. The robot  may override input commands that conflict with robot operation. For example, if the robot runs into a wall, the system may ignore all additional commands to continue in the direction of the wall. A local user is a person who is physically present with the robot. The robot could have an input device that allows local operation. For example, the robot may incorporate a voice recognition system that receives and interprets audible commands.","A caregiver is someone who remotely monitors the patient. A doctor is a medical professional who can remotely control the robot and also access medical files contained in the robot memory. The family and service users remotely access the robot. The service user may service the system such as by upgrading software, or setting operational parameters.","The robot  may operate in one of two different modes; an exclusive mode, or a sharing mode. In the exclusive mode only one user has access control of the robot. The exclusive mode may have a priority assigned to each type of user. By way of example, the priority may be in order of local, doctor, caregiver, family and then service user. In the sharing mode two or more users may share access with the robot. For example, a caregiver may have access to the robot, the caregiver may then enter the sharing mode to allow a doctor to also access the robot. Both the caregiver and the doctor can conduct a simultaneous teleconference with the patient.","The arbitration scheme may have one of four mechanisms; notification, timeouts, queue and call back. The notification mechanism may inform either a present user or a requesting user that another user has, or wants, access to the robot. The timeout mechanism gives certain types of users a prescribed amount of time to finish access to the robot. The queue mechanism is an orderly waiting list for access to the robot. The call back mechanism informs a user that the robot can be accessed. By way of example, a family user may receive an e-mail message that the robot is free for usage. Tables I and II, show how the mechanisms resolve access request from the various users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
