title: Accessing protected content in a rights-management architecture
abstract: A digital rights management system for the distribution, protection and use of electronic content. The system includes a client architecture which receives content, where the content is preferably protected by encryption and may include a license and individualization features. Content is protected at several levels, including: no protection; source-sealed; individually-sealed (or “inscribed”); source-signed; and fully-individualized (or “owner exclusive”). The client also includes and/or receives components which permit the access and protection of the encrypted content, as well as components that allow content to be provided to the client in a form that is individualized for the client. In some cases, access to the content will be governed by a rights construct defined in the license bound to the content. The client components include an object which accesses encrypted content, an object that parses the license and enforces the rights in the license, an object which obtains protection software and data that is individualized for the client and/or the persona operating the client, and a script of instructions that provides individualization information to a distributor of content so that the content may be individualized for the client and/or its operating persona. Content is generally protected by encrypting it with a key and then sealing the key into the content in a way that binds it to the meta-data associated with the content. In some instances, the key may also be encrypted in such a way as to be accessible only by the use of individualized protection software installed on the client, thereby binding use of the content to a particular client or set of clients.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED CASES","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/107,660, filed Apr. 14, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,562,395, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/604,946, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Accessing Protected Content in a Rights-Management Architecture,\u201d filed on Jun. 27, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,996,720, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/172,319 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Digital Rights Management,\u201d and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/172,318 entitled \u201cSystem for Distributing Content Having Multilevel Security Protection,\u201d both filed on Dec. 17, 1999, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates generally to distribution of electronic content, and, more particularly, to systems and methods for accessing protected content in a rights-management architecture.","As the availability and use of computers and palm-sized electronic devices has increased, it has become common for documents to be transmitted and viewed electronically. With improvements in the speed and facility of communication over infrastructures such as the Internet, there is a tremendous drive to provide enhanced services and content to the devices. Examples of services and content that may be provided are authored works, such as books or other textual material. Electronic distribution of text documents is both faster and cheaper than conventional distribution of paper copies. The same principle applies to non-text content, such as audio and video: electronic distribution of such content is generally faster and cheaper than the delivery of such content on conventional media (e.g., magnetic tape or optical disk). However, the low cost and instantaneity of electronic distribution, in combination with the ease of copying electronic content, is at odds with controlled distribution in a manner that protects the rights of the owners of the distributed works.","Once an electronic document is transmitted to one party, it may be easily copied and distributed to others without authorization by the owner of rights in the electronic document or, often, without even the owner's knowledge. This type of illicit document distribution may deprive the author or content provider of royalties and\/or income. A problem with many present delivery schemes is that they may make no provisions for protecting ownership rights. Other systems attempt to protect ownership rights, but however, are cumbersome and inflexible and make the viewing\/reading of the authored works (or otherwise rendering the authored works, in the case of non-text content such as music, video, etc.) difficult for the purchaser.","Thus, in view of the above, there is a need for an improved digital rights management system that allows of delivery of electronic works to purchasers in a manner that protects ownership rights, while also being flexible and easy to use. There is also a need for the system that provides flexible levels of security protection and is operable on several client platforms such that electronic content may be viewed\/rendered by its purchaser on each platform. The digital rights management system of the present invention advantageously provides solutions to the above problems which protect the intellectual property rights of content owners and allow for authors or other content owners to be compensated for their creative efforts, while ensuring that purchasers are not over-burdened by the protection mechanism.","An architecture for a content-rendering client in a digital rights management (\u201cDRM\u201d) system is provided. The architecture includes a rendering application (e.g., a text-viewing application or \u201creader\u201d) which renders content protected by the DRM system. The architecture also includes various security features that guard against unauthorized distribution or use of protected content, as well as software components that navigate the security features to allow content to be rendered in an appropriate client environment.","In accordance with the architecture provided, content may be protected at a plurality of levels, including: no protection, source sealed, individually sealed (or \u201cinscribed\u201d), source signed, and fully individualized (or \u201cowner exclusive\u201d). \u201cNo protection\u201d content is distributed in an unencrypted format. \u201cSource sealed\u201d and \u201cindividually sealed\u201d content is encrypted and bundled with an cryptographic key (the \u201ccontent key\u201d) that is cryptographically sealed with certain rights-management data associated with the content, such that the key cannot be retrieved if the rights-management data has been altered. The distinction between \u201csource\u201d and \u201cindividual\u201d sealing is that \u201cindividually sealed\u201d content includes in the rights-management data information pertinent to the rightful owner (e.g., the owner's name, credit card number, receipt number or transaction ID for the purchase transaction, etc.), such that this information cannot be removed from a working copy of the content, thereby allowing for detection of unauthorized distributors. The particular type of information included is determined by the retailer of the copy. \u201cSigned\u201d content is cryptographically signed in such a way that the rendering application can verify its authenticity, or the authenticity of its distribution channel. \u201cFully individualized\u201d content is encrypted content provided with a decryption key that has not merely been sealed with the rights-management information, but also encrypted in such a way that it cannot be accessed in the absence of a \u201csecure repository\u201d and \u201cactivation certificate,\u201d which are issued only to a particular client or set of clients, thereby limiting the use of such content to a finite number of installations. \u201cFully individualized\u201d content also includes a license, which specifies the rights that a user may exercise with respect to the content.","In one embodiment of the invention, the client is used for reading books or text, which are distributed to the client in a file having protection as described above. Preferably, the client software and data relating to the protection and use of the content includes: the rendering application (called the \u201creader\u201d in the case where the content is text); a \u201cmanagement\u201d component that performs unsealing of protected content and certain other cryptographic functions; a software object that provides to content distributors information such as the installation and\/or \u201cactivation\u201d status of the reader application, as well as information about the \u201cactivation\u201d certificate that is needed by the distributor in order to prepare \u201cfully individualized\u201d content whose decryptability is limited to a certain set of readers; and an \u201cactivation\u201d software object that performs the function of obtaining a secure repository and activation certificate for installation on the client. Preferably, the activation software object is embodied as an ACTIVEX control, and the object that provides information to content-distribution sites is embodied as an ACTIVEX and\/or browser plug-in wrapped in one or more Java script functions. Additionally, it is preferable that the management object be operable by the reader application through an API exposed to the reader application.","Preferably, the content key of fully individualized content is encrypted according to a public\/private key pair associated with a particular activation certificate, and a copy of the activation certificate may be provided to various client devices owned or used by a particular person (or \u201cpersona\u201d), such that one person can read the same \u201cfully individualized\u201d content on plural devices owned by that person, whereas other people who own similar devices cannot read that same \u201cfully individualized\u201d content because the necessary activation certificate will not be issued to those persons, thereby limiting the dissemination of fully individualized content.","Other features of the invention are described below.","The present invention is directed to a system for processing and delivery of electronic content wherein the content may be protected at multiple levels. A preferred embodiment of the invention is described, which is directed to the processing and delivery of electronic books, however, the invention is not limited to electronic books and may include all digital content such as video, audio, software executables, data, etc.","Overview","The success of the electronic book industry will undoubtedly require providing the existing book-buying public with an appealing, secure, and familiar experience to acquire all sorts of textual material. This material may include \u201cfree\u201d or low-cost material requiring little copy protection, to \u201cpremium-quality\u201d electronic book titles (herein \u201ceBooks\u201d) requiring comprehensive rights protection. In order to enable a smooth transition from the current distribution and retail model for printed books into an electronic distribution system, an infrastructure must exist to ensure a high level of copy protection for those publications that demand it, while supporting the distribution of titles that require lower levels of protection.","The Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Digital Asset Server (DAS) systems of the present invention advantageously provides such an infrastructure. The present invention makes purchasing an eBook more desirable than \u201cstealing\u201d (e.g., making an unauthorized copy of) an eBook. The non-intrusive DRM system minimizes piracy risk, while increasing the likelihood that any piracy will be offset by increased sales\/distribution of books in the form of eBooks. In addition, the present invention provides retailers with a system that can be rapidly deployed at a low-cost.","The primary users of the system are publishers and retailers, who use and\/or deploy the system to ensure legitimacy of the content sold as well as copy protection. Exemplary users of the system may be the traditional publisher, the \u201cleading edge\u201d publisher, and the \u201chungry author.\u201d The traditional publisher is likely to be concerned about losing revenue from their printed book publishing operation to eBook piracy. The leading edge publisher is not necessarily concerned with isolated incidents of piracy and may appreciate that eBooks commerce will be most successful in a system where consumers develop habits of purchase. Meanwhile, the hungry author, who would like to collect money for the sale of his or her works, is more interested in attribution (e.g., that the author's name be permanently bound to the work).","As will be described in greater detail below, the DRM System of the present invention accomplishes its goals by protecting works, while enabling their rightful use by consumers, by supporting various \u201clevels\u201d of protection. At the lowest level (\u201cLevel \u201d), the content source and\/or provider may choose no protection via unsigned and unsealed (clear-text) eBooks that do not include a license. A next level of protection (\u201cLevel \u201d) is \u201csource sealed,\u201d which means that the content has been encrypted and sealed with a key, where the seal is made using a cryptographic hash of the eBook's title's meta-data (see below) and the key is necessary to decrypt the content. Source sealing guards against tampering with the content or its accompanying meta-data after the title has been sealed, since any change to the meta-data will render the title unusable; however, source sealing does not guarantee authenticity of the a copy of the title (i.e., source sealing does not provide a mechanism to distinguish legitimate copies from unauthorized copies). In the case of the \u201chungry author,\u201d the author's name may be included in the meta-data for permanent binding to the content, thereby satisfying the \u201chungry author's\u201d goal of attribution. A next level of protection (\u201cLevel \u201d) is \u201cindividually sealed\u201d (or \u201cinscribed\u201d). An \u201cindividually sealed\u201d title is an eBook whose meta-data includes information related to the legitimate purchaser (e.g., the user's name or credit card number, the transaction ID or receipt number from the purchase transaction, etc.), such that this information is cryptographically bound to the content when the title is sealed. This level of protection discourages people from distributing copies of the title, since it would be easy to detect the origin of an unauthorized copy (and any change to the meta-data, including the information related to the purchaser, would make it impossible, or at least improbable, that the necessary decryption key could be unsealed).","The next level of protection (\u201cLevel \u201d) is \u201csource signed.\u201d Source signed eBooks are titles that can be authenticated by a \u201creader\u201d (which, as more particularly discussed below, is a user application that enables the reading of eBooks on a computing device, such as a PC, a laptop, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), PocketPC, or a purpose-built reading device). Authenticity may preferably be defined in three varieties: \u201ctool signed,\u201d which guarantees that the eBook title was generated by a trusted conversion and encryption tool; \u201cowner signed,\u201d which is a tool signed eBook that also guarantees the authenticity of the content in the copy (e.g., the owner may be the author or other copyright holder); and \u201cprovider signed,\u201d which is a tool signed eBook that attests to the authenticity of its provider (e.g., the publisher or retailer of the content). The \u201ctool,\u201d the owner, and the provider may each have their own asymmetric key pair to facilitate the creation and validation of digital signatures of the information. A title may be both provider signed and source signed, which facilitates authentication of the distribution channel of the title (e.g., through a signature chain in the copy). The strongest level of protection is \u201cfully individualized\u201d or \u201cowner exclusive\u201d (\u201cLevel \u201d). \u201cFully individualized\u201d titles can only be opened by authenticated reader applications that are \u201cactivated\u201d for a particular user, thereby protecting against porting of a title from one person's reader (or readers) to a reader that is not registered to that person. In order for the reader of the present invention to open a title protected at Level , the Reader must be \u201cactivated\u201d (i.e., the device on which the reader resides must have an activation certificate for a particular persona, and a secure repository). The process of Activation will be described in greater detail below with reference to .","The systems of the present invention also define an architecture for sharing information between a reader, a content provider and a content source, how that information is used to \u201cseal\u201d titles at the various levels, and how that information must be structured. The availability of these choices will enable content sources to pick and choose which content will be sold to what users and using what protection (if any). The particular information may be used to sign and\/or seal titles for use by a reader, and a compatible reader (which, in the case of level , may be a reader activated for a particular persona) may unseal the title and enable reading of the eBook.","System Architecture","As shown in , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional personal computer or network server  or the like, including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read-only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the personal computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . The personal computer or network server  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the personal computer or network server . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read-only memories (ROMs) and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system  (e.g., Windows\u00ae 2000, Windows NT\u00ae, or Windows 95\/98), one or more application programs , other program modules  and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the personal computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite disk, scanner or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port, universal serial bus (USB), or a 1394 high-speed serial port. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers.","The personal computer or network server  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, another network server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the personal computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, Intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the personal computer or network server  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the personal computer or network server  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via the serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer or network server , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Client Architecture","Referring now to , there is illustrated a first exemplary client architecture  in accordance with the present invention. The client architecture  may be implemented on the personal computer  of  or other appropriate computing device, such as a palm-sized computer, laptop computer, or closed device that is purpose-built for reading eBook titles. Client architecture  includes a reader shell  (or \u201creader \u201d) for reading the eBook titles  and a web browser  (e.g., the MICROSOFT\u00ae INTERNET EXPLORER browser) for contacting Retailer\/Distributor sites. A cryptographic transform is provided, which may be a plug-in for an Information Technology Storage System (ITSS) 5.2 . The cryptographic transform is a software component that will unseal the content key and decrypt the content stream coming out of the eBook file or \u201cLIT file\u201d  (shown in ). The cryptographic transform is preferably implemented as an extension to existing ITSS  code being used by the Reader  for LIT files . This extension is instantiated whenever encrypted content is accessed. A Bookplate API  is provided which returns the purchaser's name (or other information related to the purchaser) from the cryptographically hashed Bookplate stream C inside the DRM Storage object  of each title  (e.g., in the case of individually sealed titles that include the purchaser's name or other identifying information in their meta-data). The string returned by this function may be used on the book cover page  to identify the rightful owner of the title ; an example, in which the string is the user's name, is depicted in . If the user clicks on the name displayed (or taps, in the case of touch-screen devices) or a Copyright Notice\/Icon on the cover page, a dialog-box emphasizing the copyrighted nature of the publication may be rendered. Local store  is preferably a directory or folder where eBooks may be stored. (As discussed below in connection with , eBook  is a file containing the content of the book, as well as other information.) For example, when architecture  is implemented on a device operating under one of the MICROSOFT WINDOWS operating systems, local store  may simply be a directory called \u201cC:\\MyLibrary.\u201d Browser  is a typical browsing program (such as the MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER browser or the NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR browser); it is used to contact retail sites that sell eBooks and to engage in transactions with those sites. In some cases, reader  may have an \u201cintegrated bookstore\u201d feature that contacts retail sites and facilitates shopping without the use of a general browsing application .","Referring now to , there is illustrated a second exemplary client architecture \u2032. In the second client architecture, like reference numerals represent like elements as in the first client architecture, and the therefore the descriptions of these like elements are not be repeated below. The DRM Manager  is a component that exposes a set of internal APIs to the reader , which manage the authentication of applications requesting access to encrypted LIT files, in addition to carrying-out decryption of content, unsealing of keys, returning of a Bookplate string (e.g., the user's name for display in the case of, for example, level  or level  titles), etc. For example, the code for reader  may include an interface call that is part of the API, where the call invokes computer-executable instructions to carry out one of the above-listed functions. The computer-executable instructions may be embodied in a COM object and\/or a dynamic-link library (DLL) for use by the reader . Different versions of the COM object and\/or DLL may be provided to accommodate updates to technologies (i.e., to allow reader  to work transparently, though a constant API, with various different DRM technologies, some of which may not even have been developed at the time that the code for reader  was created.) In one example, the developer\/administrator of architecture \u2032 may provide a specification or description of interface (e.g., a set of method names\/labels for the API) to the developer of the reader , and may then provide a DLL or COM object (or successive DLLs and COM objects) to the users of client architecture \u2032. In another example, the developer\/administrator of architecture \u2032 may be the same entity who provides reader , and may define an API for DRM manager  to facilitate communication with the various components of architecture \u2032.","The secure repository  is an executable that is downloaded during the Activation process and enables the Reader to open Fully Individualized (Level ) eBooks (LIT files). The secure repository  is preferably unique (or substantially unique) for each computing device on which architecture \u2032 is implemented (e.g., a PC or purpose-built reading device). Secure repository  holds a private key that is required for opening Level  protected titles. Secure repository  may be obtained during the activation process (described below). In one example, the computing device on which architecture \u2032 resides uploads (via a network, such as network ) a hardware ID to a \u201csecure repository server\u201d (not shown), where the hardware ID is based on hardware associated with the computing device (e.g., by serial numbers or other numbers associated with that hardware) and uniquely identifies the device. The \u201csecure repository server\u201d may then download to the computing device a secure repository whose code is based on, and whose proper execution is preferably tied to, the computing device on which architecture \u2032 is implemented, where the secure repository performs functions including applying a unique private key that is used in the process of unsealing the content key, as well as decrypting the content. In an exemplary embodiment, the content in a level  title is encrypted with a symmetric key, the symmetric key is encrypted with a public key contained in an activation certificate, the encrypted symmetric key is sealed with the title, and the activation certificate's private key is contained in the activation certificate in a form encrypted by the public key of secure repository . In this example, secure repository  decrypts the activation certificate's private key using the private key of secure repository , and then the activation certificate's private key is used to decrypt the symmetric key. A system and method for creating secure repository  is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/604,543, filed on Jun. 27, 2000, and expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The activation ACTIVEX control  is a component used by the client computing device during the activation process (see below). Preferably, ACTIVEX control  is used by a browser (e.g., a MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER browser), which, in turn, is hosted by reader  (although ACTIVEX control  could also work with a stand-alone browser.) The activation ACTIVEX control  exposes methods that provide for the validation of servers (e.g., the \u201cactivation server(s)\u201d) to which reader  (or the computing device on which it resides) is connected, computation of the hardware ID, downloading of secure repository  (and associated activation certificates), and authentication and installation of the downloaded executable. For example, reader  (or another software component) may contain instructions to detect whether reader  has been activated and, if it has not been activated, may issue one or more instructions to activation ACTIVEX control  to perform the activation, and those instructions may include instructions to perform the acts listed above.","The web commerce object  is distributed as both an ACTIVEX control and a NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR\u00ae plug-in. It may be used, via client-side scripting, by retailers when selling fully individualized copies (i.e., Level  protected copies). This COM object  is preferably wrapped by client side script functions, which abstract the actual methods and underlying differences between the plug-in and the ACTIVEX control. The key methods provided by the web commerce object  and its accompanying interface are: detection of the installation of reader , detection of activation status, launching of the reader into the activation process (see, ), retrieval of encrypted PASSPORT ID with which the reader was activated, and retrieval of a (preferably encrypted) activation certificate during download of fully individualized copies (Level  protected). For example, a script (such as a Java script) may be distributed to retailers of eBooks for inclusion in the retailer's web pages. The script may expose function calls that implement the above-listed methods, and the script may include code to determine whether it is being executed by a MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER browser or a NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR browser, where it uses the ACTIVEX control in the first case, and the plug-in in the second case. A retailer may effectively transmit instructions to be performed on the client computing device by transmitting the script that defines the function calls along with script instructions that invoke the functions. For example, a retailer may wish to detect whether reader  is installed on a client's computing device, so the retailer may transmit to the client device a web page containing the Java script that defines the function of detecting whether reader  is installed, along with an instruction to invoke that function. The detecting function itself may include code to perform the detecting function of either the ACTIVEX control or the plug-in depending on the brand of browser the script is executing on. In this way, the particular browser is transparent to the retailer, who may create a single web page that performs any of the above-listed functions on either browser.","eBook File Structure","Referring now to , an exemplary eBook (or \u201cLIT\u201d) file structure is shown. The eBook  contains content , which is text such as a book (or any electronic content, such as audio, video, etc.) that has been encrypted by a key (the \u201ccontent key\u201d), which itself has been encrypted and\/or sealed. In a preferred embodiment, the key is a symmetric key A that is sealed with a cryptographic hash of meta-data  or, in the case of level  titles, with the public key of the user's activation certificate. This key is stored either as a separate stream in a sub-storage section of the eBook file (stream A of DRM Storage  in ) or, in the case of level  titles, in the license. (In the case of level  titles, instead of storing the content key as a separate stream, stream A contains a license, which is a construct that defines the rights that the user can exercise upon purchase of the title. In titles that have a license, the content key is contained within the license.) Also included in the DRM storage  are the source stream B, which may include the name of the publisher (or other content source), as well as the bookplate stream C, which, for individually sealed (level  and\/or level ) titles, includes the consumer's name as provided by the retailer (which may, for example, be obtained as part of the commercial transaction of purchasing an eBook , such as from the consumer's credit card information). The method of calculating the cryptographic hash that encrypts and\/or seals the symmetric key C (or the method of using such cryptographic hash to seal the key) is preferably a \u201csecret\u201d known only to trusted content preparation tools and trusted rendering applications. Using a hash in this way may complicate\/discourage tampering with the meta-data  contained with the eBook . It is noted that any method may be used to \u201cseal\u201d an eBook, so long as such method provide some measure of tamper resistance to the eBook .","In accordance with the present invention, the meta-data  may include a copyright tag, which describes the rights granted to the user or purchaser by the content source (e.g., the publisher). Whenever such tag is present, reader  may display to a user the text included in the tag, for example when the user taps on the name displayed on cover page  (shown in ) in the case of individually sealed copies, or on the \u201cCopyright Notice\u201d link (in the case of source sealed copies with a copyright tag), which may also be rendered on cover page . If the copyright tag is not included in meta-data  by the content source, but the eBook title has been individually sealed (Level ), the reading application based on the disclosed system (e.g., reader ) may render a generic copyright notice such as the following message, or a similar message: \u201cNo part of this electronic publication may be reproduced, re-distributed, or re-transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, printing, photo-copying, recording, or by any information storage and retrieval system, without written consent from the publisher.\u201d It will be appreciated that the act of displaying a copyright notice serves to deter typical users from attempting to copy their eBooks, and such a notice may be displayed at any point during the viewing of an eBook when it is deemed advantageous to remind users that they are viewing proprietary material.","Activating a Reader","As noted above, activation enables a reader client for purchase, download, and viewing of fully individualized (i.e., level ) eBook titles. Because computers running one of the MICROSOFT WINDOWS\u00ae operating system (or other general-purpose operating systems) are essentially open platforms where anyone can debug a running process and create \u201cpatches\u201d (software modification modules) for hacking the security of any application, the need to establish a security framework around the Reader Client is a pre-requisite for providing true copy protection\/resistance. \u201cActivation\u201d is the process by which this framework is established for reader .","It is preferable that the activation process be performed using a \u201cnamespace authority,\u201d such as MICROSOFT\u00ae PASSPORT\u2122, as the activation database. The use of PASSPORT\u2122 advantageously allows the linking of the user's activation certificate to his\/her persona. As used herein, a \u201cpersona\u201d is a unique identifier that can be tied to a user and can be securely authenticated by an out-of-band process\u2014e.g., a username and password form on a web browser for use over a secure socket layer (SSL) is an example embodiment of such an process. Using a \u201cpersona\u201d schema, an individual may read purchased titles on any reader that has been activated using the \u201cpersona\u201d under which the title was purchased. Also, once activated, the activation information may be made available to multiple merchants in order to eliminate the need for server-to-server communications between the merchants and the activation authority, while mitigating privacy concerns.","The process by which a Reader is activated will now be described. Once a user purchases a purpose-built eBooks reading device, or obtains reader software for a PC (e.g., via CD-ROM , or download via a wide-area network  such as the Internet), the user is encouraged to activate the reader the first time the reader is launched (e.g., immediately after Setup for the Laptop\/Desktop application). For example, each time the reader is launched, it may check to see whether it has been activated (or another software object may check whether the reader has been activated). If the reader has not been activated, the reader will render a dialog box reminding the user he or she will not be able to acquire premium titles that require full individualization (i.e., level  protection). An example of such a reminder is:\n\n","The dialog may include buttons to allow the user to activate the reader  (e.g., the dialog box may display two buttons marked \u201cActivate Reader now\u201d and \u201cActivate Reader later\u201d). A \u201ccheckbox\u201d may be included in the dialog box with a message such as \u201cPlease don't show me this message in the future,\u201d which the user would check if he or she has no interest in acquiring level  titles, so that the reader would cease displaying the activation message upon launch. If the Reader has been previously activated, the PASSPORT ID or persona ID of the last user that activated the reader will be rendered as well as in a \u201csplash screen,\u201d such as \u201cActivated for <persona>.\u201d User may also activate the reader from any retail web site, while shopping with a stand-alone browser. In this scenario, merchants may leverage a method exposed by the Reader Web Commerce object  and associated script wrapper API to render a link and\/or button that launches reader  as a separate process. For example, a merchant may include in a web page a script function that launches reader  into its activation feature, which then guides the user through the activation steps, just as if the user had started the reader and launched the activation feature on his own. (As noted above, the script function may perform the launch either using an ACTIVEX control or a plug-in according to what type of browser it is running on.) The merchant may also include in a web page an instruction (using the web commerce object  and associated script wrapper) to first detect whether reader  is activated, and launch the activation process only if reader  has not been previously activated. In another scenario, reader  may be using an \u201cintegrated bookstore\u201d feature of the reader (e.g., a feature that allows the user to shop various web sites that sell eBooks without using a browser), and the activation process may be launchable from (or part of) the \u201cintegrated bookstore\u201d feature of reader .","Assuming the user has decided to activate the reader , the activation process may include the steps illustrated in . At step , the reader client opens into the \u201cintegrated bookstore\u201d section and connects, via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to the activation servers, where users are prompted to login using their PASSPORT\u2122 credentials (step ). If the user does not have a PASSPORT\u2122 account, he\/she will be provided with at link to sign-up for one (step ). It is preferable that the URL to the Activation Server be hard-coded into an Activation ACTIVEX control  using a SSL connection such that the client can guarantee that the servers are truly the activation servers.","Once user is authenticated with PASSPORT\u2122 (step ), a PASSPORT\u2122 API is queried for the user alias and e-mail address (step ). Thereafter, at steps -, the Activation Servers will request that the client (via the ACTIVEX control) upload a unique hardware ID (which, as noted above, may be derived from hardware components on the user's computing device which substantially uniquely identify the user's computing device). Next, it is determined whether this is a first activation for reader  (step ). (In some circumstances, readers may be activated more than once with different PASSPORT IDs; if reader  has been activated with another PASSPORT ID, then a warning is displayed, as depicted at step .)","If it is determined that this is a new activation at step , then it is determined whether the user has activated more than five readers in the past 90 days. If so, then an error message is rendered at step  including a support telephone number, and the process terminates at step . As noted above, the limitation of activating no more than five readers in the past 90 days is merely exemplary. Limiting activation of readers by time and number helps to prevent wide dissemination of a level  eBook title for viewing on thousands (or millions) of readers throughout the world. The \u201cfive readers in ninety days\u201d limitation in the example of  is merely exemplary, however, as other limitations on activation may be imposed without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the activation limitation depicted in  could be extended by allowing additional activations once a predetermined period of time elapses, e.g., one additional activation after a subsequent 90 day period elapses up to a limit of 10 total activations.","If the user has not activated more than five readers within the first 90 days (or is not otherwise precluded from activating reader ), an activation page is rendered (step ) for the user to fill out. If the user transmits the form in an incomplete format (detected at step ), the page may be re-rendered until the user completes the form. Next, at step , it is determined if the present activation is a recovery (i.e., an attempt to \u201creactive\u201d a reader that has been previously activated but become unusable or disabled for some reason). If the present activation is not a recovery, then a new record is created for the user and reader and the number of readers associated with the user is incremented (step ). A pre-generated secure repository key pair is retrieved from a database (step ) and activation certificates are also generated (step ). (As discussed above, the activation certificate may include a public\/private key pair whose private key has been encrypted with the public key of the secure repository key pair.) The activation keys, User ID, and Machine ID are persisted in a database (not shown) at step . Preferably, the secure repository keys are not persisted, and any new secure repository that needs to be created and delivered in the future would have a new key pair (and the activation certificate delivered with that new secure repository may contain the persisted activation key pair, but with the private key encrypted to the (new) public key of the (new) secure repository).","If, at step , it is determined that this activation is a recovery, then an activation certificate is generated (step ) using the stored public\/private key pair from a prior activation (the public\/private key pair being retrieved from the database in which it was persisted at step ), and processing continues at step .","At step , the activation server(s) generate a secure repository executable . Preferably, the secure repository executable  is digitally signed, and based on and\/or bound to a machine ID. The activation server(s) also generate an activation certificate, which is preferably tied to the user's persona through his\/her PASSPORT\u2122 ID). The secure repository executable  and activation certificate are then downloaded to the client (steps  and ). The activation certificate is encrypted during download (e.g., to protect any information contained in the certificate that relates to the persona to which it is tied). The activation certificate is later uploaded to a \u201cdownload\u201d or \u201cfulfillment\u201d server during the eBook acquisition process described below in connection with  (i.e., as part of the process of acquiring a level  title). The user's PASSPORT\u2122 ID is encrypted and stamped in the PC Registry as part of this download (when reader  is installed on a computing device that has a registry), for upload during commercial transactions. The PASSPORT\u2122 ID is stored separately from the activation certificate (even though it may be included in the activation certificate) so that the stored PASSPORT ID may be compared with the PASSPORT ID in the activation certificate during the acquisition of a level  title, thereby helping to prevent theft of content.","At step  it is determined whether the download of secure repository  and the activation certificate has succeeded. If not, an event is logged and the download is attempted again (steps  and ). If the download was successful, then at step , the user may be provided with a page that \u201ccongratulates\u201d him\/her on activating reader  and informing him\/her that the activation process is complete. In one example, the page may include links where the user may obtain \u201cpromotional\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d eBooks. This link will change depending on the promotion (i.e., the server may download a different page with different links if the \u201cpromotion\u201d changes). This link may also leverage a method exposed by the Activation ACTIVEX Control  to return the user to the library page on the reader. The process then terminates at step .","eCommerce Process Flow","Referring now to , an overview of the basic process by which eBook titles are acquired and delivered online is described. It is noted that the reader of the present invention is adapted to interact and operate within a server environment. Such an exemplary server environment is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/604,540, filed on Jun. 27, 2000, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Using a browser or the \u201cintegrated bookstore\u201d feature of reader , the user visits a retail site and chooses book(s) in a manner implemented by the retailer (step ). For example, the site may provide a web page that displays (as links) various books that the user may wish to purchase. The user then pays for the titles (step ), such as by submitting a credit card number (or by referencing a stored credit card number if the user has an account with the site; in one usage, the user's PASSPORT ID may reference such a number or account). The transaction concludes at step  with a receipt page. The receipt page may contain information \u201cconfirming\u201d the order or thanking the user for his\/her order, and also contains links (HTTP POST requests) for downloading each title purchased. For fully individualized titles (level ), a client-side script populates the body of the POST with the activation certificate, via web commerce object . (E.g., web commerce object  is used to retrieve the activation certificate for provision to the retailer's site.) In one example, the activation certificate may be provided to the retailer web site, which then creates an HTTP request (i.e., a POST request) which includes an encrypted blob (i.e., in the body of the POST). The HTTP request (including the encrypted blob) is then rendered as a link at the client site, where the client clicks the link to download the purchased title (as described below). In this example scenario, the HTTP request and encrypted blob (which are generated by the retailer, who, preferably, is in privy with the fulfillment site) contains information that identifies the particular eBook to be provided to the purchaser, as well as information that demonstrates to the fulfillment site that the encrypted blob was generated by a retailer for whom the fulfillment site has agreed to fulfill eBook orders. Additionally, in the case of the purchase of level  titles, client side software adds the activation certificate to the body of the POST to allow the symmetric key of the eBook to be encrypted for use with readers activated to the user's persona.","Upon clicking on any of the links at step , the browser initiates a download from a download or \u201cfulfillment\u201d server specified in the receipt page. For individually sealed (\u201cinscribed\u201d) copies, the download server adds the consumer's name (or other identifying information as determined by the retail site, such as the user's credit card number, a transaction ID, etc.) to the title meta-data and re-seals the symmetric key using the new cryptographic hash resulting from the new meta-data, which now includes such identifying information. (The particular information to be included is determined by the retailer and provided as part of the encrypted blob in the body of the POST.) For fully individualized copies (level ) a license is generated and embedded in the LIT file, in addition to the bookplate being created. This license contains the symmetric key that encrypted the LIT file \u201csealed\u201d with the public key in the activation certificate. When the download is complete (step ), the download server logs the transaction and, on the client, the reader  may be launched automatically (step ). The title may, at this time, be moved into local store\/LIT store , or another folder or directory designated for the storage of eBook titles. Upon launch of the reader , the eBook may be opened to its cover page .","In accordance with the present invention, from an end-user's perspective, there may be no perceptible difference between a level  and a level  protected title. Both include a bookplate (e.g., inclusion of the user's name on the cover page ). Users may only notice the difference if they try to move a level  eBook to an installation where the reader  has not been activated for the persona that purchased the eBook. In this case, a level  title will not open on such a reader , whereas a level  title will open.","DRM System Client Usage Scenarios","The DRM system architecture is driven by several scenarios that consumers of eBooks are expected to encounter. Exemplary scenarios are explained below. Such scenarios include buying a book on impulse, reading a book on multiple readers , activating a reader , and recovering a lost or damaged title. The scenarios have variations according to the level of copy protection chosen by the publication provider. The variations impact the user because they determine in some cases what the user must do in order to acquire and open a title on one or more readers .","Buying a Book on Impulse and Reading","When a consumer browses a retailer's web site using a web browser or a \u201cbookstore\u201d feature inside reader application , he or she may select books to be purchased (e.g., build a \u201cshopping cart\u201d), and proceed to checkout in accordance with the rules and\/or procedures of the retail site. Depending on the level of protection associated with the selected titles (which may, for example, be determined by the retail site, or the content owner on whose behalf the retail site distributes the eBook), the retail site may request information which uniquely identifies the customer. (E.g., if the title is protected at level , the retailer acquires the user's name from a (preferably) trusted source for inclusion in the meta-data, so that a user could not purchase a title under a false name and escape detection if the title is illicitly distributed. In this scenario, other information from which the purchaser can be traced, such as the user's credit card number, a transaction ID, etc., could be used to serve the same purpose) If the title is protected at level , the retail site will also need the activation certificate (preferably obtained by use of web commerce object  an its associated script wrapper) in order to properly encrypt the content key. If the customer\/browser is not able to provide the required information to complete the transaction, the retail site may then provide the customer with the steps that are required (e.g., in the form of a web page that explains the steps and how they may be accomplished and\/or provides hyperlinks to be followed). Upon completing the transaction, it is preferable that the customer receive a receipt to confirm transaction (i.e., an order confirmation page) or receive informational errors reporting issues with processing their transaction in accordance with the retail site's rules and policies. Next, the purchaser follows download instructions embedded in the receipt for the books they purchased, according to the rules and policies set forth by retail site. (E.g., the receipt may contain a hyperlink to be clicked by the user in order to begin the download of an eBook.) After the eBook has been downloaded, it may be opened for reading by reader .","Reading a Book on Multiple Readers","Consumers will expect to be able to read titles on more than one reading platform, e.g., a desktop PC, laptop, palmtop or an eBook device. The DRM System of the present invention provides for such usage. As part of the DRM system, publishers, distributors and merchants may be holders of symmetric keys that are used to encrypt eBooks titles. Preferably, one key is used per title or SKU\/ISBN\/EAN. The symmetric key is required to open the title and is embedded in the license\/DRM stream during the purchase. The process of encrypting and later embedding the symmetric key will be referred to herein as \u201csealing.\u201d It is noted that the symmetric key may be encrypted using a public key associated with the consumer's activation certificate key-pair, or, in the case of source and individually sealed copies, may be encrypted with a cryptographic hash of the meta-data.","In order to read the encrypted title on multiple readers , each instance of the reader  needs to be able to access the symmetric key A embedded in the title's License\/DRM stream. In the case of protected titles that are not fully individualized to a person (e.g., titles at levels , , or ), accessing symmetric key A is accomplished by using (e.g., hashing) the title's meta-data to unseal, and possibly decrypt, the symmetric key A, which is preferably done by DRM manager . In this scenario, the merchant\/distributor of the title encrypts the symmetric key A with a cryptographic hash, which is programmatically generated from a hash of the title's meta-data (which may include the rightful owner's name, for example, in the case of level  titles). Reader  and\/or DRM Manager  then uses the same hash algorithm to unseal the symmetric key. Users that tamper with the contents of the title's meta-data will no longer be able to read the eBook title, since reader software will not be able to decrypt\/unseal the symmetric key A, because the new meta-data would result in a different hash.","In the case of fully-individualized (level ) titles, the symmetric key A is encrypted with the public key of the user's activation certificate and inserted into the license, where the license is inserted into DRM storage  in stream A (see ) prior to download. As discussed above, each reader  activated to a particular persona has an activation certificate containing the public\/private key pair associated with the persona. Thus, a title may be read on any reader  that has been activated to a particular persona. As discussed above, the activation certificate is obtained during the activation process. The aforementioned \u201clicense,\u201d as further discussed below, is a construct that defines the rights that the consumer can exercise upon purchase of the content and, where it is present, it also contains the content key (i.e., the symmetric key).","Client architecture \u2032 decrypts the encrypted symmetric key contained in the license of a level  title by applying the private key from the activation certificate, where the activation certificate private key is stored in encrypted form and is obtained by using secure repository  to apply its public key to the encrypted private key, as discussed above. Beyond ensuring that a reader  has been activated using the credentials (i.e., persona) for which a level  title was prepared, no other action is required to permit a user to read a title on multiple readers . Moreover, even in the case of level  titles, the act of ensuring that the reader is activated to the correct persona takes place implicitly\u2014that is, if the reader  has not been activated to the person with which a level  title is associated, then the reader  will not have access to the activation certificate (and its private key) that allows the reader to access symmetric key A needed to decrypt content steam . All the level  titles purchased for a reader  have their content keys encrypted to the public key included in the activation certificate associated with the reader\/persona. When the user installs or purchases another reader , the user only needs to activate the new reader with the same persona to receive the same activation certificate (or, more precisely, an equivalent activation certificate with the same public\/private key pair, whose private key, as discussed above, is encrypted with the public key of the secure repository resident on the new reading device\/installation).","Yet another alternative for obtaining symmetric key A exists from an OpenCard. OpenCards each contain a key or key pair to which titles are sealed. When the user wishes to read the same titles on a different reader , the reader  must be installed on a device having an OpenCard slot. Accordingly, when the user inserts the OpenCard in the device, the titles are automatically available for reading. Thus, no special steps are required when users want to read OpenCard-based titles on multiple readers , since, in effect, the title is bound to the card rather than to a particular activation certificate and\/or persona.","Upgrading or Replacing the Reader","If a user loses, replaces or upgrades his\/her reader, it is important that the user be able to read previously-purchased titles (e.g., level  titles) on the new Reader. According to an aspect of the invention, enabling users to read previously purchased content on new readers  is performed using the same mechanisms that allow them to read on multiple readers : the new reader  acquires the required activation certificate (i.e., an activation certificate with the key pair contained in previous activation certificates issued to the user's persona).","Enforcing a limit on the number of activations of readers  in the manner described above simplifies the upgrade\/replacement process. As long as the user has not exceeded the applicable limit on activations, he can activate a new\/upgraded\/replacement reader  just as if he were activating another one of several readers owned by that user. A user may \u201ccancel\u201d an activation of an old reader by deleting the activation certificate, but doing so does not necessarily increase the number of available activations for a particular persona, since the activation authority (e.g., the activation servers that users contact to obtain activation certificates and secure repositories ), does not necessarily have any way to verify that the activation certificate has been deleted, or has not been backed up in a recoverable manner. Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, deleting the activation certificate does not \u201creset\u201d the ambient limitation on new activations for a particular persona.","Recovering a Lost or Damaged Title","A user may backup titles, for example, by copying eBook file  to removable magnetic disk , optical disk , or a removable, non-volatile memory card. If the titles ever become lost or damaged on the primary storage of a particular reading device, the titles can be restored from backup storage. However, in the case where titles are, for some reason, not backed up, it may be possible to recover any titles lost or damaged from the retailer. For example, the user may keep the receipt page from a title purchase (i.e., the page that contains the download links), and simply \u201cre-visit\u201d the link to connect to a download server to obtain a new copy of the eBook (\u201cLIT\u201d) file  that embodies the title. Users can keep their receipts locally or alternatively, the retail store may chose to offer customers the service of storing their receipts on retailer's server.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, however, receipts have an expiration time\/date (e.g., the encrypted blob associated with the link that is clicked to contact the download server may have an expiration time\/date incorporated within it), such that clicking a download link more that a predetermined amount of time after it was issued (e.g., one hour) will cause the download server to refuse to download the title. In this case, the retailer may have a record of the purchase and may provide a new copy of the receipt\/download link. In order to recover a lost or damaged eBook title, the user will have to connect to the merchant from which the eBook title was purchased. After the user is identified, the merchant site will present the user with a list of receipts from which the user will choose the appropriate one. The user may then locate the title they wish to recover, and click on the link provided for download. Barring any restrictive policies from the merchant site, the user should be able to re-download the eBook title they lost. It is generally not necessary for the merchant to restrict re-downloading of titles, since the user was always free to copy the title from machine to machine (subject, of course, to the condition that level  titles do not work on readers activated for a persona other than the persona that purchased the title), and thus restricting the re-downloading of titles provides no additional copy protection. It should be observed, however, that the decision to provide free \u201cre-downloading\u201d privileges is within the discretion of the merchant, since the merchant may view the re-downloading as a service for which the merchant desires to collect a fee.","Supporting Multiple Activated Readers on the Same PC","It is preferable that the reader for laptop and desktop PCs be designed to support multiple users sharing the same computer. So long as the users have different local accounts on the PC they share, the reader may store all user-specific data on the appropriate user data-space, keyed off of their respective profiles and \u201ccurrent user\u201d registry values. For example, eBook files  may be stored, for each user, in a directory logically contained within the top-level directory for that user's profile. In the case of the activation process, the process may ensure that the reader  being activated and the components being downloaded (e.g., secure repository  and the activation certificate) are tied to the current user (e.g., the currently logged-in user on a workstation running the MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT operating system).","Additionally, once the reader is activated, it may display the PASSPORT\u2122 name for the user for whom it was activated, for example on a splash screen and a quick settings page. On the quick settings page, the PASSPORT\u2122 name for the user that last activated the reader will be shown immediately above the activation link. This allows for proper handling by the client-side web commerce object  of the activation certificate and encrypted PASSPORT\u2122 ID upload, during the shopping process for fully individualized titles (level  protected).","The process by which multiple users can activate the same reader  on an exemplary shared system is as follows. The Reader will check whether it has been Activated during startup. This check is performed by checking for an ActivationComplete RegKey, under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\eBook\\. Because this RegKey is written to the HKCU branch, it ensures that it will be user-specific and tied to the currently logged on username on the computer. If this RegKey is not found or is not set to 1 (i.e., a successful activation has taken place) the user follows the steps to activate the reader, as discussed above. After the download is complete, the activation ACTIVEX control  queries the operating system for the username for the currently logged on user on the PC. If no username is returned, it will assume \u201cDefaultUser\u201d as the username.","The ACTIVEX control  then queries the registry to find out where the reader was installed. It then creates a directory under the MS Reader installation directory that will be named: .\\<username>\\SecureRepository (<username> as determined by the operating system query). Once the directory is created, the ACTIVEX control  populates the HKCU\\ . . . \\eBook\\SecureRepository key, with the full path to that directory. In that directory, the ACTIVEX control  installs secure repository  and the activation certificate. It then executes secure repository  with the \u201c-install\u201d parameter for self-registration of secure repository . Assuming all of the above steps succeeded, the ACTIVEX control  stamps the ActivationComplete RegKey.","License Format","Below is an exemplary license, which is used for every download of fully individualized titles. The license is a construct that defines the rights that the user can exercise upon purchase of the title, in addition to defining the requirements for unsealing the symmetric key to exercise those rights. Examples of \u201crights\u201d that could be represented in the license are rendering the content (e.g., in the example of text content, reading it on the monitor of a PC), printing the content, or copying-and-pasting portions of the content. It is noted that the exemplary license format is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention as other license formats having greater or lesser information are possible.","It is preferable that language chosen to represent a license is XML, and the format of the license is based on the Extended Rights Markup Language (XrML) Specification. This is a well-suited markup language to describe usage rights in a flexible manner.

It is also the meta-tag for the whole license, which has the following sub-sections: WORK, LICENSOR, LICENSEDPRINCIPALS, and SIGNTURE. WORK contains all the semantic information about the license, including the usage RIGHTS. The contents of this field (including the tags) constitute the data that is hashed and signed. LICENSOR contains information pertaining the entity that issued the license, usually a Retailer. LICENSEDPRINCIPALS contains a series of principals that must be authenticated when exercising the usage rights specified in a license. SIGNATURE contains the hash\/digest of the LICENSEBODY as well as information about how the hash was created, including the algorithm used. It also includes the DIGEST encoded in accordance with the algorithm named by the licensor when issuing the license.
