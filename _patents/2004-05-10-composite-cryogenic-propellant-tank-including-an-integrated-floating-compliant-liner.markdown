title: Composite cryogenic propellant tank including an integrated floating compliant liner
abstract: A tank suitable for containing cryogenic propellant includes an inner liner structure comprised of two layers forming a gap. An intermediary layer comprised of micro-particles is disposed in the gap formed between the two layers of the inner liner structure. A structural overwrap layer covers the inner liner structure in a manner that enables the inner liner structure to float within the structural overwrap layer. The inner floating liner structure can be formed by two thin interlocking (outer and inner) shell s formed in a cylindrical, end dome geometry. The inner and outer shells are both sectioned beyond the tank midpoints. The micro-particles can be comprised of PTFE. An outer structural overwrap comprised of graphite/epoxy covers the double shell liner. A pair of separately fabricated polar bosses seal against the inner of the two interlocking floating liner shells are then each bonded to the tank, fittings, and piping.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The conditions under which this invention was made are such as to entitle the Government of the United States under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force, to the entire right, title and interest therein, including foreign rights.","The present invention is generally related to storage tanks. More particularly, the present invention is related to light-weight, self-sealing cryogenic propellant storage tanks.","Historically, propellant tanks for liquid rockets have been manufactured using metal. Recently, composite tanks made using, for example, graphite or epoxy have been used for storable propellants such as kerosene and as high pressure tanks in order to reduce their structural weight, and thus the overall weight of dependent systems.","Liquid oxygen (LOX), a cryogenic propellant, is one of the most efficient oxidizers from a mass and performance aspect. Other cryogenic propellant fuels include liquid hydrogen and liquid methane. There has been no successful demonstration of cryogenic propellants such as LOX in a high-pressure composite tank. Most composite tank failures using LOX can be attributed to microcracking of the composite resin matrix due to large differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between fibers and the resin used to manufacture such tanks. Also, there are no known resins that won't microcrack under these conditions.","What is needed is a storage tank for use with cryogenic propellants that can withstand thermal expansion and overcome microcracking.","The present inventor proposes a tank design for storing cryogenic propellants. The present invention can withstand thermal contraction normally encountered with the use of cryogenic propellants and related matrix microcracking.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide an integrated floating complaint liner design for tanks that captures a layer of polytetrefluoroethylene (PTFE), or other LOX compatible materials such as Teflon\u00ae, formed as micro-particles to fill in cracks as they are formed.","It is another feature of the present invention to provide an integrated floating complaint liner design for tanks that intentionally decouples composite tank cryogenic liquid containment from the structural pressure vessel.","It is another feature of the present invention to provide an integrated floating complaint liner design for tanks that includes a micro-particle sandwich wherein the micro-particles will compress under load between the floating liner and outer tank wall, resulting in a compacted tank seal.","It is yet another feature of the present invention to provide an integrated floating complaint liner design for tanks wherein each micro-particle operates to form a collective hermetical seal under pressure between the tank wall and floating compliant liner and collectively enables the tank system to survive high numbers of deep thermal cycles.","It is still another feature of the present invention to provide an integrated floating complaint liner design for tanks wherein the micro-particles are comprised of PTFE, which has a low coefficient of friction and facilitates particle redistribution, or equilibrium as voids are filled between the liner and the tank wall.","A tank suitable for containing cryogenic propellant can include an inner liner structure further comprised of two layers forming a radial gap. The intermediary layer can be comprised of LOX compatible materials, such as PTFE, formed as micro-particles disposed in the gap formed between the two layers of the inner liner structure. The structural overwrap layer will cover the inner liner structure in a manner that enables the inner liner structure to float within the structural overwrap layer. The inner floating liner structure is formed with two thin interlocking (outer and inner) composite shells, consisting of a cylindrical section with typical elliptical end dome geometries. The inner and outer shells are both sectioned beyond the tank midpoints. A pair of separately fabricated polar bosses seal against the inner of the two interlocking floating liner shells, typically bonded to each inner shell piece with a toughened epoxy.","The outer shell also performs as the inner tool mold surface for the final outer structural overwrap fabrication process. The outer overwrap reacts all pressure and external forces required by the specific tank design application, relying on the inner tank sandwich to provide the hermetic seal. This is accomplished by allowing the double wall sandwich structure to move in relation to the outer structural overwrap. The shells and overwrap can be made from graphite\/epoxy and fabricated on a filament-winding machine.","As previously mentioned, experiments have shown that carbon fiber\/epoxy materials microcrack when used with cryogenic propellants due to large differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the carbon fiber and epoxy matrix. Acknowledging this limitation, the present inventor developed an integrated floating compliant liner design for tanks.","Referring to , it is a feature of the present invention to provide a tank  that includes an inner floating liner structure . The inner floating liner structure  can include interlocking shells \/ comprised of carbon fiber\/epoxy and formed in a cylindrical, end dome geometry. The interlocking shells \/ can be sectioned to provide surface  and inner  layers that overlap and extend beyond the tank's  midpoints , resulting in interconnections as shown at locations A and B. A pair of separately fabricated polar bosses \/ seal against the inner of the two interlocking floating liner shells \/. The inner floating liner structure  is then enclosed in an outer structural overwrap , which operates as a pressure vessel.","A close in view of the layers forming the entire tank wall is shown at . The inner floating liner structure  is shown to include surface layer  and inner layer  assembled with a cryogenically compatible, inert intermediary micro-particle layer  disposed between the layers \/. Micro-particles used for the micro-particle layer  can range in size from 1-10 microns in diameter. The outer structural overwrap  is then shown enclosing the inner floating liner structure  assembly.","The micro-particles can be comprised of commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene\u2014PTFE\u2014sold under the Teflon\u00ae trademark by DuPont or the DyNeon\u2122 trademark by 3M. PTFE is a vinyl polymer. Polytetrafluoroethylene is made from the monomer tetrafluoroethylene by free radical vinyl polymerization. PTFE is available in micropowders, powders and particles. It should be appreciated that other liquid oxygen compatible materials can be used in place of PTFE to perform as the micro-particles described herein. Reference to PTFE, Teflon\u00ae or DyNeon\u2122 should not be interpreted as a limitation over the scope of the present invention.","When PTFE powders were subjected to Liquid Nitrogen temperatures during testing at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, the material remained as a complaint powder with no apparent change in viscosity. Furthermore, particles cannot react tensile (only compressive) load that would be the result of very large differences between the cryogenic thermal expansion properties of the carbon fiber\/epoxy shell and the PTFE. Finally, PTFE is routinely used in the cryogenics industry as a sealing material and is chemically compatible with all current cryogenic launch vehicle propellants.","The overlapping connection  for the surface layer  associated with the two shells \/ shown at location A in  is illustrated in more detail as a blown up illustration in . Referring to , surface layer  associated with shell  is shown overlapping the surface layer  associated with shell . Micro-particles  are shown creating a seal where the surface layers  overlap. Inner layer  is shown sandwiching the micro particles , and overwrap layer  is shown disposed outside of inner layer .","An exaggerated inner layer gap  as shown at location B in  is illustrated in more detail as a blown up illustration in . Referring to , an inner circumferential liner gap  is shown between inner layer  associated with shell  and inner layer  associated with shell . It can be appreciated that the micro-particles will fill-in the void forming the inner layer gap  that will normally extend around the entire circumference of the tank . Surface layer  is shown sandwiching the micro particles  opposite the inner layer , and overwrap layer  is shown disposed outside of inner layer .","Referring to , a blown up detail illustration of a polar bosses  is provided. Polar boss  is generally shown sealed against the inner surface  of shell liner . The inner ring  and reinforcing structure  for polar boss  is constructed of a carbon fiber\/epoxy laminate structure. Tank plumbing connections (not shown), would typically be attached to the boss via a bolted flange assembly.","During fabrication, two graphite\/epoxy shells can be produced using permanent, non-collapsible mandrels, which can reduce tooling costs. After the shells have been wound and cured over their respective mandrels, they can be sectioned (cut) and removed from the mandrels. The shells are assembled together with the inner surface layer forming an overlap. The assembled double shell inner floating liner structure  can then serve as the mandrel for the second component, an outer structural overwrap , which operates as a pressure vessel. The outer structural overwrap can comprise of graphite\/epoxy wound over the double shell liner. The structural overwrap is allowed to bond to the outer double shell structure during fabrication.","The resulting system is an integrated floating compliant liner design for tanks that captures a layer of micro-particles to fill in and seal cracks as they are formed. The invention can be used as expendable and reusable launch vehicle propellant tanks, to include potential use on the Air Force's evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), Space Operations Vehicle (SOV), and future NASA reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) programs. The invention can also be used as satellite tankage, especially those that will require long term, on-orbit storage of cryogenic propellants, including Space Based Infrared (SBIR) Low, Space Based Laser (SBL), and Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) program satellites. Terrestrial and Airborne applications that require light weight cryogenic structures, including the Airborne Laser (ABL) program and future booster air launch subsystems such as launch tubes and propellant transfer tankage can also benefit from the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The various features of novelty that characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.
