title: Lightweight neutron remmeter
abstract: A lightweight neutron remmeter for measuring neutron equivalent dose with a response range from the thermal energy levels to around 14 MeV is achieved using a center BFproportional neutron detector moderated by enclosure within a cylindrical center tube and two adjacent BFproportional neutron detectors. A cylindrical hydrogenous material covered by a boron loaded rubber wrap moderates the center detector within the center tube. The adjacent neutron detectors are uncovered. In this manner the center detector responds to fast neutrons and the over response to thermal and intermediate energy neutrons is corrected by the adjacent neutron detectors readings and an algorithm implemented by a RADIAC.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Dose equivalent in rem is used to quantify a measure of radiation damage for radiation protection purposes and is typically measured by a detector with a neutron sensitivity that is proportional to the dose equivalent in rem, or Sieverts independently of the energy or direction of the radiation field. This neutron detector commonly referred to as a remmeter responds to radiation similarly to how the human body would respond. Some devices, such as scintillators and proportional counters, produce a signal with an energy that varies with the neutron energy. The difficulty with detecting neutrons is that thermal, or low energy, neutrons are easy to detect but carry little dose equivalent, and that fast, or high energy, neutrons are hard to detect, but carry a large dose equivalent.","Generally, fast neutrons are detected by moderating a thermal neutron detector so that the detectors response is proportional to the dose equivalent in rem. Hydrogenous materials are the most common moderators used. The weight of the remmeter depends on the maximum energy that is to be measured and is largely due to the amount of moderating material required. A requirement that at least a 50 percent response be achieved at a maximum energy of 14 MeV requires a moderator weighing approximately 20 pounds. Additionally, heavily moderated thermal neutron detectors over respond at intermediate neutron energies (1 to 500 keV), so the efficiency is reduced by absorbing those neutrons that reach thermal energy after crossing only part of the moderator.","The Navy presently uses a remmeter called the AN\/PDR-70, which has a right cylinder of hydrogenous moderator surrounding a proportional counter tube. Though its response varies more with direction than a remmeter with a spherical design its efficiency is higher because a cylinder can hold a larger detector. This device has good response but weighs almost 21 pounds and is too heavy for personnel to use for long periods of time.","What is needed is a lightweight remmeter that provides good response across a useful neutron energy range that is more easily portable by personnel.","In accordance with the invention there is provided a new and improved lightweight neutron remmeter having a center proportional BFneutron counter that is moderated by a hydrogenous material and is covered with boron wrapping. The neutron remmeter further has at least one proportional BFneutron counter adjacent the wrapped center neutron counter.","In a preferred arrangement, the detector has two adjacent proportional BFneutron counters on opposite sides of the center neutron counter tube. In this arrangement one of the adjacent counter tubes may be partially wrapped in boron and the second adjacent tube is left uncovered.","In accordance with a preferred arrangement of the lightweight neutron remmeter invention, the neutron counters send signals to a multi-function RADIAC for an output that is based on a calculation that corrects for the thermal neutron over response of the center neutron counter tube. Optionally, this arrangement may be controlled by another microprocessor based measurement and display device including a microcomputer.","For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects thereof, reference is made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and its scope will be pointed out in the appended claims.","Referring now to the example of , a detection system in accordance with the present invention that may be used by personnel to measure fluence. The basic detector  has a center tube , a first outer tube , and a second outer tube . These tubes are connected via connectors  and wires to a multi function RADIAC  for calculation of the dose equivalent in rem. The center tube , the first outer tube  and the second outer tube  may be kept in the proper positions with respect to each other by their cylindrical configuration as shown in  and use of any suitable mechanical means such as straps, glue or other fasteners.","In the example of , each of the outer tubes  and  is a commercially available BFproportional neutron counter having the aluminum detector tube  therein. The first outer tube  and second outer tube  is a BFproportional neutron counter with the aluminum detector tube  therein. In other embodiments of the invention it is possible to have additional outer tubes (not shown) that are spaced equally around the center tube for totals of three, four or more outer tubes. The center tube  uses a moderated BFproportional neutron counter as the aluminum detector tube . Polyethylene  or other suitable hydrogenous material moderates the center BFdetector tube. Approximately one inch of polyethylene  was used in the example of the present invention illustrated in . Additionally, the center tube  is wrapped in a boron-loaded rubber covering . The covering  is boron powder in silicon rubber. The material used in the example covering was made with 61 grams of elemental boron (90% amorph) and 160 ML, RTV-615A silicon rubber compound and 16ML, RTV-615B curing agent.","Alternatively, other materials such as plastic may be used that are loaded with boron or another element with a high capture cross section for neutrons. Suitable elements may be chosen from the group helium, lithium, boron, cadmium, and gadolinium. By moderating a thermal neutron detector such as the BFneutron counter , the detector will be sensitive to neutrons of much higher energies that enter the moderator and are slowed to the thermal range. Alternatively, other thermal neutron detectors such as helium isotope of mass 3 counter tubes and various solid-state detectors may be utilized.","The present invention has a neutron response range from thermal energies up to around 14 MeV. The detector  supplies signals of the neutron counts to the multi function RADIAC  available from SAIC, Thermo Eberline and other manufacturers.","The RADIAC computes the response based on the equation,\n\n\n\nwhere R is the field strength in rem, B is the count rate of the detector tube  within the center tube  and T is the sum of the count rate of the outer counter tubes , , and others that may be used.\n","Aand Aare calculated using mathematical regression techniques from several readings taken in known fields, R, and the recorded Band Tin each ith field. These constants are then programmed into the RADIAC.","The user may then calibrate the device for a particular field of interest by placing the device in a known field R and then computing a calibration constant, A, by the equation,\n\n\/().\n","The device may then be used in unknown fields and an output is displayed on the RADIAC in the form of R in rem calculated by the equation,\n\n(),\n\nwhere Ris the unknown field.\n","The polyethylene core  has a passage to accept the BFproportional neutron counter tube in its aluminum housing . The BFcounter  is level with the top of the cylindrical moderator  and exposed areas except the connector are covered with boron-loaded rubber to avoid a response to thermal neutrons by the center tube  that were not moderated fast neutrons. The bottom of the BFcounter  is covered by polyethylene  and boron loaded rubber in a similar manner as the sides.","In the example of , the basic system configuration is the same. However, in this embodiment the second outer tube  is partially wrapped with boron loaded rubber covering or other suitable covering as discussed with respect to . The center tube  uses a moderated BFproportional neutron counter in an aluminum tube . Polyethylene  or other suitable hydrogenous material moderates the center BFproportional counter tube . Approximately one inch of polyethylene was used in the example of the present invention illustrated in . The center tube  and the second outer tube  are in contact with each other and are wrapped in a boron-loaded rubber covering  that extends around the tubes as shown in . The center tube  and the second outer tube  are placed in contact with one another without boron-loaded rubber between. The central thermal neutron detector  has some fast neutron response because of the moderation of the one-inch of polyethylene cylinder . This central detector  will over respond to thermal and intermediate energy neutrons, however this over response is corrected by the first outer tube  detector  and the partially wrapped second outer tube  detector  and the RADIAC calculations.","The partially wrapped second outer tube  will respond to some fast neutrons that have been moderated by the polyethylene cylinder  and escape through the gap in the covering  between the center tube  and second outer tube . The boron rubber wrapping  in this example serves to shield the center tube  detector  from thermal neutrons and also shields the first outer tube  from neutrons scattered in the moderator . Thus, the first outer tube  will only respond to thermal neutrons and the second outer tube  will respond to thermal neutrons as well as some intermediate energy neutrons that are scattered from the center moderator .","The RADIAC computes the response based on the equation,\n\n\n\nwhere the term \u201cAM\u201d is added to the expression of [21]because the response of the second outer tube  will be different from the response of outer tube .\n","While there have been described what are believed to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it is intended to claim all such changes and modifications that fall within the true scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
