{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["Botanical designation: ","Cultivar denomination: \u2018DUEPAREST\u2019.","The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Ivy plant, botanically known as , and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018Dueparest\u2019.","The new Ivy plant is a naturally-occurring whole plant mutation of a proprietary selection of identified as code number E-16-18, not patented. The new Ivy plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within a population of plants of the parent selection in a controlled greenhouse environment in Rheinberg, Germany in May, 2007.","Asexual reproduction of the new Ivy plant by vegetative terminal cuttings in a controlled greenhouse environment in Rheinberg, Germany since May, 2007, has shown that the unique features of this new Ivy plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.","Plants of the new Ivy have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment and cultural practices such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Dueparest\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Dueparest \u2019as a new and distinct cultivar of Ivy \n\n","Plants of the new Ivy differ primarily from plants of the parent selection in flower color as plants of the parent selection have solid red-colored flowers.","Plants of the new Ivy can be compared to plants of \u2018Duepared\u2019, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No.  19,236. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Rheinberg, Germany, plants of the new Ivy differed primarily from plants of \u2018Duepared\u2019 in plant size as plants of the new Ivy were broader than plants of \u2018Duepared\u2019. In addition, plants of the new Ivy and \u2018Duepared\u2019 differed in flower color as plants of \u2018Duepared\u2019 had red-colored flowers.","The aforementioned photograph and following observations and measurements describe plants grown in Rheinberg, Germany in a glass-covered greenhouse during the summer and under conditions which closely approximate commercial production. During the production of the plants, day and night temperatures averaged 18\u00b0 C. and light levels averaged 4,500 lux. Plants were pinched one time three weeks after planting. Plants had been growing for two months when the photograph and the description were taken. In the detailed description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.\n\n"],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH","p":["The accompanying colored photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Ivy plant, showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type.
