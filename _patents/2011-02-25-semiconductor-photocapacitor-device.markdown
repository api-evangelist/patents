{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to photocapacitors that employ variation in capacitance. In particular, capacitance responds to variation in light intensity primarily, but in the alternate also responds to variation in light frequency.","Photocapacitance has been used by the scientific community for many years to investigate important aspects of semiconductor materials. By scanning the frequency of the light, various deep-level traps can be identified and characterized. For purposes of this disclosure, the term \u201ctrap\u201d inclusively means either a trap or a recombination center, the distinction of which being that a trap generally interacts with only one species of (either) electrons or (else) holes, and a recombination center interacts with both electron and holes. In the literature, the terms are often used interchangeably.","For example, when a sudden change in capacitance is observed, the correlation to the photon energy of the light (determined by E=h\u03bd where h is Planck's constant and \u03bd is the frequency) reveals the activation energy of a state within the band-gap of the material. Further, by identifying the sign of change in the capacitance, the type of trap can be determined, i.e., donor or acceptor-like. In particular, a donor type constitutes a neutral trap when filled with an electron and positively charged when empty; and an acceptor-like type represents a neutral trap when filled with a hole and negatively charged when empty.","Photocapacitance can be used to determine other information as well. There are approximately thirty variations of the photocapacitance method to determine material properties. Summary information of techniques can be found in references: P. Blood and J. W. Orton, \u201cThe electrical characterization of semiconductors,\u201d 41, 2, pp. 157-258 (1978), and C. T. Sah, L. Forbes, L. L. Rosier and A. F. Tasch, Jr., \u201cThermal and Optical Emission and Capture Rates and Cross Sections of Electrons and Holes at Imperfection Centers in Semiconductors from Photo and Dark Junction Current and Capacitance Experiments,\u201d -13, 6 (1970), pp. 759-88.","As mentioned, a common use of photocapacitance in the scientific community is to determine inter-band-gap state information in a semiconductor.  show inter-band-gap state information of a semiconductor material, and the corresponding photocapacitance data, obtained from Blood et al.  shows a representational view  of an electron band-gap  between an upper conduction band edge  and a lower valance band edge .","A photon  having energy E>0.465 eV strikes a trap within the bandgap  to ionize position N at 0.465 eV transferring to the resultant electron  sufficient energy for quantum transition to the conduction band edge .  shows a graphical view  of normalized capacity as a function of photon energy E, with the latter as the abscissa  and the former as the ordinate .","A series of stepped electron capacitance values  demonstrates a series of normalized capacity values from 0.4 eV to about 1.6 eV. Several states are identified at photon energies of 0.465 eV, 0.73 eV, 0.78 eV etc. The state at 0.73 eV shows a positive change in capacitance signifying a donor-like state. By contrast, the nearby state at 0.78 eV shows a negative change in capacitance signifying an acceptor-like state. In this manner, a photocapacitor can respond to the photon energy (frequency) as provided in various exemplary embodiments. In addition, other exemplary embodiments provide for controlling capacitance by changing the light intensity.","The photocapacitor has not been commercially exploited, but such a device has advantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Previously, the capacitance of commercial semiconductor capacitors could be varied by means of applied voltage. Such devices, known as varactors, require connection wires that could interfere in materials, such as electromagnetic applications, for example.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a photocapacitor device for responding to photons having at least a specified energy. The exemplary photocapacitive device includes a first portion composed of a photocapacitive material; a second portion composed of a non-photocapacitive material; and a depletion region disposed between the first and second portions. The photocapacitive and non-photocapacitive materials respectively can have first and second Fermi-energy differences.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Photocapacitance has not been exploited for commercial, defense or other application, so far as known. In various exemplary embodiments, photocapacitance can yield devices in which the value of capacitance can be changed by the intensity of light. This is markedly different from the way the technical community uses photocapacitance where the capacitance changes due to the wavelength of the impinging light, or equivalently its photon energy.","Photon wavelength \u03bb relates to the energy of light (as proportional to the reciprocal of frequency \u03bd) by E=hc\/\u03bb=h\u03bd where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Further, techniques for fabricating the photocapacitor structure are provided that can be used to control desirable properties. Artisans of ordinary skill, e.g., electrical engineers, will find many applications for a photo-sensitive capacitance without departing from the scope of the claims, some uses of which are identified below.","One application for photocapacitance is for tunable metamaterials. Typical metameterials depend on resonances are inherently single frequency. This limitation can be overcome by employing tunability. Metamaterials can be used in lenses, cloaking envelopes, antennaes and other electromagnetic applications.","Another application of the photocapacitor includes a wide dynamic range optical sensor. For example, photocapacitors can be fabricated from undoped semi-insulating (USI) gallium arsenide (GaAs) that has sensitivity to light energy at the dominant active trap (second energy level EL2) with an ionization energy of 0.684 eV at 300K. See D. C. Look and Z.-Q. Fang, \u201cOn the energy level of EL2 in GaAs,\u201d -43, 7 (1999), pp. 1317-19 that indicates an energy value less than the band-gap of 1.424 eV at room temperature (293K).","The photocapacitor as described utilizes any one of the interband states as shown in . Rather than employ light of sufficient intensity to ionize the traps associated with that state to a maximum amount, as performed in the scientific community for material characterization purposes, various exemplary embodiments provide a photocapacitor that continuously responds to variable light intensity, thereby effectively riding up or down the sharp transition in capacitance associated with one of in the states shown in . Any state can be chosen for use, or multiple states can be utilized in various exemplary embodiments.","Various exemplary embodiments describe at least one device called a photocapacitor based on a variation of the photocapacitance effect. The photocapacitance effect has been used in scientific discovery to learn properties of semiconductor materials. However, this phenomenon has not otherwise been exploited for purposes of producing a useful device. The photocapacitor described herein employs the light intensity level to control the inherent variation in capacitance, in contrast to the scientific use that normally uses light frequency to obtain information from a corresponding variation in capacitance. Various exemplary embodiments for designing a photocapacitor are described, which can be used to optimize photocapacitor design parameters for useful applications.","In particular, the photocapacitor uses the photocapacitance effect of a semiconductor or semi-insulator material with one or more junctions. Within this disclosure, the term \u201csemiconductor\u201d indicates any one of semiconductor, semi-metal or semi-insulator. The junctions can be alternatively made from one or more of metallic materials, semiconductor materials, semi-metal materials, and quasi-photocapacitor semiconductors (doped differently from the photocapacitor). The junctions can serve both to form the photocapacitance region in a desired way and as electrical terminals.","One example application enables tunability of electromagnetic devices without incorporating wires that can otherwise interfere with such devices. Also, photocapacitance can be used for novel types of sensors and imagers of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet or higher frequency parts of the spectrum, depending on the material, and trap level within the material. Photocapacitance can be used to detect charged or uncharged particles where the particle plays the role of a photon change in capacitance. As another example, electrical engineers employ photocapacitance in electronic circuit applications in which sensitivity to light controls part of the circuit.","Additional example applications of photocapacitance devices include the coupling of output signals of optical communications, or optical computer components and devices, to standard solid state electronic devices and systems. Other examples can be found in tunable electromagnetic devices that include but are not limited to filters (e.g., notch, bandpass, high-pass, lowpass), waveguides that operate above or below the cut-off region, absorbers, transmitting or receiving antennae, and other tunable electromagnetic devices. In yet another example, photocapacitance can be used as a sensor, or part of a detector, in which light detection is secondary to detection of a primary phenomenon, such as chemical or biological agents for example.","In various exemplary embodiments, the use of materials at junctions can control the Fermi-energy position thereby forming a photocapacitor with controllable and desirable properties. The control of the Fermi-energy position at the junction relates to the Fermi-energy position within the bulk material, which can also be controlled. At thermal equilibrium, Fermi-energy remains steady. Outside of thermal equilibrium, such as through photo injection for example, the \u201cimaginary\u201d Fermi-energy is sometimes called Imref for Fermi written backwards.","One well known application involves tuning a split-ring resonator (SRR). This is accomplished by changing the capacitance in the inductorcapacitor circuit of an SRR. Success of this method is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,525,711 to Rule et al., achieving a tunable range ratio of 15:1. See also K. A. Boulais, D. W. Rule, S. Simmons, F. Santiago, V. Gehman, K. Long, and A. Rayms-Keller, \u201cTunable split-ring resonator for metamaterials using photocapacitance of semi-insulating GaAs,\u201d 93, 043518 (2008).","Varactor diodes represent an example alternative technique for varying capacitance, in this case by altering the applied voltage across its terminals. However, these suffer from the limitation that wires must be used to transfer a voltage to each device. The wire can interfere with an application such as for example, electromagnetic applications unless careful and restrictive design considerations are employed. See D. Wang, H. Chen, L. Ran, J. Huangfu, J. A. Kong, and B. Wu, \u201cReconfigurable cloak for multiple operating frequencies,\u201d 93, 043515 (2008).","In an exemplary embodiment, a photocapacitor can be used in conjunction with the varactor effect within the same device. Such operation includes a choice of capacitance variation methods via optical, electrical or both simultaneously.","A single junction semiconductor device can be formed using component configurations such as n-p, n-i, and p-i, where n represents n-type semiconductor, p represents p-type semiconductor, i represents insulating-type semiconductor. Alternatively, the junctions can be metal-semiconductor, e.g., Schottky junctions, such as m-n, m-p, and m-i, where m represents a metal. The components at either end need not be composed of the same material. In some multi-junction devices, photocapacitance may form only at one of the junctions or at multiple junctions. Combinations of these junctions can be used to make multi-junction devices so long as the junction includes a region of photocapacitance.","Capacitance naturally develops when two semiconductors of different types (n, p or i) or a metal and a semiconductor are brought into intimate contact. This contact should be distinguished from an ohmic contact that lacks such capacitance. The capacitance junction can be produced by diffusion of one material into another material, or by epitaxial growth of one material onto another, or by some other methodology established in the semiconductor art.","Capacitance forms over a region naturally depleted of free charge known as the depletion region.

By using doped semiconductors, metals, or even chalcogenides, the built-in potential \u03c6, can be adjusted such that the specified photocapacitance fits a desired function. The relationship between the built-in potential and the capacitance is evident in eqns. (2) through (6).","In some cases, such as typically in GaAs, the Fermi energy is pinned (i.e., restricted) at the semiconductor device. This renders the built-in potential \u03c6difficult to modify. The reasons for pinning are not well understood but at any rate can be compensated for by creating a junction of the same material thereby unpinning the Fermi energy. Controlling the built-in potential of the photocapacitor potential \u03c6can be accomplished by doping the added material, thereby constituting another advantage of this process. This doping material can be, for example, a p-type GaAs on semi-insulating GaAs.","Methods to illuminate the photocapacitor can include direct illumination by a light-emitting diode (LED), an organic LED, a laser, a thermal source or other means so long as the light energy is sufficient to ionize the desired traps. Other means include light-guides that can carry the optical intensity to the photocapacitor from a distance away.","Typically, light having photon energy sufficient to ionize a trap can be used to induce the photocapacitance effect. For photon energy less than the bandgap energy, the light can travel far through the semiconductor to achieve a greater effect. However, light having photon energy greater than the bandgap can be used for some device applications. The photocapacitance effect can be used in conjunction with a varactor. Also, a varactor can be used as the primary source of capacitance, which is thereby controlled through a photovoltaic device, thereby creating a different type of photocapacitor. A varactor can be used to set an effective bias, or sensitivity range for the photocapacitance effect, for example. Light sensor applications can take advantage of a wide range of capacitance values, normally found in photocapacitance, thus enabling creation of a wide dynamic range sensor. The sensor can be fabricated in a pixel array, for example, to be used in a wide dynamic range imager.","Junction capacitance in a semiconductor occurs near a Schottky junction (non-ohmic, metal-semiconductor junction), or a p-n junction. This capacitance exists across the depletion region , and is recognized by those skilled in the art of semiconductor device physics. As described above,  represents the Schottky's electron energy band diagram  that shows a depletion region near the junction of a metal  and an n-type semiconductor . An analogous capacitance exists across the depletion region  for the photocapacitor's electron energy band diagram . The depletion-width is given by xwhere the energy bands curve upwards.","The built-in electric field, due to the energy band curvature between the metal  and the semiconductor , explains the reason the depletion region  is void of free electrons, being swept out. Also, this explains why free electrons (\u2212charge) remain in the bulk semiconductor material  where the electric field may be assumed to be small or null. The depletion capacitanced forms across the depletion region .","For Schottky junctions formed with p-type semiconductors, the curvature of the energy bands in the depletion region  would curve down-wards instead of upwards, and the depletion region  would be void of hole-type charge in a similar way. Depletion regions are also found in p-n junctions in which the depletion regions form within both the n-type and the p-type materials dispersed according to their doping density (Nor N) as provided in eqn. (2).","The Fermi-energy position in the bulk semiconductor  and  is often determined under thermal equilibrium conditions from Fermi-Dirac statistics. The depletion regions  and  stem from proper alignment and control of the relative Fermi-energy positions at the junction, and within the respective semiconductors  and . One advantage of this method is that metals, semiconductors, or other materials can be used to control the Fermi energy difference, thereby controlling the built-in potential \u03c6.","In some cases, such as typically in GaAs, the Fermi energy is pinned (i.e., restricted) at the semiconductor surface. This renders the built-in potential \u03c6difficult to modify. The reasons for the pinning are not well understood but in any case can be compensated for by making a junction of the same material. Controlling the built-in potential of the photocapacitor \u03c6can be accomplished by doping the added material, constituting another advantage of this process. This doping material can be, for example, an n-type GaAs on semi-insulating GaAs.","The EL2 band-gap restriction is only due to the high level of absorption typical for above band-gap photon energy that generally prevents light from penetrating far enough into the semiconductor  as shown in . This application can take advantage of a wide range of capacitance values normally found in photocapacitance, thus making a wide dynamic range sensor. The sensor can be fabricated in a pixel array, for example, to be used in a wide dynamic range imager.","Yet another application of the multi-junction photocapacitor includes an electronic circuit that has sensitivity to light. For example, photodiodes or phototransistors are often used to detect light and perform a task in response. The multi-junction photocapacitor can be used similarly in circuits to perform a task in response to light, in which the task can include switching a device on or off, or controlling the state of a device in a continuous way, or detecting an amount of light impingent on the circuit, or to tune a resonant circuit or frequency. Other electro-optic circuit uses may be also considered and this disclosure should not be limited to those applications discussed here.","Inducing an optical control signal onto a photovoltaic device constitutes another process to provide photocapacitance, in which the photovoltaic device reacts by inducing a voltage and in turn changes Vin eqn. (2). The photovoltaic device can be of a semiconducting nature, a semi-insulating nature or a polymer nature. Very little current (leakage current only) is drawn from the photovoltaic device because the junctions represent back-to-back diodes in reverse bias mode.","The depletion approximation is known to those skilled in the art and has been used to derive eqn. (6). However, with involvement of deep level traps, or small amounts of energy band bending, the depletion approximation may no longer be valid, and numerical techniques may be required to describe the depletion region quantitatively. In some cases, the depletion region might not be completely depleted of free charge. Nonetheless, eqn. (6) is useful to describe photocapacitance qualitatively.","Trap dynamics includes the recombination and generation of electrons and holes with the conduction band and valance band, respectively. The trap dynamics represent an important part of photocapacitance and must be included in numerical solutions. These trap dynamics include interactions with phonons (thermal), photons or other particles, and often described using Shockley-Hall-Read statistics, known to artisans of ordinary skill in semiconductor physics. See W. Shockley and W. T. Read, \u201cStatistics of the Recombinations of Holes and Electrons,\u201d 87, 835 (1952), and R. N. Hall, \u201cElectron-Hole Recombination in Germanium,\u201d 87, 387 (1952). Another parameter that can be controlled includes the ionization energy of the trap density N, also described in Shockley and Read.","Generally, a strong photocapacitance effect requires deep level traps within the band-gap of the semiconductor  in which the ionized traps (+charge) are near mid-gap with an ionized trap density N. These traps are assumed to be donor type, and so free electrons are shown in the conduction band of the bulk material semiconductor  due to trap ionization. For deep traps (although not necessarily near mid-gap), thermal energy at room temperature may generally not be enough to ionize all the traps. For the USI example above, only about 10% of the traps are ionized at room temperature. This can reserve up to 90% of the traps available for ionization by light. The process is similar for acceptor type traps where the ionized trap would be a negative charge.","Without controlling the photocapacitor using voltage, as in a varactor, the applied voltage Vcan be assumed to be zero. In such cases, the depletion capacitance Ccan be approximated as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","d"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u025b","s"]},{"mi":["x","d"]}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"q","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","s"]},"msubsup":{"mi":["N","T"],"mo":"+"}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}}]}},"mo":"."}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"7"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["d","T","T","T","T","d "],"sup":["+","+","+","+","+\u221dP","4","2"],"b":["330","230"],"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","d"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u025b","s"]},{"mi":["L","D"]}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"8"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["D ","i"]},"By contrast, the case of a varactor as described by eqn. (6) shows that any change in applied voltage is summed with the built-in potential \u03c6, and thus affects the energy band bending as shown in . Thus, if the capacitor is used in a resonator, the alternating voltage affects the capacitance in a non-linear way, which can generate harmonics adverse to the application.","Exact analytical forms for the depletion capacitance may be difficult to derive analytically. However, the relationship between capacitance and light intensity can be empirically determined by experiment.  depicts a response curve in a logarithmic plot  for exemplary results from a photocapacitor fabricated from USI GaAs at a fixed light wavelength 975 nm. Aluminum contacts were used to form a two-junction device. Light irradiance P in watts-per-square-centimeter represents the abscissa  and depletion capacitance Cin pico-farads is the ordinate . ( provides another complimentary plot, described further herein.) Experimental results that demonstrate control can be achieved for example by an intensity of less than 5 mW\/cm.","A threshold level  at 100 pf denotes the maximum capacitance for power-law correlation. In this example, the data, represented by an empirical line  of measured values, show the relationship between capacitance and USI to be a correlation line  corresponding to the proportional relation C\u221dP, where P is the flux intensity of light impinging on the photocapacitor. That proportional relation remains valid over much of the photocapacitance range. More exact theoretical relationships can be determined using numerical techniques.","Location of a deep level trap can significantly influence the behavior of photocapacitance, and thus can be used to design photocapacitors with desired properties. For example, if a trap is located above midgap, then a photon having energy less than the bandgap energy Eor h\u03bd<Ecan be used to generate electrons only. Typically traps affect both electrons and holes, and these depend on the trap dynamics.","Various exemplary embodiments disclose techniques to fabricate photocapacitors towards controllable and desirable properties. Two fundamental categories of processes can be used to control the state of photocapacitance: first\u2014control the type, location and density of deep level traps, and second\u2014control the structure that in effect, controls the relative Fermi-energy throughout the structure. Through end of this section, the USI example can be assumed as the exemplary condition. USI photocapacitors have many of the elements that demonstrate the advantages of the methods in this, such as for type, energy location and density of deep level traps.","For USI, eqn. (7) may be rewritten to account for the effects of unintentional shallow donor atoms of density N, and unintentional shallow acceptor atoms of density N, which are usually present in USI. Artisans of ordinary skill recognize that true intrinsic GaAs devices can be difficult to fabricate. Often, such a device includes unintentional states within the band-gap. Deep level traps may often be used to compensate for the unintended dopants so that USI behaves as though it were nearly pure, rendering semi-insulating behavior by depletion capacitance:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00009","num":"00009"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["C","d"]},"mo":"=","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"q","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","s"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["N","d"],"mo":"+"},{"mi":["N","a"],"mo":"-"},{"mi":["N","Tt"],"mo":"+"}],"mo":["-","+","+"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u0394","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["N","To"],"mo":"+"}}}}}},{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}}]}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"9"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["d","a","T","Tt","To","d","a","Tt"],"sup":["+","\u2212","+","+","+","+","\u2212","+"]},"Moreover, eqn.

Yet, another advantage is that the number of p-type shallow acceptors can be increased to match an increased number of deep level donors, thereby increasing the number of free charge in the bulk region while maintaining the condition N=0. This further and significantly decreases loss by increasing the density of free carriers in the bulk region. Another process involves inserting dopants that constitute true traps at mid-gap, and not recombination centers. Yet another advantage involves the ability to employ multiple traps to control both the electron generation and the hole generation by different wavelengths of light.","Various exemplary embodiments provide for controlling design parameters by imposing control of the Fermi-energy levels throughout the structure. Ultimately, this Fermi-energy design process controls the band-bending that creates the depletion region, and therefore the depletion capacitance. As previously described, the band-bending may be subject to the Fermi-energy position at the junction relative to that in the bulk (e.g., the semiconductor). For this disclosure, a step junction may be assumed rather than a graded junction. Alternatively, graded junctions can be used for control in a similar manner, and the concepts herein are not restricted to step junctions.","Generally, a junction may be created at one surface representing a single photocapacitor. At least one photocapacitor can be formed in a single device. However, for purposes of this disclosure, only single junctions are described with the understanding that these single junctions or single photocapacitors do not limit the scope of these embodiments.","Each junction can be fabricated as n-c, p-c, m-c, or combination thereof, where n represents an n-type semiconductor, p represents a p-type semiconductor, c represents a photocapacitive material, and m represents a metal. The material in contact with the c material in all cases is utilized to control the Fermi-level at the c surface. Each junction can be fabricated as i-c where i is an insulator. This process disposes a fixed capacitor formed by the insulator in series with the photocapacitor. The process further reduces loss by preventing the flow of charge across the insulator.","For m-c junctions, common knowledge in the art of semiconductor physics includes that the band bending is a function of the difference in work functions between the metal \u03a6, and the semiconductor \u03a6. Thus, the built-in potential \u03c6in eqn. (10) can be written as:\n\n(\u03a6\u2212\u03a6),\u2003\u2003(14)\n\nwhere the product q\u03c6(of electronic charge and built-in potential) represents the amount of energy band bending in the depletion region.\n","Thus, according to eqn. (10), the initial dark value of capacitance can be controlled by this method through a proper selection of work-functions of the materials. Different metals can be used that have different work functions \u03a6 for any particular semiconductor. Similarly, different photocapacitive semiconductors can be used that have different work functions for any particular metal.","This technique can be used with many photocapacitive materials, but not all. For example, artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that USI has an electrically active surface that tends to set the Fermi-energy at a value nearly independent of the type of metal used at the junction. In such cases, intermediate layers can be used to reduce Fermi-energy pinning.","For example, some chalcogen elements, e.g., selenium (Se) and sulfur (S), have been shown to have a Fermi-energy unpinning effect in GaAs. Thus, sandwiching a thin chalcogen layer between the metal and the photocapacitor enables Fermi-energy control at the junction. This junction would be designated as m-h-c where h represents chalcogen.","Another process to unpin the Fermi-energy position at the surface of the semiconductor uses the same type of semiconductor for the junction instead of a metal, but one that is doped differently than the photocapacitive material. This technique naturally unpins the Fermi-energy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","810","820","830","810","820","830"],"sub":["d1 ","d2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","800","910","820","830","800","920","810","930","910","920","940","950","960","970"],"sub":["d","f-p ","f-c"]},"This technique can also be used, to some extent, to control the initial capacitance (dark value) because those of ordinary skill recognize that the doping level of the p-type material can influence the depletion width in the photocapacitance material. Practical design considerations may suggest a p-type material that is highly doped and more conductive to help control loss in the photocapacitor system. Thus, a junction of this type would be p-c.","More complex structures can be used to further improve performance, such as an m-p-c structure, which enables wire bonding to a metal contact, and that these examples are not limiting. For example, other photocapacitance materials exist in which the traps are acceptor-like. Such structures may involve n-type, or n-type junction materials.","As another example, use of a photovoltaic device can also generate a voltage that, in turn, controls the capacitance of a varactor. This technique can include many advantages of the techniques described above because external wires to an external power supply are not necessary for various exemplary embodiments.","A photocapacitor can also be fabricated using a photovoltaic effect found in some polymers. The photocapacitor can also be fabricated from materials other than semiconductors that demonstrate charge separation in response to light. Poly-9-vinylcarbazole and a variety of other polymers with aromatic or heterocyclic chain units exhibit photo-induced discharge. The photo-response can be strongly improved by doping with a wide variety of electron acceptor molecules.","The same effects may be observed with aromatic or heterocyclic electron donor-type photoconductors when dispersed in non-photoconductive polymer and doped with electron acceptors. The reverse case is given when aromatic or heterocyclic electron acceptors are doped with small amounts (0.1-2 mole %) of electron donors and dispersed in a polymer. For example, photo-conductivity of films of poly-N-epoxypropylcarbazole (PEPC) doped with polymethine dyes (PD) with different iconicity, such as cationic (PD 1-3), squarylium (PD4), neutral (PD5), and anionic (PD6) can be exploited to built an organic photo-capacitor.","Polymethine dyes are used as sensitizers of photoconductivity and electroluminescence in photoconducting polymers based on their ability to convert light energy effectively and of the strong absorption and luminescence bands in a broad spectral region. The absorption maxima of films of PEPC with polymethine dyes are close to the respective wavelengths of light at 565 nm (PD1), 667 nm (PD2), 755 nm (PD3), 655 nm (PD4), 550 nm (PD5), and 560 nm (PD6).","The main advantages of the photocapacitor semiconductor device as described in various exemplary embodiments include the following:","(a) Light is used to control the photocapacitor, often advantageous over the varactor which uses voltage to control the capacitance. Electrical interconnects are thus not required. For example, avoidance of such connectors would benefit a radio frequency device, such as a split-ring resonator, in which wires could interfere with the radio frequency interaction.","(b) Design methods can be implemented in which harmonic generation in AC applications is minimized as opposed to the varactor device.","(c) New types of photo-electric applications are possible including, but not limited to, light-tunable electrical circuits that can be controlled with light tunable capacitance, new types of light detectors and arrays of detectors for light imaging, and new sensors where the sensitivity to light is secondary to a primary sensing method or detection method such as in the detection of biological or chemical agents.","(d) Tunable resonators for metamaterials, antennas, filters and other electromagnetic and\/or electric devices, and interfaces or couplers between optical communication, optical computer components for standard solid state electronic systems.","(e) Devices that can be controlled using light (photocapacitance) and voltage (varactor) simultaneously.","(f) Wide dynamic range detectors.","(g) Detectors of which are difficult to saturate and\/or damage with intense light.","(h) Photocapacitance devices that include one or multiple photocapacitors.","(i) A varactor can be used as a photocapacitor when combined with a photovoltaic device.","(j) A varactor can be used as a photocapacitor when combined with a photovoltaic polymer.","(k) Polymers that exhibit charge separation in response to light can be used as light tunable photocapacitors.","Note that a photocapacitor can be used with dual photocapacitance and varactor modes.
