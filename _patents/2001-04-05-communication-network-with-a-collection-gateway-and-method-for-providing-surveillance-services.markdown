{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is based on prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60\/195,723, filed Apr. 7, 2000, and priority thereto is hereby claimed.","The present invention relates generally to communication networks, and more particularly, to a communication network, an apparatus and a method for providing surveillance services.","Under certain circumstances, and with appropriate authorization, law enforcement agencies (LEA) are permitted to legally intercept and monitor communications between individuals that may be targets of an investigation. A common technique, known as wiretapping, involves intercepting telephonic communications between individuals by \u201ctapping\u201d into the communication.","Plain old telephone systems (POTS) and early wireless communication systems incorporating, Class 4 or Class 5 exchanges, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and the like, employ circuit switching techniques to connect a calling party to a called party via a communication network. The call is completed upon successfully establishing the circuit between the parties, and the circuit becomes a dedicated link between the parties for carrying on the telephonic communications. All voice communication between the parties is then carried on this circuit.","To provide surveillance, or wiretapping, in such circuit switched systems required only determining and \u201ctapping\u201d the circuit at an appropriate location along the circuit. A circuit is dedicated to the call, and because all of the communications are carried on this circuit, the LEA can be assured of intercepting the entire communication, including in-band and out-of-band call signaling, between the individuals under surveillance from this one tap.","Evolution of communications technology will render obsolete the circuit switched network for both voice and data communication networks. In fact, circuit switched networks are being replaced by packet-based communication networks. In packet-based networks, the information carried by the network, for example data or encoded voice, is organized into packets, and the network carries these packets from the sending party to the receiving party. Within the network there is no single path or \u201ccircuit\u201d that carries the packets from the sending party to the receiving party. Instead, the network may be considered a fabric of links, switches and routers that carry packets in an efficient manner. Packets associated with the communications of a first party with a second party may travel on any number of paths. This arrangement of the packet based communication network permits more efficient utilization of communication resources, and hence, permits the communication network to carry more information, with greater stability. Thus, the packet based communication network can service a greater number of users communicating greater amounts of information, i.e., both voice and data.","The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA) requires that all US based wireline, cellular and broadband personal communication services (PCS) carriers provide the capability of legal, undetectable, bearer and call signaling intercept to law enforcement agencies for any subscriber utilizing their network. CALEA implementation, which is governed by Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations, must be completed by Jun. 30, 2000 for non-packet-based networks and by Sep. 30, 2001 for packet-based networks. While the FCC has specified the required functionality, it has not specified or recommended architecture for achieving compliance with its regulations.","As described above in connection with circuit-based, or non-packet-based networks, providing surveillance capability generally requires only determining the particular circuit established for a communication, and intercepting both the bearer and call signaling information carried on that circuit. However, in packet-based networks no single circuit or path carries the data packets which include the bearer and call signaling information. To ensure complete surveillance, it is necessary to ensure that all packets associated with a communication are identified regardless of the path assigned to any particular packet.","Additionally, the FCC regulations specify certain functional requirements beyond bearer and call signaling intercept that must be met for compliance with the CALEA legislation. The regulations are completely set forth in the interim standard J-STD-025, available from the Federal Communication Commission, 445 12Street S.W., Washington, D.C., 20554. Among these requirements are a capability to provide: content of subject-initiated conference calls, party hold, join, drop on conference call, in-band and out-of-band signaling, timing information, dialed digit extraction, and no interruption of call performance, billing, etc. as a result of CALEA implementation.","Thus, there is a need for a communication network and method that includes surveillance capability and which utilizes packet switched data techniques for providing communication services.","In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention, a communication network utilized for providing communications between a first party and a second party includes a surveillance server within a core network to provide communication surveillance capability. The core network may be a packet data network, and the surveillance server is operable responsive to trigger information to establish communications surveillance. Communication surveillance may be established by creating duplicate bearer packets of those data packets carrying the communicated data between the parties, creating duplicate control packets of those data packets carrying in-band or out-of-band call control information between the parties and within the packet data network, and\/or various combinations thereof. The duplicate bearer packets and the duplicate control packets are routed to appropriate authorized law enforcement agencies for providing surveillance. Since these bearer packets are digitally encoded, the law enforcement agency will require encoding information on the bearer stream so that the packets can be decoded. Therefore, bearer packet encoding information must be sent to the law enforcement agency prior to initiating the duplication of bearer packets.","Consistent with the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the surveillance server (e.g., feature server) may be disposed within a packet data network and apart from external networks accessing the core network, the surveillance server may be associated with one or more network access servers and\/or the surveillance server may be associated with one or more of the external accessing networks.","In accordance with preferred methods of providing surveillance within a packet data network, a surveillance server is provided either associated with or apart from the core network and in communication with the core network. The surveillance server identifies a trigger event, and responsive to the trigger event, causes the creation of duplicate bearer packets and\/or duplicate control packets, and routes the duplicate packets to appropriate authorized law enforcement agencies.","With reference to , a communication core network is coupled for communication with a radio access network , a public switch telephone network (PSTN) , a packet data network and\/or the Internet , and a Signaling System 7 (SS7) network . It should be appreciated that the core network  may be coupled, via gateways (e.g., an SS7 Gateway , a packet gateway  or a PSTN gateway ), for communication to additional networks of operating under virtually any protocol.","Within the core network  are a number of elements including a services client , a PSTN\/MGC , a relay client , and a CALEA feature server . The relay client  provides an interface between the core network  and the radio access network  for providing wireless communication services to subscribers, not shown, utilizing the radio access network  for wireless voice and data communications. Within the radio access network , a bearer client  provides the communication services to the subscribers, and is interfaced, such as by interface , to the relay client . Interface  is an ATM or IP signaling interface that relays radio access network signaling, possibly H.323, SIP, IS-634, or others, to the Services Client . Additionally, a SS7 gateway  couples the core network  to the SS7 network , a packet gateway  couples the core network  to the Internet  and a PSTN gateway  couples the core network  to the PSTN . The convention used in  and throughout the drawings is that arrowed lines denote signaling information while non-arrowed lines denote bearer information.","The CALEA feature server  provides the CALEA feature application within the core network . The CALEA feature server  interfaces to the services client  via a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or other text based applications programming interface (HTTP\/text API) . The CALEA feature server  further interfaces with the relay client  via a feature application programming interface (FAPI)  to control duplication of bearer streams and processing of in-band signaling in the duplicated bearer streams. Additionally, the CALEA feature server  interfaces with the law enforcement agency (LEA)  via GENMAP link , for providing out-of-band call signaling information such as dialed digits, call-waiting invocation, call feature invocation, conferencing adds\/drops\/etc. GENMAP, as is known in the art, generally refers to an ANSI-41, GSM MAP or similar signaling protocol.","The services client  provides the call processing engine within the core network  for providing communication services to users of the core network . The services client  maintains the call model and state for subscribers in the radio access network .","In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention and upon invocation of CALEA services for a targeted subscriber(s), the services client  provides point-in-call (PIC) call signaling information to the CALEA feature server via the interface . This interface is a text based API such as HTTP or a more advanced API for feature processing. Additionally, the services client  interfaces with the relay client using a Relay Client Control Protocol (RCCP) connection  (based on H.248 signaling or MGCP) to manage the original bearer streams  pertaining to a subscriber's service requests.","The relay client  provides management of bearer streams , i.e., encoded voice or data, for active calls and\/or conferences in the core network . In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention, the relay client  provides a capability to generate duplicate bearer streams  for communication to a LEA upon request from the CALEA feature server . Such duplicate bearer streams may be a single combined stream (full-duplex for a two party call and possibly all members of a conference call), or the relay client  may duplicate and provide all or a sub-set of all of the bearer streams  to the LEA , as requested by the LEA . Additionally, and in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention, the relay client  may also provide call signaling information in-band with the duplicate bearer stream , may exclude such call signaling information from the duplicate bearer stream or may provide the call signaling information as a separate data stream.","In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention shown in , the CALEA function resides within the CALEA feature server , which provides surveillance services within the core network  as a subscribed service. The service is authorized and activated under the guidance of the requesting LEA. The CALEA feature server  controls the relay client  via the xGCP link  (xGCP refers to the family of protocols SGCP, MGCP, and in the future MEGACO\/H.248) to cause the relay client  to provide the duplicate bearer streams  to the LEA  via the packet gateway  and the packet data network  in a manner that is unobtrusive to the original streams. The CALEA feature server  also controls the relay client  via the xGCP link  to provide any required in-band signaling for the duplicate bearer streams . The CALEA feature server  is triggered from the services client  via link  at required PICs to provide the required out-of-band signaling information to the LEA  over the GENMAP link .","A basic surveillance services flow that may be applied with the preferred embodiment of the invention shown in  may start with CALEA service logic being downloaded to the services client  when a \u201ctargeted\u201d subscriber registers with the core network . This logic download provides the services client  with access to the CALEA feature server  for the targeted subscriber.","The CALEA service logic may include the necessary triggers, and will include at least one trigger, and provides the LEA  with required call signaling information (dialed digits, service invocation, etc.) and proper instructions for generating the duplicate bearer streams . Upon detection of the at least one trigger associated with the targeted subscriber, such as registration, call origination, call termination, service invocation (e.g., call waiting, conference call, call forwarding, message retrieval, etc.) the services client  call model implements the surveillance service logic, which, in turn, interfaces with the CALEA feature server . The CALEA feature server , in turn, interfaces with the relay client  to provide the duplicate bearer streams  (e.g., merged, individual or sub-set bearer streams) to the LEA  using RTP over a secure Internet connection (such as defined in IPSec of the Internet Engineering Task Force) through the packet gateway . The CALEA feature server  forwards the requested signaling streams to the LEA  using the GENMAP link  over the IPSec through the packet gateway . Importantly, the original call signaling and bearer streams  are unaffected. The relay client  becomes the anchor point for targeted subscribers engaged in active calls. Also, core path optimization is deactivated if the call hands-off to another core network.","A representative call flow  for the system shown in , is illustrated in , wherein like reference numerals are used to represent like processes.  represents a surveillance service wherein the bearer streams are duplicated for forwarding to the LEA . Not shown, is an initial request by the LEA , via the packet gateway  for surveillance services in connection with a particular subscriber. This request contains the surveillance type information, which may be retained within the CALEA feature server , or as described in connection with alternate preferred embodiments of the invention, in other suitable locations within the core network .","As shown in , the targeted subscriber originates a call and the call is about to be connected. The services client  forwards a call connect trigger  to the CALEA feature server . The call connect trigger  includes information necessary for implementing the requested surveillance service, and may include the RTP stream endpoint(s), vocoder type, requesting LEA identification, requesting LEA address, and the like. The CALEA feature server  forwards a duplicate bearer stream signal  using the xGCP link  to the relay client , and the relay client  forwards the LEA address information  to the packet gateway .","The packet gateway  makes an IPSec negotiation request  to the requesting LEA  via an unsecured link . The security association is negotiated according to IPSec rules, and the LEA  provides an IPSec negotiation response . The packet gateway  sends an acknowledgement  of the IPSec negotiation to the relay client , and the relay client  begins sending the duplicate bearer streams , using RTP. The duplicate bearer streams are then communicated from the packet gateway  to the LEA  using the negotiated secure connection.","One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the modifications necessary to the above-described call flow  for triggering surveillance services responsive to call termination, services invocation, and other similar events occurring within the communication network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","310","300","310","300","300"]},"The core network  includes a packet data gateway  for linking to a packet data network , an SS gateway  for linking to a PSTN , a circuit gateway , additional feature servers , a conference feature server , a H.323\/A+ Client Gatekeeper , and an access server . Subscribers (not shown) access the core network  via an access network , such as a radio access network, and the access server . The core network  further includes a subscriber services database , e.g., a home location register database as is well known in cellular communication systems. As shown in , additional feature servers  may include a billing server , a location server  and a short message server .","As shown in , core network  also includes a surveillance distribution server (SDS) . As will be described in more detail below, the SDS  may provide the following functions: conversion of call set-up messages and call-related information to a standard message format, for example, to the J-STD-025 message standard, for communication to a requesting LEA; delivery of the standard messages to the LEA; initiation of requests to the core network elements to provide subscriber information, for example, location information; reception of packet data from other core network elements for communication to the LEA, and support a subscriber surveillance database.","To support the functionality of the SDS , it may be necessary to interface the SDS  with the H.323\/A+ Client gatekeeper  and one or more of the feature servers , such as location server . The implementation shown in  does utilize and rely upon the conference feature server  being within or interfaced to the core network  to handle combining data from the surveillance subject and associate for delivery to the LEA. A conference feature server  will typically exist within the core network  for supporting POTS features, such as three-way calling, call forwarding, etc.; however, it will also be appreciated that the function of the conference feature server  may be provided within one of the additional feature servers , another element of the core network  or may be extracted from the core network .","It will also be appreciated that there may be several locations within the core network  within which subscriber surveillance data may be retained. However, adaptation of the home location register (HLR) to include a data structure for retaining the subscriber surveillance data advantageously reduces the amount of provisioning required for implementing surveillance services and provides an implementation cost savings. For purposes of the implementation shown in , it will be assumed that the HLR is utilized in this manner and accessed via the subscriber services management system  that is used for provisioning. The surveillance data that may be included in the subscriber services database  is wire tap type, start date and time, stop date and time, IP addresses for the requesting LEAs, case identifications, and LEA identification information.","In accordance with the embodiment of the invention shown in , responsive to invocation of surveillance services, the SDS  instructs the access server  to generate duplicate bearer data packets and to transmit the duplicate bearer data packets to the conference feature server . The conference feature server  combines and sums the duplicate bearer data packets into a single path and communicates them to the circuit gateway  to transmit to the requesting LEA (not depicted). The circuit gateway communicates to the SDS  the circuit or circuits being used to transmit the bearer data to the LEA, and the SDS  also provides this information to the LEA.","The H.323 Client gatekeeper  detects when a call set-up message is being transmitted by a targeted subscriber within the access network . The H.323 Client gatekeeper  transmits duplicate call set-up messages to the SDS , and the SDS  translates these messages into standard messages for communication to the LEA. The H.323 Client gatekeeper  will also transmit messages to the SDS  from other elements of the core network . For example, messages relating to the utilization of the feature servers  may be transmitted, or the subscriber services database  may transmit messages that the targeted subscriber has made changes to their feature profile. Additionally, the subscriber services database  will also inform the SDS  whenever the targeted subscriber has roamed into a different network.","By providing an interface to the billing server, the SDS  may obtain and retain billing records whenever surveillance services are provided to a LEA. Thus, the communication network operator may more accurately recoup the cost of providing surveillance services.","Surveillance services relating to short message data may be handled by either of the access server  or the H.323 Client gatekeeper  eliminating the need to interface the short message server  to the SDS . Whether the access server  or the H.323 Client gatekeeper  controls the transmission of short message data and information may depend on whether the short message data and information is considered bearer data or signaling data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","402","404","326","332","406","326","326","408","328","328"]},"At step , the H.323 Client gatekeeper  continues with the targeted subscriber's origination request, and transmits a copy of the origination data to the SDS . The SDS  receives the origination data and translates the data to the standard data format and transmits the translated origination data to the requesting LEA through the packet gateway , step . Once the origination attempt is answered at the far end, and bearer data, either voice or data, is sent between the targeted subscriber and the access server , at step , the access server  duplicates the bearer data and sends it to the conference feature server . The access server  must send duplicated bearer data for each LEA requesting surveillance services for the subject. That is, multiple LEAs may be requesting surveillance services on the same targeted subscriber, and therefore multiple duplicate copies of the bearer data will be generated, one each for each requesting LEA.","The conference feature server  assigns resources to combine and transmit the duplicated bearer data to each of the requesting LEAs, and the combined data is then sent to the circuit gateway for transmission to the LEAs, step . At step , the circuit gateway transmits the combined data to the LEAs, and at step  the circuit gateway transmits circuit identification data to the SDS  for reporting to the LEAs in standard messages, step .","The SDS  may also request location data from the location server . The location data is likewise placed into the standard message format by the SDS  and transmitted to the LEAs. Likewise, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate and understand the modifications necessary to the above-described call flow for providing surveillance services triggered from call termination, services invocation, and other similar events occurring within the communication network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","10","510","526","510","510","526","520","524","530","526","542","540"]},"In a preferred embodiment of the invention, and in connection with the communication network , a LEA  requests surveillance services for a targeted subscriber over an IPSec secure connection via the packet gateway . The services request is communicated through the core network  to the CALEA feature server . The CALEA feature server  engages in a dialogue with the authentication authority , and is provided all necessary information associated with the requested surveillance. The CALEA feature server  communicates with the appropriate network operator, for example, the operator of core network , authorizing the surveillance request and placing the surveillance order.","The CALEA feature server  may then inject logic into the appropriate network elements within core network , for example relay client , services client  and\/or other feature servers and gateways, to enable the requested surveillance services.","When the targeted subscriber initiates a service that triggers surveillance, for example, originating a call, the relay client  notifies the CALEA feature server , and the network elements within the core network  provide the CALEA feature server  with the necessary surveillance data, for example, location. The relay client  also advises the assigned resource ID to be used for subscriber initiated service.","The CALEA feature server  instructs the relay client  to provide a duplicate bearer stream to the authorized LEA , using the LEA's IP address information provided when the LEA  made the surveillance services request. Alternatively, the CALEA feature server  could request the multicast address currently being used for the target subscriber and instruct the packet gateway  to send multicast information to the LEA's IP address. The relay client  routes the duplicate bearer stream to the LEA via the packet gateway  (and\/or a circuit gateway). Other feature servers within the core network  are also instructed to route call signaling, short message data, and the like to the LEA  via the packet gateway  and using the LEA's IP address.","As is appreciated from the embodiment of the invention describe in connection with , surveillance services may be provided as an extracted feature. Thus, surveillance services may be added without extensive reconfiguration of the architecture of the core network . Providing authentication via the authentication authority  ensures that surveillance services are not implemented absent appropriate authorization. Moreover, in accordance with the embodiment of the invention shown in , surveillance services may be implemented using existing customer equipment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","606","600","608","610"]},"The bearer distribution network  functions to transport IP bearer traffic (e.g. voice or data) within the communication network . For example, the bearer distribution network may include SDUs, MCUs, IP switches and signaling and media gateways. It should be appreciated that various combinations of these elements may be used depending on the type of source and destination parties\/devices and the services provided. For example, in communication systems supporting mobile-to-mobile calling and\/or packet data calling services, network resources may not be required.","The radio access network  is coupled to both the bearer distribution network  and to the core network  and provides wide-area wireless communication services in accordance with one or more communication standards. More particularly, within the core network , the radio access network is coupled to a call control server . The control server  is a functional entity within the core network  that incorporates the IP network call\/session establishment and feature interaction. This is a distillation of such functions as radio network controller, services client, session manager, and the like. The call control server  is also coupled to a CALEA feature server  within the core network .","A mobility server , a location server , a profile server(s) , an operations server  and other feature servers  are provided within the core network  and are coupled to the CALEA feature server . The mobility server  is the functional equivalent of the Visitor Location Register (VLR) of current cellular communication systems. The location server  manages the locations gathering and provides the best possible coordinate location of mobile subscribers operating in the radio access network . The profile server  is a repository of mobile subscribers require for feature management and control. A home location register (HLR) is an example of a profile server . The operations server  provides the functionality and operations necessary to provision the CALEA feature server  with information required for providing surveillance services. For example, the operations server  will provide the CALEA feature server  with the identity of the surveillance target as well as the identity of the LEA requesting the surveillance services.","The bearer distribution network is also coupled to a collection gateway . The collection gateway  is a media gateway, which has an interface to law enforcement. It may also include functionality to encrypt\/decrypt intercept signaling and bearer data, and may also contain multicast group client capability for intercepting multicast subject content. The collection gateway  interfaces to an intercept access point , which is the collection point for surveillance content and data, and the point from which the LEAs access and acquire the surveillance content and data.","With reference still to , and reference also to , the operation of the communication system  for providing surveillance services is described.","Upon reception of appropriate authorization from a law enforcement agency, for example, a court order authorizing wiretapping, the operator provisions surveillance of the subject via the operations system. At step , the operations server  sends the provisioning information to the CALEA Feature Server . This includes the CASE ID which identifiers the law enforcement agency and the particular surveillance case. Also included is the subject's identity such as his or her directory number and name. If encryption of the signaling is desired, a key may be distributed to the network entities that will provide surveillance information.","Based on the subscriber and agency information, the CALEA feature server  instructs the multicast client function in the appropriate collection gateways  to listen for multicast announcements of the identified subject, step . This method permits early detection of potential resource shortages in the collection gateway . An alternative to this step  is for the CALEA feature server  to directly assign collection gateway resources when a subject call is answered. Resources may include circuits and multicast bearer and signaling streams.","The CALEA feature server  instructs the Call Control Server  to add the specified subject to its surveillance list. Any signaling related to the subject will be replicated and sent to the CALEA feature server , step . An alternative approach to this step  is to assign a multicast group (address) for all intercept signaling. The CALEA feature server  would be a receiving member of this group. The CALEA feature server  also adds the subject to the surveillance list in other servers such as the profile server , the mobility server , the location server , and other feature servers .","At step , the subject, wireless subject , originates a call to a party, participant-C , on the circuit switched public network (P-C). The radio access network  sends the origination to the call control server  for proper further processing, step . The call control server  recognizes that the origination is a member of the surveillance subjects list and replicates the message to the CALEA feature server , step . The CALEA feature server  collects the call id, source and destination party ids and the cell location required for signaling to the intercept access point . The cell id may be used to collect coordinate location information from the location server .","At step , the call control server  forwards the origination to the bearer distribution network  with access to the PSTN . The bearer distribution network  signals an origination (e.g. IAM) to the participant-C  across the public switched telephone network , step . The terminating party, participant-C answers, step , and the answer is forwarded to the call control server , step .","Noting the call is for a surveillance subject, the call control server  assigns multicast addresses for the bearer stream terminations between the radio access network  and the bearer distribution network . A circuit termination is associated with the streams for delivery of information to\/from the participant-C .","The call control server  informs the CALEA feature server  of the answer so that that interception by the collection gateway \/intercept access point  may be enabled, step . The CALEA feature server  performs a proxy announcement (e.g., Service Access Point (SAP)) of the multicast sessions established for the subject communications, step . The multicast client in the collection gateway  recognizes the announcement is for a session it was earlier instructed, by the CALEA feature server , to listen for. It enables reception of the subject's IP datagrams from the radio access network , step . The multicast client enables reception of the subject's IP datagrams from the bearer distribution network , step .","The CALEA feature server  signals a call content pen instruction to the collection gateway , step . The subject identity, timestamp, call id, and other required parameters are provided. The collection gateway  forwards the open to the intercept access point , step .","The CALEA feature server  requests detailed location information of the subject from the location server , step . The location server  requests updated location information from the radio access network , step . The radio access network  returns the current subject location, step . The location server  formats and forwards the response to the CALEA feature server , step .","The CALEA feature server  includes the collected location coordinates in an Answer sent to the collection gateway . Also included is the CASE ID and all collected information from the call set up signaling, step . The collection gateway  forwards this to the intercept access point , step . At this point the collection gateway  captures the call content to and from the wireless subject  and sends it to the intercept access point . Any subject related signaling in the network is forwarded to the CALEA feature server , which sends the appropriate signal to the intercept access point  as required, step .","It will be appreciated that in this embodiment of the invention does not require the signaling entities (e.g., control\/feature servers) to replicate signaling since designated intercept parties signaling may utilize one or more known multicast addresses\/ports. Use of separate addresses enables wholesale special treatment such as encryption, which might not be done on normal calls. Further still, calls such as mobile-to-mobile calls or PDG do not have to go through the relay client (e.g. relay client ) or an MCU. It will be further appreciated that the SDU could be incorporated into the radio access network, e.g., into the base transceiver stations of the CDMA cellular communication network.","This embodiment of the invention also enables the use of multicast and signaling related to joining multicast groups. The join may be provided by a multicast client function adapted to the CALEA feature server, which joins the individual's multicast group when it is announced, e.g., via SAP. However, this may not be required since the CALEA feature server, e.g., CALEA feature server , can do an MGCP Add of the subject's multicast bearer streams to the circuit (or packet) connection to the intercept access point .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["1100","10","1110","1110","1102","1120","1102","1102","1125","1140","1140","1141","1143","1125","1141","1102","1102","1102","1102"]},"The services agent  administers initiation of surveillance services. The services agent  associates a surveillance services requester, for example, a requesting LEA  or , the services requested and a services client associated with the surveillance target, for example, services client . The services agent  locates existing services clients upon receipt of a service request for the surveillance target, or provides the instantiation of a new services client for a surveillance target upon initial attachment of the surveillance target to the network. Within the data structure, the services agent  further maintains the list of intercept features and agency delivery addresses for each surveillance target.","In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention, the services agent  instructs the services client , or potentially passes appropriate logic to the services client , to gather the appropriate surveillance features from the CALEA feature server  for application against a specific surveillance target and for a specific LEA. Multiple features can be activated against the surveillance target simultaneously. Since the services agent's function locates or creates services clients, there is minimal signaling impact to the system when the intercept target list is integrated into the services agent .","As will be appreciated, this approach combines home and network based interception into a single, unified approach as a home services client is established for a surveillance target even when the surveillance target has roamed into another network. The intercept feature loaded onto the CALEA feature server  will determine the type of interfaces, for example, interfaces ,  and\/or , used for delivery, and the format of the information delivered. ETSI and TIA standards, as well as custom regional variations are defined as features on the CALEA feature server , and assigned to each target on the services agent .
