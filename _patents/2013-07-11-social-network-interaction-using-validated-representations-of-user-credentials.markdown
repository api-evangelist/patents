title: Social network interaction using validated representations of user credentials
abstract: A representation for a credential is received by a first client device. The credential is rendered on a second client device where the credential is associated with a user identity within a social networking platform. The first client device validates the representation for the credential associated with the user identity a score associated with the user identity where the score is based on data associated with a plurality of other user identifies who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform. The data associated with the plurality of other user identities is based on interaction with the electronic social networking platform by the plurality of other user identities within the electronic social networking platform. The accessed score is outputted for display based on the representation for the credential associated with the user identity being validated and the score associated with the user identity being accessed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An electronic social networking platform may store data about or otherwise related to social characteristics of users of the electronic social networking platform.","In general, in one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification a representation for a credential is received by a first client device. The credential is rendered on a second client device where the credential is associated with a user identity within a social networking platform. The first client device validates the representation for the credential associated with the user identity a score associated with the user identity where the score is based on data associated with a plurality of other user identifies who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform. The data associated with the plurality of other user identities is based on interaction with the electronic social networking platform by the plurality of other user identities within the electronic social networking platform. The accessed score is outputted for display in response to the representation for the credential associated with the user identity being validated and the score associated with the user identity being accessed.","Implementations can include one or more of the following features. For example, the accessed score may be determined to meet a predefined criterion and a request to add the user identity associated with the credential to a social network within the social networking platform of a validating user identity may be generated in response to the determination that the accessed score meets the predefined criterion where the validating user identity being associated with a user of the first client device. The accessed score may be determined to not meet a predefined criterion and validation of the credential may be denied in response to the determination that the accessed score does not meet the predefined criterion.","The accessed score may include a popularity score reflecting a measure of popularity of other user identities who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform. The accessed score may include an influence score reflecting a measure of influence of other user identities who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform. The accessed score may include a happiness score reflecting a measure of happiness of other user identities who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform. The accessed score may include an affluence score reflecting a measure of affluence of other user identities who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform.","If user of the first client device is associated with a validating user identity within the social networking platform, information identifying common friends between the validating user identity and the user identity associated with the credential may be accessed from within the social networking platform. If a user of the first client device is associated with a validating user identity within the social networking platform information related to degrees of separation between the validating user identity and the user identity associated with the credential may be accessed from within the social networking platform. The representation for a credential from the second client device may include a Quick Response code displayed on the second client device.","The accessed and outputted score may be a plurality of scores associated with the user identity where the plurality of scores are based on data associated with a plurality of other user identities who are members of the user identity's social network within the social networking platform and the data associated with the plurality of other user identities is based on interaction with the electronic social networking platform by the plurality of other user identities within the electronic social networking platform. The accessed and outputted score may include a histogram representation of the score.","Other features may include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs encoded on computer storage devices configured to perform the foregoing actions.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description, below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","A mobile device-based credential for a user of an electronic social networking platform may present information to others about the social proximity of the user to other users possessing one or more desired characteristics (e.g., other users who are active, communicative, popular, influential, happy, and\/or affluent electronic social networking platform users). Data stored about users by the social networking platform enables quantification of various different social characteristics of the users, such as the users' activity levels, communication levels, popularity, influence, happiness, income, and\/or affluence. The social proximity of an individual user to other users having one or more target social characteristics (e.g., active, communicative, popular, influential, happy, and\/or wealthy users) may be determined by quantifying the target characteristics of other users to whom the individual user is connected within the electronic social networking platform.","Credentials can be maintained on and\/or accessed from client devices (e.g., mobile computing devices like smart phones and tablet computers) and credentials can be represented in various forms. A server, or collection of servers, can manage and distribute credentials to appropriate users' client devices.","In some instances, representations of credentials for groups of users or for individuals are generated. The credentials can be, for example, a social credential related to user identities within one or more social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, MySpace, Orkut, and others).","Examples of different representations for credentials and mechanisms for validating the different representations will now be described. In certain implementations, credentials can be represented by, among other representations, alphanumeric codes, optical machine-readable representations, sound signals, and\/or near-field communication (NFC) signals.","A first form of representation for a credential is an alphanumeric code. As referred to herein, an alphanumeric code may be a sequence of numbers and\/or letters (e.g., 4 to 24 characters) that is associated with a credential and a user. In some instances, a given alphanumeric code may be time-varying (e.g., will only be valid for a certain time period). To initialize an alphanumeric code, a server associates a given alphanumeric code with a credential, and distributes the alphanumeric code to the appropriate client device or devices.","To validate an alphanumeric code, a user or third-party presents the alphanumeric code to a validating device (e.g., a client device operated by a user or a processing system operated by a validating entity). The validating device may validate an alphanumeric code for a credential locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example, the representation for the credential provided by the third-party may be associated with a certificate associated with the third-party (e.g., a public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate), which may be stored locally at the validating device. The validating device may then compare information decoded from the alphanumeric code with information from the certificate to determine that the alphanumeric code is valid.","Alternatively or in addition, the validating device may validate the alphanumeric code by transmitting a validation request message, which includes the alphanumeric code, to the server. When the server receives the validation request message, it attempts to confirm that the presented representation of the credential is valid. For example, the server may parse the alphanumeric code to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier (e.g., from a database by querying using the credential identifier). Upon retrieving the credential, the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message (e.g., the alphanumeric code) with data associated with the retrieved credential.","Upon successful validation, the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the representation for the credential was valid (e.g., the presented alphanumeric code matches a valid alphanumeric code for the credential). In turn, the validating device may then provide an indication that the representation presented by the user or the third-party was valid.","Another form for a credential is an optical machine-readable representation. As referred to herein, an optical machine-readable representation of a credential may be an arrangement of graphical elements that encode alphanumeric data representing the credential, where the elements are arranged so that the data can be read by an optical scanner. For example, an optical machine-readable representation of a credential may be a bar code, a QR code, or an Aztec code, among other optical machine-readable representations. In some instances, a given optical machine-readable representation of a credential only may be valid for a certain time period. In some implementations, optical machine-readable representations of credentials may encode data including or representing credential identifiers and any other suitable data. In other implementations, optical machine-readable representations of credentials may encode other identifiers that are linked to or otherwise associated with credential identifiers.","To generate an optical machine-readable representation, a client device may use any suitable technique for encoding alphanumeric data within the optical machine-readable representation. For example, the client device may call a function or library routine that encodes QR codes in accordance with the QR code International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard, ISO\/IEC 18004:2006 RSS, Information technology\u2014Automatic identification and data capture techniques\u2014QR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification.","To initiate the validation process for an optical machine-readable representation, a client device may output an optical machine-readable representation to a display of the client device. A validating device can scan the portion of the client device's display showing the representation of the credential and decode the representation of the credential to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the representation of the credential. In particular, the validating device may output a reticle defining a field of view from a camera operatively coupled to the validating device. This reticle can be used to scan the optical machine-readable representation of the credential from the relevant portion of the client device's display.","The validating device may use any suitable mechanism to scan and decode the optical machine-readable representation of the credential. For example, the validating device may access a function or library routine that captures and decodes QR codes and\/or barcodes using a camera operatively coupled to the validating device. Suitable libraries may include, for example, Red Laser or Zxing.","In some implementations, a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from an optical machine-readable representation locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example, the optical machine-readable representation for the credential may include a certificate associated with the client device of the user or third-party presenting the optical machine-readable representation for validation. Alternatively or in addition, the representation for the credential may be associated with a certificate that is already stored locally at the validating device. The validating device may then compare information decoded from the optical machine-readable representation with information from the certificate to determine that the optical machine-readable representation is valid.","Alternatively or in addition, the validating device may then validate the optical machine-readable representation of the credential by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the optical machine-readable representation of the credential. When the server receives the validation request message, it attempts to confirm that the presented representation of the credential is valid. For example, the server may parse and\/or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier (e.g., from a database by querying using the credential identifier). Upon retrieving the credential, the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message (e.g., the alphanumeric characters) with data associated with the retrieved credential.","Upon successful validation, the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the representation for the credential was valid (e.g., the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential). In turn, the validating device may then provide an indication that the representation presented by the user or the third-party was valid.","Yet another form of representation for a credential is a sound signal. As described herein, a sound signal is an oscillation of pressure waves transmitted through the air that are modulated to encode information. Any suitable modulation scheme could be used, such as, for example, frequency shift keying (FSK) or phase-shift keying (PSK). In some implementations, the sound signal may be in the ultrasonic frequency range, e.g., greater than about 20 kHz. In some implementations, the sound signal may be in the audible frequency range, e.g., about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz.","A sound signal representing a credential may encode data including or representing a corresponding credential identifier and any other suitable data. In addition, a sound signal representing a credential may encode another identifier that is linked to or otherwise associated with a corresponding credential identifier. In some implementations, a given sound signal representing a credential may only be valid for a certain time period. For example, part of the data encoded in the signal may correspond to a time stamp, and the credential represented by the signal may be deemed invalid if a validating device attempts to decode the data more than a predetermined amount of time after the time stamp was generated.","To generate a sound signal, a client device may use any suitable technique for encoding a representation of a credential. For example, the client device may call a function or library routine that encodes data into sound signals such as the Zoosh software development kit (SDK) by Naratte, Inc. The client device can then output the sound signal representation of the credential from a speaker coupled to the client device for reception by a validating device.","To initiate the validation process for a sound signal, a client device outputs a sound signal representing a credential. A validating device may then receive the sound signal at a speaker of the validating device and decode the sound signal representation of the credential to generate a set of alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the sound signal. The validating device may use any suitable mechanism to receive and decode the sound signal.","In some implementations, a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from a sound signal locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example, the sound signal may include a certificate associated with the client device of the user presenting the sound signal for validation. Alternatively or in addition, the representation for the credential may be associated with a certificate that is already stored locally at the validating device. The validating device may then compare information decoded from the sound signal with information from the certificate to determine that the sound signal is valid.","Alternatively or in addition, the validating device may then validate the sound signal by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the sound signal. When the server receives the validation request message, it attempts to confirm that the presented sound signal is valid. For example, the server may parse and\/or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier (e.g., from a database by querying using the credential identifier). Upon retrieving the credential, the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message (e.g., the alphanumeric characters) with data associated with the retrieved credential.","Upon successful validation, the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the sound signal was valid (e.g., the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential). In turn, the validating device may then provide an indication that the representation presented by the user or the third-party was valid.","Still another form of representation for a credential is an NFC signal. NFC as described herein may refer to a set of standards (e.g., ECMA-340 and ISO\/IEC 18092) for client devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity (e.g., typically no more than a few centimeters). NFC as described herein may also include other suitable short range wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth or Zigbee.","A client device may use any suitable technique for encoding a representation of a credential within an NFC signal, such as a function or library routine. An NFC signal representing a credential may encode data including or representing a corresponding credential identifier and any other suitable data. In addition, an NFC signal representing a credential may encode another identifier that is linked to or otherwise associated with a corresponding credential identifier. In some implementations, a given NFC signal representing a credential may only be valid for a certain time period. For example, part of the data encoded in the signal may correspond to a time stamp, and the credential represented by the signal may be deemed invalid if a validating device attempts to decode the data more than a predetermined amount of time after the time stamp was generated.","To initiate the validation process for an NFC signal, a client device transmits an NFC signal representing a credential. A validating device may then receive the signal at a receiver of the validating device and decode the NFC signal representing the credential to generate the set of alphanumeric characters encoded in the signal.","In some implementations, a validating device may validate a set of alphanumeric characters from an NFC signal locally without requiring interaction with a server. For example, the NFC signal may include a certificate associated with the client device of the user presenting the NFC signal for validation. Alternatively or in addition, the representation for the credential may be associated with a certificate that is already stored locally at the validating device. The validating device may then compare information decoded from the NFC signal with information from the certificate to determine that the NFC signal is valid.","Alternatively or in addition, the validating device may then validate the NFC signal by transmitting a validation request message to a server. The validation request message may include data corresponding to the alphanumeric characters that were encoded in the NFC signal. When the server receives the validation request message, it attempts to confirm that the presented NFC signal is valid. For example, the server may parse and\/or decode the alphanumeric characters to obtain a credential identifier. The server can then access the corresponding credential using the credential identifier (e.g., from a database by querying using the credential identifier). Upon retrieving the credential, the server can determine whether the presented representation for the credential was valid by comparing data received in the validation request message (e.g., the alphanumeric characters) with data associated with the retrieved credential.","Upon successful validation, the server sends the validating device a validation response indicating that the NFC signal was valid (e.g., the alphanumeric characters in the request match a valid sequence of alphanumeric characters for the credential). In turn, the validating device may then provide an indication that the representation presented by the user or the third-party was valid.","An exemplary process for applying the above described credential validation techniques to a credential management application is described below in reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","104","102","106","106","102","102","104"],"i":["a ","a ","b ","b","a ","b. "]},"Although not illustrated in , as described in greater detail below, in response to validating the second user's social credential , the first user's client device displays the one or more scores to the first user . In some implementations, the first user's client device also may display a request to connect with the second user by adding the second user's user identity to the first user's social network within the electronic social networking platform. (For ease of reference, such a connection between two user identities within an electronic social networking platform may be referred to herein as a \u201cfriend\u201d connection.)","A hypothetical interaction between two users Mary, a validator, and Joe, a validatee, will be used to describe an exemplary credential management application. Both the validator, Mary , and the validatee, Joe , may be members of at least one electronic social networking platform and each may have their own user identity within the at least one electronic social networking platform. Although the process is described with respect to the hypothetical users Mary and Joe , the process may be performed similarly for any users (e.g., a pair of validator and validatee users) of a credential management application.","For instance, Mary meets Joe at a business conference and would like to add Joe as a friend in one of her social networks, but first wants to verify one or more of Joe's social characteristics. Social characteristics may include scores associated with Joe's user identity within the electronic social networking platform, friend connections that Joe and Mary share within the electronic social networking platform, a social proximity score between Joe and Mary within the electronic social networking platform, and\/or social proximity to other users (e.g., other users within Joe's social network) with desired characteristics or scores, for example. Mary then may ask Joe for his social credential . In response, Joe may access a credential management application on his client device which may generate a representation of a social credential  as displayed in diagram , for example. The social credential  may be an optical-machine readable code such as the QR code shown, a sound signal, an NFC code, or an alphanumeric code, for example, that is associated with Joe's user identity in one or more electronic social networking platforms.","Mary may activate a corresponding credential management application on her client device to receive (e.g., by scanning the QR code) and validate Joe's social credential . Validating the social credential  may include decoding data encoded in the social credential , comparing a certificate associated with the social credential  with data stored by the credential management application on Mary's client device , or sending a validation request to a server including data that were encoded in the social credential  (as described above).","Successful validation of Joe's social credential  may allow Mary's client device to access one or more social characteristics associated with Joe's user identity in an electronic social networking platform. The one or more social characteristics may include one or more scores calculated based on data associated with a plurality of other user identities who are members of Joe's social network within the electronic social networking platform. The data associated with the plurality of other user identities may be based on interactions by the other user identities with the electronic social networking platform, such as engagement with the electronic social networking platform by the plurality of other user identities or a characteristic of the plurality of other user identities within the electronic social networking platform. Furthermore, as described below in reference to , engagement with the electronic social networking platform may include writing\/responding to \u201cstatus posts,\u201d performing \u201ccheck-ins,\u201d and\/or posting photos, for example. Additionally, as described below in reference to , a characteristic of another user identity may be information posted in the other user identity's profile, for example.","Alternatively or in addition, successful validation of Joe's social credential  may allow Mary's client device to access social characteristics related to Joe's user identity such as information related to similarities between Mary's and Joe's social networks within the electronic social networking platform. For example, the information may relate to friends that Mary and Joe have in common within the electronic social networking platform. In other words, user identities within the social networking platform that are members of both Mary's and Joe's social networks within the electronic social networking platform. The information related to similarities between Mary's and Joe's social network may be, for example, information related to the social proximity between Mary and Joe within the electronic social networking platform. For example, social proximity between two user identities of an electronic social networking platform may be measured in terms of the number of degrees of separation (i.e., the number of other intermediate, interconnected user identities required to form a connection) between the two user identities within the electronic social networking platform.","Upon successfully validating Joe's social credential , the credential management application on Mary's client device may display a screen similar to screen  showing Joe's electronic social networking platform user identity. Screen  may simply display a photograph from a user profile associated with Joe's user identity or it may also include additional data from Joe's user profile. A user selectable control  may be selected to display one or more social characteristics associated with Joe.","In some implementations, the credential management application may generate a request to add Joe's electronic social network user identity to Mary's social network within the electronic social networking platform (i.e., a \u201cfriend\u201d request) after successfully validating Joe's social credential . In some implementations, the request may only be generated if one or more of scores (described in greater detail below) associated with Joe's user identity meets one or more predefined criteria. For example, a predefined criterion may be a threshold value previously set by Mary for a particular social characteristic. For instance, Mary may be an estate planner for high net worth individuals seeking referrals to potential clients; therefore she may set a threshold for establishing friend connections with user identities having a Friends' affluence score at or above some threshold value. Alternatively or in addition, Mary may not be a highly communicative electronic social network user and may prefer to receive a moderate number of electronic social networking communications; therefore she may set a threshold for establishing friend connections with user identities having a Friends' communicativity score at or below some threshold value.","Alternatively or in addition, the predefined criteria may be a specified number of mutual friends within Mary's and Joe's social networks in the electronic social networking platform. The criteria also may be a minimum number of degrees of separation between Mary's and Joe's user identities within the electronic social networking platform or a condition that Mary and Joe have one or more specific mutual friends within the electronic social networking platform, for example. Mary may then use the credential management application to determine Joe has the potential to become a valuable business networking contact. For instance, Mary may be an entrepreneur seeking a meeting with an executive at a company that may be a potentially high value client for Mary's business. She may then set a predefined criterion to alert her if Joe, an owner of a business within the executive's industry, is friends with the executive within the electronic social networking platform.","Some implementations of the credential management application may be capable of validating a social credential that is associated with user identities in multiple electronic social networking platforms. In some implementations, validation by the credential management application may include determining if Mary (the validator) has a user identity within the same electronic social networking platform as that in which Joe's (the validatee's) user identity, as indicated by Joe's social credential, is associated. If it is determined that Mary and Joe do not both have user identities within the same electronic social networking platform, the credential management application may deny validation of Joe's social credential. For example, Joe may have a user identity within Facebook, but Mary only has a user identity within LinkedIn. Similarly, when Joe's (the validatee's) social credential is associated with a user identity in more than one electronic social networking platform, validation by the credential management application may include identifying within which of the more than one electronic social networking platforms Mary (the validator) also has a user identity. For example, Joe may have user identities within Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter and Mary has a user identity within LinkedIn. In the case where Mary and Joe each have user identities in the same two or more electronic social networking platforms, the credential management application may request that Mary (the validator) select one of the two or more electronic social networking platforms for which to validate Joe's (the validatee's) social credential. For example, Joe may have user identities within Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter and Mary may have user identities within Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2C","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","112","200","202","202"]},"In addition GUI  may include the number of friends that validator and validatee (Mary and Joe) have in common within their respective social networks in the electronic social networking platform and\/or the number of degrees of separation between the two users' user identities within the electronic social networking platform. In addition to displaying the number of degrees of separation between the two users' user identities, one or more paths may be displayed that connect the two user identities with the fewest degrees of separation within the electronic social networking platform. In some implementations, GUI  may include a request  to add Joe to Mary's social network within the electronic social networking platform. In some implementations, the request  is only generated and displayed if one or more of the validatee's scores meet predefined criteria. In some implementations, data from a user profile associated with the validatee's electronic social networking platform user identity also may be displayed (e.g., the user identity's age, relationship status, education history, etc.).  is an example GUI  which may be displayed if one or more of Joe's scores do not meet a predefined criteria and, as a result, Joe's credential is not validated.","In some implementations, a more detailed view of the scores , such as a histogram as illustrated in , may be displayed for any of the scores  by, for example, by selecting one of the scores  listed on GUI . As illustrated in , GUI  includes an \u201cAffluence Distribution\u201d panel that presents a histogram reflecting the distribution of the affluence scores of the user identities from Joe's social network within the electronic social networking platform for whom the application was able to calculate affluence scores.","In addition, GUI  includes an \u201cInfluence Distribution\u201d panel that presents a histogram reflecting the distribution of the influence scores of the user identities from Joe's social network within the electronic social networking platform for whom the application was able to calculate influence scores.","Finally, GUI  includes a \u201cPopularity Distribution\u201d panel that presents a histogram reflecting the distribution of the popularity scores of the user identities from Joe's social network within the electronic social networking platform for whom the application was able to calculate popularity scores. Although  depicts exemplary histogram representations for Affluence, Influence, and Popularity scores, a more detailed representation of the data related to any score may be displayed. Furthermore, representations of score data other than histograms may be displayed.","In order to calculate the scores described above, an application may extract data from an electronic social networking platform on behalf of users of the application who also are represented by user identities within the electronic social networking platform. The data may be extracted by a credential management application or it may be extracted by another application (e.g., a social intelligence application) from which the credential management application subsequently accesses the data. The scores also may be calculated by the other application (e.g., a social intelligence application), in which case a credential management application need only access the scores from the other application (e.g., a social intelligence application).","This data extracted from the electronic social networking platform may include data about or otherwise related to the users of the application. In addition, this data extracted from the electronic social networking platform may include data about or otherwise related to user identities within the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of users of the application. After extracting this data from the electronic social networking platform, the application may process the extracted data to enable analysis of the extracted data, for example to glean intelligence about the users of the application (and\/or user identities within the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of the users of the application).","Techniques are described herein for extracting, analyzing, and\/or acting upon data from an electronic social networking platform. These techniques are widely applicable and may be employed in connection with any of the above electronic social networking platforms or any other electronic social networking platforms.","Electronic social networking platforms often enable an individual user identity to create a user profile that reflects various different types of information about or otherwise related to the user identity. Such a profile for a particular user identity may be helpful to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are interested in learning more about the particular user identity. Similarly, the profile for the particular user identity may be helpful to the user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are interested in confirming that the particular user identity represents a particular human user within the electronic social networking platform.","For example, an electronic social networking platform may maintain a user profile for a user identity that reflects the user identity's name, gender, age, relationship status, education history (e.g., schools attended and\/or degrees awarded), employment history (e.g., employers and\/or positions held), contact information (e.g., e-mail address(es), telephone number(s), other electronic addresses, physical addresses, etc.), current residence information (e.g., city, state\/territory, and\/or country), hometown information (e.g., city, state\/territory, and\/or country), primary language, and\/or sexual orientation.","Additionally or alternatively, the user identity's profile also may reflect various different interests of the user identity and\/or indications of various different locations that the user identity (or another user identity, such as, for example, a member of the user identity's social network) has registered with the electronic social networking platform as locations that the user identity has visited. Such locations may include a wide variety of different types of locations, including, for example, geographic locations, such as cities, states, or countries, as well as commercial venues, businesses, or other places, such as restaurants, retail stores, parks, train or bus stations, airports, etc. For ease of reference, indications of locations registered with an electronic social networking platform as locations that a user identity has visited may be referred to herein as \u201ccheck-ins,\u201d and information stored in a user identity's profile that reflects such indications of locations registered with the electronic social networking platform as locations that the user identity has visited may be referred to herein as \u201ccheck-in information.\u201d","Electronic social networking platforms also typically enable an individual user identity (e.g., representing a human user who has registered with the electronic social networking platform and\/or a human user who has been assigned a unique or otherwise identifying identifier by the electronic social networking platform) to establish connections with other user identities. These connections between user identities may reflect relationships between the underlying human users of the electronic social networking platform who are represented by the user identities. For example, a connection between two user identities within an electronic social networking platform may reflect a social friendship (e.g., developed through physical interaction in the real-world and\/or through on-line interaction in the cyber-world) or a professional relationship between the underlying human users represented by the user identities.","In some electronic social networking platforms, user identities may be able to form connections with other user identities unilaterally. For example, an electronic social networking platform may enable a first user identity to form a connection to a second user identity simply by requesting to form a connection to the second user identity (without requiring authorization of the connection by the second user identity). Alternatively, in other electronic social networking platforms, the formation of connections between two user identities may involve bilateral participation by both user identities. For example, in such electronic social networking platforms, when a first user identity requests to form a connection to a second user identity, the electronic social networking platform may establish the connection between the first and second user identities only after receiving authorization to form the connection from the second user identity.","A user identity's social network within an electronic social networking platform may be defined based on the connections between the user identity and other user identities of the electronic social networking platform. In some cases, the social network of a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may be defined as the group of other user identities to whom the particular user identity is directly connected. Alternatively, in other cases, the social network of a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may be defined to extend beyond the group of other user identities to whom the particular user identity is directly connected to include other user identities who are within a threshold level of proximity to the particular user identity within the electronic social networking platform. For example, social proximity between two user identities of an electronic social networking platform may be measured in terms of the number of degrees of separation (or the number of other intermediate, interconnected user identities required to form a connection) between the two user identities within the electronic social networking platform, and the social network of a particular user identity within the electronic social networking platform may be defined to include a group of other user identities who are within a threshold social proximity of the particular user identity.","Commonly, an electronic social networking platform may provide a particular user identity with certain increased functionality in connection with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform that the electronic social networking platform may not provide to the particular user identity in connection with user identities who are not members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform. For example, an electronic social networking platform may provide a particular user identity with one or more different mechanisms for electronically communicating or otherwise sharing content with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform. Furthermore, an electronic social networking platform may allow a particular user identity to access more detailed profile information about other user identities who are members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform than the electronic social networking platform allows the particular user identity to access about user identities who are not members of the particular user identity's social network. Additionally or alternatively, an electronic social networking platform may enable a particular user identity to access \u201ccheck-ins\u201d registered with the electronic social networking platform by members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform, while not enabling the particular user identity to access \u201ccheck-ins\u201d registered with the electronic social networking platform by user identities who are not members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform.","The connections between individual user identities within an electronic social networking platform may be represented in the form of a graph, where user identities are represented by nodes and connections between user identities are represented by edges connecting the nodes. As new user identities join and other user identities stop using the electronic social networking platform and\/or as new connections between user identities are formed and old connections between user identities are dissolved, this graph of interconnected user identities may change dynamically in time to represent the current state of connections between user identities within the electronic social networking platform.","For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in\/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["300","302","304","302","300","304","302","302","304","302","302","302","302","302","302"],"i":["a","b","a","b","a","b"]},"As further discussed above, an electronic social networking platform may facilitate the sharing of information and the exchange of electronic communications between a particular user identity and other user identities who are members of the particular user identity's social network within the electronic social networking platform. For example, referring to the electronic social networking platform represented in , the electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of electronic communications between the user identity represented by node () and the user identities represented by nodes () who are members of the social network of the user identity represented by node (). In some implementations, the electronic social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node () to send private electronic messages to any one or more of the user identities represented by nodes (). Furthermore, the electronic social networking platform also may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node () to publish an electronic message (e.g., a \u201cstatus post\u201d) that is broadcast to all (or some defined subset of all) of the user identities represented by nodes (). Additionally or alternatively, the electronic social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node () to send a directed electronic message to a user identity that is represented by a particular one of nodes (). In such cases, the recipient user identity of the directed message may define whether this directed message is shared publicly with other user identities of the electronic social networking platform.","In addition to enabling user identities to establish connections to other user identities, an electronic social networking platform also may enable user identities to establish connections with other types of objects. Among other examples, such other types of objects may include interest objects, location objects, event objects, and application objects.","Interest objects may represent a variety of different types of interests, including, for example, local businesses or places (e.g., restaurants, retail stores, parks, train or bus stations, airports, etc.); companies, organizations, or institutions; brands or products; artists, bands, or public figures; media or other forms of entertainment (e.g., books, music albums, movies, etc.); and causes or communities. As described in greater detail below in connection with , interest objects may be manifested within an electronic social networking platform as so-called \u201cpages\u201d that provide information about the interests that the interest objects represent. These \u201cpages\u201d may be maintained by one or more representatives of the interests that the interest objects represent.","An electronic social networking platform that supports interest objects may enable an individual user identity to record various different interests within the electronic social networking platform by registering endorsements of the interest objects that represent the user identity's interests with the electronic social networking platform. The electronic social networking platform may represent the individual user identity's endorsement of different interest objects within the electronic social networking platform as connections between the user identity and the interest objects that the user identity has endorsed. Furthermore, the electronic social networking platform may provide various different mechanisms that enable the one or more representatives of a particular interest object to share electronic communications or otherwise interact with those user identities who have endorsed the particular interest object. For example, the electronic social networking platform may enable the one or more representatives of the particular interest object to publish status posts, including, for example, text, images, and\/or videos that are broadcast publicly to user identities who have endorsed the particular interest object.","Location objects may represent a variety of different types of locations, including, for example, geographic locations, such as cities, states, or countries, as well as commercial venues, businesses, or other places, such as restaurants, retail stores, parks, train or bus stations, airports, etc. An electronic social networking platform that supports location objects may enable an individual user identity to form various different types of connections to different location objects. For example, an electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to record information about the user identity's hometown by establishing a \u201chometown\u201d connection with a location object that represents the user identity's hometown. Similarly, an electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to record information about the user identity's current place of residence by establishing a \u201ccurrent city\u201d connection with a location object that represents the user identity's current place of residence. Additionally or alternatively, an electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to register locations that the user identity has visited by establishing \u201ccheck-in\u201d connections with location objects that represent locations that the user identity has visited.","In some cases, an electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to manually \u201ccheck-in\u201d at a location. For example, a social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to manually define and\/or search for a location object that corresponds to a location that the user identity is visiting (or has visited or plans to visit) and create a connection to the location object that corresponds to the location in order to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at the location. Additionally or alternatively, an electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at a location in a more intelligent or automated fashion. For instance, a social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at a location using a mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone or tablet computer) using global positioning system (GPS), map, and\/or other location-identifying data available to the mobile computing device.","Event objects may represent events hosted by user identities of an electronic social networking platform and\/or events hosted by representatives of interest objects. Furthermore, event objects may include mechanisms that enable the hosts of the events represented by the event objects to invite user identities to the events. In some electronic social networking platforms, event objects may be manifested within the electronic social networking platforms as \u201cevent pages\u201d that provide information about the events the event objects represent (e.g., date, time, and location information for the events), and the electronic social networking platforms may enable one or more designated representatives associated with the event (e.g., the hosts) to share information and exchange electronic communications with user identities who have been invited to the event via the \u201cevent page.\u201d","An electronic social networking platform that supports event objects may establish a connection between an event object and the user identity or interest object responsible for hosting the event represented by the event object. In addition, the electronic social networking platform also may establish a connection between an event object and user identities who have been invited to the event represented by the event object and\/or user identities who register with the electronic social networking platform that they will be attending the event represented by the event object.","As described in greater detail below, electronic social networking platforms may enable independent applications to leverage the electronic social networking platforms, for example, to provide more compelling user experiences for the users of the independent applications by accessing and\/or extracting data from the electronic social networking platforms, generally on behalf of user identities who have granted the independent applications authorization to access and\/or extract data from the electronic social networking platforms on their behalf. Application objects in an electronic social networking platform, thus, may represent different applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform.","A wide variety of different types of applications may leverage electronic social networking platforms. Among other examples, gaming applications are one common example of applications that leverage electronic social networking platforms. Such gaming applications may allow user identities to engage in interactive or multiplayer games that involve other user identities of the electronic social networking platforms that they leverage. Other examples of types of applications that may leverage electronic social networking platforms include social electronic marketplace applications, social event management applications, content delivery and sharing applications, collaboration applications, and social recommendation applications.","An electronic social networking platform that supports application objects may establish connections between an individual application that leverages the electronic social networking platform and user identities who are users of the application represented by the application object and\/or who are users who have granted the application represented by the application object authorization to access or extract data from the electronic social networking platform on their behalf. Furthermore, the electronic social networking platform may provide various different mechanisms that enable an application that leverages the social networking platform to share electronic communications or otherwise interact with those user identities for whom connections have been established with the application object that represents the application within the electronic social networking platform. For example, the electronic social networking platform may enable an application that leverages the electronic social networking platform (and\/or users of the application that leverages the electronic social networking platform) to transmit communications within the electronic social networking platform to user identities for whom connections have been established with the application object that represents the application within the electronic social networking platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["350","352","352","350","352","352","352","352","352","354"],"i":["a","b","c","d","e","f"]},"As illustrated in , an edge  that connects two nodes  represents a connection between the two objects that are represented by the connected nodes .

There may be various different types of event connections between user identities and event objects in an electronic social networking platform. For example, one type of an event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity is the host of the event. Another type of an event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity has been invited to the event.

For example, an activity score may be calculated for a user identity based on, among other things, the number of status posts generally broadcast by the user identities to their social networks; the number of targeted posts the user identities directed to members of their social networks; the number of locations at which the user identities checked-in; the number of responsive comments that the user identities posted; the number of endorsements by the user identities of communications exchanged within the electronic social networking platform; the number of indications of applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform that the user identities installed; the number of events that occurred for which the user identities received and accepted invitations within the electronic social networking platform; and the number of pages endorsed by the user identities over a defined period of time (e.g., the previous 30 days, the previous 60 days, the previous 90 days, the previous year, etc.).","An activity score may then be calculated for the individual user identities as a function of one or more of these values. For example, in some implementations, the activity score for an individual user identity may be calculated according to the Equation 1 below:\n\nActivity Level=2\u00b7(#status posts)+2\u00b7(#targeted posts)+2\u00b7(#checkins)+(#comments)+0.5\u00b7(#comms. endorsed)+3\u00b7(#apps installed)+2\u00b7(#events attended)+(#pages endorsed)\u2003\u2003(Eq. 1)\n","Various different techniques may be employed to estimate a user identity's level of communication within the electronic social networking platform based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. For example, a communicativity score may be calculated for a user identity based on, among other things, counting the number of general status posts the user identities broadcasted generally to their social networks within the previous 30 days; the number of photo status posts the user identities broadcasted generally to their social networks; the number of video status posts the user identities broadcasted generally to their social networks; the number of link status posts the user identities broadcasted generally to their social networks; the number of different locations at which the user identities checked-in; the number of targeted posts the user identities directed to members of their social networks; and the number of responsive comments the user identities posted over a defined period of time (e.g., the previous 30 days, the previous 60 days, the previous 90 days, the previous year, etc.).","A communicativity score may then be calculated for the individual user identities as a function of one or more of these values.

For example, a determination may be made as to whether the user identity likely has an income. This determination may be made based upon one or more of the user identity's age, employment history, and education history. If the user identity has a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined to have an income irrespective of the user identity's age and\/or education history. If the user identity is less than 18 years old and does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined not to have an income. If the user identity is between 18 years old and 21 years old, does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, and does not have a college\/university or a graduate school specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined to have an income. In contrast, if the user identity is between 18 years old and 21 years old, does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, and does have a college\/university or a graduate school specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined not to have an income. If the user identity is between 22 years old and 25 years old, does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, and does not have a graduate school specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined to have an income. In contrast, if the user identity is between 22 years old and 25 years old, does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, and does have a graduate school specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined to not have an income. If the user identity is between 25 years old and 65 years old and does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity still may be determined to have an income. If the user identity is more than 65 years old and does not have a current employer specified in his\/her employment history, the user identity may be determined not to have an income. Finally, if no age information is returned from the electronic social networking platform for the user identity, the application may not be able to estimate the user identity's income.","If the user identity is determined to have an income, a base income then is determined for the user identity. Different techniques may be employed to determine a base income for the user identity. For example, one or more databases may be maintained that store base incomes to be used for user identities based on the current residence locations of the user identities. In some implementations, the same base income may be used for all user identities within a single country. In such implementations, the base income to be used for user identities from each country may be the mean or median income for the country. In other implementations, different base incomes may be used for user identities from a single country. In such implementations, the base incomes to be used may vary at the regional, state, or even city level and may be based on the mean or median incomes for the corresponding regions, states, or cities. For example, the base incomes to be used for user identities residing in one country may be determined based on the cities in the country where the user identities currently reside. More particularly, the base income to be used for a user identity may be the mean income for individuals in the user identity's current residence city. Alternatively, the base income to be used for a user identity may be the median income for individuals in the user identity's current residence city.","After determining the base income for the user identity, age and education level multipliers then are determined for the user identity.

The representation for the credential may be, for example, an alphanumeric code, an optical-machine readable code (e.g., the QR code  shown in ), a sound signal, or an NFC code used to encode a credential (e.g., a certificate) associated with a user identity within a electronic social networking platform.

In some implementations, the request may only be generated if one or more of the scores associated with the user identity meets predefined criteria. For example, the predefined criteria may include a threshold value previously set by the user of the client device for a particular social characteristic.
