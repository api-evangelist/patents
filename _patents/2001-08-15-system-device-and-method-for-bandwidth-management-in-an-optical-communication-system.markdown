Schofield.","The present invention relates generally to optical networking, and more particularly to managing communication services in an optical communication system.","In today's information age, communication networks are increasingly used for transferring information among a multitude of communication devices. As demand for communication services continues to grow, the demand on these communication networks for carrying increasing amounts of information at increasing speeds continues to grow. Therefore, communication networks are evolving to handle these increased demands.","One way in which communication networks are evolving is through the use of optical communication facilities. Optical communication facilities transport information over optical communication media (such as optical fibers). Such optical communication networks provide vast amounts of bandwidth over short and long distances.","The optical communication network is capable of providing various communication services to its users. Traditionally, such communication services have been very expensive, and need to be planned and scheduled well in advance. This is due in part because changes to the optical communication network, such as provisioning and switching optical communication paths, required substantial human intervention.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, an optical service agent is used to provide bandwidth management services on behalf of a user. The optical service agent may monitor bandwidth utilization on a connection, control bandwidth utilization on a connection, obtain additional bandwidth for a connection, relinquish excess bandwidth for a connection, and allocate bandwidth among multiple connections, to name but a few. The optical service agent may interact with an optical communication network and\/or various peer users in order to obtain and reserve communication services.","In an embodiment of the present invention, an optical service agent (OSA) operating within the domain of the network user manages communication connections on behalf of the network user. The OSA interacts with the optical communication network to obtain various communication services and manages those communication services for the network user based upon predetermined parameters defined by the network user. In essence, then, the optical communication network provides a \u201ccore\u201d set of communication services that can be accessed by the OSA, and the OSA provides advanced communication services for the network user using the \u201ccore\u201d set of communication services provided by the optical communication network.","In an agile transport network, various optical communication services that heretofore have been performed manually are performed automatically by \u201cintelligent\u201d optical communication devices within the network. In particular, the optical internet infrastructure is evolving from a statically-provisioned SONET ring-based transport network to a more dynamically-provisioned mesh network.","One example of an agile transport network is an automatically switched optical\/transport network (ASON or ASTN), which is described in the related application entitled SYSTEM AND DEVICE FOR PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES IN AN OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM incorporated by reference above. The ASON typically includes optical cross-connect switches (OXCs) that are used to form the mesh network and optical channel controllers (OCCs) that dynamically create, delete, and modify optical communication paths by controlling the OXCs through a connection control interface (CCI). For convenience, the OXCs and OCCs are referred to hereinafter collectively as ASON devices. The ASON devices, and in particular the OCCs, are typically network routers that use a link-state routing protocol (e.g., OSPF) to distribute link attributes (such as optical channel availability) and a signaling protocol (e.g., MPLS or GMPLS) to manage optical communication paths end-to-end. These protocols enable the ASON to automatically and quickly create, delete, and modify optical communication paths. The ASON typically also includes an optical service server (OSS) for coordinating the various communication services provided by the ASON. Thus, the ASON provides more agility by moving from manual provisioning to automatic provisioning via switching and signaling.","In essence, then, the ASON is an optical\/transport network that has dynamic connection capabilities. Among other things, the ASON provides for discovery of physical topology for optical elements, efficient use of available bandwidth by dynamic creation of optical communication paths, and end-to-end connection protection and restoration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","130","120","110","130","120","120","110","130"]},"Each ASON device includes an ASON controller for supporting automated communication services within the ASON . Among other things, the ASON controller enables each ASON device to automatically provision, switch, and signal optical communication paths within the ASON . The ASON controller enables carriers and service providers to offer many value-added services to their customers.","In order for the users ,  to control and monitor communication services from the ASON , the ASON controller provides a user-to-network interface (UNI) through which the users ,  interact with the ASON controller for controlling and monitoring communication services within the ASON . Through the ASON UNI, the users ,  can access various controllable features of the ASON . For example, using the ASON UNI, the users ,  can request an optical communication path having certain attributes, renegotiate the attributes of the optical communication path, control switching of the optical communication path, terminate the optical communication path, and monitor operation of the ASON , to name but a few.","Within the ASON , each ASON device is able to perform various functions in support of the automated communication services. Some of these functions can be carried out by an individual ASON device, while others of these functions require coordination among multiple ASON devices. Therefore, the ASON controller provides a network-to-network interface (NNI) that enables communication between ASON devices for coordinating various communication functions. Through the ASON NNI, the various ASON devices can exchange ASON routing information and coordinate such things as establishment and termination of optical communication paths, switching of optical communication paths, and protection and restoration of optical communication paths, to name but a few.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","210","220","230","240","250","210","240","210","240","110","130","120","210","240","210","240","110","130","110","130","120","210","240","210","240","250","210","240"]},"At the heart of the various automated communication services is automatic switching of optical communication paths. In order to support automatic switching of optical communication paths within the ASON , the ASON devices - typically include some form of optical switching logic, such as an optical\/photonic switching fabric, for performing optical\/photonic switching of optical communication paths. The optical switching fabric may be based upon any of a variety of optical\/photonic switching technologies, including, but not limited to, Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technology, Micro Opto Electro Mechanical System (MOEMS) technology, lithium niobate technology, liquid crystal technology, or other optical\/photonic switching technology. The optical switching logic can be dynamically configured under control of the ASON controller for such things as passing optical data streams from a number of incoming optical fibers to a number of outgoing optical fibers (i.e., switching), adding an optical data stream to an outgoing optical fiber, and dropping an optical data stream from an incoming optical fiber for local processing by the ASON device, to name but a few.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","330","320","340","350","360","370","380","310","330","320","310","330","310","330","310","300","330","340","310","320","330","350","340","360","340","300","120","350","360","340","370","340","380","340","380","380","370"]},"Without limitation, the ASON  can provide practically any communication service that has traditionally been performed manually. As described in the related application entitled SYSTEM AND DEVICE FOR PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES IN AN OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM incorporated by reference above, some exemplary communication services that can be provided by the ASON  include \u201cplug and play\u201d for optical elements, modeling of optical communication paths, automatic provisioning of optical communication paths, user-requested switching of optical communication paths, automatic switching based upon service level agreement (SLA), automatic switching for protection and restoration, bandwidth management, and reporting of statistical and other information, to name but a few. It should be noted that the present invention is in no way limited to any particular communication services provided by the ASON .","As discussed above, the ASON UNI enables the users to control and monitor communication services provided by the ASON . The ASON UNI provides a standardized interface to the ASON , and more particularly to the ASON controller  in the ASON device. Conceptually, the ASON UNI provides a set of \u201ccontrol knobs\u201d through which the users can control and monitor ASON communication services.","One way for a user to access ASON communication services is by implementing some or all of the ASON UNI functionality. For example, ASON UNI functionality can be integrated with a user application so that the user application can access ASON communication services. For convenience, such a user is referred to hereinafter as an ASON-enabled user, and such a user application is referred to hereinafter as an ASON-enabled user application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","410","410","340","420","120","420"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","120","510","520","120","510","520","120","510","520","510","520","120"]},"Unfortunately, it is not always practical to implement the ASON UNI in each user application that requires ASON communication services. Therefore, another way for the user to access ASON communication services is by employing an optical service agent (OSA) to manage communication services for the user. As described in the related application entitled SYSTEM, DEVICE, AND METHOD FOR MANAGING COMMUNICATION SERVICES IN AN OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM incorporated by reference above, the OSA is an intelligent, embedded signaling agent that operates within the user at the edge of the ASON . The OSA implements application-specific services and intelligence as well as the ASON UNI and other mechanisms for communicating with the ASON controller  via the ASON UNI. The OSA can be viewed as a subsystem that understands user requirements and manages various communication services on behalf of the user to meet the user requirements. Specifically, the OSA interacts with the ASON  via the ASON UNI to obtain various communication services and manages that communication services for the user based upon predetermined parameters defined by the user. Architecturally, the OSA is layered above the ASON UNI, and uses the ASON UNI to manage and control ASON communication services provided through the ASON controller . In essence, then, the OSA provides advanced communication services for the user using the \u201ccontrol knobs\u201d provided by the ASON UNI. For convenience, a user that employs an OSA for managing communication services is referred to hereinafter as an OSA-enabled user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","610","340","610","380","120","620","340","630","120","340","340","610","340","380","380","370"]},"The OSA  is typically implemented in software, and can be implemented in a platform dependent or platform independent manner. In a platform dependent OSA implementation, the OSA  is implemented specifically for a particular platform, and is typically not portable to other platforms. In a platform independent OSA implementation, the OSA  is implemented so as to work with multiple platforms, for example, by separating platform-specific functions from the higher level protocols and algorithms and implementing the platform-specific functions separately from the higher level protocols and algorithms such that the higher level protocol\/algorithm \u201clayer\u201d can be used with the platform-specific \u201clayer\u201d for a particular platform. The suitability of a particular programming language for implementing the OSA  may depend on the type of implementation (platform dependent or platform independent) as well as the execution frequency of the OSA . For example, a Java implementation may be suitable for a platform independent implementation in which the OSA  is executed infrequently, while a C++ implementation may be more suitable for platform dependent implementations as well as applications in which the OSA  is executed more frequently.","Whether the OSA  is implemented in a platform dependent or platform independent manner, the OSA  typically includes various user-controllable and user-customizable features. In order for a user application to access these user-controllable and user-customizable features, the OSA  typically includes an OSA Application Program Interface (API) that includes various primitives for accessing the user-controllable and user-customizable features of the OSA . The OSA API is typically simpler than the ASON UNI, particularly because the OSA API is typically an internal software interface that does not need to implement the complexities of the ASON UNI (such as mechanisms for communicating over a UNI signaling channel).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["710","610","610","710","610","610"]},"In a typical embodiment of the OSA , the OSA  is separated into two components, namely an application component (referred to hereinafter as the OSA-A) and a network component (referred to hereinafter as the OSA-N). The OSA-A and the OSA-N communication via a control interface, which, depending on the placement of the OSA-N (discussed below), may be the ASON UNI or another control interface.","The OSA-A is the application piece of the OSA . The OSA-A implements application-specific services and intelligence. Because the OSA-A is so tightly coupled to the user application, the OSA-A typically resides on the user platform in the edge system. The OSA-A manages communication services on behalf of the user, specifically by requesting communication services from the ASON  via the OSA-N and mapping communication services from the ASON  to the user network or application.","The OSA-N is the network piece of the OSA . Among other things, the OSA-N provides functionality for user authentication, registration, and membership. Authentication functionality enables the network to authenticate the user in order to ensure that the user is permitted to access ASON communication services. Registration functionality enables the user to register a user identifier with the network. For example, in an Internet Service Provider (ISP) application, the user identifier is typically the address of the router attachment to the ASON device (i.e., the IP address of the ASON controller and the UNI control channel identifier), which can be viewed as the L1\/L2 address of the router interface. Membership functionality enables the user to join a multicast group along with other peer users of the ASON . The OSA-N may reside on the user platform in the edge system or in the ASON device at the edge of the ASON .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["810","820","830"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["820","810","820","810","820","830","830","810","820","810","820","340","820","810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["820","120","820","340","810","820","820","810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["820","1110","830","810","820","810","820","820"]},"In order to guarantee service to its users and maintain integrity of the optical core, the ASON  needs to provide a level of security and authentication. The fact that there is an enabled physical connection between an ASON-enabled user and the ASON device may be sufficient authentication for the ASON-enabled user to access the ASON . However, as ASON usage grows and OSA is deployed, the ASON  will need to authenticate the OSA-enabled users so that only authorized OSA-enabled users are able to access the ASON . Therefore, the ASON  will authenticate each OSA-enabled user that registers with the ASON controller.","In one embodiment, an authentication server is used to authenticate OSA-enabled users. The authentication server is typically a centralized database that uses an authentication protocol for authentication. The authentication protocol can use any of a variety of authentication techniques, such as challenge-based handshake authentication or simple username\/password based authentication.","In another embodiment, each ASON controller  uses public key technology (i.e., authentication certificates) to authenticate OSA-enabled users that register with it. This requires that the OSA understand and manage authentication certificates for the OSA-enabled user.","Data security is a user-based feature that needs to be implemented at the edge of the enterprise network. The OSA software need not support data integrity.","Architecturally, the OSA-N functionality can be implemented in different ways. The suitability of a particular OSA-N architecture depends on a number of characteristics, such as such as implementation complexity, fault tolerance, UNI bandwidth utilization, UNI signaling delay, memory utilization, and computational complexity. Because OSA-N is layered on top of the ASON UNI, an important consideration is the UNI bandwidth utilization and signaling delay for OSA signaling. Latency is important because it affects the type of applications OSA can support.","A number of exemplary OSA-N architectures, namely a client-server architecture, a distributed flooding architecture, a hybrid\/proxy architecture, and an ASON-coupled architecture, are discussed herein. It should be noted, however, that the present invention is in no way limited to any of the described OSA-N implementations or to any particular OSA-N implementation.","In the client-server architecture, most of the OSA-N functionality, including authentication, registration, and group membership, is handled by an optical service server (OSS), as shown in . The OSS maintains authentication, registration, and group membership information for multiple OSA-enabled devices. The OSA-enabled user is typically pre-configured with a group identifier. When the OSA-enabled user is attached to the ASON , the OSA-N sends a registration message to the OSS. The OSA-N includes its group identifier in the registration message. The OSS stores the group identifier in its registration database. The OSA-N queries the OSS to obtain group membership information that includes the identity and location of peer users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1302","1304","1306","1304"]},"The client-server architecture has a number of characteristics that are considered to be advantages. First, the client-server architecture is relatively simple to implement. Second, the amount of signaling bandwidth (both UNI and NNI) is relatively small, in part because group membership information is maintained and distributed by the OSS and therefore there is no need to advertise group membership information to the network. Signaling bandwidth can be further reduced by having the OSA-N cache the group membership information it retrieves from the OSS, with a periodic refresh technique used to keep the cache current.","The client-server architecture has a number of characteristics that are considered to be disadvantages. First, the OSS represents a single point of failure so that, if the OSS fails, the network cannot perform authentication, registration, and group membership functions. This problem can be mitigated by running a \u201cbackup\u201d OSS and using a synchronization protocol, such as the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) as described in RFC 2334, to maintain synchronization between the servers, although this adds implementational complexity. Second, because the client-server architecture is server-based, the network is heavily dependent upon the availability, reliability, and performance of the OSS, which could become a bottleneck for overall system performance, specifically in terms of delay. Third, like other types of centralized solutions, the client-server architecture is not scalable. Fourth, in order to register with the OSS, the OSA-enabled user must be manually configured with its group identifier.","In the distributed flooding architecture, authentication is handled by the OSS, as shown in . The OSS maintains authentication information for multiple OSA-enabled users, and also maintains a group identifier for each OSA-enabled user. After authenticating an OSA-enabled user, the OSS informs the OSA-enabled user of its group identifier. The OSA-enabled user then informs the other OSA-enabled users in the network of its group membership, specifically by flooding an advertisement through the network, for example, in a manner similar to OSPF-TE and PNNI Augmented Routing. This flooding occurs periodically and, since the procedure is similar to that of OSPF and PNNI, inherits the advantages of both protocols. The link state advertisement (LSA) and neighbor database is maintained in the user domain rather than in the network domain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1502","1504","1506","1506"]},"The distributed flooding architecture has a number of characteristics that are considered to be advantages of the distributed flooding architecture. First, it allows centralized policy as to which OSA-enabled users can join a group. Second, it does not require manual configuration of the group identifier, and instead uses the OSS to distribute the group identifier after authentication of the OSA-enabled user. Third, it is well-suited to IP-router end systems, since OSPF is an extensible IP protocol by virtue of Opaque Link State Advertisements (LSA).","The distributed flooding architecture has a number of characteristics that are considered to be disadvantages of the distributed flooding architecture. First, if the OSS is out of service, then the OSA-enabled user will not be able to authenticate and determine its group identifier, and so the OSA-enabled user will not be able to determine its peers automatically. This problem can be mitigated by providing peer information to the OSA-enabled user manually, which would allow connections to be made using the ASON. In this respect, the distributed flooding architecture advantageously separates optical network operation from the availability of the OSS and allows the OSA to own most of the intelligence. Second, the flooding mechanism uses extra bandwidth in the ASON signaling network (both UNI and NNI), which can be particularly problematic if the UNI has limited bandwidth. Third, flooding does not occur until authentication is complete. Fourth, an OSPF-based flooding mechanism requires IP support, and is therefore not suitable for non-IP routers. Fifth, because the LSA and neighbor database is maintained in the user domain rather than the network domain, topological information must be \u201cleaked\u201d to the OSA-enabled user, which can be done by implementing some form of NNI in the UNI and thereby confusing the separation between the NNI and the UNI.","In the hybrid\/proxy architecture, authentication and flooding are handled by the OSS, as shown in . The OSS maintains authentication information for multiple OSA-enabled users, and also maintains a group identifier for each OSA-enabled user. After authenticating an OSA-enabled user, the OSS floods the advertisement on behalf of the OSA-enabled user, for example, using a mechanism similar to Proxy-PAR.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1702","1706","1706"]},"The hybrid\/proxy architecture is similar to the distributed flooding architecture, and therefore has many of the same advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics as the distributed flooding architecture. However, because the OSS rather than the OSA-N floods the advertisement, the OSS does not need to \u201cleak\u201d topological information to the OSA-enabled user. Therefore, there is no confusion of the separation between the NNI and the UNI.","In the ASON-coupled architecture, the various OSS services described with reference to the client-server architecture are handled by the ASON devices at the periphery of the ASON , with each ASON device acting as the OSS for its directly attached OSA-enabled device. The ASON-coupled architecture has many characteristics that are considered to be advantages of the ASON-coupled architecture. First, because there is no central server, network performance does not depend upon the availability and reliability of a single server. Second, because an ASON device services only its directly attached OSA-enabled user, a failure of the ASON device affects only the directly attached OSA-enabled device. Third, the ASON-coupled architecture is scalable, particularly because of the one-to-one mapping between clients and servers, and also because the ASON device only needs to maintain advertisements for the group associated with its directly attached OSA-enabled user. Fourth, the amount of UNI signaling bandwidth is relatively small. Fifth, because link state advertisements are stored by the ASON device rather than in the user domain, the ASON device can detect a failure of its directly attached OSA-enabled user and invalidate the link state advertisement for the OSA-enabled user, thus allowing peer users to more quickly detect the failure of the OSA-enabled user (otherwise, the peer users would need to wait for a link state advertisement timeout to detect the failure, which, in OSPF, is typically a MaxAge of 1 hour). Sixth, because the ASON device is already running ASON-specific OSPF, adding extra link state advertisements into the link state database is relatively easy. Seventh, because no topological information needs to be \u201cleaked\u201d to the OSA-enabled user, the separation of UNI and NNI is clear. Eighth, because the link state advertisements are handled by the ASON device, the OSA-enabled user does not necessarily need to implement OSPF, which can be a big advantage in certain applications.","Of the four OSA-N implementation architectures described above, the ASON-coupled architecture seems most suitable for typical applications, particularly because of its clearly defined separation of UNI and NNI, flexible implementation platforms, and simplicity for client systems. OSA-A must be customized on a case-by-case basis and requires a lot of close work with customer.","As discussed above, both the ASON-enabled user and the OSA-enabled user implement at least some of the ASON UNI functionality for obtaining communication services from the ASON . The OSA-enabled user additionally includes the OSA  for performing a variety of advanced communication services using the ASON UNI.","As shown and discussed with reference to  above, two ASON-enabled users can communicate over the ASON  using the ASON UNI. However, the types of communication services available to the ASON-enabled users is essentially limited to those that are provided directly by the ASON .","On the other hand, an OSA-enabled user can interoperate with ASON-enabled users and\/or with other OSA-enabled users over the ASON . When interoperating with other OSA-enabled users, a full set of OSA-enabled features can be supported end-to-end across the ASON . When interoperating with an ASON-enabled user that does not support OSA, only a limited set of features can be supported end-to-end across the ASON  (such as setting up an optical communication path through the ASON ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1800","1810","1820","120","1820","1810","1820","1810","1820","120","1810","1820","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1900","1910","1920","120","1910","1920","1910","1920","1910","1920","120"]},"In order to manage various communication services, the OSA  includes optical service logic that implements application-specific services and intelligence. The optical service logic interacts with the ASON  via the ASON UNI. The optical service logic also interacts with other OSA-enabled users via a peer-to-peer signaling mechanism. The peer-to-peer signaling mechanism enables communication between OSA-enabled users within a user network and\/or across the ASON . Thus, using the peer-to-peer signaling mechanism, OSA-enabled users within the user network can interoperate over intra-domain signaling channels, and OSA-enabled users at the edge of the ASON  can interoperate across the ASON  over ASON signaling channels. Among other things, the peer-to-peer signaling mechanism effectively extends OSA functionality to OSA-enabled users that are not at the edge of the ASON .","It should be noted that, while the OSA-enabled users at the edge of the ASON  implement the ASON UNI and interact with the ASON  via the ASON UNI, OSA-enabled users that are not adjacent to the ASON  are unable to interact directly with the ASON  via the ASON UNI. Therefore, such OSA-enabled users cannot directly access ASON services. Such OSA-enabled users can, however, channel ASON service requests through the OSA-enabled user at the edge of the ASON  using the peer-to-peer signaling mechanism. Specifically, an OSA-enabled user forwards an ASON service request to an OSA-enabled user at the edge of the ASON  using the peer-to-peer signaling mechanism. In turn, the OSA-enabled user at the edge of the ASON  interacts with the ASON  via the ASON UNI to execute the ASON service request, and responds if necessary using the peer-to-peer signaling mechanism.","Certain communication services can be managed by a single OSA-enabled user. However, other communication services require that a number of OSA-enabled users interoperate to coordinate communication services. This is particularly true when communication services are coordinated end-to-end between peer OSA-enabled users across the ASON . In order for OSA-enabled users to interoperate, each OSA-enabled user needs to identify its peer OSA-enabled users and obtain various types of peer information for each peer OSA-enabled user, such as an attachment address that is used for establishing an optical communication path to the peer OSA-enabled user. Therefore, the OSA typically includes mechanisms for identifying peer OSA-enabled users and for obtaining the peer information.","In a typical embodiment of the present invention, the OSA includes auto-discovery logic by which an OSA-enabled user automatically discovers its peer OSA-enabled users and obtains the various types of peer information for each of its peer OSA-enabled users. The auto-discovery logic typically uses an advertisement mechanism for exchanging peer information between OSA-enabled users, similar to the exchanging of link state advertisements by OSPF, although the auto-discovery logic is not limited to any particular advertisement or discovery mechanism. Each OSA-enabled user typically includes a peer database in which the peer information is stored. It should be noted that peer information can also be configured manually, for example, by a network administrator.","In addition to identifying peer OSA-enabled users, it is typically necessary or desirable for each OSA-enabled user to authenticate its peers.

The authenticated auto-discovery mechanism requires each OSA-enabled user to register with the ASON using an authenticated registration mechanism. A centralized advertisement scheme managed by the OSS is used to collect and distribute peer information to the peer OSA-enabled users associated with a particular peer group. Each OSA-enabled user maintains the peer information received from the OSS in its peer database.","More specifically, when an OSA-enabled user needs to access the ASON, it first establishes and activates the ASON UNI with a corresponding ASON device at the edge of the ASON. The OSA-enabled user then registers with the ASON by sending a registration message to the ASON edge device. The registration message includes, among other things, a group identifier identifying the peer group for the OSA-enabled user.","Upon receiving the registration message from the OSA-enabled user, the ASON edge device sends a challenge message to the OSA-enabled user. The challenge message provides an opportunity for the OSA-enabled user to positively identify itself to the ASON through a cryptographic authentication mechanism, for example, using predetermined public and\/or private key technologies.","Upon receiving the challenge message from the ASON edge device, the OSA-enabled user formats a challenge response message. The challenge response message positively identifies itself to the ASON device using the cryptographic authentication message. The OSA-enabled user sends the challenge response message to the ASON edge device.","Upon receiving the challenge response message from the OSA-enabled user, the ASON edge device authenticates the information in the challenge response message to verify and positively identify the OSA-enabled user. This authentication may require interaction with other network elements, such as a certifying authority for public key authentication or retrieval of an encryption key from a secure server (possibly the OSS) for private key authentication. If the ASON edge device is able to verify and positively identify the OSA-enabled user through the information provided in the challenge response message, then the ASON edge device sends a success message to the OSA-enabled user indicating that the registration process is complete. On the other hand, if the ASON edge device is unable to verify and positively identify the OSA-enabled user through the information provided in the challenge response message, then the ASON edge device rejects the registration, for example, by sending a rejection message to the OSA-enabled user.","Upon successfully registering the OSA-enabled user, the ASON edge device also sends a join message to the OSS in order to add the OSA-enabled user to its peer group. The join message includes, among other things, a group identifier identifying the peer group, a user identifier identifying the OSA-enabled user, and a bearer identifier identifying the bearer channel associated with the OSA-enabled user.","The OSS maintains group membership information for the various OSA-enabled users that have registered with the ASON. Upon receiving the join message from the ASON edge device, the OSS stores the group membership information for the new OSA-enabled user identified in the join message. If the new OSA-enabled user is the first to register for the particular peer group, then the OSS sends a database synchronization message to the ASON edge device listing no peer OSA-enabled users (i.e., a NULL list). However, if the new OSA-enabled user is not the first to register for the particular peer group, then the OSS sends a database synchronization message to the ASON edge device listing the other peer OSA-enabled users, and also sends an advertisement message to the various ASON devices supporting registered OSA-enabled users listing at least the new OSA-enabled user.","Upon receiving the database synchronization message from the OSS, the ASON edge device determines whether any peer OSA-enabled users are listed in the database synchronization message. If there is at least one peer OSA-enabled user listed in the database synchronization message, then the ASON edge device sends a new neighbor message to the OSA-enabled user listing the peer OSA-enabled users and their respective bearer identifiers. However, if there are no peer OSA-enabled users listed in the database synchronization message (i.e., the list is NULL), then the ASON edge device typically does not send the new neighbor message to the OSA-enabled user, since the peer database maintained by the OSA-enabled user is NULL by default.","Each ASON device that receives an advertisement message from the OSS sends a new neighbor message to its respective OSA-enabled user including the list of peer OSA-enabled users from the advertisement message.","The new neighbor message identifies the new OSA-enabled user to all existing OSA-enabled users in the peer group.","Upon receiving a new neighbor message from its corresponding ASON device, an OSA-enabled user stores the peer information from the new neighbor message in its peer database.","Thereafter, whenever a new OSA-enabled user registers with the peer group, the OSS sends an advertisement message to those ASON devices that support registered OSA-enabled devices in the peer group. The advertisement message identifies at least the new OSA-enabled user and its bearer identifier, and may also list some or all of the other peer OSA-enabled users and their respective bearer identifiers. Each ASON device that receives an advertisement message from the OSS sends a new neighbor message to its respective OSA-enabled user listing the peer OSA-enabled users and their respective bearer identifiers.

The ASON device O sends challenge message  to the OSA-enabled user A. The OSA-enabled user A sends challenge response message  to the ASON device O. The ASON device O sends success message  to the OSA-enabled user A, and also sends join message  to the OSS including group identifier for peer group G, user identifier for OSA-enabled user A, and bearer identifier for the bearer channel to OSA-enabled user A. The OSS sends database synchronization (DBsync) message  to the ASON device O with a NULL list of peer OSA-enabled users. The ASON device O does not send a new neighbor message to the OSA-enabled user A.","In order to register with the ASON, the OSA-enabled user B sends registration message  to the ASON device O indicating peer group G. The ASON device O sends challenge message  to the OSA-enabled user B. The OSA-enabled user B sends challenge response message  to the ASON device O. The ASON device O sends success message  to the OSA-enabled user B, and also sends join message  to the OSS including group identifier for peer group G, user identifier for OSA-enabled user B, and bearer identifier for the bearer channel to OSA-enabled user B. The OSS sends database synchronization (DBsync) message  to the ASON device O with listing OSA-enabled user A as a peer OSA-enabled user, and also sends advertisement message  to the ASON device O indicating OSA-enabled user B as a new peer OSA-enabled user. The ASON device O sends new neighbor message  to the OSA-enabled user A including peer information for OSA-enabled user B, and the OSA-enabled user A adds OSA-enabled user B to its peer database. The ASON device O sends new neighbor message  to the OSA-enabled user B including peer information for OSA-enabled user A, and the OSA-enabled user B adds OSA-enabled user A to its peer database. At this point, the OSA-enabled user A has successfully identified and authenticated the OSA-enabled user B, and the OSA-enabled user B has successfully identified and authenticated the OSA-enabled user A.","Each ASON device monitors the connection to its corresponding OSA-enabled user. If the ASON device detects loss or degradation of the connection to the OSA-enabled user (e.g., due to a failure of the ASON UNI, the bearer channel, or the OSA-enabled device itself), then the ASON device sends a leave message to the OSS to remove the OSA-enabled user from the peer group. The OSS removes the OSA-enabled user from the peer group, and sends an advertisement message to the various ASON devices that support registered OSA-enabled users indicating the removed OSA-enabled users. Each ASON device in turn sends an update message to its corresponding OSA-enabled user indicating the removed OSA-enabled user. Each OSA-enabled user deletes the removed OSA-enabled user from its respective peer database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2302","1","2304","2306","2","2","2308"]},"It should be noted that, when an OSA-enabled user interoperates with an ASON-enabled user, as shown and described with reference to  above, there is essentially no peer-to-peer relationship between the OSA-enabled user and the ASON-enabled user. Consequently, many of the OSA's peer-to-peer mechanisms are not available for interoperation between the OSA-enabled user and the ASON-enabled user. Specifically, the ASON-enabled user does not support OSA auto-discovery, peer authentication, and peer-to-peer signaling mechanisms. Therefore, the OSA-enabled user typically cannot auto-discover, authenticate, and perform peer-to-peer signaling with the ASON-enabled user. This has certain practical implications. For example, an ASON-enabled user receiving a request from an OSA-enabled user would be unable to authenticate the OSA-enabled user, and therefore would generally have to accept the request unconditionally. This poses a security\/reliability risk that may be unacceptable in some situations.","It should also be noted that optical communication services may be provided by multiple service and infrastructure providers. The OSA can manage communication services provided by these multiple service and infrastructure providers.","As discussed above, the OSA is an intelligent agent that manages various communication services on behalf of the network user. The OSA interacts with the ASON to obtain various communication services, and manages those services for the network user based upon predetermined parameters defined by the network user. The OSA can manage practically any communication services that have heretofore been managed manually.","The related application entitled SYSTEM, DEVICE, AND METHOD FOR MANAGING CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT AND RELATED SERVICES IN AN OPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, which was incorporated by reference above, discusses various connection establishment services that can be managed by the OSA. For example, the OSA can negotiate various connection and connection-related services on behalf of the user, model one or more connections for the user, reserve connection and connection-related services for the user, establish a connection for the user, and aggregate multiple optical communication paths over a connection, to name but a few.","Once a connection is established, the OSA can provide various bandwidth management services for the OSA-enabled user based upon various policy-based constraints imposed by the OSA-enabled user. These bandwidth management services can involve such things as monitoring bandwidth utilization on the connection, controlling bandwidth utilization on the connection, obtaining additional bandwidth for the connection (i.e., bandwidth on demand), relinquishing unused bandwidth for the connection, and allocating bandwidth among multiple connections (i.e., load balancing), to name but a few.","The OSA may monitor bandwidth utilization on the connection on behalf of the OSA-enabled user. Such bandwidth utilization monitoring may be done for a variety of reasons. For example, the OSA may monitor bandwidth utilization on a connection in order to detect over-utilization or under-utilization conditions on the connection. Over-utilization may lead to congestion or dropped packets as well as to additional fees for excess bandwidth utilization. Under-utilization may lead to inefficient bandwidth utilization and over-paying for connections.","The OSA may control bandwidth utilization on the connection. Specifically, the OSA-enabled user may establish a connection with express conditions setting a maximum bandwidth utilization for the connection and prescribing severe penalties for exceeding the maximum bandwidth utilization. If, in monitoring bandwidth utilization, the OSA determines that the bandwidth utilization has exceeded a predetermined level (i.e., the OSA-enabled user is over-utilizing the connection), then the OSA may take certain actions in order to prevent the OSA-enabled user from exceeding the maxiumum bandwidth utilization and therefore to avoid the prescribed penalties. Such actions may include such things as dropping packets and other flow control measures to prevent the OSA-enabled user from exceeding the maximum bandwidth utilization.","The OSA may obtain additional bandwidth for the connection on behalf of the OSA-enabled user. If, in monitoring bandwidth utilization, the OSA determines that the bandwidth utilization has exceeded a predetermined level (i.e., the OSA-enabled user is over-utilizing the connection), then the OSA may obtain additional bandwidth for the connection in order to provide additional bandwidth for the connection. This may be done instead of, or in addition to, controlling bandwidth utilization on the connection, as discussed above. Obtaining additional bandwidth for the connection typically involves interacting with the ASON, and may also involve interacting with peer OSA-enabled users.","The OSA may relinquish unused bandwidth for the connection on behalf of the OSA-enabled user. If, in monitoring bandwidth utilization, the OSA determines that the bandwidth utilization is below a predetermined level (i.e., the OSA-enabled user is under-utilizing the connection), then the OSA may relinquish unused bandwidth for the connection, for example, by interacting with the ASON and\/or peer OSA-enabled users to contract for less bandwidth or to switch communications to a lower bandwidth connection.","The OSA may allocate bandwidth among multiple connections (i.e., load balancing) on behalf of the OSA-enabled user. If, in monitoring bandwidth utilization on a number of connections, the OSA determines that one connection is over-utilized and another connection is under-utilized, then the OSA may move some traffic from the over-utilized connection to the under-utilized connection in order to more evenly balance the traffic load.","As part of the bandwidth management services provided by the OSA, the OSA may have an interface into various billing\/accounting systems. Information provided by the OSA to the billing\/accounting systems relating to bandwidth utilization can be used to reconcile fees for bandwidth utilization as well as to identify overcharges and\/or undercharges. Such a value-added service is particular useful, since otherwise the OSA-enabled user has virtually no way to verify connection and bandwidth utilization charges levied by a service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2400","2402","2404","2406","2408","2410","2412","2400","2499"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["2500","2406","2502","2504","2506","2508","2500","2599"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["2600","2408","2602","2604","2606","2608","2600","2699"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["2700","2410","2702","2704","2706","2708","2700","2799"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0138"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["2800","2412","2802","2804","2806","2808","2800","2899"]},"It should be noted that the term \u201crouter\u201d is used herein to describe a communication device that may be used in a communication system, and should not be construed to limit the present invention to any particular communication device type.
