{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Currently, mobile devices and related accessories facilitate communication in a number of different ways: users can send email messages, make telephone calls, send text and multimedia messages, chat with other users, and so on. That is, mobile devices allow users to not only make voice calls, but also send written messages via email, instant messaging (\u201cIM\u201d), texting via short messaging service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS), messaging via social networks (often over the internet protocol (IP)), etc. Moreover, mobile devices can play music, games, videos, and so on. As these devices have added features and become more powerful, users have also demanded that the devices become smaller and more portable.","Some mobile phones provide a traditional numeric keypad along with a few additional buttons. Other mobile devices provide a full alphanumeric keyboard, or a touch screen that depicts the keyboard. Many of these devices include a display and a keypad\/keyboard that can move relative to each other. For example, flip phones have a display that can pivot relative to the keyboard, while many smart phones have a keyboard that can slide relative to the screen. The flip phones may include a small secondary display on a top of the phone to display time, signal strength, battery level, and\/or a phone number of a calling party.","While these arrangements have been successful for many devices, there is a continual need to improve the overall arrangement and compactness of mobile devices. Further, as the mobile devices add more features, e.g. digital music players, the devices must include additional buttons, e.g. play, stop, reverse and fast forward buttons for the music player. These additional buttons add to the complexity and cost of the device. Alternatively, the device could provide buttons that implement two or more functions, such as a \u201c4\u201d key that also rewinds a music track. However, such dual, or even triple, use of buttons can become confusing to users.","The need exists for a system that overcomes these problems and progresses the state of the art, as well as one that provides additional benefits. Overall, the examples herein of some prior or related systems and their associated limitations are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of existing or prior systems will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the following Detailed Description.","Described in detail below is a mobile device that has at least three modes or levels of engagement for a user. The modes of engagement can be selected based on movement of an element on the mobile device to a first, second or third position. In one example, the mobile device employs two displays, one of which may be smaller than the other. The smaller display may allow the device to operate in a low power mode or Passive Mode, yet continue to provide essential information to the mobile device user, such as message status, e-mail status, voicemail status, etc. The device allows the larger display to be moved and thereby cause the mobile device to enter two other modes, a Semiactive Mode to access some applications\/communications and an increased user interface set (e.g. to voice calls), and an Active Mode that permits a much broader range of applications and communications and full or greatly expanded user interface set (e.g. emails, IM, chat\/text messaging, video playback, capturing digital pictures, etc.).","In another example, the small, secondary display is not visible in the Semiactive Mode (it may be covered by the primary display ), but provides visual indication to users via function buttons that may be accessed or used during specific applications employed while in either the Semiactive Mode or the Active Mode. The device may further maintain state while transitioning between modes, such that if the device is displaying a video or playing back digital audio while in the Active Mode and the larger display is moved to cause the device to enter the Passive Mode, the mobile device may stay in a Active Mode so that the video or audio playback is not disrupted.","Many specific details of certain embodiments of the disclosure are set forth in the following description and Figures to provide a thorough understanding of these embodiments. Well-known structures, systems, and methods often associated with such systems have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the disclosure. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that additional embodiments may be practiced without several of the details described below.","The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.","Suitable System with Three Operating Modes","As discussed herein, a mobile device having, for example, at least two displays and associated functionality provides users with a rich telecommunications experience. The mobile device provides for multitasking and allows users to be constantly connected to others, such as those in their social network. Fewer buttons need to be provided on the mobile device through the use of specific modes; a display screen, in a given mode, provides to the user an interface that intuitively provides or presents those input options the user requires in that mode while omitting other options. For example, for voice communications such as voice calls, a full physical keyboard may not be necessary. The visual complexity is thus reduced. The secondary display can be used to display icons or functions associated with function keys, where those keys are programmed to perform different functions based on not only the current state of the mobile device, but also on an application currently active on the device. While hardware buttons are generally described herein, the device may include one or more touch sensitive screens.","Overall, the device provides for escalating user engagement and power management, based upon the physical position of a primary display. In a first \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201ccheck\u201d or Passive Mode, the device allows users to check status of miscellaneous device functions or applications, such as e-mails received, text messages received, alerts received, voicemails waiting, etc. While in Passive Mode, the device conserves power. In a second Semiactive Mode, the device provides more functionality to the user so that the user can, for instance, initiate or receive voice calls, launch certain device applications, in some embodiments, interact with device applications via touchscreen functionality, while omitting functionality that is not necessary to those applications, such as a physical keyboard. In Semiactive Mode, the mobile device  presents to the user a greater set of user input devices or options and greater set of user output than in the Passive Mode (e.g. more input buttons and a larger display to provide more information to the user). In a third, fully Active Mode, the device provides all functionality, including a full keyboard permitting alphanumeric entry via a physical, as opposed to touchscreen, keyboard. In Active Mode, the mobile device  presents to the user an even greater set of user input options and user output than in the Semiactive Mode (e.g. all input buttons, both the primary and secondary displays, all with more information and options presented to the user). In other words, the Active mode provides to the user all or nearly all of the functionality available to the user via the mobile device ; the Semiactive mode provides to the user a proper subset of the functionality available via the mobile device; and, the Passive Mode provides to the user limited functionality\u2014a proper subset of the Semiactive mode functionality.","Referring to , B, C, D and E, a mobile device  that provides two displays and three operating modes is shown. The term \u201cmobile device\u201d may encompass any of a myriad of telecommunication devices such as cellular phones, VoIP phones, personal digital assistants, portable computers, mini computers, programmable consumer electronics, media players, gaming devices and so on. Such mobile devices may include a central processing unit, memory, input devices (e.g., keypads and input buttons) and output devices (e.g., display devices), as described herein. Mobile devices may also include hardware and operating instructions stored in memory for wirelessly transmitting and receiving data according to one or more wireless protocols. Such protocols include short range protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ultra-wideband, and ZigBee) and radio-access network protocols (e.g., GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), EDGE (Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution), LTE (Long Term Evolution), Wimax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), UMA\/GAN (Unlicensed Mobile Access\/Generic Access Network)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A","b":["1","1","100","100","102","104","102","102","106","104","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","104","108","102","100","104","108"]},"In the Passive Mode, the second housing portion  and larger display  are positioned adjacent to a first or bottom end  of the first housing portion . The Passive Mode is a low engagement mode for the mobile device  in which the larger display  is typically turned off or operates for limited periods of time in order or in a reduced manner to preserve device power, and the mobile device otherwise operates in a low power mode. One advantage of this operating mode is that a user can receive instant or approximately instant notification of, for example, incoming messages (via the secondary display  or \u201cstatus bar\u201d) without having to power on the larger display . Keeping the larger display  off or in a reduced state can significantly reduce the power consumption of the mobile device  and, accordingly, extends battery life of the device. Moreover, the user can still receive a stream of information regarding device functionality (e.g., emails, text messages, alerts, voicemails received, etc.) via the secondary display  because radio components are still operating, but in a lower power state.","As best seen in , a top end  of the first housing portion  includes the secondary display  having one or more status indicators or icons  configured to provide information about the mobile device  (e.g., phone calls, e-mail messages, text messages, voicemail messages, social networking messages, etc.), or other types of information. The status indicators  can include icons associated with e-mail messages, voicemail messages, text or chat messages and\/or social networking messages, each of which may also include a number or counter indicating a total number of new messages received but that have not yet been opened or viewed. In other embodiments, the status bar  can have a different configuration and\/or include different features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 5"],"b":["106","106","106","30","122","124","126","128","122","128","106","122","128"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["100","122","128","106","122","106"]},"As discussed above, the mobile device  is in the first or Passive Mode when in the configuration shown in . Referring next to , the second housing portion  and larger display  are slidably moved laterally relative to the first housing portion  (as shown by arrow A in ) in a plane parallel to that of the secondary display , to position the second component adjacent to a top end  of the first housing portion  and put the mobile device  in the Semiactive Mode.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1D","b":["104","108","105","102","100","100","116","100","100","100","100","108"]},"As shown in , the first housing portion  includes or carries a number of input\/output components and other electronic and mechanical components for the device . For example, the mobile device  includes a send button , an end button , a menu button , a back button , and a trackball or input pad . As described below, the first housing  can also include a number of other input components (e.g., a camera, etc.) to accept input from a user, output components (e.g., headphone port, speaker, etc.) to provide feedback to a user, and communication ports (e.g., USB port, etc.) for connecting the mobile device  to an external device (e.g., a personal computer).","The second housing portion  includes a display housing movably engaged with the first housing  and the display  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or organic LCD (OLED), plasma display, electronic ink (eInk)) carried by the display housing. The display housing can also include a speaker (not shown) and a variety of other electronic or mechanical components. A user interfaces with the mobile device  via user input components (e.g., input buttons , a keyboard (), touchscreen, microphone, voice recognition system, etc.) and\/or user output components (e.g., screen , speaker, etc.).","As described below, the mobile device  can also include various other computing components, such as those generally found in smart phones, cellular phones, handheld e-mail devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablet computers, gaming devices, or other such mobile devices, such as a power subsystem, data storage to store programs and data, and at least one data processor to run an operating system and a variety of different applications. The mobile device  can also include hardware and operating instructions stored in memory for wirelessly transmitting and receiving data according to one or more wireless protocols, as well as other hardware and\/or software components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1E","FIG. 1D"],"b":["100","100","104","102","104","102","116","108","104","102","116","116","102","104","116"]},"Suitable Internal Systems and Network Configurations","Referring to , the mobile device  may contain a portable power subsystem  (e.g. battery, solar cell, or power conditioning circuit), data storage or memory  to store programs and data, and at least one data processor  to run an operating system and applications to implement the processes described herein. A user interacts or interfaces with the device via a user input component  (e.g., elements noted herein, including keypad, touchscreen, microphone, voice recognition system, an audio input port for use with an external wired\/wireless microphone) and\/or a user output component  (e.g., speaker, primary and secondary display devices, an audio output port for use with an external wired\/wireless speaker\/earphone). The mobile device also includes a communication network interface component  (such as a radio and\/or wireless interface, an Enternet interface, a universal serial bus (USB) interface, and so on), and may include one or more wireless transceivers or components to establish communication channels with a network and\/or other devices. The communication component  may establish any number of suitable communication channels including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ultra-wideband, ZigBee, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, CDMA, and so on.","The user input components  include a position sensor circuit configured to detect movement of the second housing portion  and\/or larger display  and thus determine a desired mode for the mobile device . The position sensor circuit can generate three different signals for the processor  based on the position of the second housing portion  and\/or larger display , and thus the processor can initiate the corresponding mode described herein.","The mobile device  may include messaging components  to permit the user to engage in multiple types of asynchronous text-based communication described herein. Thus, the messaging components  can include e-mail clients, social network messaging clients\/twittering components, etc. Further, the mobile device may include certain applications, such as a video playback component  to permit the device to replay downloaded, streamed or locally stored videos. Further, the mobile device includes an audio playback component  to permit the device to replay digital audio files, such as mp3 files. While playback is described, the audio and video components may include functionality to permit users to create and\/or edit video and\/or audio files. Of course, other applications are possible including digital image capture, editing and replay where the mobile device may include a camera (not shown). The mobile device  may also contain other components and\/or applications, such as a mapping component and a location determination component such as a global positioning system (GPS) component.","In the Passive Mode, the power component  and processor  power down the primary display  (user output component ), unless video playback component  is active, as explained below. Further, the processor may shut down or put in a standby state messaging components  and aspects of the communication components , such as powering down a radio (e.g. WiFi radio), or operating transceivers at a lower power state, especially any transmit components. Other power saving features may likewise be employed.","In the Semiactive, the power component  and processor  power up the communication components . In the Fully Active Mode, the power component  and processor  further engage the messaging components  and, based on user input, may enable other components, such as the audio or video playback components  and . Thus, as the mobile device moves from the Passive Mode to the Semiactive Mode, and finally to the Active Mode, various aspects or functionality of the device escalate. For example, the amount of information provided or output to a user escalates from simple icons, message counters, and a temporarily displayed line of text in the Passive Mode to display of full color messages with text and\/or images in Active Mode. Likewise, the array of user inputs available to a user similarly escalates from four function buttons - in the Passive Mode, to the microphone\/audio input and buttons associated with making\/ending calls, and finally to a full keyboard and other inputs in the Active Mode. All these modes of communication allow the user to stay connected to friends, family, and business associates and any other person or entity to which the user wishes to communicate with, over a variety of communication mediums and networks.","Referring to , a block diagram  illustrates a suitable system for exchanging various types of messaging between mobile devices, landline phones, computers, etc. Aspects of the system may be stored or distributed on tangible computer-readable media, including magnetically or optically readable computer discs, hard-wired or preprogrammed chips (e.g., EEPROM semiconductor chips), nanotechnology memory, biological memory, or other data storage media. Alternatively or additionally, computer implemented instructions, data structures, screen displays, and other data under aspects of the system may be distributed over the Internet or over other networks (including cellular or IP-based telecommunications networks), on a propagated signal on a propagation medium (e.g., an electromagnetic wave(s), a sound wave, etc.) over a period of time, or they may be provided on any analog or digital network (packet switched, circuit switched, or other scheme).","The system  includes a mobile device  at a first location, a PC or laptop computer , a landline or fixed-line phone , two or more other mobile devices , ,  (such as mobile devices from different manufacturers and associated with different wireless service providers\/networks), and, in this example, a network  that provides communication links between the mobile devices, telephone, and PC, stores information associated with the mobile device PC, and sends and receives information from the mobile device PC. Although only one network  is shown, it will be understood that the devices of  may access each other via one or more other telecommunications networks, including, for example, one or more cellular networks, IP-based telecommunications networks, the Internet, peer-to-peer communications, circuit switched networks (e.g., POTS), etc., as discussed herein.","Thus, in one example, a user of the mobile device  may receive a voice message, an email message, and a text message from each of the different mobile devices , , and , all of which are temporarily displayed in the secondary display  as noted herein. The user can make a voice call to the landline phone  or to a VoIP phone via PC . Further, the user of the mobile device  can exchange text-based messages with the mobile devices -, and the PC .","Referring to , a block diagram illustrating suitable components within the network  is shown. The network  includes a data network  (e.g., TCP\/IP or other protocol), which one or more telecommunications networks  may access via a gateway . The network  may include or communicate with one or more servers , a network database , and so on. The servers  may assist in exchanging messages among the devices (e.g. devices of ), display and\/or present information to users of the mobile devices described herein, such as information stored in the database , etc. The servers may include components similar to those shown in , including communication components that enable communication of information between the servers  and mobile devices, and other components. The network  may include or be part of any network capable of facilitating communications between devices, and is not limited to those shown in . Examples include the wireless protocols noted above, as well as other protocols including Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), TCP\/IP, and other technologies.","The system may include one or more picocells communicatively coupled to a base station in a cellular network. A picocell is a wireless access point typically covering a relatively small area, such as within a building (e.g., office, shopping mall, train station, or the like) or within an aircraft, ship, train or other vehicle. A picocell may, for example, be analogous to a WiFi access point, except that it typically broadcasts using the licensed spectrum of an associated wireless carrier. The picocell serves as an access point for routing communication between device and the network. One or more picocells may be coupled to a base station controller (BSC) by way of wired or wireless connections.","Alternatively or additionally, the network includes an IP-based network that includes a VoIP broadcast architecture, UMA or GAN (Generic Access Network) broadcast architecture, or a femtocell broadcast architecture. Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, is a telecommunication system for the transmission of voice over the Internet or other packet-switched networks, and can include mobile devices specifically designed for usage under VoIP. Unlicensed Mobile Access or UMA, is the commercial name of the 3GPP Generic Access Network or GAN standard. Somewhat like VoIP, UMA\/GAN is a telecommunication system which extends services, voice, data, and IP Multimedia Subsystem\/Session Initiation Protocol (IMS\/SIP) applications over IP-based networks. For example, a common application of UMA\/GAN is in a dual-mode handset service in which device users can seamlessly roam and handover between local area networks and wide area networks using a GSM\/Wi-Fi dual-mode mobile phone. UMA\/GAN enables the convergence of mobile, fixed and Internet telephony, sometimes called Fixed Mobile Convergence. Femtocells are much like picocells\u2014they broadcast within the licensed spectrum of a wireless telecommunications carrier. Femtocells are typically designed for use in residential or small business environments. Femtocells connects to the service provider's network much like UMA\/GAN access points, namely over IP-based networks.","The database  can store personalized information for the user of the mobile device . For example, as described below, the function buttons - and secondary display  may be assigned different functions depending upon not only the current state of the mobile device, but also an application currently running on the device. The user may adjust the functions and icons associated with the function buttons - and the secondary display , respectively, and store such changes in a user profile stored in the network database . For example, when the mobile device  is playing an application such as a first-person shooter game, the application may set as defaults for the function buttons , , , and , the following respective functions: shoot, jump, crouch, and reload. The user may reconfigure functions associated with the function buttons , ,  and , to be change weapon, run, turn left, and turn right, respectively. These changes would thus be added to the user's profile stored in the database  for that particular game so that the next time the user played that game, those presets for the function buttons would be enabled. This can be particularly helpful with network games where the user is playing a game with other users over the network . Many other examples are possible, including those presented below.","As another example, the network database  can be a network address book that stores contact information for friends and other contacts for the user. Rather than relying on an address book stored locally in the mobile device , the network address book may allow the user to have access to more current information regarding the user's contacts. Thus, phone numbers, email addresses, and other contact information for the user's contacts can be the most accurate and thereby help ensure that she stays connected to her contacts. More details regarding the network address book may be found in the assignee's U.S. Patent Application No. 2009\/0093242 entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ACCOUNTS SET UP FOR MOBILE DEVICES, SUCH AS AN EMAIL ACCOUNT SETUP,\u201d filed May 5, 2008 (A. Bhalekar and M. Penwala, inventors).","Modal Operation of Mobile Device","As discussed above, the mobile device  may move from increasing engagement modes, such as whisper-phone-text, or check-call-connect. Referring to , a flow diagram illustrating an example of a routine  for moving between modes is shown. Beginning in block , the mobile device  is in Passive Mode. As noted above, the device displays on the secondary display  a counter of received messages, and a scrolling text message of a subject line or other brief information regarding a newly received message. The radio is in a lower power mode to simply ping the network for any newly received messages. In block , the device determines whether any new messages are received, and if so temporarily displays a portion of those messages under block .","In block , the mobile device  determines whether the primary display screen  has been moved laterally. If so, then in block  the device enters Semiactive Mode and prepares for and primarily facilitates, for example, voice communications. In Semiactive Mode, the user can also read text or asynchronous communications without responding to those communications. The radio will be fully powered up to facilitate voice communications. Optionally, the mobile device may secondarily facilitate other device functionality, such as text messaging, e-mail, etc. Following blocks  or , the device determines whether the screen is moved transversely under block . If so, then in block , the device enters Active Mode and prepares for and facilitates all of the communication and application functionality available on or via the device. Following block  or , the device determines whether the screen has been moved to enter the Passive Mode (block ). If so, then the routine  loops back to block ; otherwise, the routine moves back to block .","When the mobile device moves into Active Mode, most or all functionality of the device is made available to the user. Referring to , the secondary display  may display information for the user in addition to the primary display , unlike in phone mode. The displayed icons  in the secondary display  are rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and more importantly, become visual indicators for functions associated with function buttons -. The secondary display may be a dashboard for launching applications or functions on the mobile device . In the example of , a home screen for the secondary display  in Active Mode may provide access to certain user-preferred functions via the function buttons. For example, the function button  may permit the user to access and obtain a pull-down screen or \u201cwindow shade\u201d that displays an inbox and\/or a really simple syndication (RSS) feed or running list of posts, messages or other information associated with a group of friends, individuals, organizations, sites, etc. previously selected by the user. The function button  may allow the user to quickly access a menu or user interface to allow her to contact, through any means noted herein, her selected, or \u201cfavorite\u201d, friends, individuals, organizations, etc. The function button  may be used to quickly access a user's predefined favorite applications on the mobile device or to access a home page\/screen. The button  may permit the user to access and edit her profile (which may be stored in the network address book).","Thus, when the mobile device  is in Active Mode or in landscape orientation, the function buttons - become dedicated to a particular application currently active or running on the device. As another example to that noted above, a home or initial page of the primary display  in the Active Mode may provide all available applications to the user, but a home display for function buttons , ,  and  may allow the user to send an e-mail, leave a voice message, send a text\/chat message, or send a social networking message, respectively (see icons of ). To perform other functions, such as take a picture, watch a video, listen to music, view pictures, etc., the user must access the corresponding application from a main menu of applications displayed on the primary display . If the user selects the option to send an e-mail (e.g. via function button ), the mobile device launches the e-mail client and may display the user's inbox of messages. When the user selects the option to create a new message, then the function buttons - may then be dedicated to perform functions specific to the active application, such as insert an emoticon, insert a picture, insert specific formatting, and attach a file, all with appropriate icons  displayed in the secondary display . As another example, the mobile device  in  may be executing an instant messaging or chat mode application. Function button  then may become associated with sending a chat message to an individual, while button  would allow the user to send a chat message to a group. Button  would allow the user to provide a do not disturb state to fellow instant messaging users, while button  would allow access to certain chat functions.","Overall, in keyboard mode, both the larger display  and the secondary display  display information for the user. The operating system running on the mobile device  provides appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable applications running on the mobile device to use not only the larger display , but also the secondary display . Thus, in the example above, the email application or chat application includes specific functionality to specify icons or labels for the function buttons -, depending upon a current mode or status of the application (e.g., preparing a new email message or chat message). While the secondary display  displays supplementary information, users may still receive full information on the primary display device. The examples above show how the secondary display provides users with quick access to certain functions also available via the primary display. However, the secondary display may provide other supplementary information to users beyond short cuts to desired applications, or to desired functions within applications. For example, the secondary display may be an extension of the primary display so as to display other information. Such other or supplementary information can include: a list of tabs (e.g. for tabbed browsing); a list of favorite links; a list of recently opened\/edited files; to display changing data, such as a news feed, stock ticker (e.g. when executing a stock viewing application\/site), or other RSS\/browser accessed information (e.g. social networking feed of recent posts\/messages from friends), or display other information. Further examples can include displaying an equalizer when the mobile device is executing a digital audio player, or providing a list of friends within a predetermined geographic radius under a location-based service.","The current operating state or application of the mobile device  not only can specify what to display in the secondary display , but also provide further features to a user depending upon the current state of the device and\/or depending upon transitions between states. Consider one example where the mobile device  is in Active Mode. The instant messaging application is active, and the user is replying to a chat message from an instant messaging contact. The mobile device then enters Semiactive Mode. As a result, the mobile device provides certain shortcuts to the user based on predetermined assumptions. In this example, the mobile device assumes that the user wishes to call the instant messaging contact who was the subject of the most recent chat message. The mobile device thus accesses the network address book stored in the network database  and obtains the phone number(s) associated with that contact so that those numbers are available and displayed to the user in phone mode. The user can thus simply press the Call or Send button , rather than having to find the appropriate number. Thus, when moving from Active Mode (while executing an application associated with a message\/message) to the Semiactive Mode, the phone number or phone numbers for contact(s) involved in the message while in keyboard mode can be retrieved from memory and made readily available to the user to quickly establish a call. Other examples are, of course, possible.","Referring to , an example of a routine  is shown for maintaining states or functionality as the mobile device moves between modes. Beginning in block , the mobile device  is in an Active Mode of . The user selects to replay a video. In block , the device obtains context information, such as determining that a previous chat message was viewed or a video is currently being played back and has not been paused or stopped. In block , the mobile device determines that the primary display  has moved to a lower engagement mode or lower state position, which moves the device into the passive or phone state. If it has so been moved, then in block  the mobile device  continues to enable any necessary high power components. In this example, the processor  continues to power up the primary display  and output audio via the speaker (user output components ). In block , the mobile device provides messages or appropriate icons for function buttons - via the secondary display . In this example, the user puts the primary display  into the Passive Mode. As a result, the secondary display  displays icons for pause, rewind, fast forward, and stop, associated respectively with function buttons  through . In block , the process  determines whether the screen  has moved to a higher power state. If not, it loops back to block , but if it does move, then the process loops up to block .","While the example above has been applied to video playback, the same is true for music playback where the secondary display  may show, for example, a scrolling display of song title, artist, etc. In camera mode, the primary display  can show the field of view for the camera (with camera optics provided on an underside of the mobile device (not shown)), and the function buttons - can provide functions to take a picture, delete a picture, replay a picture, or enable certain options such as flash, zoom, fast shutter speed, etc.","Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u201ccomprise,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense, as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d As used herein, the terms \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d or any variant thereof means any connection or coupling, either direct or indirect, between two or more elements; the coupling or connection between the elements can be physical, logical, or a combination thereof. Additionally, the words \u201cherein,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cbelow,\u201d and words of similar import, when used in this application, refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application. Where the context permits, words in the above Detailed Description using the singular or plural number may also include the plural or singular number respectively. The word \u201cor,\u201d in reference to a list of two or more items, covers all of the following interpretations of the word: any of the items in the list, all of the items in the list, and any combination of the items in the list.","The above Detailed Description of examples of the system is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the system to the precise form disclosed above. While specific examples for the system are described above for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications are possible within the scope of the system, as those skilled in the relevant art will recognize. While processes or blocks are presented in a given order, alternative implementations may perform routines having steps, or employ systems having blocks, in a different order, and some processes or blocks may be deleted, moved, added, subdivided, combined, and\/or modified to provide alternative or subcombinations. Each of these processes or blocks may be implemented in a variety of different ways. Also, while processes or blocks are at times shown as being performed in series, these processes or blocks may instead be performed or implemented in parallel, or may be performed at different times.","The teachings of the system provided herein can be applied to other systems, not necessarily the system described above. The elements and acts of the various examples described above can be combined to provide further implementations of the system. Any patents and applications and other references noted above, including any that may be listed in accompanying filing papers, are incorporated herein by reference. Aspects of the invention can be modified, if necessary, to employ the systems, functions, and concepts of the various references described above to provide yet further implementations of the invention.","Other changes can be made to the system in light of the above Detailed Description. While the above description describes certain examples of the system, and describes the best mode contemplated, no matter how detailed the above appears in text, the system can be practiced in many ways. Details of the system may vary considerably in its specific implementation, while still being encompassed by the system disclosed herein. As noted above, particular terminology used when describing certain features or aspects of the system should not be taken to imply that the terminology is being redefined herein to be restricted to any specific characteristics, features, or aspects of the system with which that terminology is associated. In general, the terms used in the following claims should not be construed to limit the system to the specific examples disclosed in the specification, unless the above Detailed Description section explicitly defines such terms. Accordingly, the actual scope of the system encompasses not only the disclosed examples, but also all equivalent ways of practicing or implementing the system under the claims.","While certain aspects of the invention are presented below in certain claim forms, the applicant contemplates the various aspects of the invention in any number of claim forms. For example, while only one aspect of the invention is recited as a means-plus-function claim under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, sixth paragraph, other aspects may likewise be embodied as a means-plus-function claim, or in other forms, such as being embodied in a computer-readable medium. (Any claims intended to be treated under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, \u00b66 will begin with the words \u201cmeans for\u201d, but use of the term \u201cfor\u201d in any other context is not intended to invoke treatment under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, \u00b66.) Accordingly, the applicant reserves the right to add additional claims after filing the application to pursue such additional claim forms for other aspects of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 1E","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
