title: Wideband floating wire antenna using a double negative meta-material
abstract: A buoyant cable antenna element is taught that employs a specific double-negative meta-material sheath with a negative permeability. The double-negative meta-material sheath is disposed over the insulated wire portion of the buoyant cable antenna element. The double-negative meta-material sheath enables a deliberate reduction in the antenna wire inductance to a zero value at a desired critical frequency. Reducing the antenna wire inductance to zero creates a traveling wave structure antenna having enhanced bandwidth.

The wire may be either a solid or stranded copper conductor of uniform diameter along its length. It is often connected to the underwater vehicle by means of a standard coaxial transmission line at one end. The other end of the wire is terminated either in a shorting cap (to connect it to the ocean) or an insulating cap (to isolate it from the ocean.) The choice of cap is determined by the mode of operation that the operator wishes. The buoyant cable antenna is one of a host of submarine antennas currently in use that allow a submarine to perform electromagnetic communications while it is submerged.","Prior art antennas suffer from limited performance in the commercial high frequency (HF) band of 2 to 30 MHZ. This limited performance is due to the limited band width of the prior art antenna elements. It has become apparent that there is a need for a buoyant cable antenna element that can improve the bandwidth of the antenna in the HF band.","An object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide an improved buoyant cable antenna element with enhanced performance in the commercial HF band.","This objective is achieved by using a specific double-negative meta-material sheath with a negative permeability, to surround the insulated wire portion of the buoyant cable antenna element. A double-negative meta-material having a specific permeability is used in order to deliberately reduce the antenna wire inductance to a zero value at a desired critical frequency, thereby creating a traveling wave structure antenna having enhanced bandwidth.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , there is illustrated an exploded view of the present invention. Using the geometry of prior art buoyant cable antennas as a point of departure there is illustrated a coaxial feed line . The coaxial feed line  is a standard 50 ohm transmission line, however, the invention is not limited to use with a 50 ohm transmission lines. At the end of the coaxial feed line  the braid  is exposed for 3 to 4 inches. This is necessary in order to ground the feed system for the antenna. At the end of the section of exposed braid  the center conductor  of coaxial feed line  is connected to the antenna element . The antenna element  is designed to be positively buoyant and to float on the surface of a body of water. The antenna element  consist of a straight wire , usually a copper (or other metal) conductor of uniform diameter along its length. The straight wire  may be either a solid or stranded copper conductor. The antenna element  has a cylindrical sheath of a double-negative (DNG) meta-material  disposed over a cylindrical sheath of dielectric insulator  surrounding the straight wire . The sheath of double negative meta-material  is a non-conducting material whose dielectric constant and relative permeability are both negative numbers over a particular frequency range of interest. Meta-materials are a broad class of materials for applications in electromagnetics, antennas, and radio frequency component design and are well known in the art. At the end of antenna element  is a shorting cap . The shorting cap  is a solid metallic structure that connects electrically to the center conductor of the antenna element  and conforms to the overall diameter of the antenna element .","Referring to , there is illustrated a more detailed view of antenna element , which consists of a straight wire  surrounded by two concentric cylinders of material. The inner cylinder is composed of a conventional dielectric insulating material , such as Teflon or polyethylene. The outer cylinder is composed of the double negative meta-material , the material parameters of which are determined by the frequency range over which the antenna element  is to be used. There are no air gaps between the straight wire  and the dielectric cylinder , or between the dielectric cylinder  and meta-material cylinder . In a preferred embodiment, the meta-material  is buoyant in water.","In operation, the buoyant cable antenna of this invention works by exploiting the negative properties of the meta-material cylinder  to alter the propagation constant along the straight wire . A transmission line model is a suitable one for predicting the input impedance of a typical floating wire antenna. Applying this approach, it can be shown that the per-unit length inductance of the straight wire  is given by equation (1) as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"L","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mrow":{"mn":"8","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03c0"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"ln","mfrac":{"mi":["b","a"]}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"2"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"ln","mfrac":{"mi":["c","b"]}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":"2","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b3","Euler"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"c","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":[{"mi":"\u03bc","mn":"0"},{"mi":["\u03c3","ocean"]}]}}}}}}}],"mo":["+","+"]}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["16","20","18","18","16"],"sub":["2 ","0 ","ocean ","Euler "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"1"}},{"mi":["a","b"]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"ln"},{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"2"}},{"mi":["b","c"]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"ln"}],"mo":"+"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 "],"b":["20","18","16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"Z","mo":"=","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"R","mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":["j\u03c9","L"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":["j\u03c9","C"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["R+j\u03c9L","j\u03c9C"]},"where R is the sum of the bulk electrical resistance of the straight wire  and it radiation resistance, both on a per-unit-length basis.

The inner dielectric enclosing the wire was 0.325 inches in radius and had a dielectric constant of 1.8. The L=0 critical frequency was arbitrarily chosen to be 17 MHz (roughly mid-band). This frequency dictated the use of a meta-material with a \u03bcof \u22125.475. The permittivity of the meta-material had been arbitrarily chosen to be \u22122.2. It is of great interest to note that for a frequency of f>7 MHz, the input impedances seen with either a short or open circuited tip are almost identical. This indicates that the current leaving the coaxial feed line is attenuated as it travels along the wire to such an extent that there is little current left at the end of the antenna to reflect backwards and create a standing wave. It is also worth noting that the impedance does not change appreciably with increasing frequency.","There is thus provided a buoyant cable antenna that can improve the bandwidth of the antenna in the HF band through the use of a DNG meta-material sheath.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, and arrangements of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawing in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
