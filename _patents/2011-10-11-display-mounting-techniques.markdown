{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL STATEMENT","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure relates to automation control, and more specifically, to display mounting techniques for a display associated with an industrial control system.","Industrial control systems can be employed to regulate operation of equipment in an industrial environment, where operation of the equipment can include process(es) typically directed to accomplishment of a complex task or a streamlined, automated task, such as large scale manufacturing. Regulation of operation of the equipment and related process(es) typically exploits and produces substantive amounts of control data, which include configuration data such as controller code, human-machine interface (HMI) data, process recipe(s) and report definitions, or the like. In addition, operation of industrial control systems also produces both real-time and historical data about the status of regulated equipment and related process(es), the data including alarms, process values, and audit\/error logs. To operate industrial control systems, various HMIs in the industrial environment render control data (real-time (or last known) and historical data) through operator interfaces which convey process overviews or equipment detail. Information relating to the operation of the industrial control system and at least some of the various types of interfaces are often presented to the operator via one or more displays.","One particular display associated with a particular industrial control system is traditionally mounted using screws, such as micro screws, which are inserted in a horizontal direction into the sides of the display housing. However, the particular bezel design does not allow for horizontal mounting, and only allows vertical mounting of the display. As a result, it is necessary to retain the display in the vertical direction in accordance with the bezel design, yet the display still has to be retained horizontally for alignment purposes.","Another issue with regard to that particular display is that there are a significant number of cables associated with the display, and it is desirable to maintain the positioning of these cables so that the cables are not degraded or corrupted (e.g., pinched, shorted, broken, etc.) by other components associated with the display. Still another issue with regard to that particular display is that, in accordance with industrial standards, it is necessary for the cable connector associated with the cable wires to be able to withstand at least 15 Newtons (N) of pulling out force such that the cable connector will not be disengaged from the socket on the display unless more than 15 N of force is applied to pull out the cable connector from its connection counterpart.","Yet another issue relating to that particular display is that a dust gasket, which is to be positioned below the display, has to be in compression for the display and associated dust gasket to perform properly. In this regard, another issue is that an undesired amount and\/or distribution of force (e.g., suboptimal amount of force and\/or uneven distribution of force) on the display can result in impaired operation of the display.","Another issue is that the display should be properly grounded in relation to the bezel housing. With the display itself not being able to be horizontally mounted in the bezel housing, the insertion of the display in the bezel housing may result in the display not having a conductive ground path with the bezel. If the display does not have a conductive ground path with the bezel, the display may not be properly grounded, which could negatively impact performance of the display.","The above-described deficiencies of today's devices and systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional devices and systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the subject disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the subject disclosure or to delineate any scope. The sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The disclosed subject matter comprises a display retention bracket (DRB) that can be attached to and can retain a display using a plurality of display retention components (DRCs) in a horizontal direction to horizontally mount the display without having to use fasteners to facilitate mounting the display in a bezel housing that supports vertical mounting of the display but does not support horizontal mounting, wherein the DRB (with the display retained therein via horizontal mount) can be inserted into and vertically mounted in the bezel housing, as more fully disclosed herein. In another aspect, the DRB also can include a cable retention component that can enable a cable connector, associated with (e.g., connected to) one or more cable wires, to withstand at least a specified amount of pull-out force to maintain connection of the cable connector to a cable receptacle on the back side of the display. In still another aspect, the DRB can include a cable guide that can be employed to maintain one or more cable wires of a cable in a desired position in relation to other components, wherein the one or more cable wires can be routed via, and secured within, one or more channels formed in the cable guide to restrict movement of the cable wires and maintain the one or more cable wires in a desired position in relation to other components associated with the display.","In yet another aspect, the DRB can contain a specified number of alignment pins, which can be utilized to precisely align the DRB and display with a bezel housing when the DRB and display are placed in or on the bezel housing. For instance, the alignment pins can be formed on the DRB in respective positions that can correspond to respective holes in the bezel housing, wherein the respective pins can be inserted in the respective holes to place the DRB and display within the bezel housing with the desired alignment. In accordance with still another aspect, the DRB can comprise a specified number (e.g., 2) of non-symmetrical tabs that can be employed to ensure the display is oriented correctly, wherein the specified number of non-symmetrical tabs can, for example, restrict the placement of the DRB and display in the bezel housing by an assembly system or an assembler such that the orientation of the DRB and display within the bezel housing results in the proper display of information when the display is powered on (e.g., display will have a right-side-up orientation).","In yet another aspect, the DRB can include a plurality of offset columns that can desirably offset loads on the display when an adapter plate is applied onto the DRB and display, and fastened to the bezel to secure the display, while also enabling the fastening of the adapter plate to the bezel to desirably secure the display within the bezel housing. The offset columns can extend vertically upward from the main frame of the DRB and away from the bezel toward the adapter plate, wherein the offset columns can facilitate providing a desired amount of clamping force to the display and a dust gasket associated with the display. In another aspect, the offset columns can be offset by a specified amount from their corresponding supports on the bottom of the DRB to act or function as a compliant or deflection member for the bezel housing. In still another aspect, the DRB also can comprise a ground clip that can extend the ground path from the bezel to the display to adequately ground the display. For instance, the ground clip can be positioned so that it is in contact with the bezel when the DRB and display are placed within the bezel housing, and the ground clip also can be in contact with the housing (e.g., metal housing) of the display.","In accordance with various aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a DRB that includes a main frame configured to have a perimeter that has a shape and a size that is proportional to a housing of a display to enable a portion of the housing of the display to be inserted into a space defined and surrounded by the main frame, wherein the portion of the housing of the display has a defined shape and size. The DRB also can include a plurality of DRCs that are formed on a surface of the main frame in locations that correspond to locations of a plurality of holes in the housing of the display, wherein the plurality of DRCs are configured to be slidable into the plurality of holes to retain the display, without using screws, to mount the display when the display and the DRB are inserted into a housing of a bezel.","In accordance with various other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can include a method comprising the act of forming a main frame of a DRB, wherein the main frame has a substantially polygonal shape and a specified size, wherein the main frame is large enough to contain at least a portion of a display within an area defined and surrounded by the main frame, and wherein the portion of the display has a defined size and shape. The method also includes the act of forming a specified number of display retention components on an inner surface of the main frame of the display retention bracket to facilitate retaining the display in a horizontal direction to horizontally mount the display, without using screws, when the display retention bracket is attached to the display and the display retention bracket and the display are inserted into and vertically mounted to a housing of a bezel that is structured to not allow horizontal mounting of the display.","In accordance with still other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system comprising one or more DRBs, wherein a DRB of the one or more DRBs comprises: a main frame configured to hold a display having a housing that has a convex quadrilateral shape and a specified size, without using screws, to mount the display when the display and the one or more DRBs are inserted into a bezel housing.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed subject matter are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be employed and is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The subject disclosure is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident, however, that the subject disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof.","As used in this application, in certain instances, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and the like, can refer to a mechanical or physical entity; and, in certain other instances, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d, \u201csystem\u201d, \u201cplatform\u201d, \u201clayer\u201d, \u201ccontroller\u201d, \u201cinterface\u201d, and the like, can refer to a computer-related entity or an entity related to, or that is part of, an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein such entities can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.

Thus, a \u201cset\u201d or a \u201csubset\u201d in the subject disclosure includes one or more elements or entities. As an illustration, a set of controllers includes one or more controllers; a set of data resources includes one or more data resources; etc. Likewise, the term \u201cgroup\u201d as utilized herein refers to a collection of one or more entities; e.g., a group of nodes refers to one or more nodes.","Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches also can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102"]},"In another aspect, the system  can comprise a bezel  (also referred to herein as a bezel sub-assembly) that can be used to facilitate holding and securing the display , wherein the bezel  can be placed or attached in a desired location in an industrial control system so that the display  can be utilized by one or more users. Typically, the bezel  can have a shape and size that corresponds to the shape and size of the display, but with the size being larger than the size of the display  by a specified amount so that the display  can be placed wholly or at least partially within the bezel . It is to be appreciated and understood though that, in accordance with other embodiments, the display  can be differently shaped than the bezel  and\/or can be sized such that the display  is significantly smaller than the bezel .","The display  can comprise a plurality of holes (e.g., screw holes), such as holes  and , on the one side of the display  and corresponding holes (not shown in ) on the other side of the display , wherein conventionally relatively small screws (e.g., M2 screws or micro screws) are inserted horizontally into the holes  and  of the display . However, the bezel  is structured such that the bezel  does not allow for horizontal mounting of the display , but does allow vertical mounting. As a result, the display  has to be retained in the vertical direction in relation to the bezel , but also has to be retained horizontally for alignment purposes. Further, during assembly, it can be difficult to insert the relatively small screws into the holes  and  when attempting to secure the display  in the bezel  and retain the display  horizontally.","In accordance with various aspects and embodiments, the system  can include a display retention bracket (DRB)  that can be used to retain the display  in the horizontal direction to mount the display  horizontally, while also enabling the display  to be secured or retained in the vertical direction within the bezel . In an aspect, the DRB  can retain the display  in the horizontal direction without having to use fasteners (e.g., screws, such as micro screws), which thereby overcomes the difficulty involved in trying to insert the fasteners. In an embodiment, the DRB  can be formed of a compliant material or geometry (e.g., plastic, rubberized plastic compound, etc.), wherein the DRB  can be formed via a desired process, such as an injection molding process (e.g., computer-implemented injection molding process), although other processes can be employed, as desired. It is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with various other embodiments, the DRB  can be formed of other types of materials (e.g., metal, such as a metal with a flexibility and resiliency similar to the DRB formed of a polymer-type material) or a combination of materials (e.g., combination of polymer and metal).","In an embodiment, the DRB  can be sized (e.g., perimeter or space defined and surrounded by the main frame of the DRB  can be sufficiently sized to be able to contain at least a defined portion of the display having a size of 9 inches (e.g., diagonally for the display screen), 12 inches, 15 inches, or a smaller or larger size) and shaped (e.g., polygonal, quadrilateral (e.g., convex quadrilateral), square, rectangular, circular, elliptical, etc.) to correspond with the respective sizes and shapes of the display  and bezel . For instance, the DRB  can be large enough in size to fit around and be attached to the housing, or portion thereof, of the display , yet still small enough to fit the DRB , with the display  attached therein, into the opening of the bezel . For instance, the main frame of the DRB  can be sufficiently sized so that the length and width of the area defined and surrounded by the main frame is at least as large as the length and width of the display housing, and the height of the main frame can be as large as, or smaller than, the height of the housing of the display  (e.g., the height of the display housing being the distance from the front side (e.g., the side having the display screen) to the back side (e.g., the side having the cable receptacle) of the display ). It is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the DRB  can be differently shaped or size from the display  and\/or the bezel . For example, if the display  is significantly smaller and\/or has a different shape than the bezel , the DRB  can be formed with an inside shape and size that can facilitate attachment of the DRB  to the display and retention of the display  therein, and further can have an outside shape and size that can facilitate connecting the DRB , with the display  therein, to the bezel  with the desired (e.g., correct) alignment in relation to the bezel .","In an aspect, the DRB  can include a plurality of display retention components (DRCs), such as DRC  and DRC , which can be formed on the inside surface of the DRB , and can be pin-like in structure extending outward from the inner surface of the DRB . The shape and size of the DRCs, such as DRCs  and , can correspond to the shape and size of the holes, such as holes  and  of the display , or at least can have a shape and size that enables the DRCs (e.g., , ) to be inserted or slid into the corresponding holes (e.g., , ) in the housing of the display . The number of DRCs formed on an inner side of the DRB  typically can correspond to the number of holes on the corresponding side of the housing of the display . The DRCs, such as DRCs  and , can be respectively located to correspond to the respective holes, such as holes  and , of the display . In one embodiment, the DRCs can be made of the same material as the main frame of the DRB , although it is to be appreciated and understood that, in accordance with other embodiments, the DRCs can be constructed of a different material than the main frame of the DRB  (e.g., the DRCs can be metal retention pins inserted or embedded into the main frame of the DRB , wherein the main frame can be constructed of a plastic material). It is to be appreciated and understood that  and certain other figures (e.g., ) described herein depict the DRB as having two DRCs and the display housing as having two holes in its side, however,  and the certain other figures are only depicting portions of the DRB and display. For instance, in accordance with the disclosed subject matter, a display can have two holes on a left side of the display housing and two holes on the right side of the display housing, and the DRB can have two DRCs on a left inner surface of the DRB main frame and two DRCs on a right inner surface of the DRB main frame. For instance, in accordance with various aspects, the DRB  can comprise a main frame that can be configured to have a rectangular or substantially rectangular shape and a size that can enable a portion of the housing of a display  to be inserted into a space defined and surrounded by the main frame, wherein the portion of the housing of the display can have a defined size. The DRB can further include a plurality of DRCs (e.g., , ) that can be formed on an inner surface of the main frame in locations that correspond to locations of a plurality of holes in the housing of the display , wherein the plurality of DRCs are configured to be slidable into the plurality of holes to retain the display  in the horizontal direction, without using screws, to horizontally mount the display  when the display  and the DRB  are inserted into a housing of a bezel  that does not support horizontal mounting.","In another aspect, the DRB  can be placed or snapped onto the display , wherein the respective DRCs, such as DRCs  and , can be placed, slid, or inserted into the corresponding holes, such as  and , wherein the DRCs can retain the display  in the horizontal direction without having to use fasteners (e.g., screws, such as M2 or other micro screws). The DRB  can be a semi-rigid structure such that the DRB  can be flexible enough to be bend to attach the DRB  to the display , wherein the DRB  can have a tight fit around the housing of the display , yet can be rigid enough so that the DRCs (e.g.,  and ) can retain the display  when the DRCs are inserted in the holes of the housing of the display  and rigid enough that the display  will not be removed from being within and attached to the DRB  unless a specified amount of force is applied to the DRB  or conversely the display .","In one embodiment, a cable (not shown in ) can be connected to the display  prior to the attachment of the DRB  to the display  to facilitate using the DRB  to retain the cable (e.g., cable connector of the cable) and\/or maintain the cable connection with the display  (e.g., maintain the cable connector in the cable receptacle of the display even when the cable connector is subjected to a predefined amount of pull-out force), as more fully disclosed herein. However, in accordance with other embodiments, as desired, the cable can be connected to the display  after the DRB  is attached to the display , or the display  can use wireless communication and\/or wireless power (e.g., internal power source, external power source that transfers power wirelessly to the display ) to thereby make a cable connection unnecessary.","As stated, the bezel  is structured to have the display  attached in the vertical direction. To facilitate securing and retaining the display  in the bezel , in still another aspect, the DRB  can comprise a plurality (e.g., 4, or less or more than 4) of alignment pins, such as pins  and , that can be formed on the DRB  in respective recessed areas, such as recessed areas  and , and can be formed to extend a specified length vertically from the base of the respective recessed areas (e.g., , ) of the DRB . In an aspect, the alignment pins (e.g., , ) can be inserted into corresponding holes (e.g., a plurality of holes or recesses), such as holes  and , formed in the bezel , and wherein the pins (e.g., , ) can precisely align the display  in the x and y directions. The holes (e.g., , ) of the bezel  can be further recessed than other portions of the inside of the bezel  to accommodate placement of the DRB , with the display , within the bezel , and placement of the extended vertical pins (e.g., , ) inside the holes (e.g., , ). The alignment pins (e.g., , ) can facilitate aligning and holding the DRB  and display  in the bezel , as desired.","In yet another aspect, the system  can include an adapter plate  that can be placed against the DRB  and fastened to the bezel  using a plurality of fasteners (e.g., screws), such as fasteners  and , that can be inserted through a corresponding plurality of holes, such as holes  and , formed in the adapter plate , and into a corresponding plurality of holes (e.g., screw holes), such as holes  and , that can be formed in the bezel , to facilitate securing the display  and DRB  in the bezel .","The DRB  can thereby retain the display  in the horizontal direction without using fasteners, while the DRB  also can facilitate alignment of the display  in the x and y directions and retention of the display  in the vertical direction via the alignment pins, wherein the adapter plate  can be used to fasten and secure the DRB , with the display , within the bezel . Other aspects of a DRB are further disclosed herein in relation to the other figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200"]},"In one aspect, the DRB  can include DRC  comprising a plurality of DRCs  that can be used to retain a display in a horizontal direction to horizontally mount the display without having to use fasteners, as more fully disclosed herein. The number of DRCs  employed typically can correspond to the number of holes contained in the display.","In another aspect, the DRB  also can include a cable retention component  that can enable a cable, comprising a cable connector associated with one or more cable wires, to withstand at least a specified amount of pull-out force to maintain connection of the cable to the display. Typically the cable wires, with a cable connector on the end of the cable wires, can be connected to the corresponding cable receptacle (e.g., receptacle, socket, or connector of the display in which the cable connector of the cable wires is plugged) on the back side of the display prior to attaching the DRB  to the display. In an aspect, the cable retention component  can be a pin or tab, which can be formed on the DRB  to protrude vertically downward from the main frame of the DRB  such that, when the DRB  is attached to the display, the cable retention component  can be located behind at least a portion of the back side of the cable connector that connects the cable wires to the cable receptacle of the display, wherein the front side of the cable connector connects to the corresponding cable receptacle of the display, and wherein the cable retention component  can be placed against at least a portion of the back side of the cable connector to resist movement or disconnection of the cable connector from the corresponding receptacle of the display, even when the cable connector is subjected to a predefined amount of pull-out force, such as a pull-out force based at least in part on an industrial standard. In an aspect, the cable retention component  can provide sufficient resistance to resist movement or disconnection of the cable connector from the corresponding receptacle when the cable connector is subjected to at least a specified amount of force (e.g., pull-out force) in the direction of pulling out of the cable connector from the corresponding cable receptacle. For example, to comply with specified industrial standards or regulations, during a pull-out test, the cable retention component  can provide at least a predefined amount of resistance to resist movement or disconnection of the cable connector from the corresponding receptacle when the cable connector is subjected to at least a specified amount of force (e.g., 15 Newtons (N)) in the direction of pulling out of the cable connector from the corresponding cable receptacle.","In still another aspect, the DRB  can include a cable guide component  that can be employed to maintain one or more cable wires of the cable in a desired position in relation to other components when the cable is connected to the display. The cable guide component  can be formed on a portion (e.g., cross member) of the DRB  in or near the region where the cable is connected to the display. The cable guide component  can be in the form of one or more channels or tracks formed between adjacent ridges or ribs formed on the DRB  to facilitate creating the one or more channels or tracks. When the DRB  is attached to the display, the one or more cable wires can be inserted in, routed via, and\/or secured within, the one or more channels in the cable guide component  to maintain the one or more cable wires in a desired position in relation to other components associated with the display. As a result, the cable wires can be adequately prevented from moving from the one or more channels towards other components, such as high voltage components or other sensitive components, wherein, without the cable guide component , the cable wires potentially could move such that the cable wires could come close to contacting or could come in contact with the high voltage components or other sensitive components, which could cause harm to the cable wires, the display, and\/or sensitive components.","In yet another aspect, the DRB  can contain an alignment component  that can comprise a specified number of alignment pins (e.g., polymer-based pins), which can be utilized to precisely align the DRB  and associated display with a bezel housing when the DRB  and display are placed in or on the bezel. For instance, the alignment pins of the alignment component  can be formed on the DRB  in respective positions that can correspond to respective holes in the bezel, wherein the respective alignment pins can be inserted in the respective holes to place the DRB  and display within the bezel with the desired alignment in relation to the bezel. The alignment pins can facilitate vertically mounting the DRB , with the display attached thereto, to the bezel, which only supports vertical mounting, while the DRB  also can retain the display in the horizontal direction to horizontally mount the display (since the display supports horizontal mounting but not vertical mounting), as more fully disclosed herein.","In accordance with still another aspect, the DRB  can comprise an orientation component  that can include a specified number (e.g., 2) of non-symmetrical tabs that can be employed to ensure the display is oriented correctly within the bezel. The specified number of non-symmetrical tabs (e.g., polymer-based non-symmetrical tabs) of the orientation component  can extend from one or more outer sides of the DRB , wherein the non-symmetrical tabs can, for example, restrict the placement of the DRB  and associated display in the bezel by an assembly system or an assembler such that the orientation of the DRB  and associated display within the bezel results in the proper display of information when the display is powered on (e.g., display will have a right-side-up orientation so that the information is presented with the desired right-side-up orientation to a user). That is, the non-symmetry of the non-symmetrical tabs can prevent the insertion of the DRB  into the bezel opening if the DRB  and associated display are oriented incorrectly (e.g., oriented 180 degrees off from the desired orientation (e.g., oriented upside down)), and\/or make it obvious when the DRB  and associated display are oriented incorrectly, in relation to the bezel.","In yet another aspect, the DRB  can comprise an offset column component  that can include a plurality of offset columns, which can desirably offset loads on the display when an adapter plate is applied onto the DRB  and display, and fastened to the bezel to secure the display, while also enabling the fastening of the adapter plate to the bezel to desirably secure the display within the bezel housing. The offset columns can extend vertically upward from the main frame of the DRB  and away from the bezel toward the adapter plate, wherein the plurality of offset columns can facilitate providing a desired amount of clamping force to the display and a dust gasket associated with the display. In an embodiment, the offset columns can be located at or near each corner (e.g., of the 4 corners) of the main frame of the DRB , although, in accordance with other embodiments, the offset columns can be placed at other locations along the main frame. That is, the offset columns can facilitate applying a desired amount of clamping or compression force (via transferring force from the fastening of the adapter plate) to the display and dust gasket of the display to maintain the display and dust gasket in a desired amount of compression to facilitate desired (e.g., optimal) performance of the display and dust gasket.","In another aspect, the offset columns can be offset by a specified amount from their corresponding supports on the bottom of the DRB  to act or function as a compliant member for the bezel.
