One such equation that can be used to transform data is the Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov (\u201cWSK\u201d) sampling theorem. The theorem describes two processes in signal processing, a sampling process in which a continuous time signal is converted into a discrete time signal, and a reconstruction process in which the original continuous time signal is recovered from the discrete signal. Reconstruction of the original continuous time signal is an interpolation process that mathematically defines a continuous-time signal from the discrete samples and times between the sample instants. During the interpolation process, unknown data values are approximated from surrounding known data values.","The WSK sampling theorem corresponds to Nyquist sampled data. The WSK sampling theorem provides a method for reconstructing a continuous time band-limited function from a discrete set of data points. The WSK sampling theorem assumes constant intervals between the data points. In other words, the theorem assumes a uniform data signal. Such a theorem is disadvantageous, however, when there is a need to reconstruct a non-uniform data signal. A need exists to overcome this deficiency.","According to various embodiments, a method for interpolating non-uniformly sampled data is provided. The interpolated data can be used to improve the original data. The method can comprise providing an optical system comprising a signal processor. The method can comprise collecting data generated by the optical system, wherein the data comprises non-uniformly sampled data. The method can comprise performing an interpolation operation on the non-uniformly sampled data using the signal processor, to generate interpolated data. Further, the method can comprise adjusting the data with the interpolated data using the signal processor, to generate improved data. The improved data can be output to a user, for example, by displaying the improved data on a display unit, by printing the improved data, by adjusting an image based on the improved data, or a combination thereof. According to various embodiments, the data can comprise any desired data, for example, image data. The method can comprise improving the image data. For example, the method can comprise improving the image resolution, the image brightness, the image contrast, and\/or the image focus.","According to various embodiments, the interpolation operation can transform the data from one domain to another. For example, the data can be transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain or from the frequency domain to the spatial domain. In some embodiments, the interpolation operation can comprise transforming the non-uniformly sampled data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain by applying the function",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"2","mi":"Q"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"}},{"mo":"+","mi":"\u221e"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["x","n"]}}},{"mi":"c","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"2","mi":"Q"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"sin","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"}},{"mo":"+","mi":"\u221e"}]}}},"br":{},"sub":"n "},"In some embodiments, the interpolation operation can comprise transforming the non-uniformly sampled data from the frequency domain to the spatial domain by applying the function",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"F","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"v"}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"2","msub":{"mi":["Q","v"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"}},{"mo":"+","mi":"\u221e"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"F","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["v","n"]}}},{"mi":"c","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"2","msub":{"mi":["Q","v"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mi":"v","mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","v"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"sin","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":"v "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u221e"}},{"mo":"+","mi":"\u221e"}]}}},"br":{},"sub":"n"},"According to various embodiments, the present teachings provide an optical system that can be configured to perform the method of the present teachings.

The result can be derived using a convolution theorem in combination with various mathematical computing software, for example, the comb(x) and rect(x) functions of MATLAB\u00ae, available from Mathworks Inc., Natick, Mass. The sampling theorem can be used to sample optical fields as described in J. W. Goodman, Introduction to Fourier Optics, 2ed. (McGraw Hill, New York, N.Y., 1996), pp. 23-26, and D. A. Aronstein, \u201cWhittacker-Shannon Interpolation of Electric Fields and Point-Spread Functions,\u201d private communication (Apr. 6, 2007), both of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.","As is known in the art, the WSK sampling theorem assumes a continuous uniformly sampled data signal. Because of this, the WSK sampling theorem is not ideal for use with a non-uniformly sampled data signal. Described herein is a derivation of the sampling theorem that emphasizes two assumptions of the theorem explicitly. This derivation achieves a preferred method for interpolating non-uniformly sampled data signals. The theorem can be expressed in terms of two fundamental length scales that are derived from these assumptions. The result can be more general than what is usually reported and contains the WSK form as a special case corresponding to Nyquist sampled data. In some embodiments, the preferred basis set for interpolation can be found by varying the frequency component of the basis functions in an optimal way. This observation can give a generalization of the WSK result to situations where the data-sampling interval is non-uniform, for example, as is described J. L. Yen, \u201cOn nonuniform sampling of band limited signals,\u201d IRE Trans. Circ. Theory CT-3, 251-257 (1956), which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","According to various embodiments, a method for interpolating non-uniformly sampled data is provided. The interpolated data can be used to improve original data. The method can comprise providing an optical system comprising a signal processor. The method can comprise collecting data generated by the optical system, wherein the data comprises non-uniformly sampled data.

The improved data can be output to a user, for example, by displaying the improved data on a display unit, by printing the improved data, by adjusting an image based on the improved data, by a combination thereof, or the like. According to various embodiments, the data can comprise any desired data, for example, image data. The method can comprise improving the image data. For example, the method can comprise improving the image resolution, the image brightness, the image contrast, and\/or the image focus.","According to various embodiments, the interpolation operation can transform the data from one domain to another. For example, the data can be transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain or from the frequency domain to the spatial domain.

The conditions A, B, and C can be:\n\n","According to various embodiments, the band-limited functions shown in condition (A) and condition (B) can imply two fundamental length scales x=1\/vand \u0394x=1\/v where x=n\u0394x are the data sample points. These length scales, or equivalently their associated frequency intervals, can be kept independent and play a fundamental role in the derivation of the sampling theorem. According to various embodiments, condition (C) does not hold for periodic functions, for example, sin(x). To overcome this, the generalized Fourier transform for functions of \u201cslow growth\u201d can be used. Discussion on the generalized Fourier transform can be found in H. P. Hsu, Applied Fourier Analysis, (Harcourt Brace, New York, N.Y., 1984), pp. 98, 104, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Parseval's theorem can be used to construct the Fourier transform for functions not satisfying condition (C).","According to various embodiments,  illustrates the band-limited condition (A) and condition (B) in the frequency domain. In , the Fourier transform of a band-limited sampled function is represented by periodic extension of the sampling interval. Alternatively, the \u2212vordinate of  can be shifted to the origin as in . This version of the band-limited sampled function further illustrates the construction of condition (B), by periodic extension over the sampling frequency v.","Derivation of the Sampling Theorem","As shown in , condition (B) allows the Fourier transform to be constructed as a periodic function by periodic extension of the sampling frequency. Condition (B) does not have to be taken as a fundamental property of the sampled Fourier transform, but can be enforced by construction, for example,

subsidiary side-lobes at the base of the sin c(\u03b1u), can improve interpolation results. To further elaborate, consider an example where Q=4, and for convenience, what is produced is:\n\n4=2=1\u215b=8\n\nThe WSK result corresponds to \u03b1=1 and the two terms of this example (terms n=20, n+1=21, and N=41) are plotted on a graph and shown in , where it seen that the zeros of the sin c(\u03b1u) basis functions correspond to the data sampling interval, \u0394x. This means that when shifting the neighboring basis functions over by one data unit to the next, the side-lobe maxima of the n-th basis function corresponds approximately to the side-lobe minima of the (n+1)-th basis function. Therefore, aside from the interpolated value of \u0192(x) at about (n+\u00bd)\u0394x, the remaining contribution to the sum of the two basis functions approximately cancels because the side-lobes are out of phase. The sum of the two basis functions can be, for example, as shown in  where the rapid decay of the side-lobes is apparent.\n","According to various embodiments, by contrast to the WSK result with \u03b1=1, the WSK(Q) result has \u03b1=\u00bd when Q=4. In this case, the zeros of the sin c(\u03b1u) functions are located 2k apart for k given when","\u03c0\u03b1u(n)=\u03c0ku(n)=k\/\u03b1; for k=1, 2, 3, . . . therefore, the sin c(\u03b1u) zeros go through every other data point. As a result, when shifting the basis function over by one data unit in the interpolation sum, the basis function side-lobes can be approximately \u201cin phase\u201d and little cancellation can occur in the sum. The situation is illustrated in  along with the sum of the two basic functions. As a result, the WSK(Q) result can provide a more efficient method of interpolating the non-uniformly sampled data. The WSK(Q) result can be optimal in cases where the data sampling interval is non-constant, and an optimal superposition of the various neighboring basis function can be achieved by varying the \u03b1 coefficient in a way that minimizes the subsidiary side-lobes.","According to various embodiments, optimally out of phase describes choices of \u03b1 that minimize ringing in the subsidiary side-lobes because in such cases a better overall interpolation result is obtained.
