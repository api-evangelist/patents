title: System and method for dynamic coordination of timelines having common inspectable elements
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for dynamic coordination of inspectable elements across timelines. In one arrangement, timelines are processed to identify common chronological events. Such events can be associated and rendered across the timelines. In another arrangement, selectable elements are rendered in relation to a timeline. The selection of such selectable elements highlights one or more of the associated inspectable elements. In another arrangement, a selection is received at the first timeline, and, in response, events are highlighted at the second timeline and inspectable elements are rendered at the second timeline pertaining to the selection. In another arrangement, metadata associated with a received selection is processed against a database to provide a second timeline, and the second timeline is populated with one or more additional elements that are chronologically proximal to the particular element in the first timeline to thereby provide a dynamic association between the first and second timelines.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This patent application relates generally to the field of dynamic coordination of inspectable elements that are displayable on a screen, and, in particular, to dynamic coordination of inspectable elements across one or more timelines.","Various social networking sites such as Facebook\u2122 enable a user to interact with other users and\/or share media and updates with one another. While such tools are useful to build and maintain socially-focused connections, these sites generally lack a sense of chronology and\/or time. That is, no such mechanism exists whereby a user can view another user's elements (e.g., media such as images and\/or video) and\/or events (e.g., media that correspond to a particular event), and further search for and\/or identify such events from a chronological perspective.","Moreover, considering the prevalence of digital media (such as digital photos and video) in everyday life, it is inevitable that substantial amounts of such media is generated on a regular basis such that would be\u2014in theory\u2014of interest to a particular user. For example, if a user attends a party or event, there is a significant likelihood that that user appears in photos or video taken by various of the attendees at the party\/event. However, unless such a user actually knows the individual(s) who took the picture\/video (e.g., is \u201cfriends\u201d with that user\u2014using a Facebook\u2122 term), it is unlikely that the user will actually see the picture\/video that he\/she is featured in.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","Technologies are presented herein in support of a system and method for dynamic depiction and coordination of one or more inspectable elements across one or more timelines. According to a first aspect, a computer implemented method for dynamic association of elements in a first timeline with a second timeline at a central machine is provided, the central machine having a processor, a memory, and a coordination application stored in the memory and executable by the processor, and each of the first timeline and the second timeline having one or more inspectable elements that correspond to one or more chronological events. The method includes receiving a selection of a particular element in the first timeline into the memory of the central machine through interaction with a user interface on a computing device, processing at least a one metadata associated with the received selection against a database; providing to the computing device for display thereat at least a second timeline based on the result of the processing, the second timeline being associated with an entity or person identified in the at least one metadata of the particular element of the first timeline, and populating the second timeline with one or more additional elements from the database, at least a portion of which has a chronological proximity to the particular element in the first timeline to thereby provide a dynamic association between the first and second timelines.","According to another aspect, a computer implemented method for dynamic chronological coordination of a first timeline and a second timeline at a central machine is provided, the central machine having a processor, a memory, and a coordination application stored in the memory and executable by the processor, and each of the first timeline and the second timeline having one or more inspectable elements that correspond to one or more chronological events. The method includes receiving a selection of at least one of the one or more inspectable elements, and the one or more chronological events of the second timeline, processing the first timeline against at least a second timeline based on the selection to identify one or more common chronological events shared across the first timeline and the second timeline, generating an association of the common chronological events within the context of the first timeline and the second timeline, and rendering one or more graphical features that reflect the association.","According to another aspect, a computer implemented method for dynamic depiction of inspectable elements across a timeline at a central machine is provided, the central machine having a processor, a memory, and a coordination application stored in the memory and executable by the processor, and the timeline having one or more inspectable elements. The method includes depicting at least a section of the timeline, rendering one or more selectable elements in relation to the section, the selectable elements representing at least one of (a) one or more users and (b) one or more events that are related to the section, receiving a selection of at least one of the selectable elements, and, in response to the selection, highlighting one or more of the inspectable elements within the section that relate to the selection.","According to yet another aspect, a computer implemented method for dynamic depiction of inspectable elements shared by a first timeline and at least a second timeline at a central machine is provided, the central machine having a processor, a memory, and a coordination application stored in the memory and executable by the processor, and each of the inspectable elements corresponding to one or more chronological events. The method includes receiving a selection of at least one of (a) the one or more inspectable elements, and (b) the one or more chronological events at the first timeline, in response to the selection, highlighting at least one of (a) the one or more inspectable elements, and (b) the one or more chronological events, at the at least second timeline, and rendering one or more inspectable elements at the at least second timeline that pertain to at least one of (a) the one or more selected inspectable elements, and (b) the one or more selected chronological events.","These and other aspects, features, and advantages can be appreciated from the accompanying description of certain embodiments of the invention and the accompanying drawing figures.","By way of overview and introduction, various systems and methods are described herein that enable the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination of one or more inspectable elements across one or more timelines. It can be appreciated that many types of media elements, such as photographs and videos, and particularly those that focus on people and\/or events (such as parties, weddings, gatherings, etc.) are frequently potentially of interest to a large number of people and, at minimum are of interest to those people who participated in and\/or were associated with such people and\/or events to which such media elements correspond. However, despite contemporary advances in technology, such media elements are generally only accessible to and\/or viewed by a small fraction of the potential total audience for such media, such as a group of users that are linked to one another through a social networking site. In fact, in many instances individuals who may have interest in a particular photo or video (such as one taken at a party they attended) are not even aware of its existence.","In an effort to expand the potential audience of such media to as many users as may be interested in a particular media element, a timeline scheme can be implemented whereby such media elements are depicted on a display of a computer or other processor-based device in chronological order across such a timeline (in prior art approaches, such elements are generally organized in arbitrary, user-defined ways, such as grouping media elements by topic, e.g., \u2018friends,\u2019 and \u2018vacations\u2019). Such timelines\u2014each of which preferably corresponds to a particular individual or entity\u2014are advantageous in that they organize media elements in an absolute, universal manner\u2014that is, chronologically\u2014allowing for seamless and intuitive comparisons, associations, and transfers of various media between multiple timelines. Furthermore, the organization and depiction of such media elements across a chronological timeline enables further functionalities and operations that cannot be effectively employed using other organizational approaches. As will be described in greater detail herein, using such timelines and displayable, inspectable elements, users can further view and discover various media elements that are of interest to them in ways that are more efficient and effective than those previously available.","In particular, the systems and methods disclosed herein incorporate various software modules that, upon execution in a processor, encompass a discovery tool that enables a user to discover connections with other users independent of a preexisting relationship between them. In one arrangement disclosed herein, this is achieved by revealing to a first user certain coincidental points in the first user's timeline in relation to a timeline of a second user. Various intersecting and\/or closely proximate elements and\/or events can also be revealed, even if no relationship presently exists between the two (or more) users, as will be described in greater detail below. Accordingly, through interaction with the various timelines referenced herein, the discovery tool enables a user to discover media elements, events, and connections that might not have been previously discoverable through existing applications.","The following detailed description is directed to systems and methods for dynamic depiction, association, and coordination of one or more inspectable elements across one or more timelines. The referenced systems and methods are now described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which one or more illustrated embodiments and\/or arrangements of the systems and methods are shown. The systems and methods are not limited in any way to the illustrated embodiments and\/or arrangements as the illustrated embodiments and\/or arrangements described below are merely exemplary of the systems and methods, which can be embodied in various forms, as appreciated by one skilled in the art. Therefore, it is to be understood that any structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting the systems and methods, but rather are provided as a representative embodiment and\/or arrangement for teaching one skilled in the art one or more ways to implement the systems and methods. Accordingly, aspects of the present systems and methods can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.), or an embodiment combining software and hardware. One of skill in the art can appreciate that a software process can be transformed into an equivalent hardware structure, and a hardware structure can itself be transformed into an equivalent software process. Thus, the selection of a hardware implementation versus a software implementation is one of design choice and left to the implementer. Furthermore, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting, but rather are to provide an understandable description of the systems and methods.","An exemplary computer system is shown as a block diagram in  which is a high-level diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system . In one arrangement, central machine  can be a personal computer or server. In other arrangements, central machine  can be a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a mobile device\/smartphone, though it should be understood that central machine  of dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  can be practically any computing device capable of embodying the systems and\/or methods described herein.","Central machine  of dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  includes a control circuit  which is operatively connected to various hardware and software components that serve to enable operation of the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system . The control circuit  is operatively connected to a processor  and a memory . Processor  serves to execute instructions for software that can be loaded into memory . Processor  can be a number of processors, a multi-processor core, or some other type of processor, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor  can be implemented using a number of heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor  can be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Preferably, memory  and\/or storage  are accessible by processor , thereby enabling processor  to receive and execute instructions stored on memory  and\/or on storage . Memory  can be, for example, a random access memory (RAM) or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile computer readable storage medium. In addition, memory  can be fixed or removable. Storage  can take various forms, depending on the particular implementation. For example, storage  can contain one or more components or devices such as a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. Storage  also can be fixed or removable.","One or more software modules  are encoded in storage  and\/or in memory . The software modules  can comprise one or more software programs or applications having computer program code or a set of instructions executed in processor . Such computer program code or instructions for carrying out operations for aspects of the systems and methods disclosed herein can be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++, Python, and JavaScript or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code can execute entirely on central machine , partly on central machine , as a stand-alone software package, partly on central machine  and partly on a remote computer\/device, or entirely on the remote computer\/device or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer can be connected to central machine  through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection can be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","One or more software modules , including program code\/instructions, are located in a functional form on one or more computer readable storage devices (such as memory  and\/or storage ) that can be selectively removable. The software modules  can be loaded onto or transferred to central machine  for execution by processor . It can also be said that the program code of software modules  and one or more computer readable storage devices (such as memory  and\/or storage ) form a computer program product that can be manufactured and\/or distributed in accordance with the present invention, as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","It should be understood that in some illustrative embodiments, one or more of software modules  can be downloaded over a network to storage  from another device or system via communication interface  for use within dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system . For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage device in a server can be downloaded over a network from the server to dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system .","Preferably, included among the software modules  is a coordination application  that is executed by processor . During execution of the software modules , and specifically the coordination application , the processor  configures the control circuit  to dynamically coordinate and depict various elements with central machine , as will be described in greater detail below. It should be understood that while software modules  and\/or coordination application  can be embodied in any number of computer executable formats, preferably software modules  and\/or coordination application  comprise one or more applications that are configured to be executed at central machine  in conjunction with one or more applications or \u2018apps\u2019 executing at remote devices, such as computing device(s) A-N (collectively computing devices ) and\/or one or more viewers such as internet browsers and\/or proprietary applications. Furthermore, in certain arrangements, software modules  and\/or coordination application  can be configured to execute at the request or selection of a user of one of computing devices  (or any other such user having the ability to execute a program in relation to central machine , such as a network administrator), while in other arrangements central machine  can be configured to automatically execute software modules  and\/or coordination application , without requiring an affirmative request to execute. It should also be noted that while  depicts memory  oriented on control circuit , in an alternate arrangement, memory  can be operatively connected to the control circuit . In addition, it should be noted that other information and\/or data relevant to the operation of the present systems and methods (such as databases  and\/or ) can also be stored on storage , as will be discussed in greater detail below.","A communication interface  is also operatively connected to control circuit . Communication interface  can be any interface that enables communication between the central machine  and external devices, machines and\/or elements. Preferably, communication interface  includes, but is not limited to, a modem, a Network Interface Card (NIC), an integrated network interface, a radio frequency transmitter\/receiver (e.g., Bluetooth, cellular, NFC), a satellite communication transmitter\/receiver, an infrared port, a USB connection, and\/or any other such interfaces for connecting central machine  to other computing devices and\/or communication networks such as the Internet. Such connections can include a wired connection or a wireless connection (e.g. using the 802.11 standard) though it should be understood that communication interface  can be practically any interface that enables communication to\/from the control circuit .","At various points during the operation of dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system , central machine  can communicate with one or more computing devices A-N (collectively computing devices ). The computing devices  transmit and\/or receive data to\/from the central machine , thereby preferably initiating maintaining, and\/or enhancing the operation of the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system , as will be described in greater detail below. It should be understood that computing devices  can be in direct communication with central machine , indirect communication with central machine , and\/or can be communicatively coordinated with central machine , as will be described in greater detail below. While computing device  can be practically any device capable of communication with central machine , in the preferred embodiment computing device  is a personal computer, server, handheld\/portable computer, smartphone, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer, and\/or any other such computing device that is capable of transmitting and\/or receiving data to\/from central machine . It should also be appreciated that in many arrangements, computing device  will be substantially identical, from a structural and functional perspective, to central machine .","It should be noted that while the  depicts the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  with respect to computing devices A, B, C, and N, it should be understood that any number of computing devices can interact with the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  in the manner described herein. It should be further understood that a substantial number of the operations described herein are initiated by and\/or performed in relation to such computing devices . For example, as referenced above, such computing devices  can execute applications and\/or viewers which request and\/or receive data from central machine , substantially in the manner described in detail herein.","In certain arrangements, one or more external databases and\/or servers  are also in communication with central machine . As will be described in greater detail below, database\/server  is preferably a computing and\/or storage device, and\/or a plurality of computing and\/or storage devices, that contain(s) information, such as timelines  and\/or inspectable elements  that can be relevant to the dynamic coordinating, associating, and\/or depiction by central machine . Such external databases\/servers  are in addition to the internal or local database  of central machine . It should be understood that databases  and  can, in many cases, contain similar, complimentary, and\/or identical information. The primary distinction between database  and database  is that database  is local to central machine  (thus not requiring additional communication to access) while database  is external and thus requires communication between central machine  and database\/server  in order to access the data stored therein. By way of illustration, database\/server  can be an external website such as Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, or Picasa, which contains one or more inspectable elements , tags, and\/or comments that can be accessed, such as through an application programming interface (API), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and thus incorporated into the various methods and systems described herein, as will be described in greater detail below. It should be noted that, as described in detail below, dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  can be configured such that various items (such as inspectable elements ) can be stored at one location (such as at database ), while various other related items can be stored at a second location (such as at database ), as will be described in greater detail below.","At this juncture it should be noted that in certain arrangements, such as the one depicted in , computing devices  and\/or database\/server  can be in periodic or ongoing communication with central machine  thorough a computer network such as the Internet . Though not shown, it should be understood that in certain other arrangements, computing devices  and\/or database\/server  can be in periodic or ongoing direct communication with central machine , such as through communications interface .","In the description that follows, certain embodiments and\/or arrangements are described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations that are performed by one or more devices, such as the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  of . As such, it will be understood that such acts and operations, which are at times referred to as being computer-executed, include the manipulation by the processor of the computer of electrical signals representing data in a structured form. This manipulation transforms the data and\/or maintains them at locations in the memory system of the computer, which reconfigures and\/or otherwise alters the operation of the computer in a manner understood by those skilled in the art. The data structures in which data are maintained are physical locations of the memory that have particular properties defined by the format of the data. However, while an embodiment is being described in the foregoing context, it is not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments can be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments can be implemented in a system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system . Other components shown in  can be varied from the illustrative examples shown. The different embodiments can be implemented using any hardware device or system capable of running program code. In another illustrative example, dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  can take the form of a hardware unit that has circuits that are manufactured or configured for a particular use. This type of hardware can perform operations without needing program code to be loaded into a memory from a computer readable storage device to be configured to perform the operations.","For example, central machine  can take the form of a circuit system, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable logic device, or some other suitable type of hardware configured to perform a number of operations. With a programmable logic device, the device is configured to perform the number of operations. The device can be reconfigured at a later time or can be permanently configured to perform the number of operations. Examples of programmable logic devices include, for example, a programmable logic array, programmable array logic, a field programmable logic array, a field programmable gate array, and other suitable hardware devices. With this type of implementation, software modules  can be omitted because the processes for the different embodiments are implemented in a hardware unit.","In still another illustrative example, central machine  can be implemented using a combination of processors found in computers and hardware units. Processor  can have a number of hardware units and a number of processors that are configured to execute software modules . In this example, some of the processors can be implemented in the number of hardware units, while other processors can be implemented in the number of processors.","In another example, a bus system can be implemented and can be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input\/output bus. Of course, the bus system can be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, communications interface  can include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter.","Embodiments and\/or arrangements can be described in a general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.","It should be further understood that while the various computing devices and machines referenced herein, including but not limited to central machine , computing devices A-N, and database\/server  are referred to herein as individual\/single devices and\/or machines, in certain arrangements the referenced devices and machines, and their associated and\/or accompanying operations, features, and\/or functionalities can be arranged or otherwise employed across any number of devices and\/or machines, such as over a network connection, as is known to those of skill in the art.","Turning now to , a high-level diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of an inspectable element  is depicted in accordance with at least one embodiment disclosed herein. As noted above, inspectable element  is preferably a media and\/or data file, including but not limited to images\/pictures, videos, music files, text files, and\/or calendar entries that includes at least one data component that is displayable on the display screen associated with a computing device . Various metadata  are preferably embedded within and\/or otherwise associated or linked with inspectable element . For example, one or more tags A-N (collectively tags ) can preferably be embedded and\/or associated with a particular inspectable element . Such tags  can reflect an association between a certain individual\/entity and a particular inspectable element . For example, such tags  can preferably correspond to one or more individuals and\/or entities that are reflected by and\/or otherwise associated with the particular inspectable element . Thus, a single inspectable element  can, in certain arrangements, have multiple tags , such as in the case of a group photo. As will be described in greater detail below, the various tags  can originate from and\/or be generated in any number of ways. In one arrangement, one or more users can ascribe various tags  to a particular inspectable element , while in other arrangements one or more known processing methods can be applied, such as facial recognition algorithms, which can process one or more images in order to identify one or more individuals within the image(s), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Metadata including tags can be displayable, or not. It should also be noted that in certain arrangements the tags  can be configured to track, link to, and\/or otherwise comply with one or more pre-existing identification schemes, e.g., a Facebook profile (and\/or any other such user account). That is, tags  are preferably not simply identifiers (such as a name) that are ascribed to an inspectable element  by a user, but rather reflect existing accounts that have already been established. In doing so, the present dynamic depiction, coordination, and association system  can further build on and enhance user accounts and profiles that already exist.","At this juncture, it should be noted that metadata  encompasses not only tags , but also various other metadata items. For example, metadata  preferably includes information regarding the time, date, and\/or location that are associated with a particular inspectable element . Such metadata  are preferably embedded with inspectable element  at the time the inspectable element  (e.g., the picture or video) is captured, as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, thought it should be understood that such metadata can be obtained and\/or edited after capture.","It should be appreciated that while  depicts both inspectable element  and metadata  as being stored at database  and\/or  (that is, inspectable element  and metadata  are stored at the same location), in other arrangements metadata  and inspectable element  can be stored in separate locations. As depicted in , in one such exemplary arrangement, metadata  can be stored at database , while inspectable element  (e.g., one or more images) is stored at database server . A pointer  connects and\/or links metadata  to the inspectable element  to which it corresponds, as is known to those of skill in the art. Such an arrangement can be advantageous in a scenario where a large number of inspectable elements  have already been stored at a particular location, such as part of a social networking profile (e.g., at database\/server ). Rather than copying and\/or transferring such inspectable elements  to database , using pointer , metadata  can be associated\/linked (such as through an API, as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art) with its respective inspectable element(s)  without the need to actually store the inspectable element  and the metadata  at the same physical location. It should be understood that this arrangement is merely exemplary, and other such arrangements are also possible within the scope of the systems and methods described herein.","The operation of the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  and the various elements and components described above will be further appreciated with reference to various methods for dynamic coordination, association and\/or depiction as described below, in conjunction with .","Turning now to , a flow diagram is described showing a routine  that illustrates a broad aspect of a method for dynamic association of elements in a first timeline with a second timeline at a central machine  in accordance with at least one embodiment disclosed herein. It should be appreciated that several of the logical operations described herein are implemented (1) as a sequence of computer implemented acts and\/or program modules running on dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  and\/or (2) as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  (). The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the requirements of the device (e.g., size, energy, consumption, performance, etc.). Accordingly, the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as operations, structural devices, acts, or modules. Several of these operations, structural devices, acts and modules can be implemented in software, in firmware, in special purpose digital logic, and any combination thereof. It should also be appreciated that more or fewer operations can be performed than shown in the figures and described herein. These operations can also be performed in a different order than those described herein.","Various of the operations depicted in  and described in detail herein will be appreciated with reference to  which depicts an exemplary timeline  according to at least one arrangement disclosed herein. As can be appreciated with reference to , timeline  is preferably a horizontal line representing a particular time span (e.g., a year, month, week, etc.) which can be zoomed into and\/or out of by a user, thereby adjusting the viewable time span of the timeline, using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It should be understood that although timeline  is depicted as being a horizontal timeline, it other arrangements various other timelines and\/or schemes are possible, such as a vertical timeline. Based on the particular viewable time span selected by a user, the timeline  is preferably divided into various segments or sections , such as months, weeks, days, hours, etc. Furthermore, such segments or sections  can be further sub-divided in substantially the same manner. It should be understood that the viewable span of timeline  is preferably not fixed, but rather can be zoomed into and\/or out of in order to select the viewing of a narrower or wider date\/time range, as described herein.","Along timeline  are preferably one or more inspectable elements . As noted above, such inspectable elements  can correspond to practically any media and\/or data file, including but not limited to images, videos, music files, text files, and\/or calendar entries. One or more inspectable elements  can, in turn, correspond to and\/or comprise one or more events . Events  can thus be understood, in part, as collections of one or more inspectable elements , such as a collection of inspectable elements  (e.g., photos and\/or videos) having a common origin or theme, such as that they originate at a particular event such as a birthday party of a certain user, a particular wedding, or a particular concert. Preferably, in certain arrangements, events  are generated in whole and\/or in part based on the metadata  that is stored and\/or associated with the respective inspectable elements . For example, several inspectable elements , such as several images, that have several common metadata  items (e.g., several common users tagged in the images, at a similar location and\/or date) can be identified as an event . Alternatively, in certain arrangements such a grouping can be proposed to a user prior to grouping the various inspectable elements  together as an event . Additionally, in certain arrangements one or more users can define an event manually by selecting the various inspectable elements  that correspond to the particular event. In any event, as shown in , such events  (and the inspectable elements  that preferably comprise them) can be depicted chronologically along timeline . Thus, as one moves along timeline  (preferably from left to right), the various inspectable elements , and the events  that they make up, are displayed.","Returning now to , the process  begins at step  where processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , receives a selection of at least one of the one or more inspectable elements , and\/or the one or more chronological events  on a first timeline . Preferably, such a selection is received into memory  of central machine  based on and\/or in response to an interaction of a user with a user interface on a computing device  (such as through an application or \u2018app\u2019 executing at computing device , as referenced above), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Then, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , processes at least one metadata  associated with the received selection against one or more database(s) , . That is, as noted above, the various inspectable elements  and\/or events  preferably have and\/or are associated with one or more metadata items , such as tags  (corresponding to one or more individuals) and\/or time\/date\/location information. Accordingly, such metadata  can be processed against a database ,  containing other metadata and\/or inspectable elements. In doing so, one or more entities, individuals, inspectable elements and\/or events can be identified that match and\/or relate to one or more of the metadata items  associated with the selection received at step . For example, in one scenario a user can select a particular inspectable element  such as a picture of several individuals taken at a party. The picture is preferably associated with one or more tags , each of which preferably correspond to a particular individual in the picture. Accordingly, each of the various tags  can be processed against database ,  in order to identify one or more additional elements  that are also associated with the same tag  (that is, are associated with at least one of the same individuals present in the selected inspectable element ). It should also be understood that multiple metadata items  can be processed simultaneously against database ,  in order to identify additional elements  of particular relevance. By way of further example, metadata items  corresponding to a particular time\/date and a particular location can be processed against database , . In doing so, additional elements  can be identified that share and\/or are closely associated with the same time\/date and location can be identified.","In addition, various tools and approaches can be employed in order to generate, ascribe, and\/or associate one or more metadata items  to one or more elements . By way of example, one or more image processing tools and\/or methods can be employed whereby an element (such as an image) can be processed to identify distinctive items (e.g., a landmark such as the Eiffel Tower) within the element, in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In doing so, metadata items  such as a location (e.g., Paris, France) can be generated and\/or ascribed to the related item(s). Similar approaches can be employed to identify the presence of various individuals in a given item, such as by using facial recognition technologies and\/or approaches, as is also known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Then, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , generates one or more additional timelines A-N. Such timelines A-N preferably correspond to one or more users and\/or events that are associated with the element(s)  and\/or events  that were selected at step . Thus, for example, where selected element  is an image from a party having one or more persons in the picture, and such users have been \u2018tagged\u2019 or designated as being in the photo (in a manner referenced above and known to those of ordinary skill in the art), that particular element  can be further associated with the timelines A-N of those tagged users. That is, upon tagging a particular user in a particular inspectable element , that inspectable element is preferably added to and\/or associated with that tagged user's timeline. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that a user's timeline can be generated and\/or grow simply by ascribing a tag  associated with a particular user's identity, even if that particular user has not contributed any inspectable elements to his\/her own timeline.","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , provides one or more of the additional timelines A-N for display at one or more computing device(s) . As noted above, each of the additional timelines A-N are preferably associated with at least one entity and\/or person identified by and\/or associated with at least one metadata  of the particular element  selected from timeline  at step , as described in detail above. This operation can be further appreciated with reference to , wherein upon a selection at least one of elements  and\/or events  from a timeline  (that is, when a particular user selects one or more of elements  and\/or events  using an application or viewer executing on computing device , which is in turn preferably in communication with central machine ), such as that depicted in , one or more parallel timelines A-N can be generated. As noted above, such timelines A-N preferably correspond to one or more users and\/or events that are associated with the selected element(s)  and\/or events .","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , populates at least one of the additional timelines A-N with one or more additional elements A-N, as depicted in . In doing so, such additional elements A-N can be retrieved from their respective database(s) , , as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, additional elements A-N are populated such that at least a portion of such elements A-N have a chronological proximity to the particular selected element  (selected at step ). As well, the additional timelines are displayed concurrently with the first timeline. In doing so, a dynamic association between first timeline  and one or more additional timelines A-N can be provided, in which the association is made through one or more inspectable elements. By way of illustration, upon selecting a particular element  at step , such as a picture in the timeline  of a particular user, a depiction of parallel timelines A-N of the users tagged in that particular inspectable element  can be generated (at step ) and provided (at step ), as depicted in  and described in detail above. Such timelines A-N are preferably depicted as being parallel to timeline , and further preferably encompass the same general time span as has been selected for timeline , as referenced above. Moreover, such timelines A-N further depict various additional inspectable elements A-N which are preferably associated, such as in time proximity, to the selected element  (as can be determined by various metadata items such as time\/date). Accordingly, it can be appreciated that by selecting a single element , a user can further view those inspectable elements A-N present on the timelines A-N of other users, such users being associated with the selected element . It can be further appreciated that the various elements A-N that populate such additional timelines A-N are preferably chronologically proximal to the element selected at step  (based on various metadata  pertaining to time\/date). As such, even if such additional elements A-N are not actually part of the same event  as the selected element , such additional elements A-N are discoverable by a user in at least the manner described in detail above. This functionality is particularly advantageous when considered in context of an event . Being that a particular user can attend an event such as a party, he\/she is likely interested in the various inspectable elements A-N that are present in the timelines A-N of other users who also attended the same event. Given the chronological arrangement of the timelines , it can be appreciated that it is likely that the various inspectable elements A-N that are in close chronological proximity to the selected inspectable element  will also be of interest to the selecting user, even if such inspectable elements A-N are not formally associated with the same event  (due to any number of factors, including human error or oversight).","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , permits interaction with one or more of the additional elements A-N, such as through an interaction of a user with a user interface on a computing device  (such as through an application or \u2018app\u2019 executing at computing device , as referenced above), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In doing so, one or more of the various steps of routine  can be repeated for such elements A-N, substantially in the manner described in detail above, thereby enabling a user to discover additional inspectable elements.","Moreover, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , can process the interaction (from step ) in order to identify at least one additional association between at least a second timeline A and the first timeline , substantially in the manner described below with respect to steps  and .","Then, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , renders a depiction of the additional association(s) in relation to at least the first timeline , substantially in the manner described below with respect to steps . In doing so, at least one additional element of the second timeline A can be dynamically associated with the first timeline  in a chronologically coordinated manner, as described in detail below.","Turning now to , a flow diagram is described showing a routine  that illustrates a broad aspect of a method for dynamic chronological coordination of a first timeline and a second timeline with a central machine  in accordance with at least one embodiment disclosed herein.","The process begins at step  where processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , receives a selection of at least one of the one or more inspectable elements A-N, and\/or the one or more chronological events A-N of at least a second timeline A. That is, upon receiving such a selection at central machine  (such as from an application or \u2018app\u2019 executing at computing device , as referenced above), wherein a user selects such an element A-N and\/or event A-N, a further interface can be generated, as referenced above and shown in , wherein at least two timelines, such as timelines  and A are rendered\/generated in parallel.","Upon receiving the selection of one or more inspectable elements  and\/or events  from a timeline, such as timeline A, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , generates at least one of a first timeline  and a second timeline A based on one or more inspectable elements  and\/or the events , substantially as described in detail above and depicted in one exemplary arrangement in .","Then, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , processes the first timeline  against at least a second timeline A. Alternatively, it can be appreciated that in certain arrangements second timeline A is processed against first timeline . In any event, such processing is preferably initiated by and\/or based on the selection referenced above, and such processing further serves to identify one or more common chronological events  shared across the first timeline  and the second timeline A. Such common chronological events  are preferably events that are common to both timelines , A, for example, a party or concert that each of the respective users of the timelines , A attended.","Upon identifying one or more common chronological events , at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , generates an association of the common chronological events  within the context of the first timeline  and the second timeline A, as shown in . For example, such an association can be depicted in a shared space , such as in a space situated between the timelines , A (such as that shown in ) which depicts such common chronological events  along the respective timelines , A.","Then, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , renders one or more graphical features that reflect the association. By way of example, one or more further common chronological events  (that is, events that are shared by both timelines  and A) can be plotted between the timelines , A, thus further connecting the users of the respective timelines based on events to which the users are mutually connected to and\/or associated with. That is, although common chronological event  was initially identified based on a user selection (as described above), further associations can be further identified based on this initial association. For example, having identified that the user of timeline  and the user of timeline A shared a common event  in the month of June, further common events , such as a wedding both users attended in September, can be further identified and\/or rendered, as described herein.","Moreover, in certain arrangements various sections and\/or segments  of the timelines , A can be highlighted (such as by increasing their size and\/or changing their color) according to a concentration of common chronological events , . In doing so, various graphical trends can be easily perceived, such as the frequency of such events and\/or the proximity of such events to one another (for example, friends who are college students can have frequent common chronological events during the academic year, but may not have as many during the summer break or other such vacation).","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , annotates at least one of (a) the one or more inspectable elements , and\/or (b) the one or more chronological events . In doing so, a particular element  (such as a photo) can be \u2018tagged\u2019 with the identities of one or more users that appear in and\/or are associated with the photo, as described in detail above and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In doing so, the photo is preferably further associated with the timelines of such users, such as in the manner described in detail above. Moreover, it can be appreciated that based on such ascribing, a timeline  can be generated, as also referenced above (such as in the case where a user is tagged in an element for the first time). Accordingly, it can be appreciated that in certain arrangements routine  can further proceed from step  back to step , where one or more timelines are initially generated, as described in detail above and shown in .","Turning now to , a flow diagram is described showing a routine  that illustrates an aspect of a method for dynamic depiction of inspectable elements  across a timeline  at a central machine  in accordance with at least one embodiment disclosed herein.","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , depicts at least a section  of the timeline , substantially in the manner described in detail above.","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , renders one or more selectable elements  (of ) in relation to the section . It should be understood that the selectable elements  preferably correspond to one or more users and\/or one or more events that are related to the section . For example, as depicted in , various users that appear throughout a timeline  (such as in inspectable elements  via tags ascribed to such elements, as referenced above) are depicted as balls or bubbles of varying sizes that are positioned above the section  of the timeline  that they are present within. For example, if a particular user is tagged frequently across various inspectable elements  found within a particular section , the selectable element  of that user will preferably be rendered larger and\/or more prominently than that of a user who appears relatively fewer times within the same section .","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , receives a selection of at least one of the selectable elements . That is, a user can select a particular one of the selectable elements , such as that corresponding to a particular user, as described above.","In response to the selection, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , highlights one or more of the inspectable elements , such as element A, preferably within the section , that relate to the selection . For example, if a particular user is selected, inspectable elements  (such as photos) that pertain to that selected user are highlighted, such as element A as shown in .","Conversely, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , obscures one or more of the inspectable elements , such as element B within the section  that do not relate to the selection (that is, that are not tagged and\/or associated with the particular selected user).","It should be further understood that in certain arrangements, timeline  can have one or more viewing modes. That is, timeline  can be configured such that certain of the inspectable elements  can be viewable in a first mode by certain users, but are not viewable in a second mode. By way of example, a user can configure timeline  to have public and private modes, such that certain of the inspectable elements are designated as private, and thus can only be seen by the user him\/herself on the timeline, while other inspectable elements  can be designated as public, and thus can be viewable by other users as well, substantially in the manner described in detail herein. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that an interface can be depicted wherein such public and private elements can be depicted on a single timeline , and can further be dragged from one section to another, in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art.  depicts such public and private elements across a timeline.","Turning now to , a flow diagram is described showing a routine  that illustrates an aspect of a method for dynamic depiction of inspectable elements shared by a first timeline and at least a second timeline at a central machine  in accordance with at least one embodiment disclosed herein.","At step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , receives at a first timeline  a selection of at least one of the one or more inspectable elements , and\/or the one or more chronological events , substantially in the manner described in detail above.","In response to the selection, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application  highlights at least one of the one or more inspectable elements , and\/or the one or more chronological events  at the at least second timeline A, such as that depicted in .","Then, at step , processor  executing one or more of software modules , including, preferably, coordination application , renders one or more inspectable elements  at the at least second timeline A such that the selected inspectable element  pertains to at least one of the one or more selected inspectable elements, and the one or more selected chronological events.","By way of example, it can be appreciated that, as described in detail above, various timelines , A can share one or more inspectable elements  (e.g., photographs, videos, etc.) and\/or events . Accordingly, upon selection of an inspectable element  and\/or an event  at a first timeline , a corresponding element \/event  can be highlighted at a second timeline A. That is, the same element\/event as selected in the first timeline \u2014which is shared by and thus also present in the second timeline A\u2014can be highlighted within the context of the second timeline A in response to the selection of that element\/event in the first timeline . Furthermore, various additional elements\/events that are associated with the selected shared element\/event can be rendered. In doing so, by selecting an element\/event from a first timeline , a user can view not only the same element\/event within the context of a second timeline A, but can also view additional elements\/events in second timeline A that pertain to the selected element\/event. Being that these further elements\/events pertain to the selected element\/event, it is likely that the selecting user has interest in them as well. However, being that such elements\/events are present in second timeline A, it is unlikely that the selecting user would learn of such further elements\/events without the functionality described herein.","At this juncture, it should be noted that although much of the foregoing description has been directed to systems and methods for dynamic depiction and coordination, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be similarly deployed and\/or implemented in scenarios, situations, and settings far beyond the referenced scenarios. It can be readily appreciated that dynamic depiction, association, and coordination system  can be effectively employed in practically any scenario where such dynamic depiction and coordination is of value.
