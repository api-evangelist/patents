{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to the following U.S. Provisional Patent Applications: Application No. 60\/558,527, filed on Apr. 1, 2004, Application No. 60\/558,909, filed on Apr. 2, 2004, Application No. 60\/559,766, filed on Apr. 6, 2004, Application No. 60\/561,768, filed on Apr. 12, 2004, Application No. 60\/564,846, filed on Apr. 23, 2004, Application No. 60\/564,688, filed on Apr. 23, 2004, and Application No. 60\/602,898, filed on Aug. 18, 2004.","The use of printed books and documents (hereafter referred to as simply \u201cdocuments\u201d) has been commonplace for many hundreds of years. Over the centuries, various tools and strategies have evolved to try to make more effective use of printed documents. These range from handwritten (or typed) notes on the contents of documents (either on the document itself or in a separate but related document), to highlighting passages in a document deemed to be of greater significance, to manually copying passages from a document (or using a scanning copier, despite the fact that copyrights are often so infringed), to the simple act of including a printed index at the end of a document to facilitate locating information on a specific topic. Many new tools and strategies are needed now that a document can be accessed in an electronic, searchable format such as a file on a local computer or a web page that can be accessed with a browser.","The relatively recent innovation of providing a searchable electronic copy of a document that can be accessed using a standard personal computer is quite powerful in increasing the ease with which the desired contents can be accessed and utilized. When a traditional index is provided in such a context, once an entry is found, a single click of the mouse can take the user directly to the desired entry in the electronic text. Once a relevant entry has been found, its location can be retained as a \u201cbookmark\u201d and filed according to the user's choice, making future access to the location in the electronic document quick and easy.","It is a problem that these very useful tools for working with electronic documents cannot be used with the vast existing reserve of printed books and documents. Even though there are tremendous advantages that accrue with access to an electronic version of a document, these are obviously only available when such an electronic version is available (and a computer is available to access the electronic document). Even in those instances where such an electronic version is available, this still does nothing to enhance the actual use of the paper document itself. Furthermore, when newer revisions and updated versions of either the paper or the electronic version of a document become available, the owner of a previous version generally has little recourse but to go and purchase a new, updated copy of the material.","As is well known in the art, by using traditional methods for document processing (such as, for example, a flatbed scanner combined with appropriate computer software for optical character recognition), a user can create an electronic version of a paper document. However, in addition to the fact that such a task is laborious, time-consuming, and generally error-prone, it usually involves infringement of the copyright held by the author of the textbook in question. Further, even when an electronic version of a document is thus created, it is still subject to the limitations mentioned above\u2014a computer is required to make any use of the additional features offered, and no additional utility is provided for the paper document itself. Despite the prevalence of computers, and despite the advantages conveyed by searchable electronic versions of documents, the continued widespread preference for creating and using paper documents is a clear indication of how attractive they remain to the average user. The portability, convenience, ease of viewing, and even the \u201cfeel\u201d of paper documents clearly retain a powerful appeal to most individuals.","Therefore, there exists a need to allow users to easily navigate between printed and electronic versions of documents. There also exists a need to allow users to easily access electronic document versions or links of a paper document or article.","Systems and methods for quickly and easily getting information about, or included in, a paper document into a public or private digital page are described. An example system includes a scanner that generates scan information of at least a portion of a paper document and a processing system in data communication with the scanner over a network. The processing system stores digital content corresponding to a plurality of paper documents into a database, receives the generated scan information from the scanner, searches the database to identify digital content associated with the received scan information, and sends at least one of a portion of the identified digital content or an address associated with the identified digital content to a network-accessible location being associated with the user, if results of that database search are positive. In one embodiment, the network-accessible location is a web log page associated with the user.","In another embodiment of the disclosed innovations, a blogger could scan some text from a paper document with a portable scanning device. The scanning device could either perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the scanned image or transmit either the raw image data or a partially processed version of the image data to a computer for remote OCR processing. The computer would submit at least a portion of the text to a search engine that would locate an electronic version of the paper document and return a hyperlink to the computer. The computer could then modify a predetermined blog page by adding an entry having at least a portion of the scanned text followed by a hyperlink to the electronic document. By optionally including a portion of the scanned text in the blog entry, the hyperlink can be put in context without requiring the blogger to type any explanatory text.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","125","108","110","112","160","165","110"]},"The computer  may include a memory containing computer executable instructions for processing an order request from scanning device  by obtaining an order. An example of an order could include an identifier (such as a serial number of the scanning device  or an identifier that uniquely identifies the user of the scanner), scanning context information and\/or scanned information that serves as the basis for a search of one or more document databases  to uniquely identify the digital document corresponding to the document  being scanned. The computer  also includes a processor and memory. In alternative embodiments, operating environment  may include more or less components.","In other embodiments, the system  includes a wireless device , a vendor server  and an aggregator server . The servers  and  are coupled to each other via various sorts of networks (e.g., the Internet  or wireless network ). Regardless of the manner by which the devices are coupled to each other, the scanning device , the computer , the wireless device , the account server , the document server , the vendor server  and the aggregator server  may be operable in accordance with well-known commercial transaction and communication protocols. In various embodiments, the functions and capabilities of the scanning device , the computer , and the wireless device  may be wholly or partially integrated into one device. Thus, the terms scanning device, computer and wireless device, could refer to the same device depending upon whether the device incorporates functions or capabilities corresponding to the roles of the scanning device , the computer  and the wireless device .","Additionally, in various embodiments, the computer  and the account server  may be wholly or partially integrated. Thus, the terms computer and account server, as used herein, for the purpose of this specification, including the claims, shall be interpreted with the meaning of an appropriately equipped device, operating in accordance with either a computer or an account server role.","In accordance with another embodiment, an operating environment  includes a document server  that has speech recognition capabilities. In this environment, no scanning device  is required, and in lieu of scanning a portion of a rendered document, the user reads aloud the portion of the document and the document server  performs speech recognition of the spoken text portion to generate the search query to be processed. For example, the user may place a telephone call from wireless device  directly to an access number for document server , and in response to automated prompts, reads aloud the portion of the rendered document. Because the ultimate task of the server is to identify a document within its database corresponding to the spoken text (that may be assumed to occur within the known corpus of text within the database), the task of correctly recognizing the spoken words is vastly easier than the task of correctly recognizing spoken text when no such information is available to constrain the search domain. This speech-recognition-based approach also has the advantage that it can be implemented using the currently available technology infrastructure, and does not require a user base of individuals who possess a scanning device . Thus, in the following disclosure, functions described as being performed by a scanner can alternatively be performed using a speech-recognition-based approach. The unique user identity associated with the scanner may equivalently be associated with, for example, a cellular phone used to call document server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","102","102","150","156","160","162","166","170","102","172","172","102","178"]},"As an example of one use of the scanner , a reader may scan some text from a newspaper article with scanner . The text is scanned as a bit-mapped image via scan port . The logic  causes the bit-mapped image to be stored in memory . The logic  may also perform optical character recognition (OCR) or other post-scan processing on the bit-mapped image to convert it to text or an intermediate form of processed image data. The scanner  may then upload the bit-mapped image (or text or processed image data, if post-scan processing has been performed by the logic ) to the computer  via the interface .","The scanner  further includes a velocity sensor  to sense velocity aspects of a scan action (e.g. how fast and in what direction a scan action occurs), an acceleration sensor  to detect acceleration aspects of a scan action, and a temperature sensor . Of course, not all scanner embodiments may include each of these features, and some embodiments may include additional features not found in the exemplary embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","202","102","204","102","202","110","206","110","112","130","210","200","212","110","102","106","118","102"]},"If there are results from the search, then the process  determines if the results are to go to one or more of a public or private location associated with the operator of the scanning device , see decision block . The results of the search, whether they be a link to a network-based location of the found results (e.g., a hyperlink) or an actual document (or portion thereof) identified in the search, are sent to a public location, at a block . The public location associated with the user can be in a number of different formats. A web log (blog) is one example of a public location that receives the results of the search. In one embodiment, the blog is automated to automatically post the results of the search in various formats. Blogs are described in more detail below. If the results of the search determined at the decision block  go to a private location, then a private location associated with the user receives the results of the search, see block . Whether the search results go to a public or private location associated with the user, various information of the search and the user may be recorded for later use, see block . The information recorded may be used, for example, to establish or modify a ranking within the document database  of any of the information or associated documents that were scanned and searched, and also to provide various demographic information with regard to the searcher (e.g., location, age, sex, etc.) and the items scanned by the searcher (which may be used by the document server  to create other useful databases).","A blog is an online journal (the contraction of \u201cweb log\u201d) or a website. A blog usually shows the following primary characteristics:","frequently updated with new content;","content unit is a \u201cpost\u201d or an \u201centry\u201d\u2014it may not necessarily be text but also pictures, sounds, videos, etc.;","posts are dated;","full posts or summaries are displayed on the blog home page with the last or freshest ones on top\u2014that posts are listed in reverse chronologic order makes it very easy to see if a blog has been updated recently, or appears to be stalled, it is therefore an incentive (along with dated posts) for authors to publish frequently in order to keep the content fresh; and","posts are accessible through a permanent link and\/or chronological archives (daily\/weekly\/monthly, or a linear previous\/next navigation).","A blog may show the following secondary characteristics, which are not necessarily distinctive of blogs but are instrumental in their adoption:","the publication process is supported by a microcontent or personal publishing system\u2014the emergence of those free or cheap systems which help people without knowledge of web technologies to easily publish content on the web has been the key factor in the spread of blogs outside the web-savvy, geek community;","a news feed is available for use with a news aggregator;","visitors may comment on posts, with or without registration, and their comments may appear publicly along with the post. At any time, a blog author may decide on a post-by-post basis if comments are allowed (most blogs allow comments while most web sites do not). Because most blogs allow comments, a blog may provide a newsfeed that includes visitor comments to improve interaction between publishers and their audience;","posts may be classified by categories;","each post may display a list of external links that point to it allowing readers to discover more sources around a particular topic\u2014techniques known as TrackBacks, Pingbacks and Referrer tracking allow for the automatic creation of such back links between two websites;","display a list of other blogs (blogolist) and websites of interest\u2014this is a great way to discover new blogs and also gives a better idea of who are the authors by seeing who they link to; and\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"112"},"In another embodiment, the article includes an icon  or other type of graphic image or text that when highlighted by the scanner  automatically sends any of the results of the search directly to the blog associated with the user. Of course, the control icon  does not necessarily have to be on the paper document that includes the article. The control icon  may be scanned from any document. For example, the user may carry a wallet-sized card with various control icons that the user may scan to cause the system  to perform certain actions. For example, the user may scan a control icon  which causes the text from the next scan to be submitted to a search engine and the search results automatically posted to a predetermined blog.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["320","322","322","300","162","102","320","326","320","320","326","326"]},"While the system has been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from its spirit and scope.
