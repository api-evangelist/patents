title: Initial power control for spread-spectrum communications
abstract: A code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) system employing spread-spectrum modulation. The CDMA system has a base station, and a plurality of subscriber units. The signals transmitted between the base station and subscriber unit use spread-spectrum modulation. The system and method transmits from the base station, a synchronization channel having a chip-sequence signal used by the plurality of subscriber units for synchronization. A first subscriber unit receives the synchronization channel, and determines timing from the synchronization channel. In order to initiate communications with the base station, the first subscriber unit transmits an access signal. The access signal has a plurality of power levels, which typically ramp up. The base station receives the access signal at a particular-power level. The base station then transmits to the first subscriber unit an acknowledgment signal. The first subscriber unit receives the acknowledgment signal, and transmits to the base station, a spread-spectrum signal.

More particularly, the present invention pertains to a system and method for providing a high capacity, CDMA communications system which provides for one or more simultaneous user bearer channels over a given radio frequency, allowing dynamic allocation of bearer channel rate while rejecting multipath interference.","Providing quality telecommunication services to user groups which are classified as remote, such as rural telephone systems and telephone systems in underdeveloped countries, has proven to be a challenge in recent years. These needs have been partially satisfied by wireless radio services, such as fixed or mobile frequency division multiplex (FDM) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, time division multiplex (TDM) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, combination frequency and time division (FD\/TDMA) systems, and other land mobile radio systems. Usually, these remote services are faced with more potential users than can be supported simultaneously by their frequency or spectral bandwidth capacity.","Recognizing these limitations, recent advances in wireless communications have used spread spectrum modulation techniques to provide simultaneous communication by multiple users. Spread spectrum modulation refers to modulating an information signal with a spreading code signal; the spreading code signal being generated by a code generator where the period Tc of the spreading code is substantially less than the period of the information data bit or symbol signal. The code may modulate the carrier frequency upon which the information has been sent, called frequency-hopped spreading, or may directly modulate the signal by multiplying the spreading code with the information data signal, called direct-sequence (DS) spreading. Spread-spectrum modulation produces a signal with bandwidth substantially greater than that required to transmit the information signal. Synchronous reception and despreading of the signal at the receiver recovers the original information. A synchronous demodulator in the receiver uses a reference signal to synchronize the despreading circuits to the input spread-spectrum modulated signal to recover the carrier and information signals. The reference signal can be a spreading code which is not modulated by an information signal. Such use of a synchronous spread-spectrum modulation and demodulation for wireless communication is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,056 entitled SYNCHRONOUS SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AND METHOD by Donald L. Schilling, which techniques are incorporated herein by reference.","Spread-spectrum modulation in wireless networks offers many advantages because multiple users may use the same frequency band with minimal interference to each user s receiver. Spread-spectrum modulation also reduces effects from other sources of interference. In addition, synchronous spread-spectrum modulation and demodulation techniques may be expanded by providing multiple message channels for a single user, each spread with a different spreading code, while still transmitting only a single reference signal to the user. Such use of multiple message channels modulated by a family of spreading codes synchronized to a pilot spreading code for wireless communication is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,951 entitled HIGH CAPACITY SPREAD-SPECTRUM CHANNEL by Donald L. Schilling, which is incorporated herein by reference.","One area in which spread-spectrum techniques are used is in the field of mobile cellular communications to provide personal communication services (PCS). Such systems desirably support large numbers of users, control Doppler shift and fade, and provide high speed digital data signals with low bit error rates. These systems employ a family of orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal spreading codes, with a pilot spreading code sequence synchronized to the family of codes. Each user is assigned one of the spreading codes as a spreading function. Related problems of such a system are: supporting a large number of users with the orthogonal codes, handling reduced power available to remote units, and handling multipath fading effects. Solutions to such problems include using phased-array antennas to generate multiple steerable beams and using very long orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal code sequences. These sequences may be reused by cyclic shifting of the code synchronized to a central reference and diversity combining of multipath signals. Such problems associated with spread spectrum communications, and methods to increase the capacity of a multiple access, spread-spectrum system are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307 entitled SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS by Gilhousen et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.","The problems associated with the prior art systems focus around reliable reception and synchronization of the receiver despreading circuits to the received signal. The presence of multipath fading introduces a particular problem with spread spectrum receivers in that a receiver must somehow track the multipath components to maintain code-phase lock of the receiver's despreading means with the input signal. Prior art receivers generally track only one or two of the multipath signals, but this method is not satisfactory because the combined group of low power multipath signal components may actually contain far more power than the one or two strongest multipath components. The prior art receivers track and combine the strongest components to maintain a predetermined bit error rate (BER) of the receiver. Such a receiver is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390 entitled DIVERSITY RECEIVER IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM by Gilhousen et al. A receiver that combines all multipath components, however, is able to maintain the desired BER with a signal power that is lower than that of prior art systems because more signal power is available to the receiver. Consequently, there is a need for a spread spectrum communication system employing a receiver that tracks substantially all of the multipath signal components, so that substantially all multipath signals may be combined in the receiver, and hence the required transmit power of the signal for a given BER may be reduced.","Another problem associated with multiple access, spread-spectrum communication systems is the need to reduce the total transmitted power of users in the system, since users may have limited available power. An associated problem requiring power control in spread-spectrum systems is related to the inherent characteristic of spread-spectrum systems that one users spread-spectrum signal is received by another user's receiver as noise with a certain power level. Consequently, users transmitting with high levels of signal power may interfere with other users'reception. Also, if a user moves relative to another user's geographic location, signal fading and distortion require that the users adjust their transmit power level to maintain a particular signal quality. At the same time, the system should keep the power that the base station receives from all users relatively constant. Finally, because it is possible for the spread-spectrum system to have more remote users than can be supported simultaneously, the power control system should also employ a capacity management method which rejects additional users when the maximum system power level is reached.","Prior spread-spectrum systems have employed a base station that measures a received signal and sends an adaptive power control (APC) signal to the remote users. Remote users include a transmitter with an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit which responds to the APC signal. In such systems the base station monitors the overall system power or the power received from each user, and sets the APC signal accordingly. Such a spread-spectrum power control system and method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,299,226 entitled ADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,840 entitled ADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM TRANSMITTER, both by Donald L. Schilling and incorporated herein by reference. This open loop system performance may be improved by including a measurement of the signal power received by the remote user from the base station, and transmitting an APC signal back to the base station to effectuate a closed loop power control method. Such closed loop power control is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,225 entitled HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE CLOSED LOOP AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL CIRCUIT to Charles E. Wheatley, III et al. and incorporated herein by reference.","These power control systems, however, exhibit several disadvantages. First, the base station must perform complex power control algorithms, increasing the amount of processing in the base station. Second, the system actually experiences several types of power variation: variation in the noise power caused by the variation in the number of users and variations in the received signal power of a particular bearer channel. These variations occur with different frequency, so simple power control algorithms can be optimized to compensate for only one of the two types of variation. Finally, these power algorithms tend to drive the overall system power to a relatively high level. Consequently, there is a need for a spread-spectrum power control method that rapidly responds to changes in bearer channel power levels, while simultaneously making adjustments to all users' transmit power in response to changes in the number of users. Also, there is a need for an improved spread-spectrum communication system employing a closed loop power control system which minimizes the system's overall power requirements while maintaining a sufficient BER at the individual remote receivers. In addition, such a system should control the initial transmit power level of a remote user and manage total system capacity.","Spread-spectrum communication systems desirably should support large numbers of users, each of which has at least one communication channel. In addition, such a system should provide multiple generic information channels to broadcast information to all users and to enable users to gain access to the system. Using prior art spread-spectrum systems this could only be accomplished by generating large numbers of spreading code sequences.","Further, spread-spectrum systems should use sequences that are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal to reduce the probability that a receiver locks to the wrong spreading code sequence or phase. The use of such orthogonal codes and the benefits arising therefrom are outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM, by Gilhousen et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,193,094 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING SUPER-ORTHOGONAL CONVOLUTIONAL CODES AND THE DECODING THEREOF, by Andrew J. Viterbi, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, generating such large families of code sequences with such properties is difficult. Also, generating large code families requires generating sequences which have a long period before repetition. Consequently, the time a receiver takes to achieve synchronization with such a long sequence is increased. Prior art spreading code generators often combine shorter sequences to make longer sequences, but such sequences may no longer be sufficiently orthogonal. Therefore, there is a need for an improved method for reliably generating large families of code sequences that exhibit nearly orthogonal characteristics and have a long period before repetition, but also include the benefit of a short code sequence that reduces the time to acquire and lock the receiver to the correct code phase. In addition, the code generation method should allow generation of codes with any period, since the spreading code period is often determined by parameters used such as data rate or frame size.","Another desirable characteristic of spreading code sequences is that the transition of the user data values occur at a transition of the code sequence values. Since data typically has a period which is divisible by 2, such a characteristic usually requires the code-sequence to be an even length of 2. However, code generators, as is well known in the art, generally use linear feedback shift registers which generate codes of length 2\u22121. Some generators include a method to augment the generated code sequence by inserting an additional code value, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,054 entitled POWER-OF-TWO LENGTH PSEUDONOISE SEQUENCE GENERATOR WITH FAST OFFSET ADJUSTMENT by Timothy Rueth et al. and incorporated herein by reference. Consequently, the spread-spectrum communication system should also generate spreading code sequences of even length.","Finally, the spread-spectrum communication system should be able to handle many different types of data, such as FAX, voiceband data and ISDN, in addition to traditional voice traffic. To increase the number of users supported, many systems employ encoding techniques such as ADPCM to achieve \u201ccompression\u201d of the digital telephone signal. FAX, ISDN and other data, however, require the channel to be a clear channel. Consequently, there is a need for a spread spectrum communication system that supports compression techniques that also dynamically modify the spread spectrum bearer channel between an encoded channel and a clear channel in response to the type of information contained in the user's signal.","The present invention is embodied in a multiple access, spread spectrum communication system which processes a plurality of information signals received simultaneously over telecommunication lines for simultaneous transmission over a radio frequency (RF) channel as a code-division-multiplexed (CDM) signal. The system includes a radio carrier station (RCS) which receives a call request signal that corresponds to a telecommunication line information signal, and a user identification signal that identifies a user to which the call request and information signal are addressed. The receiving apparatus is coupled to a plurality of code division multiple access (CDMA) modems, one of which provides a global pilot code signal and a plurality of message code signals, and each of the CDMA modems combines one of the plurality of information signals with its respective message code signal to provide a spread-spectrum processed signal. The plurality of message code signals of the plurality of CDMA modems are synchronized to the global pilot code signal. The system also includes assignment apparatus that is responsive to a channel assignment signal for coupling the respective information signals received on the telecommunication lines to indicated ones of the plurality of modems. The assignment apparatus is coupled to a time-slot exchange means. The system further includes a system channel controller coupled to a remote call-processor and to the time-slot exchange means. The system channel controller is responsive to the user identification signal, to provide the channel assignment signal. In the system, an RF transmitter is connected to all of the modems to combine the plurality of spread-spectrum processed message signals with the global pilot code signal to generate a CDM signal. The RF transmitter also modulates a carrier signal with the CDM signal and transmits the modulated carrier signal through an RF communication channel.","The transmitted CDM signal is received from the RF communication channel by a subscriber unit (SU) which processes and reconstructs the transmitted information signal assigned to the subscriber. The SU includes a receiving means for receiving and demodulating the CDM signal from the carrier. In addition, the SU comprises a subscriber unit controller and a CDMA modem which includes a processing means for acquiring the global pilot code and despreading the spread-spectrum processed signal to reconstruct the transmitted information signal.","The RCS and the SUs each contain CDMA modems for transmission and reception of telecommunication signals including information signals and connection control signals. The CDMA modem comprises a modem transmitter having: a code generator for providing an associated pilot code signal and for generating a plurality of message code signals; a spreading means for combining each of the information signals, with a respective one of the message code signals to generate spread-spectrum processed message signals; and a global pilot code generator which provides a global pilot code signal to which the message code signals are synchronized.","The CDMA modem also comprises a modem receiver having associated pilot code acquisition and tracking logic. The associated pilot code acquisition logic includes an associated pilot code generator; a group of associated pilot code correlators for correlating code-phase delayed versions of the associated pilot signal with a receive CDM signal for producing a despread associated pilot signal. The code phase of the associated pilot signal is changed responsive to an acquisition signal value until a detector indicates the presence of the despread associated pilot code signal by changing the acquisition signal value. The associated pilot code signal is synchronized to the global pilot signal. The associated pilot code tracking logic adjusts the associated pilot code signal in phase responsive to the acquisition signal so that the signal power level of the despread associated pilot code signal is maximized. Finally, the CDMA modem receiver includes a group of message signal acquisition circuits. Each message signal acquisition circuit includes a plurality of receive message signal correlators for correlating one of the local receive message code signals with the CDM signal to produce a respective despread receive message signal.","To generate large families of nearly mutually orthogonal codes used by the CDMA modems, the present invention includes a code sequence generator. The code sequences are assigned to a respective logical channel of the spread-spectrum communication system, which includes In-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) transmission over RF communication channels. One set of sequences is used as pilot sequences which are code sequences transmitted without modulation by a data signal. The code sequence generator circuit includes a long code sequence generator including a linear feedback shift register, a memory which provides a short, even code sequence, and a plurality of cyclic shift, feedforward sections which provide other members of the code family which exhibit minimal correlation with the code sequence applied to the feedforward circuit. The code sequence generator further includes a group of code sequence combiners for combining each phase shifted version of the long code sequence with the short, even code sequence to produce a group, or family, of nearly mutually orthogonal codes.","Further, the present invention includes several methods for efficient utilization of the spread-spectrum channels. First, the system includes a bearer channel modification system which comprises a group of message channels between a first transceiver and second transceiver. Each of the group of message channels supports a different information signal transmission rate. The first transceiver monitors a received information signal to determine the type of information signal that is received, and produces a coding signal relating to the coding signal. If a certain type of information signal is present, the first transceiver switches transmission from a first message channel to a second message channel to support the different transmission rate. The coding signal is transmitted by the first transceiver to the second transceiver, and the second transceiver switches to the second message channel to receive the information signal at a different transmission rate.","Another method to increase efficient utilization of the bearer message channels is the method of idle-code suppression used by the present invention. The spread-spectrum transceiver receives a digital data information signal including a predetermined flag pattern corresponding to an idle period. The method includes the steps of: 1) delaying and monitoring the digital data signal; 2) detecting the predetermined flag pattern; 3) suspending transmission of the digital data signal when the flag pattern is detected; and 4) transmitting the data signal as a spread-spectrum signal when the flag pattern is not detected.","The present invention includes a system and method for closed loop automatic power control (APC) for the RCS and SUs of the spread-spectrum communication system. The SUs transmit spread-spectrum signals, the RCS acquires the spread-spectrum signals, and the RCS detects the received power level of the spread-spectrum signals plus any interfering signal including noise. The APC system includes the RCS and a plurality of SUs, wherein the RCS transmits a plurality of forward channel information signals to the SUs as a plurality of forward channel spread-spectrum signals having a respective forward transmit power level, and each SU transmits to the base station at least one reverse spread-spectrum signal having a respective reverse transmit power level and at least one reverse channel spread-spectrum signal which includes a reverse channel information signal.","The APC includes an automatic forward power control (AFPC) system, and an automatic reverse power control (ARPC) system. The AFPC system operates by measuring, at the SU, a forward signal-to-noise ratio of the respective forward channel information signal, generating a respective forward channel error signal corresponding to a forward error between the respective forward signal-to-noise ratio and a pre-determined signal-to-noise value, and transmitting the respective forward channel error signal as part of a respective reverse channel information signal from the SU to the RCS. The RCS includes a plural number of AFPC receivers for receiving the reverse channel information signals and extracting the forward channel error signals from the respective reverse channel information signals. The RCU also adjusts the respective forward transmit power level of each one of the respective forward spread-spectrum signals responsive to the respective forward error signal.","The ARPC system operates by measuring, in the RCS, a reverse signal-to-noise ratio of each of the respective reverse channel information signals, generating a respective reverse channel error signal representing an error between the respective reverse channel signal-to-noise ratio and a respective pre-determined signal-to-noise value, and transmitting the respective reverse channel error signal as a part of a respective forward channel information signal to the SU. Each SU includes an ARPC receiver for receiving the forward channel information signal and extracting the respective reverse error signal from the forward channel information signal. The SU adjusts the reverse transmit power level of the respective reverse spread-spectrum signal responsive to the respective reverse error signal.","I. General System Description","The system of the present invention provides local-loop telephone service using radio links between one or more base stations and multiple remote subscriber units. In the exemplary embodiment, a radio link is described for a base station communicating with a fixed subscriber unit (FSU), but the system is equally applicable to systems including multiple base stations with radio links to both FSUs and mobile subscriber units (MSUs). Consequently, the remote subscriber units are referred to herein as subscriber units (SUs).","Referring to , base station (BS)  provides call connection to a local exchange (LE)  or any other telephone network switching interface, such as a private branch exchange (PBX) and includes a radio carrier station (RCS) . One or more RCSs , ,  connect to a radio distribution unit (RDU)  through links , , , , , and RDU  interfaces with LE  by transmitting and receiving call set-up, control, and information signals through telco links , , . SUs ,  communicate with the RCS  through radio links , , , , . Alternatively, another embodiment of the invention includes several SUs and a \u201cmaster\u201d SU with functionality similar to the RCS . Such an embodiment may or may not have connection to a local telephone network.","The radio links  to  operate within the frequency bands of the DCS 1800 standard (1.71-1.785 Ghz and 1.805-1.880 GHz); the US-PCS standard (1.85-1.99 Ghz); and the CEPT standard (2.0-2.7 GHz). Although these bands are used in described embodiment, the invention is equally applicable to the entire UHF to SHF bands, including bands from 2.7 GHz to 5 GHz. The transmit and receive bandwidths are multiples of 3.5 MHz starting at 7 MHz, and multiples of 5 MHz starting at 10 MHz, respectively. The described system includes bandwidths of 7, 10, 10.5, 14 and 15 MHz. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the minimum guard band between the uplink and downlink is 20 MHz, and is desirably at least three times the signal bandwidth. The duplex separation is between 50 to 175 MHz, with the described invention using 50, 75, 80, 95, and 175 MHz. Other frequencies may also be used.","Although the described embodiment uses different spread-spectrum bandwidths centered around a carrier for the transmit and receive spread-spectrum channels, the present method is readily extended to systems using multiple spread-spectrum bandwidths for the transmit channels and multiple spread-spectrum bandwidths for the receive channels. Alternatively, because spread-spectrum communication systems have the inherent feature that one user's transmission appears as noise to another user's despreading receiver, an embodiment may employ the same spread-spectrum channel for both the transmit and receive path channels. In other words, uplink and downlink transmissions can occupy the same frequency band. Furthermore, the present method may be readily extended to multiple CDMA frequency bands, each conveying a respectively different set of messages, uplink, downlink or uplink and downlink.","The spread binary symbol information is transmitted over the radio links  to  using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation with Nyquist Pulse Shaping in the present embodiment, although other modulation techniques may be used, including, but not limited to, offset QPSK (OQPSK), minimum shift keying (MSK). Gaussian phase shift keying (GPSK) and M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK)","The radio links  to  incorporate Broadband Code Division Multiple Access (B-CDMA\u2122) as the mode of transmission in both the uplink and downlink directions. CDMA (also known as spread spectrum) communication techniques used in multiple access systems are well-known, and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,056 entitled SYNCHRONOUS SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD by Donald T Schilling. The system described utilizes the direct sequence (DS) spreading technique. The CDMA modulator performs the spread-spectrum spreading code sequence generation, which can be a pseudonoise (PN) sequence; and complex DS modulation of the QPSK signals with spreading code sequences for the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) channels. Pilot signals are generated and transmitted with the modulated signals, and pilot signals of the present embodiment are spreading codes not modulated by data. The pilot signals are used for synchronization, carrier phase recovery and for estimating the impulse response of the radio channel. Each SU includes a single pilot generator and at least one CDMA modulator and demodulator, together known as a CDMA modem. Each RCS , ,  has a single pilot generator plus sufficient CDMA modulators and demodulators for all of the logical channels in use by all SUs.","The CDMA demodulator despreads the signal with appropriate processing to combat or exploit multipath propagation effects. Parameters concerning the received power level are used to generate the automatic power control (APC) information which, in turn, is transmitted to the other end of the communication link. The APC information is used to control transmit power of the automatic forward power control (AFPC) and automatic reverse power control (ARPC) links. In addition, each RCS ,  and  can perform maintenance power control (MPC), in a manner similar to APC, to adjust the initial transmit power of each SU , , ,  and . Demodulation is coherent where the pilot signal provides the phase reference.","The described radio links support multiple traffic channels with data rates of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 144 kbs. The physical channel to which a traffic channel is connected operates with a 64 k symbol\/sec rate. Other data rates may be supported, and forward error correction (FEC) coding can be employed. For the described embodiment, FEC with coding rate of \u00bd and constraint length 7 is used. Other rates and constraint lengths can be used consistent with the code generation techniques employed.","Diversity combining at the radio antennas of RCS ,  and  is not necessary because CDMA has inherent frequency diversity due to the spread bandwidth. Receivers include adaptive matched filters (AMFs) (not shown in ) which combine the multipath signals. In the present embodiment, the exemplary AMFs perform maximal ratio combining.","Referring to , RCS  interfaces to RDU  through links , , ,  with, for example, 1.544 Mb\/s DS1, 2.048 Mb\/s E1; or HDSL formats to receive and send digital data signals. While these are typical telephone company standardized interfaces, the present invention is not limited to these digital data formats only. The exemplary RCS line interface (not shown in ) translates the line coding (such as HDB3, B8ZS, AMI) and extracts or produces framing information, performs alarms and facility signaling functions, as well as channel specific loop-back and parity check functions. The interfaces for this description provide 64 kbs PCM encoded or 32 kbs ADPCM encoded telephone traffic channels or ISDN channels to the RCS for processing. Other ADPCM encoding techniques can be used consistent with the sequence generation techniques.","The system of the present invention also supports bearer rate modification between the RCS  and each SU , , ,  and  communicating with the RCS  in which a CDMA message channel supporting 64 kbs may be assigned to voiceband data or FAX when rates above 4.8 kbs are present. Such 64 kbs bearer channel is considered an unencoded channel. For ISDN, bearer rate modification may be done dynamically, based upon the D channel messages.","In , each SU , , ,  and  either includes or interfaces with a telephone unit , or interfaces with a local switch (PBX) . The input from the telephone unit may include voice, voiceband data and signaling. The SU translates the analog signals into digital sequences, and may also include a data terminal  or an ISDN interface . The SU can differentiate voice input, voiceband data or FAX and digital data. The SU encodes voice data with techniques such as ADPCM at 32 kbs or lower rates, and detects voiceband data or FAX with rates above 4.8 kbs to modify the traffic channel (bearer rate modification) for unencoded transmission. Also, A-law, u-law or no compounding of the signal may be performed before transmission. For digital data, data compression techniques, such as idle flag removal, may also be used to conserve capacity and minimize interference","The transmit power levels of the radio interface between RCS  and SUs , ,  and  are controlled using two different closed loop power control methods. The automatic forward power control (AFPC) method determines the downlink transmit power level, and the automatic reverse power control (ARPC) method determines the Uplink transmit power level. The logical control channel by which SU  and RCS , for example, transfer power control information operates at least a 16 kHz update rate. Other embodiments may use a faster or slower update rate, for example 64 kHz. These algorithms ensure that the transmit power of a user maintains an acceptable bit-error rate (BER), maintains the system power at a minimum to conserve power and maintains the power level of all SUs , , ,  and  received by RCS  at a nearly equal level.","In addition, the system uses an optional maintenance power control method during the inactive mode of a SU. When SU  is inactive or powered-down to conserve power, the unit occasionally activates to adjust its initial transmit power level setting in response to a maintenance power control signal from RCS . The maintenance power signal is determined by the RCS  by measuring the received power level of SU  and present system power level and, from this, calculates the necessary initial transmit power. The method shortens the channel acquisition time of SU  to begin a communication. The method also prevents the transmit power level of SU  from becoming too high and interfering with other channels during the initial transmission before the closed loop power control reduces the transmit power.","RCS  obtains synchronization of its clock from an interface line such as, but not limited to, E1, T1, or HDSL interfaces. RCS  can also generate its own internal clock signal from an oscillator which may be regulated by a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. RCS  generates a global pilot code, a channel with a spreading code but no data modulation, which can be acquired by remote SUs  through . All transmission channels of the RCS are synchronized to the pilot channel, and spreading code phases of code generators (not shown) used for logical communication channels within RCS  are also synchronized to the pilot channel's spreading code phase. Similarly, SUs  through  which receive the global pilot code of RCS  synchronize the spreading and de-spreading code phases of the code generators (not shown) of the SUs to the global pilot code.","RCS , SU  and RDU  may incorporate system redundancy of system elements and automatic switching between internal functional system elements upon a failure event to prevent loss or drop-out of a radio link, power supply, traffic channel or group of traffic channels.","II. Logical Communication Channels","A \u2018channel\u2019 of the prior art is usually regarded as a communications path which is part of an interface and which can be distinguished from other paths of that interface without regard to its content. However, in the case of CDMA, separate communications paths are distinguished only by their content. The term \u2018logical channel\u2019 is used to distinguish the separate data streams, which are logically equivalent to channels in the conventional sense. All logical channels and sub-channels of the present invention are mapped to a common 64 kilo-symbols per second (ksym\/s) QPSK stream. Some channels are synchronized to associated pilot codes which are generated from, and perform a similar function to the system global pilot code (GPC). The system pilot signals are not, however, considered logical channels.","Several logical communication channels are used over the RF communication link between the RCS and SU. Each logical communication channel either has a fixed, pre-determined spreading code or a dynamically assigned spreading code. For both pre-determined and assigned codes, the code phase is synchronized with the pilot code. Logical communication channels are divided into two groups: the global channel (GC) group includes channels which are either transmitted from the base station RCS to all remote SUs or from any SU to the RCS of the base station regardless of the SU's identity. The channels in the GC group may contain information of a given type for all users including those channels used by SUs to gain system access. Channels in the assigned channels (AC) group are those channels dedicated to communication between the RCS and a particular SU.","The global channels (GC) group provides for 1) broadcast control logical channels, which provide point-to-multipoint services for broadcasting messages to all SUs and paging messages to SUs; and 2) access control logical channels which provide point-to-point services on global channels for SUs to access the system and obtain assigned channels. The RCS of the present invention has multiple access control logical channels, and one broadcast control group. An SU of the present invention has at least one access control channel and at least one broadcast control logical channel.","The global logical channels controlled by the RCS are the fast broadcast channel (FBCH) which broadcasts fast changing information concerning which services and which access channels are currently available, and the slow broadcast channel (SBCH) which broadcasts slow changing system information and paging messages. The access channel (AXCH) is used by the SUs to access an RCS and gain access to assigned channels. Each AXCH is paired with a control channel (CTCH). The CTCH is used by the RCS to acknowledge and reply to access attempts by SUs. The long access pilot (LAXPT) is transmitted synchronously with AXCH to provide the RCS with a time and phase reference. An assigned channel (AC) group contains the logical channels that control a single telecommunication connection between the RCS and a SU. The functions developed when an AC group is formed include a pair of power control logical message channels for each of the uplink and downlink connections, and depending on the type of connection, one or more pairs of traffic channels. The bearer control function performs the required forward error control, bearer rate modification, and encryption functions.","Each SU , , ,  and  has at least one AC group formed when a telecommunication connection exists, and each RCS ,  and  has multiple AC groups formed, one for each connection in progress. An AC group of logical channels is created for a connection upon successful establishment of the connection. The AC group includes encryption, FEC coding and multiplexing on transmission, and FEC decoding, decryption and demultiplexing on reception.","Each AC group provides a set of connection oriented point-to-point services and operates in both directions between a specific RCS, for example, RCS  and a specific SU, for example, SU . An AC group formed for a connection can control more than one bearer over the RF communication channel associated with a single connection. Multiple bearers are used to carry distributed data such as, but not limited to, ISDN. An AC group can provide for the duplication of traffic channels to facilitate switch over to 64 kbs PCM for high speed facsimile and modem services for the bearer rate modification function.","The assigned logical channels formed upon a successful call connection and included in the AC group are a dedicated signaling channel [order wire (OW)], an APC channel, and one or more traffic channels (TRCH) which are bearers of 8, 16, 32, or 64 kbs depending on the service supported. For voice traffic, moderate rate coded speech, ADPCM or PCM can be supported on the traffic channels. For ISDN service types, two 64 kbs TRCHs form the B channels and a 16 kbs TRCH forms the D channel. Alternatively, the APC subchannel may either be separately modulated on its own CDMA channel, or may be time division multiplexed with a traffic channel or OW channel.","Each SU , , ,  and  of the present invention supports up to three simultaneous traffic channels.

The spreading code is a sequence of symbols, called chips or chip values. The general methods of generating pseudorandom sequences using Galois Field mathematics is known to those skilled in the art; however, a unique set or family of code sequences has been derived for the present invention. First, the length of the LFSR to generate a code sequence is chosen, and the initial value of the register is called a \u201cseed\u201d. Second, the constraint is imposed that no code sequence generated by a code seed may be a cyclic shift of another code sequence generated by the same code seed. Finally, no code sequence generated from one seed may be a cyclic shift of a code sequence generated by another seed. It has been determined that the spreading code length of chip values of the present invention is:\n\n128\u00d7233,415=29,877,120\u2003\u2003Equation (1)\n\nThe spreading codes are generated by combining a linear sequence of period 233415 and a nonlinear sequence of period 128.\n","The FBCH channel of the exemplary embodiment is an exception because it is not coded with the 128 length sequence, so the FBCH channel spreading code has period 233415.","The nonlinear sequence of length  is implemented as a fixed sequence loaded into a shift register with a feed-back connection. The fixed sequence can be generated by an m-sequence of length  padded with an extra logic 0, 1, or random value as is well known in the art.","The linear sequence of length L=233415 is generated using an LFSR circuit with 36 stages. The feedback connections correspond to a irreducible polynomial h(n) of degree . The polynomial h(x) chosen for the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is\n\n()=+1\n\nor, in binary notation\n\n()=(1100001010110010110111101101100011101)\u2003\u2003Equation (2)\n","A group of \u201cseed\u201d values for a LFSR representing the polynomial h(x) of Equation (2) which generates code sequences that are nearly orthogonal with each other is determined. The first requirement of the seed values is that the seed values do not generate two code sequences which are simply cyclic shifts of each other.","The seeds are represented as elements of GF(2) which is the field of residue classes modulo h(x). This field has a primitive element \u03b4=x+x+1. The binary representation of \u03b4 is:\n\n\u03b4=000000000000000000000000000000000111\u2003\u2003Equation (3)\n","Every element of GF(2) can also be written as a power of \u03b4 reduced modulo h(x). Consequently, the seeds are represented as powers of \u03b4, the primitive element.","The solution for the order of an element does not require a search of all values; the order of an element divides the order of the field (GF(2)). When \u03b4 is any element of GF(2) with\n\n\u22611\u2003\u2003Equation (4)\n\nfor some e, then e|2\u22121. Therefore, the order of any element in GF(2) divides 2\u22121. Using these constraints, it has been determined that a numerical search generates a group of seed values, n, which are powers of \u03b4, the primitive element of h(x).\n","The present invention includes a method to increase the number of available seeds for use in a CDMA communication system by recognizing that certain cyclic shifts of the previously determined code sequences may be used simultaneously. The round trip delay for the cell sizes and bandwidths of the present invention are less than 3000 chips. In one embodiment of the present invention, sufficiently separated cyclic shifts of a sequence can be used within the same cell without causing ambiguity for a receiver attempting to determine the code sequence. This method enlarges the set of sequences available for use. By implementing the tests previously described, a total of 3879 primary seeds were determined through numerical computation. These seeds are given mathematically as:\n\n\u03b4modulo h(x)\u2003\u2003Equation (5)\n\nwhere 3879 values of n, with \u03b4=(00, . . . 00111) as in (3), is a series incrementing by 1, starting at 1 and continuing to 1101, resuming at 2204 and continuing to 3305, resuming at 4408 and continuing to 5509, and resuming at 6612 and ending at 7184.\n","When all primary seeds are known, all secondary seeds of the present invention are derived from the primary seeds by shifting them multiples of 4095 chips modulo h(x). Once a family of seed values is determined, these values are stored in memory and assigned to logical channels as necessary. Once assigned, the initial seed value is simply loaded into LFSR to produce the required spreading code associated with the seed value.","V. Rapid Acquisition Feature of Long and Short Codes.","Rapid acquisition of the correct code phase by a spread-spectrum receiver is improved by designing spreading codes which are faster to detect. It should be noted that spreading code, code sequence, spreading code sequence, chip code, chip sequence or chip code sequence may be used interchangeably to refer to a moduling signal used to modulate an information signal whereby the period of the modulation signal is substantially less than the period of the information signal. For simplicity, the term spreading code will be used. The present embodiment of the invention includes a new method of generating spreading codes that have rapid acquisition properties by using one or more of the following methods. First, a long code may be constructed from two or more short codes. The new implementation uses many spreading codes, one or more of which are rapid acquisition sequences of length L that have average acquisition phase searches r=log2L. Sequences with such properties are well known to those practiced in the art. The average number of acquisition test phases of the resulting long sequence is a multiple of r=log2L rather than half of the number of phases of the long sequence.","Second, a method of transmitting complex valued spreading codes (in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) sequences) in a pilot spreading code signal may be used rather than transmitting real valued sequences. Two or more separate spreading codes may be transmitted over the complex channels. If the codes have different phases, an acquisition may be done by acquisition circuits in parallel over the different spreading codes when the relative phase shift between the two or more code channels is known. For example, for two spreading codes, one can be sent on an in phase (I) channel and one on the quadrature (Q) channel. To search the spreading codes, the acquisition detection means searches the two channels, but begins the Q channel with an offset equal to one-half of the spreading code length. With code length of N, the acquisition means starts the search at N\/2 on the Q channel. The average number of tests to find acquisition is N\/2 for a single code search, but searching the I and phase delayed Q channel in parallel reduces the average number of tests to N\/4. The codes sent on each channel could be the same code, the same code with one channel's code phase delayed or different spreading codes.","VI. Epoch and Sub-epoch Structures","The long complex spreading codes used for the exemplary system of the present invention have a number of chips after which the code repeats. The repetition period of the spreading code is called an epoch. To map the logical channels to CDMA spreading codes, the present invention uses an epoch and sub-epoch structure. The code period for the CDMA spreading code to modulate logical channels is 29877120 chips\/code period, which is the same number of chips for all bandwidths. The code period is the epoch of the present invention, and Table 3 below defines the epoch duration for the supported chip rates. In addition, two sub-epochs are defined over the spreading code epoch and are 233415 chips and 128 chips long.","The 233415 chip sub-epoch is referred to as a long sub-epoch, and is used for synchronizing events on the RF communication interface such as encryption key switching and changing from global to assigned codes. The 128 chip short epoch is defined for use as an additional timing reference. The highest symbol rate used with a single CDMA code is 64 ksym\/s.

Global codes are CDMA codes that can be received or transmitted by all users of the system. Assigned codes are CDMA codes that are allocated for a particular connection. When a set of spreading codes are generated from the same generator as described, only the seed of the 36 stage LFSR is specified to generate a family of spreading codes. Spreading codes for all of the global codes are generated using the same LFSR circuit. Therefore, once an SU has synchronized to the global pilot signal from an RCS and knows the seed for the LFSR circuit for the global channel codes, it can generate not only the pilot spreading code but also all other global codes used by the RCS.","The signal that is upconverted to RF is generated as follows. The output signals of the above shift register circuits are converted to an antipodal sequence (0 maps into +1, 1 maps into \u22121). The logical channels are initially converted to QPSK signals, which are mapped as constellation points as is well known in the art. The in-phase and quadrature channels of each QPSK signal form the real and imaginary parts of the complex data value. Similarly, two spreading codes are used to form complex spreading chip values. The complex data are spread by being multiplied by the complex spreading code. Similarly, the received complex data is correlated with the conjugate of the complex spreading code to recover despread data.","VIII. Short Codes","Short codes are used for the initial ramp-up process when a SU accesses an RCS. The period of the short codes is equal to the symbol duration and the start of each period is aligned with a symbol boundary. Both SU and RCS derive the real and imaginary parts of the short codes from the last eight feed-forward sections of the code generator producing the global codes for that cell.","The short codes that are in use in the exemplary embodiment of the invention are updated every 3 ms. Other update times that are consistent with the symbol rate may be used. Therefore, a change-over occurs every 3 ms starting from the epoch boundary. At a change-over, the next symbol length portion of the corresponding feed-forward output becomes the short code. When the SU needs to use a particular short code, it waits until the first 3 ms boundary of the next epoch and stores the next symbol length portion output from the corresponding FF section. This shall be used as the short code until the next change-over, which occurs 3 ms later.","The signals represented by these short codes are known as short access channel pilots (SAXPTs).","IX.

The reverse link pilot associated with a particular connection is called the assigned pilot (ASPT). In addition, there are pilot signals associated with access channels. These are called the long access channel pilots (LAXPTs). Short access channel pilots (SAXPTs) are also associated with the access channels and used for spreading code acquisition and initial power ramp-up.

The correction for the channel response is done using the channel response estimate calculated in the AVC which operates on the pilot sequence signal. The output signal of the AMF is the combination of the multipath components which are summed to give a maximum value. This combination corrects for the distortion of multipath signal reception. The various message despreading circuits operate on this combined multipath component signal from the AMF. shows an exemplary embodiment of the AMF. The sampled signal from the A\/D converter  is applied to the L-stage delay line . Each stage of this delay line  holds the signal corresponding to a different multipath signal component. Correction for the channel response is applied to each delayed signal component by multiplying the component in the respective multiplier of multiplier bank  with the respective weighting factor w, W, . . . , wfrom the AVC corresponding to the delayed signal component. All weighted signal components are summed in the adder  to give the combined multipath component signal y(t).","The combined multipath component signal y(t) does not include the correction due to phase and frequency offset of the carrier signal. The correction for the phase and frequency offset of the carrier signal is made to y(t) by multiplying y(t) with carrier phase and frequency correction (derotation phaser) in multiplier . The phase and frequency correction is produced by the AVC as described previously. shows the correction as being applied before the despreading circuits , but alternate embodiments of the invention can apply the correction after the despreading circuits.","XX. Method to Reduce Re-Acquisition Time with Virtual Location","One consequence of determining the difference in code phase between the locally generated pilot code sequence and a received spreading code sequence is that an approximate value for the distance between the base station and a subscriber unit can be calculated. If the SU has a relatively fixed position with respect to the RCS of the base station, the uncertainty of received spreading code phase is reduced for subsequent attempts at re-acquisition by the SU or RCS. The time required for the base station to acquire the access signal of a SU that has gone \u201coff-hook\u201d contributes to the delay between the SU going off-hook and the receipt of a dial tone from the PSTN. For systems that require a short delay, such as 150 msec for dial tone after off-hook is detected, a method which reduces the acquisition and bearer channel establishment time is desirable. One embodiment of the present invention uses such a method of reducing re-acquisition by use of virtual locating. Additional details of this technique are described in Section XXXXIII hereinafter entitled \u201cVirtual Locating Of A Fixed Subscriber Unit To Reduce Re-Acquisition Time\u201d.","The RCS acquires the SU CDMA signal by searching only those received code phases corresponding to the largest propagation delay of the particular system. In other words, the RCS assumes that all SUs are at a predetermined, fixed distance from the RCS. The first time the SU establishes a channel with the RCS, the normal search pattern is performed by the RCS to acquire the access channel. The normal method starts by searching the code phases corresponding to the longest possible delay, and gradually adjusts the search to the code phases with the shortest possible delay. However, after the initial acquisition, the SU can calculate the delay between the RCS and the SU by measuring the time difference between sending a short access signal to the RCS and receiving an acknowledgment signal, and using the received global pilot channel as a timing reference. The SU can also receive the delay value by having the RCS calculate the round trip delay difference from the code phase difference between the global pilot code generated at the RCS and the received assigned pilot code from the SU, and then sending the SU the value on a predetermined control channel. Once the round trip delay is known to the SU, the SU may adjust the code phase of the locally generated assigned pilot and spreading codes by adding the delay required to make the SU appear to the RCS to be at the predetermined fixed distance from the RCS. Although the method is explained for the largest delay, a delay corresponding to any predetermined location in the system can be used.","A second advantage of the method of reducing re-acquisition by virtual locating is that a conservation in SU power use can be achieved. Note that a SU that is \u201cpowered down\u201d or in a sleep mode needs to start the bearer channel acquisition process with a low transmit power level and ramp-up power until the RCS can receive its signal in order to minimize interference with other users. Since the subsequent re-acquisition time is shorter, and because the SU's location is relatively fixed in relation to the RCS, the SU can ramp-up transmit power more quickly because the SU will wait a shorter period of time before increasing transmit power. The SU waits a shorter period because it knows, within a small error range, when it should receive a response from the RCS if the RCS has acquired the SU signal.","XXI. The Radio Carrier Station (RCS)","The Radio Carrier Station (RCS) of the present invention acts as a central interface between the SU and the remote processing control network element, such as a radio distribution unit (RDU). The interface to the RDU of the present embodiment follows the G.704 standard and an interface according to a modified version of DECT V5.1, but the present invention can support any interface that can exchange call control and traffic channels. The RCS receives information channels from the RDU including call control data, and traffic channel data such as, but not limited to, 32 kbs ADPCM, 64 kbs PCM and ISDN, as well as system configuration and maintenance data. The RCS also terminates the CDMA radio interface bearer channels with SUs, which channels include both control data, and traffic channel data. In response to the call control data from either the RDU or a SU, the RCS allocates traffic channels to bearer channels on the RF communication link and establishes a communication connection between the SU and the telephone network through an RDU.","As shown in , the RCS receives call control and message information data into the MUXs ,  and  through interface lines ,  and . Although El format is shown, other similar telecommunication formats can be supported in the same manner as described below. The MUXs shown in  may be implemented using circuits similar to that shown in FIG. . The MUX shown in  includes system clock signal generator  consisting of phase locked oscillators (not shown) which generate clock signals for the line PCM highway  (which is part of PCM highway ), and high speed bus (HSB) ; and the MUX controller  which synchronizes the system clock  to interface line . It is contemplated that the phase lock oscillators can provide timing signals for the RCS in the absence of synchronization to a line. The MUX line interface  separates the call control data from the message information data. Referring to , each MUX provides a connection to the wireless access controller (WAC)  through the PCM highway . The MUX controller  also monitors the presence of different tones present in the information signal by means of tone detector . Additionally, the MUX Controller  provides the ISDN D channel network signaling locally to the RDU.","The MUX line interface , such as a FALC , includes an E1 interface  which consists of a transmit connection pair (not shown) and a receive connection pair (not shown) of the MUX connected to the RDU or central office (CO) ISDN switch at the data rate of 2.048 Mbps. The transmit and receive connection pairs are connected to the E1 interface  which translates differential tri-level transmit\/receive encoded pairs into levels for use by the framer . The line interface  uses internal phase-locked-loops (not shown) to produce E1-derived 2.048 MHz and 4.096 MHz clocks as well as an 8 KHz frame-sync pulse. The line interface can operate in clock-master or clock-slave mode. While the exemplary embodiment is shown as using an E1 interface, it is contemplated that other types of telephone lines which convey multiple calls may be used, for example, T1 lines or lines which interface to a private branch exchange (PBX).","The line interface framer  frames the data streams by recognizing the framing patterns on channel- (time-slot ) of the incoming line, inserts and extracts service bits and generates\/checks line service quality information.","As long as a valid E1 signal appears at the E1 interface , the FALC , recovers a 2.048 MHz PCM clock signal from the E1 line. This clock, via system clock , is used system wide as a PCM highway clock signal. If the E1 line fails, the FALC  continues to deliver a PCM clock derived from an oscillator signal o(t) connected to the sync input (not shown) of the FALC . This PCM clock serves the RCS system until another MUX with an operational E1 line assumes responsibility for generating the system clock signals.","The framer  generates a received frame sync pulse, which in turn can be used to trigger the PCM Interface  to transfer data onto the line PCM highway  and into the RCS system for use by other elements. Since all E1 lines are frame synchronized, all line PCM highways are also frame synchronized. From this 8 kHz PCM Sync pulse, the system clock signal generator  of the MUX uses a phase locked loop (not shown) to synthesize the PN\u00d72 clock (e.g., 15.96 MHZ)(W(t)). The frequency of this clock signal is different for different transmission bandwidths as described in Table 7.","The MUX includes a MUX controller , such as a 25 MHz quad integrated communications controller, containing a microprocessor , program memory , and time division multiplexer (TDM) . The TDM  is coupled to receive the signal provided by the framer , and extracts information placed in time slots  and . The extracted information governs how the MUX controller  processes the link access protocol-D (LAPD) data link. The call control and bearer modification messages, such as those defined as V5.1 network layer messages, are either passed to the WAC, or used locally by the MUX controller .","The RCS line PCM highway  is connected to and originates with the framer  through PCM Interface , and comprises of a 2.048 MHz stream of data in both the transmit and receive direction. The RCS also contains a high speed bus (HSB)  which is the communication link between the MUX, WAC, and MIUs. The HSB  supports a data rate of, for example, 100 Mbit\/sec. Each of the MUX, WAC, and MIU access the HSB using arbitration. The RCS of the present invention also can include several MUXs requiring one board to be a \u201cmaster\u201d and the rest \u201cslaves\u201d. Details on the implementation of the HSB may be found in Section XXXXIV hereinafter entitled ","Referring to , the wireless access controller (WAC)  is the RCS system controller which manages call control functions and interconnection of data streams between the MUXs , , , modem interface units (MIUs) , , . The WAC  also controls and monitors other RCS elements such as the VDC , RF , and power amplifiers . The WAC  as shown in , allocates bearer channels to the modems on each MIU , ,  and allocates the message data on line PCM Highway  from the MUxs , ,  to the modems on the MIUs , , . This allocation is made through the System PCM Highway  by means of a time slot interchange on the WAC . If more than one WAC is present for redundancy purposes, the WACs determines the master-slave relationship with a second WAC. The WAC  also generates messages and paging information responsive to call control signals from the MUXs , ,  received from a remote processor, such as an RDU; generates broadcast data which is transmitted to the MIU master modem ; and controls the generation by the MIU MM  of the Global system Pilot spreading code sequence. The WAC  also is connected to an external network manager (NM)  for craftsperson or user access.","Referring to , the WAC includes a time-slot interchanger (TSI)  which transfers information from one time slot in a line PCM highway or system PCM highway to another time slot in either the same or different line PCM highway or system PCM highway. The TSI  is connected to the WAC controller  of  which controls the assignment or transfer of information from one time slot to another time slot and stores this information in memory . The exemplary embodiment of the invention has four PCM Highways , , ,  connected to the TSI. The WAC also is connected to the HSB , through which WAC communicates to a second WAC (not shown), to the MUXs and to the MIUs.","Referring to , the WAC  includes a WAC controller  employing, for example, a microprocessor , such as a Motorola MC 68040 and a communications processor , such as the Motorola MC68360 QUICC communications processor, and a clock oscillator  which receives a clock synch signal wo(t) from the system clock generator. The clock generator is located on a MUX (not shown) to provide timing to the WAC controller . The WAC controller  also includes memory  including flash PROM  and SRAM memory . The flash PROM  contains the program code for the WAC controller  and is reprogrammable for new software programs downloaded from an external source. The SRAM  is provided to contain the temporary data written to and read from memory  by the WAC controller .","A low speed bus  is connected to the WAC  for transferring control and status signals between the RF transmitter\/receiver , VDC , RF  and power amplifier  as shown in FIG. . The control signals are sent from the WAC  to enable or disable the RF transmitters\/receiver  or power amplifier , and the status signals are sent from the RF transmitters\/receiver  or power amplifier  to monitor the presence of a fault condition.","The exemplary RCS contains at least one MIU , which is shown in FIG.  and now described in detail. The MIU of the exemplary embodiment includes six CDMA modems, but the invention is not limited to this number of modems. The MIU includes a system PCM highway  connected to each of the CDMA Modems , , ,  through a PCM Interface , a control channel bus  connected to MIU controller  and each of the CDMA modems , , , , an MIU clock signal generator (CLK) , and a modem output combiner . The MIU provides the RCS with the following functions: the MIU controller receives CDMA channel assignment instructions from the WAC and assigns a modem to a user information signal which is applied to the line interface of the MUX and a modem to receive the CDMA channel from the SU; it also combines the CDMA transmit modem data for each of the MIU CDMA modems; multiplexes I and Q transmit message data from the CDMA modems for transmission to the VDC; receives analog I and Q receive message data from the VDC; distributes the I and Q data to the CDMA modems; transmits and receives digital AGC data; distributes the AGC data to the CDMA modems; and sends MIU board status and maintenance information to the WAC .","The MIU controller  of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention contains one communication microprocessor , such as the MC68360 \u201cQUICC\u201d processor, and includes a memory  having a Flash PROM memory  and a SRAM memory . Flash PROM  is provided to contain the program code for the microprocessors , and the memory  is downloadable and reprogrammable to support new program versions. SRAM  is provided to contain the temporary data space needed by the MC68360 microprocessor  when the MIU controller  reads or writes data to memory","The MIU CLK circuit  provides a timing signal to the MIU controller , and also provides a timing signal to the CDMA modems. The MIU CLK circuit  receives, and is synchronized to, the system clock signal wo(t). The controller clock signal generator  also receives and synchronizes to the spreading code clock signal pn(t) which is distributed to the CDMA modems , , ,  from the MUX.","The RCS of the present embodiment includes a system modem  contained on one MIU. The system modem  includes a broadcast spreader (not shown) and a pilot generator (not shown). The broadcast modem provides the broadcast information used by the exemplary system, and the broadcast message data is transferred from the MIU controller  to the system modem . The system modem also includes four additional modems (not shown) which are used to transmit the signals CT through CT and AX through AX. The system modem  provides unweighted I and Q broadcast message data signals which are applied to the VDC. The VDC adds the broadcast message data signal to the MIU CDMA modem transmit data of all CDMA modems , , ,  and the global pilot signal.","The pilot generator (PG)  provides the global pilot signal which is used by the present invention, and the global pilot signal is provided to the CDMA modems , , ,  by the MIU controller . However, other embodiments of the present invention do not require the MIU controller to generate the global pilot signal, but include a global pilot signal generated by any form of CDMA spreading code generator. In the described embodiment of the invention, the unweighted I and Q global pilot signal is also sent to the VDC where it is assigned a weight, and added to the MIU CDMA modem transmit data and broadcast message data signal.","System timing in the RCS is derived from the E1 interface. There are four MUXs in an RCS, three of which (,  and ) are shown in FIG. . Two MUXs are located on each chassis. One of the two MUXs on each chassis is designated as the master, and one of the masters is designated as the system master. The MUX which is the system master derives a 2.048 MHz PCM clock signal from the E1 interface using a phase-locked loop (not shown). In turn, the system master MUX divides the 2.048 Mhz PCM clock signal in frequency by 16 to derive a 128 KHz reference clock signal. The 128 KHz reference clock signal is distributed from the MUX that is the system master to all the other MUXs. In turn, each MUX multiplies the 128 KHz reference clock signal in frequency to synthesize the system clock signal which has a frequency that is twice the frequency of the PN-clock signal. The MUX also divides the 128 KHz clock signal in frequency by 16 to generate the 8 KHz frame synch signal which is distributed to the MIUs. The system clock signal for the exemplary embodiment has a frequency of 11.648 Mhz for a 7 MHz bandwidth CDMA channel Each MUX also divides the system clock signal in frequency by 2 to obtain the PN-clock signal and further divides the PN-clock signal in frequency by 29 877 120 (the PN sequence length) to generate the PN-synch signal which indicates the epoch boundaries. The PN-synch signal from the system master MUX is also distributed to all MUXs to maintain phase alignment of the internally generated clock signals for each MUX. The PN-synch signal and the frame synch signal are aligned. The two MUXs that are designated as the master MUXs for each chassis then distribute both the system clock signal and the PN-clock signal to the MIUs and the VDC.","The PCM highway interface  connects the system PCM highway  to each CDMA modem , , , . The WAC controller transmits modem control information, including traffic message control signals for each respective user information signal to the MIU controller  through the HSB . Each CDMA modem , , ,  receives a traffic message control signal, which includes signaling information, from the MIU controller . Traffic message control signals also include call control (CC) information and spreading code and despreading code sequence information.","The MIU also includes the transmit data combiner  which adds weighted CDMA modem transmit data including in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) modem transmit data from the CDMA modems , , ,  on the MIU. The I modem transmit data is added separately from the Q modem transmit data. The combined I and Q modem transmit data output signal of the transmit data combiner  is applied to the I and Q multiplexer  that creates a single CDMA transmit message channel composed of the I and Q modem transmit data multiplexed into a digital data stream.","The receiver data input Circuit (RDI)  receives the analog differential I and Q Data from the video distribution circuit (VDC)  shown in FIG.  and distributes analog differential I and Q data to each of the CDMA modems , , ,  of the MIU. The automatic gain control (AGC) distribution circuit  receives the AGC data signal from the VDC and distributes the AGC data to each of the CDMA modems of the MIU. The TRL circuit  receives the traffic lights information and similarly distributes the Traffic light data to each of the Modems , , , .","XXII. The CDMA Modem","The CDMA modem provides for generation of CDMA spreading codes and synchronization between transmitter and receiver. It also provides four full duplex channels (TR, TR, TR, TR) programmable to 64, 32, 16, and 8 ksym\/sec. each, for spreading and transmission at a specific power level. The CDMA modem measures the received signal strength to allow automatic power control, it generates and transmits pilot signals, and encodes and decodes using the signal for forward error correction (FEC). The modem in an SU also performs transmitter spreading code pulse shaping using an FIR filter.

These I and Q CMDA channel signals are sampled by the CDMA modem receive section  (shown in ) and converted to I and Q digital receive message signal using an analog to digital (A\/D) converter , shown in FIG. . The sampling rate of the A\/D converter of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is equivalent to the despreading code rate.

The initial acquisition is done by shifting the phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence relative to the received signal and comparing the output of the pilot despreader to a threshold. The method used is called sequential search. Two thresholds (match and dismiss) are calculated from the auxiliary despreader. Once the signal is acquired, the search process is stopped and the tracking process begins. The tracking process maintains the code generator  (shown in ) used by the receiver in synchronization with the incoming signal.

In the exemplary embodiment, the A\/D  provides the I and Q digital receive message signal data as 2's complement values, 6 bits for I and 6 bits for Q which are clocked through an 11 stage shift register  responsive to the receive spreading-code clock signal RXPNCLK. The signal RXPNCLK is generated by the timing section  of code generation logic . Each stage of the shift register is tapped and complex multiplied in the multipliers , , , ,  by individual (6-bit I and 6-bit Q) weight values to provide 11 tap-weighted products which are summed in adder , and limited to 7-bit I and 7-bit Q values.","The CDMA modem receive section  (shown in ) provides independent channel despreaders , , , , , ,  (shown in ) for despreading the message channels.

The 7 despreaders correspond to the 7 channels: traffic channel  (TR\u2032), TR\u2032, TR\u2032, TR\u2032, AUX (a spare channel), APC and pilot (PLT).","The pilot AVC  shown in  receives the I and Q pilot spreading code sequence values PCI and PCQ into shift register  responsive to the timing signal RXPNCLK, and includes  individual despreaders  through  each correlating the I and Q digital receive message signal data with a one chip delayed version of the same pilot code sequence. Signals OE, OE, . . . OE are used by the modem control  to enable the despreading operation. The output signals of the despreaders are combined in combiner  forming correlation signal DSPRDAT of the Pilot AVC , which is received by the ACQ & track logic  (shown in FIG. ), and ultimately by modem controller  (shown in FIG. ).

The idle code used for each traffic channel is programmed by the Modem Controller  by writing the appropriate pattern IDLE to the MOI, which in the present embodiment is a 8 bit word for a 64 kbs stream, 4 bit word for a 32 kbs stream.","XXV. Modem Algorithms for Acquisition and Tracking of Received Pilot Signal","The acquisition and tracking algorithms are used by the receiver to determine the approximate code phase of a received signal, synchronize the local modem receiver despreaders to the incoming pilot signal, and track the phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence with the received pilot code sequence. Referring to , the algorithms are performed by the modem controller , which provides clock adjust signals to code generator . These adjust signals cause the code generator for the despreaders to adjust locally generated code sequences in response to measured output values of the pilot rake  and quantile values from quantile estimators B. Quantile values are noise statistics measured from the in-phase and quadrature channels from the output values of the AUX vector correlator  (shown in FIG. ). Synchronization of the receiver to the received signal is separated into two phases; an initial acquisition phase and a tracking phase. The initial acquisition phase is accomplished by clocking the locally generated pilot spreading code sequence at a higher or lower rate than the received signal's spreading code rate, sliding the locally generated pilot spreading code sequence and performing sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) on the output of the pilot vector correlator . The tracking phase maintains the locally generated spreading code pilot sequence in synchronization with the incoming pilot signal. Details of the quantile estimators B may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,535,238 entitled \u201cADAPTIVE POWER CONTROL FOR A SPREAD SPECTRUM COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein for its teachings on adaptive power control systems.","The SU cold acquisition algorithm is used by the SU CDMA modem when it is first powered up, and therefore has no knowledge of the correct pilot spreading code phase, or when an SU attempts to require synchronization with the incoming pilot signal but has taken an excessive amount of time. The cold acquisition algorithm is divided into two subphases. The first subphase consists of a search over the length 233415 code used by the FBCH. Once this sub-code phase is acquired, the pilot's 233415\u00d7128 length code is known to within an ambiguity of 128 possible phases. The second subphase is a search of these remaining128 possible phases. In order not to lose synch with the FBCH, in the second phase of the search, it is desirable to switch back and forth between tracking of the FBCH code and attempting acquisition of the pilot code.","The RCS acquisition of short access pilot (SAXPT) algorithm is used by an RCS CDMA modem to acquire the SAXPT pilot signal of an SU. Additional details of this technique are described in Section XXXXII hereinafter entitled \u201cA Method Of Controlling Initial Power Ramp-Up In CDMA Systems By Using Short Codes\u201d filed on even date herewith and herein incorporated by reference. The algorithm is a fast search algorithm because the SAXPT is a short code sequence of length N, where N=chips\/symbol, and ranges from 45 to 195, depending on the system's bandwidth. The search cycles through all possible phases until acquisition is complete.","The RCS acquisition of the long access pilot (LAXPT) algorithm begins immediately after acquisition of SAXPT. The SU's code phase is known within a multiple of a symbol duration, so in the exemplary embodiment of the invention there may be 7 to 66 phases to search within the round trip delay from the RCS. This bound is a result of the SU pilot signal being synchronized to the RCS global pilot signal.","The re-acquisition algorithm begins when loss of code lock (LOL) occurs. A Z-search algorithm is used to speed the process on the assumption that the code phase has not drifted far from where it was the last time the system was locked. The RCS uses a maximum width of the Z-search windows bounded by the maximum round trip propagation delay.","The pre-track period immediately follows the acquisition or re-acquisition algorithms and immediately precedes the tracking algorithm. Pre-track is a fixed duration period during which the receive data provided by the modem is not considered valid. The pre-track period allows other modem algorithms, such as those used by the ISW PLL , ACQ & tracking, AMF weight GEN , to prepare and adapt to the current channel. The pre-track period is two parts. The first part is the delay while the code tracking loop pulls in. The second part is the delay while the AMF tap weight calculations are performed by the AMF weight gen  to produce settled weighting coefficients. Also in the second part of the pre-track period, the carrier tracking loop is allowed to pull in by the SW PLL , and the scalar quantile estimates are performed in the quantile estimator A.","The tracking process is entered after the pre-track period ends. This process is actually a repetitive cycle and is the only process phase during which receive data provided by the modem may be considered valid. The following operations are performed during this phase: AMF tap weight update, carrier tracking, code tracking, vector quantile update, scalar quantile update, code lock check, derotation and symbol summing and power control (forward and reverse)","If LOL is detected, the modem receiver terminates the track algorithm and automatically enters the reacquisition algorithm. In the SU, a LOL causes the transmitter to be shut down. In the RCS, LOL causes forward power control to be disabled with the transmit power held constant at the level immediately prior to loss of lock. It also causes the return power control information being transmitted to assume a 010101 . . . pattern, causing the SU to hold its transmit power constant. This can be performed using the signal lock check function which generates the reset signal to the acquisition and tracking circuit .","Two sets of quantile statistics are maintained, one by quantile estimator B and the other by the scalar quantile estimator A. Both are used by the modem controller . The first set is the \u201cvector\u201d quantile information, so named because it is calculated from the vector of four complex values generated by the AUX AVC receiver . The second set is the scalar quantile information, which is calculated from the single complex value AUX signal that is output from the AUX despreader . The two sets of information represent different sets of noise statistics used to maintain a pre-determined probability of false alarm (P). The vector quantile data is used by the acquisition and reacquisition algorithms implemented by the modem controller  to determine the presence of a received signal in noise, and the scalar quantile information is used by the code lock check algorithm.","For both the vector and scalar cases, quantile information consists of calculated values of lambda through lambda, which are boundary values used to estimate the probability distribution function (p.d.f.) of the despread receive signal and determine whether the modem is locked to the PN code. The aux power value used in the following C-subroutine is the magnitude squared of the AUX signal output of the scalar correlator array for the scalar quantiles, and the sum of the magnitudes squared for the vector case. In both cases the quantiles are then calculated using the following C-subroutine:","for (n=0; n<3; n++){",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0287","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["lambda [n]+=(lambda [n]<Aux_Power)? CG[n]: GM[n];","}\n\nwhere CG[n] are positive constants and GM[n] are negative constants, (different values are used for scalar and vector quantiles).\n"]}}}},"During the acquisition phase, the search of the incoming pilot signal with the locally generated pilot code sequence employs a series of sequential tests to determine if the locally generated pilot code has the correct code phase relative to the received signal. The search algorithms use the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) to determine whether the received and locally generated code sequences are in phase. The speed of acquisition is increased by parallelism resulting from having a multi-fingered receiver. For example, in the described embodiment of the invention the main pilot rake  has a total of 11 fingers representing a total phase period of 11 chip periods. For acquisition 8 separate SPRTs are implemented, with each SPRT observing a 4 chip window. Each window is offset from the previous window by one chip, and in a search sequence any given code phase is covered by 4 windows. If all 8 of the SPRT tests are rejected, then the set of windows is moved by 8 chips. If any of the SPRT's is accepted, then the code phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence is adjusted to attempt to center the accepted SPRT's phase within the pilot AVC. It is likely that more than one SPRT reaches the acceptance threshold at the same time. A table lookup is used cover all 256 possible combinations of accept\/reject and the modem controller uses the information to estimate the correct center code phase within the pilot rake . Each SPRT is implemented as follows (all operations occur at 64 k symbol rate): Denote the fingers' output level values as I_Finger[n] and Q_Finger[n], where n=0 . . . 10 (inclusive, 0 is earliest (most advanced) finger), then the power of each window is: \n\n\nTo implement the SPRT's the modem controller then performs for each of the windows the following calculations which are expressed as a pseudo-code subroutine:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0289","num":"0289"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\/* find bin for Power *\/"},{"entry":"tmp = SIGMA[0];"},{"entry":"for (k = 0; k<3; k++) {"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"if (Power > lambda [k]) tmp SIGMA[k+1];"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":"test_statistic += tmp; \/* update statistic *\/"},{"entry":"if(test_statistic > ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD)you've got ACQ;"},{"entry":"else if (test_statistic < DISMISSAL_THRESHOLD) {"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"forget this code phase;"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"} else keep trying - get more statistics;"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The modem controller determines which bin delimited by the values of lambda[k] the power level falls into which allows the modem controller to develop an approximate statistic.","For the present algorithm, the control voltage is formed as \u03b5=yBy, where y is a vector formed from the complex valued output values of the pilot vector correlator , and B is a matrix consisting of the constant values pre-determined to maximize the operating characteristics while minimizing the noise as described previously with reference to the quadratic detector.","To understand the operation of the quadratic detector, it is useful to consider the following. A spread spectrum signal, s(t) is passed through a multipath channel with an impulse response h(t). The baseband spread signal is described by Equation (30): \n\n\nwhere Cis a complex spreading code symbol, p(t) is a predefined chip pulse and Tis the chip time spacing, where T=1\/Rand Ris the chip rate.\n","The received baseband signal is represented by Equation (31): \n\n\nwhere q(t)=p(t)*h(t), t is an unknown delay and n(t) is additive noise. The received signal is processed by a filter, h(t), so the waveform, x(t), to be processed is given by Equation (32): \n\n\nwhere f(t)=q(t)*h(t) and z(t)=n(t)*h(t).\n","In the exemplary receiver, samples of the received signal are taken at the chip rate, that is to say, 1\/T. These samples, x(mT+\u03c4\u2032), are processed by an array of correlators that compute, during the rcorrelation period, the quantities given by Equation (33): \n\n\nThese quantities are composed of a noise component wand a deterministic component Ygiven by Equation (34): \n\n\nIn the sequel, the time index r may be suppressed for ease of writing, although it is to be noted that the function f(t) changes slowly with time.\n","The samples are processed to adjust the sampling phase, \u03c4\u2032, in an optimum fashion for further processing by the receiver, such as matched filtering. This adjustment is described below. To simplify the representation of the process, it is helpful to describe it in terms of the function f(t+\u03c4), where the time-shift, \u03c4, is to be adjusted. It is noted that the function f(t+\u03c4) is measured in the presence of noise. Thus, it may be problematical to adjust the phase \u03c4\u2032 based on measurements of the signal f(t+\u03c4). To account for the noise, the function v(\u03c4): v(t)=f(t)+m(t) is introduced, where the term m(t) represents a noise process. The system processor may be derived based on considerations of the function v(t).","The process is non-coherent and therefore is based on the envelope power function |v(t+\u03c4)|. The functional e(\u03c4\u2032) given in Equation (35) is helpful for describing the process: \n\n\nThe shift parameter is adjusted for e(\u03c4\u2032)=0, which occurs when the energy on the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4] equals that on the interval [\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4, \u221e). The error characteristic is monotonic and therefore has a single zero crossing point. This is the desirable quality of the functional. A disadvantage of the functional is that it is ill-defined because the integrals are unbounded when noise is present. Nevertheless, the functional e(\u03c4\u2032) may be cast in the form given by Equation (36): \n\n\nwhere the characteristic function w(t) is equal to sgn(t), the signum function.\n","To optimize the characteristic function w(t), it is helpful to define a figure of merit, F, as set forth in Equation (37): \n\n\nThe numerator of F is the numerical slope of the mean error characteristic on the interval [\u2212T,T] surrounding the tracked value, \u03c4\u2032. The statistical mean is taken with respect to the noise as well as the random channel, h(t). It is desirable to specify a statistical characteristic of the channel in order to perform this statistical average. For example, the channel may be modeled as a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel with impulse response h(t) and a white noise process U(t) that has an intensity function g(t) as shown in Equation (38): \n\n\nThe variance of e(\u03c4) is computed as the mean square value of the fluctuation:\n\n\u2003(\u03c4)=(\u03c4)\u2212<(\u03c4)>\u2003\u2003Equation (39)\n\nwhere <e(\u03c4)> is the average of e(\u03c4) with respect to the noise.\n","Optimization of the figure of merit F with respect to the function w(t) may be carried out using well-known variational methods of optimization. Once the optimal w(t) is determined, the resulting processor may be approximated accurately by a quadratic sample processor which is derived as follows. By the sampling theorem, the signal v(t), bandlimited to a bandwidth W may be expressed in terms of its samples as shown in Equation (40):\n\n()=\u03a3()sin c[()\u03c0]\u2003\u2003Equation (40)\n\nsubstituting this expansion into Equation 36 results in an infinite quadratic form in the samples v(k\/W+\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4). Making the assumption that the signal bandwidth equals the chip rate allows the use of a sampling scheme that is clocked by the chip clock signal to be used to obtain the samples. These samples, vare represented by Equation (41):\n\n(+\u03c4\u2032\u2212\u03c4)\u2003\u2003Equation (41)\n\nThis assumption leads to a simplification of the implementation.

The phase detector output is the hard limited version of the quadrature component of the product of the (complex valued) pilot output signal of the scalar correlated array and the VCO output signal.

The VCO is a pure summation, accumulated phase error \u03c6, which is converted to the complex phaser cos \u03c6+j sin \u03c6 using a look-up table in memory.","The previous description of acquisition and tracking algorithm focuses on a non-coherent method because the acquisition and tracking algorithm described requires non-coherent acquisition following by non-coherent tracking because during acquisition a coherent reference is not available until the AMF, pilot AVC, aux AVC, and DPLL are in an equilibrium state. However, it is known in the art that coherent tracking and combining is always optimal because in non-coherent tracking and combining the output phase information of each pilot AVC finger is lost. Consequently, another embodiment of the invention employs a two step acquisition and tracking system, in which the previously described non-coherent acquisition and tracking algorithm is implemented first, and then the algorithm switches to a coherent tracking method.

It is noted that data interface , ADPCM encoder  and ADPCM decoder  are typically provided as a standard ADPCM encoder\/decoder chip.","The forward link CDMA RF channel signal is applied to the RF demodulator  to produce the forward link CDMA signal. The forward link CDMA signal is provided to the CDMA modem , which acquires synchronization with the global pilot signal, produces global pilot synchronization signal to the clock , to generate the system timing signals, and despreads the plurality of logical channels. The CDMA modem  also acquires the traffic messages RMESS and control messages RCTRL and provides the traffic message signals RMESS to the data interface  and receive control message signals RCTRL to the SU controller .","The receive control message signals RCTRL include a subscriber identification signal, a coding signal and bearer modification signals. The RCTRL may also include control and other telecommunication signaling information. The receive control message signal RCTRL is applied to the SU controller , which verifies that the call is for the SU from the subscriber identification value derived from RCTRL. The SU controller  determines the type of user information contained in the traffic message signal from the coding signal and bearer rate modification signal. If the coding signal indicates the traffic message is ADPCM coded, the traffic message RVMESS is sent to the ADPCM decoder  by sending a select message to the data interface . The SU controller  outputs an ADPCM coding signal and bearer rate signal derived from the coding signal to the ADPCM decoder . The traffic message signal RVMESS is the input signal to the ADPCM decoder , where the traffic message signal is converted to a digital information signal RINF in response to the values of the input ADPCM coding signal.","If the SU controller  determines the type of user information contained in the traffic message signal from the coding signal is not ADPCM coded, then RDMESS passes through the ADPCM encoder transparently. The traffic message RDMESS is transferred from the data interface  directly to the interface controller (IC)  of the subscriber line interface .","The digital information signal RINF or RDMESS is applied to the subscriber line interface , including a interface controller (IC)  and line interface (LI) . For the exemplary embodiment the IC is an extended PCM interface controller (EPIC) and the LI is a subscriber line interface circuit (SLIC) for POTS which corresponds to RINF type signals and a ISDN Interface for ISDN which corresponds to RDMESS type signals. The EPIC and SLIC circuits are well known in the art. The subscriber line interface  converts the digital information signal RINF or RDMESS to the user defined format. The user defined format is provided to the IC  from the SU Controller . The LI  includes circuits for performing such functions as A-law or \u03bc-law conversion, generating dial tone and generating or interpreting signaling bits. The line interface also produces the user information signal to the SU user  as defined by the subscriber line interface, for example POTS voice, voiceband data or ISDN data service.","For a reverse link CDMA RF channel, a user information signal is applied to the LI  of the subscriber line interface , which outputs a service type signal and an information type signal to the SU controller. The IC  of the subscriber line interface  produces a digital information signal TINF which is the input signal to the ADPCM encoder  if the user information signal is to be ADPCM encoded, such as for POTS service.

The SU controller  also outputs the reverse control signal which includes the coding signal call control information, and bearer channel modification signal, to the CDMA modem. The output message signal TVMESS is applied to the data interface . The data interface  sends the user information to the CDMA modem  as transmit message signal TMESS. The CDMA modem  spreads the output message and reverse control channels TCTRL received from the SU controller  and produces the reverse link CDMA signal. The reverse link CDMA signal is provided to the RF transmit section  and modulated by the RF modulator  to produce the output reverse link CDMA RF channel signal transmitted from antenna .","XXVII. Call Connection and Establishment Procedure","The process of bearer channel establishment consists of two procedures: the call connection process for a call connection incoming from a remote call processing unit such as an RDU (incoming call connection), and the call connection process for a call outgoing from the SU (outgoing call connection). Before any bearer channel can be established between an RCS and a SU, the SU must register its presence in the network with the remote call processor such as the RDU. When the off-hook signal is detected by the SU, the SU not only begins to establish a bearer channel; but also initiates the procedure for an RCS to obtain a terrestrial link between the RCS and the remote processor. As incorporated herein by reference, the process of establishing the RCS and RDU connection is detailed in the DECT V5.1 standard.","For the incoming call connection procedure shown in , first , the WAC  (shown in ) receives, via one of the MUXs ,  and , an incoming call request from a remote call processing unit. This request identifies the target SU and that a call connection to the SU is desired. The WAC periodically outputs the SBCH channel with paging indicators for each SU and periodically outputs the FBCH traffic lights for each access channel. In response to the incoming call request, the WAC, at step , first checks to see if the identified SU is already active with another call. If so, the WAC returns a busy signal for the SU to the remote processing unit through the MIX, otherwise the paging indicator for the channel is set.","Next, at step , the WAC checks the status of the RCS modems and, at step , determines whether there is an available modem for the call. If a modem is available, the traffic lights on the FBCH indicate that one or more AXCH channels are available. If no channel is available after a certain period of time, then the WAC returns a busy signal for the SU to the remote processing unit through the MUX. If an RCS modem is available and the SU is not active (in sleep mode), the WAC sets the paging indicator for the identified SU on the SBCH to indicate an incoming call request. Meanwhile, the access channel modems continuously search for the short access pilot signal (SAXPT) of the SU.","At step , an SU in sleep mode periodically enters awake mode. In awake mode, the SU modem synchronizes to the downlink pilot signal, waits for the SU modem AMF filters and phase locked loop to settle, and reads the paging indicator in the slot assigned to it on the SBCH to determine if there is a call for the SU . If no paging indicator is set, the SU halts the SU modem and returns to sleep mode. If a paging indicator is set for an incoming call connection, the SU modem checks the service type and traffic lights on FBCH for an available AXCH.","Next, at step , the SU modem selects an available AXCH and starts a fast transmit power ramp-up on the corresponding SAXPT. For a period the SU modem continues fast power ramp-up on SAXPT and the access modems continue to search for the SAXPT. At step , the RCS modem acquires the SAXPT of the SU and begins to search for the SU LAXPT. When the SAXPT is acquired, the modem informs the WAC controller, and the WAC controller sets the traffic lights corresponding to the modem to \u201cred\u201d to indicate the modem is now busy. The traffic lights are periodically output while continuing to attempt acquisition of the LAXPT.","The SU modem monitors, at step , the FBCH AXCH traffic light. When the AXCH traffic light is set to red, the SU assumes the RCS modem has acquired the SAXPT and begins transmitting LAXPT. The SU modem continues to ramp-up power of the LAXPT at a slower rate until sync-ind messages are received on the corresponding CTCH. If the SU is mistaken because the traffic light was actually set in response to another SU acquiring the AXCH, the SU modem times out because no sync-ind messages are received. The SU randomly waits a period of time, picks a new AXCH channel, and steps  and  are repeated until the SU modem receives sync-ind messages. Details of the power ramp up method used in the exemplary embodiment of this invention may be found in Section XXXXII hereinafter entitled \u201cMethod Of Controlling Initial Power Ramp-Up In CDMA Systems By Using Short Codes.\u201d","Next, at step , the RCS modem acquires the LAXPT of the SU and begins sending sync-ind messages on the corresponding CTCH. The modem waits 10 msec for the pilot and AUX Vector correlator filters and phase-locked loop to settle, but continues to send sync-ind messages on the CTCH. The modem then begins looking for a request message for access to a bearer channel (MAC_ACC_REQ), from the SU modem.","The SU modem, at step , receives the sync-ind message and freezes the LAXPT transmit power level. The SU modem then begins sending repeated request messages for access to a bearer traffic channel (MAC_ACC_REQ) at fixed power levels, and listens for a request confirmation message (MAC_BEARER_CFM) from the RCS modem.","Next, at step , the RCS modem receives a MAC_ACC_REQ message; the modem then starts measuring the AXCH power level, and starts the APC channel. The RCS modem then sends the MAC_BEARER_CFM message to the SU and begins listening for the acknowledgment MAC_BEARER_CFM_ACK of the MAC_BEARER_CFM message. At step , the SU modem receives the MAC_BEARER_CFM message and begins obeying the APC power control messages. The SU stops sending the MAC_ACC_REQ message and sends the RCS modem the MAC_BEARER_CFM_ACK message. The SU begins sending the null data on the AXCH. The SU waits 10 msec for the uplink transmit power level to settle.","The RCS modem, at step , receives the MAC_BEARER_CFM_ACK message and stops sending the MAC_BEARER_CFM messages. APC power measurements continue.","Next, at step , both the SU and the RCS modems have synchronized the sub-epochs, obey APC messages, measure receive power levels, and compute and send APC messages. The SU waits 10 msec for downlink power level to settle.","Finally, at step , the bearer channel is established and initialized between the SU and RCS modems. The WAC receives the bearer establishment signal from the RCS modem, re-allocates the AXCH channel and sets the corresponding traffic light to green.","For the Outgoing Call Connection shown in , the SU is placed in active mode by the off-hook signal at the user interface at step . Next, at step , the RCS indicates available AXCH channels by setting the respective traffic lights. At step , the SU synchronizes to the downlink pilot, waits for the SU modem vector correlator filters and phase lock loop to settle, and the SU checks service type and traffic lights for an available AXCH. Steps  through  are identical to the procedure steps  through  for the incoming call connection procedure of , and therefore are not explained in detail.","In the previous procedures for incoming call connection and outgoing call connection, the power ramping-up process consists of the following events. The SU starts from very low transmit power and increases its power level while transmitting the short code SAXPT; once the RCS modem detects the short code it turns off the traffic light. Upon detecting the changed traffic light, the SU continues ramping-up at a slower rate this time sending the LAXPT. Once the RCS modem acquires the LAXPT and sends a message on CTCH to indicate this, the SU keeps its transmit (TX) power constant and sends the MAC-access-request message. This message is answered with a MAC_BEARER_CFM message on the CTCH. Once the SU receives the MAC_BEAER_CFM message it switches to the traffic channel (TRCH) which is the dial tone for POTS.","When the SU captures a specific user channel AXCH, the RCS assigns a code seed for the SU through the CTCH. The code seed is used by the spreading code generator in the SU modem to produce the assigned code for the reverse pilot of the SU, and the spreading codes for associated channels for traffic, call control, and signaling. The SU reverse pilot spreading code sequence is synchronized in phase to the RCS system global pilot spreading code, and the traffic, call control and signaling spreading codes are synchronized in phase to the SU reverse pilot spreading code.","If the SU is successful in capturing a specific user channel, the RCS establishes a terrestrial link with the remote processing unit to correspond to the specific user channel. For the DECT V5.1 standard, once the complete link from the RDU to the LE is established using the V5.1 ESTABLISHMENT message, a corresponding V5.1 ESTABLISHMENT ACK message is returned from the LE to the RDU, and the SU is sent a CONNECT message indicating that the transmission link is complete.","XXVIII. Support of Special Service Types","The system of the present invention includes a bearer channel modification feature which allows the transmission rate of the user information to be switched from a lower rate to a higher rate. The bearer channel modification (BCM) method is used to change a 32 kbs ADPCM channel to a 64 kbs PCM channel to support high speed data and fax communications through the spread-spectrum communication system of the present invention. Although the details of this technique are described in Section XXXXV hereinafter entitled \u201cCDMA Communication System Which Selectively Suppresses Data Transmissioning During Establishment Of A Communication Channel\u201d, the process is briefly described below:","First, a bearer channel on the RF interface is established between the RCS and SU, and a corresponding link exists between the RCS terrestrial interface and the remote processing unit, such as an RDU. The digital transmission rate of the link between the RCS and remote processing unit normally corresponds to a data encoded rate, which may be, for example, ADPCM at 32 kbs. The WAC controller of the RCS monitors the encoded digital data information of the link received by the line interface of the MUX. If the WAC controller detects the presence of the 2100 Hz tone in the digital data, the WAC instructs the SU through the assigned logical control channel and causes a second, 64 kbs duplex link to be established between the RCS modem and the SU. In addition, the WAC controller instructs the remote processing unit to establish a second 64 kbs duplex link between the remote processing unit and the RCS. Consequently, for a brief period, the remote processing unit and the SU exchange the same data over both the 32 kbs and the 64 kbs links through the RCS. Once the second link is established, the remote processing unit causes the WAC controller to switch transmission only to the 64 kbs link, and the WAC controller instructs the RCS modem and the SU to terminate and tear down the 32 kbs link. Concurrently, the 32 kbs terrestrial link is also terminated and torn down.","Another embodiment of the BCM method incorporates a negotiation between the external remote processing unit, such as the RDU, and the RCS to allow for redundant channels on the terrestrial interface, while only using one bearer channel on the RF interface. The method described is a synchronous switchover from the 32 kbs link to the 64 kbs link over the air link which takes advantage of the fact that the spreading code sequence timing is synchronized between the RCS modem and SU. When the WAC controller detects the presence of the 2100 Hz tone in the digital data, the WAC controller instructs the remote processing unit to establish a second 64 kbs duplex link between the remote processing unit and the RCS. The remote processing unit then sends 32 kbs encoded data and 64 kbs data concurrently to the RCS. Once the remote processing unit has established the 64 kbs link, the RCS is informed and the 32 kbs link is terminated and torn down. The RCS also informs the SU that the 32 kbs link is being torn down and to switch processing to receive unencoded 64 kbs data on the channel. The SU and RCS exchange control messages over the bearer control channel of the assigned channel group to identify and determine the particular subepoch of the bearer channel spreading code sequence within which the RCS will begin transmitting 64 kbit\/sec data to the SU. Once the subepoch is identified, the switch occurs synchronously at the identified subepoch boundary. This synchronous switchover method is more economical of bandwidth since the system does not need to maintain capacity for a 64 kbs link in order to support a switchover.","In previously described embodiments of the BCM feature, the RCS will tear down the 32 kbs link first, but one skilled in the art would know that the RCS could tear down the 32 kbs link after the bearer channel has switched to the 64 kbs link.","As another special service type, the system of the present invention includes a method for conserving capacity over the RF interface for ISDN types of traffic. This conservation occurs while a known idle bit pattern is transmitted in the ISDN D-channel when no data information is being transmitted. The CDMA system of the present invention includes a method to prevent transmission of redundant information carried on the D-channel of ISDN networks for signals transmitted through a wireless communication link. The advantage of such method is that it reduces the amount of information transmitted and consequently the transmit power and channel capacity used by that information. The method is described as it is used in the RCS. In the first step, the controller, such as the WAC of the RCS or the SU controller of the SU, monitors the output D-channel from the subscriber line interface for a predetermined channel idle pattern. A delay is included between the output of the line interface and the CDMA modem. Once the idle pattern is detected, the controller inhibits the transmission of the spread message channel through a message included in the control signal to the CDMA modem. The controller continues to monitor the output D-channel of the line interface until the presence of data information is detected. When data information is detected, the spread message channel is activated. Because the message channel is synchronized to the associated pilot which is not inhibited, the corresponding CDMA modem of the other end of the communication link does not have to require synchronization to the message channel.","XXIX. Drop Out Recovery","The RCS and SU each monitor the CDMA bearer channel signal to evaluate the quality of the CDMA bearer channel connection. Link quality is evaluated using the SPRT process employing adaptive quantile estimation. The SPRT process uses measurements of the received signal power; and if the SPRT process detects that the local spreading code generator has lost synchronization with the received signal spreading code or if it detects the absence or low level of a received signal, the SPRT declares loss of lock (LOL).","When the LOL condition is declared, the receiver modem of each RCS and SU begins a Z-search of the input signal with the local spreading code generator. Z-search is well known in the art of CDMA spreading code acquisition and detection and is described in by Robert E. Ziemer and Roger L. Peterson, at pages 492-94 which is incorporated herein by reference. The Z-search algorithm of the present invention tests groups of eight spreading code phases ahead and behind the last known phase in larger and larger spreading code phase increments.","During the LOL condition detected by the RCS, the RCS continues to transmit to the SU on the assigned channels, and continues to transmit power control signals to the SU to maintain SU transmit power level. The method of transmitting power control signals is described below. Successful reacquisition desirably takes place within a specified period of time. If reacquisition is successful, the call connection continues, otherwise the RCS tears down the call connection by deactivating and deallocating the RCS modem assigned by the WAC, and transmits a call termination signal to a remote call processor, such as the RDU, as described previously.","When the LOL condition is detected by the SU, the SU stops transmission to the RCS on the assigned channels which forces the RCS into a LOL condition, and starts the reacquisition algorithm. If reacquisition is successful, the call connection continues, and if not successful, the RCS tears down the call connection by deactivating and deallocating the SU modem as described previously.","XXX. Power Control","The power control feature of the present invention is used to minimize the amount of transmit power used by an RCS and the SUs of the system, and the power control subfeature that updates transmit power during bearer channel connection is defined as automatic power control (APC). APC data is transferred from the RCS to an SU on the forward APC channel and from an SU to the RCS on the reverse APC channel. When there is no active data link between the two, the maintenance power control (MPC) subfeature updates the SU transmit power.","Transmit power levels of forward and reverse assigned channels and reverse global channels are controlled by the APC algorithm to maintain sufficient signal power to interference noise power ratio (SIR) on those channels, and to stabilize and minimize system output power. The present invention uses a closed loop power control mechanism in which a receiver decides that the transmitter should incrementally raise or lower its transmit power. This decision is conveyed back to the respective transmitter via the power control signal on the APC channel. The receiver makes the decision to increase or decrease the transmitter's power based on two error signals. One error signal is an indication of the difference between the measured and desired despread signal powers, and the other error signal is an indication of the average received total power.","As used in the described embodiment of the invention, the term near-end power control is used to refer to adjusting the transmitter's output power in accordance with the APC signal received on the APC channel from the other end. This means the reverse power control for the SU and forward power control for the RCS; and the term far-end APC is used to refer to forward power control for the SU and reverse power control for the RCS (adjusting the opposite end's transmit power).","In order to conserve power, the SU modem terminates a transmission and powers-down while waiting for a call, defined as the sleep phase. Sleep phase is terminated by an awaken signal from the SU controller. The SU modem acquisition circuit automatically enters the reacquisition phase and begins the process of acquiring the downlink pilot, as described previously.","XXXI. Closed Loop Power Control Algorithms","The near-end power control consists of two steps: first, the initial transmit power is set; and second, the transmit power is continually adjusted according to information received from the far-end using APC.","For the SU, initial transmit power is set to a minimum value and then ramped up, for example, at a rate of 1 dB\/ms until either a ramp-up timer expires (not shown) or the RCS changes the corresponding traffic light value on the FBCH to \u201cred\u201d indicating that the RCS has locked to the SU's short pilot SAXPT. Expiration of the timer causes the SAXPT transmission to be shut down, unless the traffic light value is set to red first, in which case the SU continues to ramp-up transmit power but at a much lower rate than before the \u201cred\u201d signal was detected.","For the RCS, initial transmit power is set at a fixed value, corresponding to the minimum value necessary for reliable operation as determined experimentally for the service type and the current number of system users. Global channels, such as global pilot or, FBCH, are always transmitted at the fixed initial power, whereas traffic channels are switched to APC.","The APC bits are transmitted as one bit up or down signals on the APC channel. In the described embodiment, the 64 kbs APC data stream is not encoded or interleaved. Far-end power control consists of the near-end transmitting power control information for the far-end to use in adjusting its transmit power. The APC algorithm causes the RCS or the SU to transmit +1 if the following inequality holds, otherwise \u22121.\n\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b1>0\u2003\u2003Equation (45)\n\nHere, the error signal eis calculated as:\n\n\u2212(1)\u2003\u2003Equation (46)\n\nwhere Pis the despread signal plus noise power, Pis the despread noise power, and SNRis the desired despread signal to noise ratio for the particular service type; and:\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation (47)\n\nwhere Pr is a measure of the received power and Po is the automatic gain control (AGC) circuit set point. The weights aand ain Equation (45) are chosen for each service type and APC update rate.\n\nXXXII. Maintenance Power Control\n","During the sleep phase of the SU, the interference noise power of the CDMA RF channel may change. The present invention includes a maintenance power control feature (MPC) which periodically adjusts the SU's initial transmit power with respect to the interference noise power of the CDMA channel. The MPC is the process whereby the transmit power level of an SU is maintained within close proximity of the minimum level for the RCS to detect the SU's signal. The MPC process compensates for low frequency changes in the required SU transmit power.","The maintenance control feature uses two global channels: one is called the status channel (STCH) on reverse link, and the other is called the check-up channel (CUCH) on forward link. The signals transmitted on these channels carry no data and they are generated the same way the short codes used in initial power ramp-up are generated. The STCH and CUCH codes are generated from a \u201creserved\u201d branch of the global code generator.","The MPC process is as follows. At random intervals, the SU sends a symbol length spreading code periodically for 3 ms on the status channel (STCH). If the RCS detects the sequence, it replies by sending a symbol length code sequence within the next 3 ms on the check-up channel (CUCH). When the SU detects the response from the RCS, it reduces its transmit power by a particular step size. If the SU does not see any response from the RCS within that 3 ms period, it increases its transmit power by the step size. Using this method, the RCS response is transmitted at a power level that is enough to maintain a 0.99 detection probability at all SU's.","The rate of change of traffic load and the number of active users is related to the total interference noise power of the CDMA channel. The update rate and step size of the maintenance power update signal for the present invention is determined by using queuing theory methods well known in the art of communication theory, such as outlined in \u201c\u201d (Plenum-New York) edited by McDonald and incorporated herein by reference. By modeling the call origination process as an exponential random variable with mean 6.0 mins, numerical computation shows the maintenance power level of a SU should be updated once every 10 seconds or less to be able to follow the changes in interference level using 0.5 dB step size. Modeling the call origination process as a Poisson random variable with exponential interarrival times, arrival rate of 2\u00d710per second per user, service rate of 1\/360 per second, and the total subscriber population is 600 in the RCS service area also yields by numerical computation that an update rate of once every 10 seconds is sufficient when 0.5 dB step size is used.","Maintenance power adjustment is performed periodically by the SU which changes from sleep phase to awake phase and performs the MPC process. Consequently, the process for the MPC feature is shown in FIG.  and is as follows: First, at step , signals are exchanged between the SU and the RCS maintaining a transmit power level that is close to the required level for detection: the SU periodically sends a symbol length spreading code in the STCH and the RCS periodically sends a symbol length spreading code in the CUCH as response.","Next, at step , if the SU receives a response within 3 ms after the STCH message it sent, it decreases its transmit power by a particular step size at step ; but if the SU does not receive a response within 3 ms after the STCH message, it increases its transmit power by the same step size at step .","The SU waits, at step , for a period of time before sending another STCH message, this time period is determined by a random process which averages 10 seconds. Thus, the transmit power of the STCH messages from the SU is adjusted based on the RCS response periodically, and the transmit power of the CUCH messages from the RCS is fixed.","XXXIII. Mapping of Power Control Signal to Logical Channels For APC","Power control signals are mapped to specified logical channels for controlling transmit power levels of forward and reverse assigned channels. Reverse global channels are also controlled by the APC algorithm to maintain sufficient signal power to interference noise power ratio (SIR) on those reverse channels, and to stabilize and minimize system output power. The present invention uses a closed loop power control method in which a receiver periodically decides to incrementally raise or lower the output power of the transmitter at the other end. The method also conveys that decision back to the respective transmitter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0361","num":"0368"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 13"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"APC Signal Channel Assignments"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Link",{},{}]},{"entry":["Channels and","Call\/Connection","Power Control Method"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Signals","Status","Initial Value","Continuous"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Reverse link","being established","as determined by","APC bits in"]},{"entry":["AXCH",{},"power ramping","forward APC"]},{"entry":["AXPT",{},{},"channel"]},{"entry":["Reverse link","in-progress","level established","APC bits in"]},{"entry":["APC, OW,",{},"during call set-up","forward APC"]},{"entry":["TRCH,",{},{},"channel"]},{"entry":"pilot signal"},{"entry":["Forward link","in-progress","fixed value","APC bits in"]},{"entry":["APC, OW,",{},{},"reverse APC"]},{"entry":["TRCH",{},{},"channel"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Forward and reverse links are independently controlled.

APC Parameters","APC information is always conveyed as a single bit of information, and the APC data rate is equivalent to the APC update rate. The APC update rate is 64 kbs. This rate is high enough to accommodate expected Rayleigh and Doppler fades and allow for a relatively high (\u02dc0.2) bit error rate (BER) in the uplink and downlink APC channels, which minimizes capacity devoted to the APC.","The power step up\/down indicated by an APC bit is nominally between 0.1 and 0.01 dB. The dynamic range for power control is 70 dB on the reverse link and 12 dB on the forward link for the exemplary embodiment of the present system.","XXXVIII. An Alternative Embodiment of Multiplexing of APC information","The dedicated APC and OW logical channels described previously can also be multiplexed together in one logical channel. The APC information is transmitted at 64 kbs. continuously whereas the OW information occurs in data bursts. The alternative multiplexed logical channel includes the unencoded, non-interleaved 64 kbs. APC information on, for example, the in-phase channel and the OW information on the quadrature channel of the QPSK signal.","XXXIX. Closed Loop Power Control Implementation","The closed loop power control during a call connection responds to two different variations in overall system power. First, the system responds to local behavior such as changes in power level of an SU, and second, the system responds to changes in the power level of the entire group of active users in the system.","The power control system of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . As shown, the circuitry used to adjust the transmitted power is similar for the RCS (shown as the RCS power control module ) and SU (shown as the SU power control module ). Beginning with the RCS power control module , the reverse link RF channel signal is received at the RF antenna and demodulated to produce the reverse CDMA signal RMCH. The signal RMCH is applied to the variable gain amplifier (VGA)  which produces an input signal to the AGC circuit . The AGC  produces a variable gain amplifier control signal into the VGA. This signal maintains the level of the output signal of VGA at a near constant value. The output signal of VGA is despread by the despread-demultiplexer (demux) , which produces a despread user message signal MS and a forward APC bit. The forward APC bit is applied to the integrator  to produce the forward APC control signal. The forward APC control signal controls the forward link VGA and maintains the forward link RF channel signal at a minimum desired level for communication.","The signal power of the despread user message signal MS of the RCS power module  is measured by the power measurement circuit  to produce a signal power indication. The output of the VGA is also despread by the AUX despreader  which despreads the signal by using an uncorrelated spreading code, and hence obtains a despread noise signal. The power measurement by measure power  of this signal is multiplied at multiplier  by 1 plus the desired signal to noise ratio (SNR) to form the threshold signal S. The difference between the despread signal power and the threshold value S is produced by the subtracter . This difference is the error signal ES, which is an error signal relating to the particular SU transmit power level. Similarly, the control signal for the VGA is applied to the rate scaling circuit  to reduce the rate of the control signal for VGA. The output signal of scaling circuit  is a scaled system power level signal SP. The threshold compute logic  calculates the system signal threshold value SST from the RCS user channel power data signal RCSUSR. The complement of the scaled system power level signal, SP, and the system signal power threshold value SST are applied to the adder  which produces second error signal ES. This error signal is related to the system transmit power level of all active SUs. The input error signals ES and ES are combined in the combiner  produce a combined error signal input to the delta modulator (DM) , and the output signal of the DM is the reverse APC bit stream signal, having bits of value +1 or \u22121, which for the present invention is transmitted as a 64 kbs signal.","The reverse APC bit is applied to the spreading circuit , and the output signal of the spreading circuit  is the spread-spectrum forward APC message signal. Forward OW and traffic signals are also provided to spreading circuits , , producing forward traffic message signals 1, 2, . . . N. The power level of the forward APC signal, the forward OW, and traffic message signals are adjusted by the respective amplifiers ,  and  to produce the power level adjusted forward APC, OW and TRCH channels signals. These signals are combined by the adder  and applied to the VGA, which produces forward link RF channel signal.","The forward link RF channel signal including the spread forward APC signal is received by the RF antenna of the SU, and demodulated to produce the forward CDMA signal FMCH. This signal is provided to the variable gain amplifier (VGA) . The output signal of VGA is applied to the AGC  which produces a variable gain amplifier control signal to VGA. This signal maintains the level of the output signal of VGA at a near constant level. The output signal of VGA is despread by the despread demux , which produces a despread user message signal SUTMS and a reverse APC bit. The reverse APC bit is applied to the integrator  which produces the reverse APC control signal. This reverse APC control signal is provided to the reverse APC VGA to maintain the reverse link RF channel signal at a minimum power level.","The despread user message signal SUMS is also applied to the power measurement circuit  producing a power measurement signal, which is added to the complement of threshold value S in the adder  to produce error signal ES. The signal ES is an error signal relating to the RCS transmit power level for the particular SU. To obtain threshold S, the despread noise power as measured by measure power  indication from the AUX despreader  is multiplied using multiplier  by 1 plus the desired signal to noise ratio SNR. The AUX despreader  despreads the input data using an uncorrelated spreading code, hence its output is an indication of the despread noise power. Similarly, the control signal for the VGA is applied to the rate scaling circuit to reduce the rate of the control signal for VGA in order to produce a scaled received power level RP. The threshold compute circuit  computes the received signal threshold RST from the SU measured power signal SUUSR. The complement of the scaled received power level RP and the received signal threshold RST are applied to the adder  which produces error signal ES. This error is related to the RCS transmit power to all other SUs. The input error signals ES and ES are combined in the combiner  and input to the delta modulator DM. The output signal of DM is the forward A-PC bit stream signal, with bits having value of value +1 or \u22121. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, this signal is transmitted as a 64kbs signal.","The forward APC bit stream signal is applied to the spreading circuit , to produce the output reverse spread-spectrum APC signal. Reverse OW and traffic signals are also input to spreading circuits , , producing reverse OW and traffic message signals 1, 2, . . . N, and the reverse pilot is generated by the reverse pilot generator . The power level of the reverse APC message signal, reverse OW message signal, reverse pilot, and the reverse traffic message signals are adjusted by amplifiers , , ,  to produce the signals which are combined by the adder  and input to the reverse APC VGA. It is this VGA which produces the reverse link RF channel signal.","During the call connection and bearer channel establishment process, the closed loop power control of the present invention is modified, and is shown in FIG. . As shown, the circuits used to adjust the transmitted power are different for the RCS, shown as the initial RCS power control module ; and for the SU, shown as the initial SU power control module . Beginning with the initial RCS power control module , the reverse link RF channel signal is received at the RF antenna and demodulated producing the reverse CDMA signal IRMCH which is received by the first variable gain amplifier (VGA) . The output signal of VGA is detected by the AGC circuit (AGC)  which provides a variable gain amplifier control signal to VGA to maintain the level of the output signal of VAG at a near constant value. The output signal of VGA is despread by the despread demultiplexer , which produces a despread user message signal IMS. The forward APC control signal, ISET, is set to a fixed value, and is applied to the forward link variable gain amplifier (VGA)  to set the forward link RF channel signal at a predetermined level.","The signal power of the despread user message signal IMS of the Initial RCS power module  is measured by the power measure circuit , and the output power measurement is subtracted from a threshold value S in the subtracter  to produce error signal ES, which is an error signal relating to the transmit power level of a particular SU. The threshold S is calculated by multiplying using a multiplier  the despread power measurement by measure power  obtained from the AUX despreader  by 1 plus the desired signal to noise ratio SNR. The AUX despreader  despreads the signal using an uncorrelated spreading code, hence its output signal is an indication of despread noise power. Similarly, the VGA control signal is applied to the rate scaling circuit  to reduce the rate of the VGA control signal in order to produce a scaled system power level signal SP. The threshold computation logic  determines an initial system signal threshold value (ISST) computed from the user channel power data signal (IRCSUSR). The complement of the scaled system power level signal SP and the ISST are provided to the adder  which produces a second error signal ES, which is an error signal relating to the system transmit power level of all active SUs. The value of ISST is the desired transmit power for a system having the particular configuration. The input error signals ES and ES are combined in the combiner  produce a combined error signal input to the delta modulator (DM) . DM produces the initial reverse APC bit stream signal, having bits of value +1 or \u22121, which in the exemplary embodiment is transmitted as a 64 kbs signal.","The reverse APC bit stream signal is applied to the spreading circuit , to produce the initial spread-spectrum forward APC signal. The CTCH information is spread by the spreader  to form the spread CTCH message signal. The spread APC and CTCH signals are scaled by the amplifiers  and , and combined by the combiner . The combined signal is applied to VAG, which produces the forward link RF channel signal.","The forward link RF channel signal including the spread forward APC signal is received by the RF antenna of the SU and demodulated to produce the initial forward CDMA signal (IFMCH) which is applied to the variable gain amplifier (VGA) . The output signal of VGA is detected by the AGC circuit (AGC)  which produces a variable gain amplifier control signal for the VGA. This signal maintains the output power level of the VGA at a near constant value. The output signal of VAG is despread by the despread demultiplexer , which produces an initial reverse APC bit that is dependent on the output level of VGA. The reverse APC bit is processed by the integrator  to produce the reverse APC control signal. The reverse APC control signal is provided to the reverse APC VGA to maintain the reverse link RF channel signal at a defined power level.","The global channel AXCH signal is spread by the spreading circuits  to provide the spread AXCH channel signal. The reverse pilot generator  provides a reverse pilot signal, and the signal power of AXCH and the reverse pilot signal are adjusted by the respective amplifiers  and . The spread AXCH channel signal and the reverse pilot signal are summed by the adder  to produce reverse link CDMA signal. The reverse link CDMA signal is received by the reverse APC VGA, which produces the reverse link RF channel signal output to the RF transmitter.","XXXX. System Capacity Management","The system capacity management algorithm of the present invention optimizes the maximum user capacity for an RCS area, called a cell. When the SU comes within a certain value of maximum transmit power, the SU sends an alarm message to the RCS. The RCS sets the traffic lights which control access to the system, to \u201cred\u201d which, as previously described, is a flag that inhibits access by the SU's. This condition remains in effect until the call to the alarming SU terminates, or until the transmit power of the alarming SU, measured at the SU, is a value less than the maximum transmit power. When multiple SUs send alarm messages, the condition remains in effect until either all calls from alarming SUs terminate or until the transmit power of the alarming SU, measured at the SU, is less than the maximum transmit power. An alternative embodiment monitors the bit error rate measurements from the FEC decoder, and holds the RCS traffic lights at \u201cred\u201d until the bit error rate is less than a predetermined value.","The blocking strategy of the present invention includes a method which uses the power control information transmitted from the RCS to an SU, and the received power measurements at the RCS. The RCS measures its transmit power level, detects that a maximum value is reached and determines when to block new users. An SU preparing to enter the system blocks itself if the SU reaches the maximum transmit power before successful completion of a bearer channel assignment.","Each additional user in the system has the effect of increasing the noise level for all other users, which decreases the signal to noise ratio (SNR) that each user experiences. The power control algorithm maintains a desired SNR for each user. Therefore, in the absence of any other limitations, addition of a new user into the system has only a transient effect and the desired SNR is regained.","The transmit power measurement at the RCS is done by measuring either the root mean square (rms) value of the baseband combined signal or by measuring the transmit power of the RF signal and feeding it back to digital control circuits. The transmit power measurement may also be made by the SUs to determine if the unit has reached its maximum transmit power. The SU transmit power level is determined by measuring the control signal of the RF amplifier, and scaling the value based on the service type, such as POTS, FAX, or ISDN.","The information that an SU has reached the maximum power is transmitted to the RCS by the SU in a message on the assigned channels. The RCS also determines the condition by measuring reverse APC changes because, if the RCS sends APC messages to the SU to increase SU transmit power, and the SU transmit power measured at the RCS is not increased, the SU has reached the maximum transmit power.","The RCS does not use traffic lights to block new users who have finished ramping-up using the short codes. These users are blocked by denying them the dial tone and letting them time out. The RCS sends all 1's (go down commands) on the APC channel to make the SU lower its transmit power. The RCS also sends either no CTCH message or a message with an invalid address which would force the FSU to abandon the access procedure and start over. The SU, however, does not start the acquisition process immediately because the traffic lights are red.","When the RCS reaches its transmit power limit, it enforces blocking in the same manner as when an SU reaches its transmit power limit. The RCS turns off all the traffic lights on the FBCH, starts sending all 1 APC bits (go down commands) to those users who have completed their short code ramp-up but have not yet been given a dial tone, and either sends no CTCH message to these users or sends messages with invalid addresses to force them to abandon the access process.","The self blocking process of the SU is as follows. When the SU starts transmitting the AXCH, the APC starts its power control operation using the AXCH and the SU transmit power increases. While the transmit power is increasing under the control of the APC it is monitored by the SU controller. If the transmit power limit is reached, the SU abandons the access procedure and starts over.","XXXXI. System Synchronization","The RCS is synchronized either to the PSTN network clock signal through one of the line interfaces, as shown in  or to the RCS system clock oscillator, which free-runs to provide a master timing signal for the system. The global pilot channel, and therefore all logical channels within the CDMA channel, are synchronized to the system clock signal of the RCS. The global pilot (GLPT) is transmitted by the RCS and defines the timing at the RCS transmitter.","The SU receiver is synchronized to the GLPT, and so behaves as a slave to the network clock oscillator. However, the SU timing is retarded by the propagation delay. In the present embodiment of the invention, the SU modem extracts a 64 KHz and 8 KHz clock signal from the CDMA RF receive channel, and a PLL oscillator circuit creates 2 MHz and 4 MHz clock signals","The SU transmitter and hence the LAXPT or ASPT are slaved to the timing of the SU receiver. The RCS receiver is synchronized to the LAXPT or the ASPT transmitted by the SU, however, its timing may be retarded by the propagation delay. Hence, the timing of the RCS receiver is that of the RCS transmitter retarded by twice the propagation delay.","Furthermore, the system can be synchronized via a reference received from a GPS receiver. In a system of this type, a GPS receiver in each RCS provides a reference clock signal to all submodules of the RCS. Because each RCS receives the same time reference from the GPS, all of the system clock signals in all of the RCSs are synchronized.","The present invention also performs multichannel filtering. Details of this technique can be found in Section XXXXVI hereinafter entitled \u201cEfficient Multichannel Filtering For CDMC Modems\u201d.","XXXXII. A Method Of Controlling Initial Power Ramp-up In CDMA Systems By Using Short Codes","The use of the same frequency spectrum by a plurality of SUs increases the efficiency of a CDMA communication system. However, it also causes a gradual degradation of the performance of the system as the number of SUs increase. Each SU detects communication signals with its unique spreading code as valid signals and all other signals are viewed as noise. The stronger the signal from an SU arrives at the BS, the more interference the BS experiences when receiving and demodulating signals from other SUs. Ultimately, the power from one SU may be great enough to terminate communications of other SUs. Accordingly, it is extremely important in wireless CDMA communication systems to control the transmission power of all SUs. The control of transmission power is particularly critical when an SU is attempting to initiate communications with a BS and a power control loop has not yet been established. Typically, the transmission power required from an SU changes continuously as a function of the propagation loss, interference from other SUs, channel noise, fading and other channel characteristics. Therefore, an SU does not know the power level at which it should start transmitting. If the SU begins transmitting at a power level that is too high, it may interfere with the communications of other SUs and may even terminate the communications of other SUs. If the initial transmission power level is too low, the SU will not be detected by the BS and a communication link will not be established.","The present invention comprises a novel method of controlling transmission power during the establishment of a channel in a CDMA communication system by utilizing the transmission of a short code from an SU to a BS during initial power ramp-up. The short code is a sequence for detection by the BS which has a much shorter period than a conventional spreading code. The ramp-up starts from a power level that is guaranteed to be lower than the required power level for detection by the BS. The SU quickly increases transmission power while repeatedly transmitting the short code until the signal is detected by the BS. Once the BS detects the short code, it sends an indication to the SU to cease increasing transmission power. The use of short codes limits power overshoot and interference to other SUs and permits the BS to quickly synchronize to the spreading code used by the SU.","A communication network  in one embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . The communication network  generally comprises one or more BSs , each of which is in wireless communication with a plurality of SUs , which may be fixed or mobile. Each SU  communicates with either the closest BS  or the BS  which provides the strongest communication signal. The BSs  also communicate with a base station controller , which coordinates communications among base stations . The communication network  may also be connected to a local exchange (LE) , wherein the base station controller  also coordinates communications between the BSs  and the LE . Preferably, each BS  communicates with the base station controller  over a wireless link, although a land line may also be provided. A land line is particularly applicable when a BS  is in close proximity to the base station controller .","The base station controller  performs several functions. Primarily, the base station controller  provides all of the operations, administrative and maintenance (OA&M) signaling associated with establishing and maintaining all of the wireless communications between the SUs , the BSs  and the base station controller . The base station controller  also provides an interface between the wireless communication system  and the LE . This interface includes multiplexing and demultiplexing of the communication signals that enter and leave the system  via the base station controller . Although the wireless communication system  is shown employing antennas to transmit RF signals, one skilled in the art should recognize that communications may be accomplished via microwave or satellite uplinks. Additionally, the functions of the base station controller  may be combined with a BS  to form a \u201cmaster base station\u201d.","Referring to , the propagation of signals between a BS  and a plurality of SUs  is shown. A two-way communication channel (link)  comprises a signal transmitted  (Tx) from the BS  to the SU  and a signal received  (Rx) by the BS  from the SU . The Tx signal  is transmitted from the BS  and is received by the SU  after a propagation delay \u0394t. Similarly, the Rx signal originates at the SU  and terminates at the BS  after a further propagation delay \u0394t. Accordingly, the round trip propagation delay is 2\u0394t. In the preferred embodiment, the BS  has an operating range of approximately 30 kilometers. The round trip propagation delay  associated with an SU  at the maximum operating range is 200 microseconds.","It should be apparent to those of skill in the art that the establishment of a communication channel between a BS and an SU is a complex procedure as herinbefore described involving many tasks performed by the BS and the SU which are outside the scope of the present invention. This aspect of present invention is directed to initial power ramp-up and synchronization during the establishment of a communication channel.","Referring to , the signaling between a BS  and an SU  is shown. In accordance with the present invention, the BS  continuously transmits a pilot code  to all of the SUs  located within the transmitting range of the base station . The SU  must acquire the pilot code  transmitted by the BS  before it can receive or transmit any data. Acquisition is the process whereby the SU  aligns its locally generated spreading code with the received pilot code . The SU  searches through all of the possible phases of the received pilot code  until it detects the correct phase, (the beginning of the pilot code ).","The SU  then synchronizes its transmit spreading code to the received pilot code  by aligning the beginning of its transmit spreading code to the beginning of the pilot code . One implication of this receive and transmit synchronization is that the SU  introduces no additional delay as far as the phase of the spreading codes are concerned. Accordingly, as shown in , the relative delay between the pilot code  transmitted from the base station  and the SU's transmit spreading code  received at the BS  is 2\u0394t, which is solely due to the round trip propagation delay.","In the preferred embodiment, the pilot code is 29,877,120 chips in length and takes approximately 2 to 5 seconds to transmit, depending on the spreading factor. The length of the pilot code  was chosen to be a multiple of the data symbol no matter what kind of data rate or bandwidth is used. As is well known by those of skill in the art, a longer pilot code  has better randomness properties and the frequency response of the pilot code  is more uniform. Additionally, a longer pilot code  provides low channel cross correlation, thus increasing the capacity of the system  to support more SUs  with less interference. The use-of a long pilot code  also supports a greater number of random short codes. For synchronization purposes, the pilot code  is chosen to have the same period as all of the other spreading codes used by the system . Thus, once a SU  acquires the pilot code , it is synchronized to all other signals transmitted from the BS .","During idle periods, when a call is not in progress or pending, the SU  remains synchronized to the BS  by periodically reacquiring the pilot code . This is necessary for the SU  to receive and demodulate any downlink transmissions, in particular paging messages which indicate incoming calls.","When a communication link is desired, the BS  must acquire the signal transmitted from the SU  before it can demodulate the data. The SU  must transmit an uplink signal for acquisition by the BS  to begin establishing the two-way communication link. A critical parameter in this procedure is the transmission power level of the SU . A transmission power level that is too high can impair communications in the whole service area, whereas a transmission power level that is too low can prevent the BS  from detecting the uplink signal.","The SU  starts transmitting at a power level guaranteed to be lower than what is required and increases transmission power output until the correct power level is achieved. This avoids sudden introduction of a strong interference, hence improving system  capacity.","The establishment of a communication channel in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention and the tasks performed by the BS  and an SU  are shown in FIG. . Although many SUs  may be located within the operating range of the BS , reference will be made hereinafter to a single SU  for simplicity in explaining the operation of the present invention. Additionally, although the terminology \u201caccess code\u201d is used herein as referring to the spreading code used with the \u201caccess signal\u201d, access code and access signal may be used interchangeably. Finally, the terminology \u201cconfirmation signal\u201d and \u201cacknowledgement signal\u201d may also be used interchangeably.","The BS  begins by continuously transmitting a periodic pilot code  to all SUs  located within the operating range of the BS  (step ). As the BS  transmits the pilot code  (step ), the BS  searches (step ) for an \u201caccess code\u201d  transmitted by an SU . The access code  is a known spreading code transmitted from an SU  to the BS  during initiation of communications and power ramp-up. The BS  must search through all possible phases (time shifts) of the access code  transmitted from the SU  in order to find the correct phase. This is called the \u201cacquisition\u201d or the \u201cdetection\u201d process (step ). The longer the access code , the longer it takes for the BS  to search through the phases and acquire the correct phase.","As previously explained, the relative delay between signals transmitted from the BS  and return signals received at the BS  corresponds to the round trip propagation delay 2\u0394t. The maximum delay occurs at the maximum operating range of the BS , known as the cell boundary. Accordingly, the BS  must search up to as many code phases as there are in the maximum round trip propagation delay, which is typically less code phases than there are in a code period.","For a data rate Rb and spreading code rate Rc, the ratio L =Rc\/Rb is called the spreading factor or the processing gain. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cell boundary radius is 30 km, which corresponds to approximately between 1000 and 2500 code phases in the maximum round trip delay, depending on the processing gain.","If the BS  has not detected the access code after searching through the code phases corresponding to the maximum round trip delay, the search is repeated starting from the phase of the pilot code  which corresponds to zero delay (step ).","During idle periods, the pilot code  from the BS  is received at the subscriber unit  which periodically synchronizes its transmit spreading code generator thereto (step ). If synchronization with the pilot code  is lost, the SU  reacquires the pilot code  and resynchronizes (step ).","When it is desired to initiate a communication link, the SU  starts transmitting the access code  back to the BS  (step ). The SU  continuously increases the transmission power while retransmitting the access code  (step ) until it receives an acknowledgment from the BS . The BS  detects the access code  at the correct phase once the minimum power level for reception has been achieved (step ). The BS  subsequently transmits an access code detection acknowledgment signal (step ) to the SU . Upon receiving the acknowledgment, the SU ceases the transmission power increase (step ). With the power ramp-up completed, closed loop power control and call setup signaling is performed (step ) to establish the two-way communication link.","Although this embodiment limits SU  transmission power, acquisition of the subscriber unit  by the BS  in this manner may lead to unnecessary power overshoot from the SU , thereby reducing the performance of the system .","The transmission power output profile of the SU  is shown in FIG. . At t, the SU  starts transmitting at the starting transmission power level P, which is a power level guaranteed to be less than the power level required for detection by the BS . The SU  continually increases the transmission power level until it receives the detection indication from the BS . For the BS  to properly detect the access code  from the SU  the access code  must: 1) be received at a sufficient power level; and 2) be detected at the proper phase. Accordingly, referring to , although the access code  is at a sufficient power level for detection by the BS  at t, the BS  must continue searching for the correct phase of the access code  which occurs at t.","Since the SU  continues to increase the output transmission power level until it receives the detection indication from the BS , the transmission power of the access code  exceeds the power level required for detection by the BS . This causes unnecessary interference to all other SUs . If the power overshoot is too large, the interference to other SUs  may be so severe as to terminate ongoing communications of other SUs .","The rate that the SU  increases transmission power to avoid overshoot may be reduced, however, this results in a longer call setup time. Those of skill in the art would appreciate that adaptive ramp-up rates can also be used, yet these rates have shortcomings and will not appreciably eliminate power overshoot in all situations.","This embodiment of the present invention utilizes \u201cshort codes\u201d and a two-stage communication link establishment procedure to achieve fast power ramp-up without large power overshoots. The spreading code transmitted by the SU  is much shorter than the rest of the spreading codes (hence the term short code), so that the number of phases is limited and the BS  can quickly search through the code. The short code used for this purpose carries no data.","The tasks performed by the BS  and the SU  to establish a communication channel using short codes in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention are shown in . During idle periods, the BS  periodically and continuously transmits the pilot code to all SUs  located within the operating range of the BS  (step ). The BS  also continuously searches for a short code transmitted by the SU  (step ). The SU  acquires the pilot code and synchronizes its transmit spreading code generator to the pilot code. The SU  also periodically checks to ensure it is synchronized. If synchronization is lost, the SU  reacquires the pilot signal transmitted by the BS (step ).","When a communication link is desired, the SU  starts transmitting a short code at the minimum power level P(step ) and continuously increases the transmission power level while retransmitting the short code (step ) until it receives an acknowledgment from the BS  that the short code has been detected by the BS .","The access code in the preferred embodiment, as previously described herein, is approximately 30 million chips in length. However, the short code is much smaller. The short code can be chosen to be any length that is sufficiently short to permit quick detection. There is an advantage in choosing a short code length such that it divides the access code period evenly. For the access code described herein, the short code is preferably chosen to be 32, 64 or 128 chips in length. Alternatively, the short code may be as short as one symbol length, as will be described in detail hereinafter.","Since the start of the short code and the start of the access code are synchronized, once the BS  acquires the short code, the BS  knows that the corresponding phase of the access code is an integer multiple of N chips from the phase of the short code where N is the length of the short code. Accordingly, the BS  does not have to search all possible phases corresponding to the maximum round trip propagation delay.","Using the short code, the correct phase for detection by the BS  occurs much more frequently. When the minimum power level for reception has been achieved, the short code is quickly detected (step ) and the transmission power overshoot is limited. The transmission power ramp-up rate may be significantly increased without concern for a large power overshoot. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the power ramp-up rate using the short code is 1 dB per millisecond.","The BS  subsequently transmits a short code detection indication signal (step ) to the SU  which enters the second stage of the power ramp-up upon receiving this indication. In this stage, the SU  ceases transmitting the short code (step ) and starts continuously transmitting a periodic access code (step ). The SU  continues to ramp-up its transmission power while transmitting the access code, however the ramp-up rate is now much lower than the previous ramp-up rate used with the short code (step ). The ramp-up rate with the access code is preferably 0.05 dB per millisecond. The slow ramp-up avoids losing synchronization with the base station  due to small changes in channel propagation characteristics.","At this point, the BS  has detected the short code at the proper phase and power level (step ). The BS  must now synchronize to the access code which is the same length as all other spreading codes and much longer than the short code. Utilizing the short code, the BS  is able to detect the proper phase of the access code much more quickly. The BS  begins searching for the proper phase of the access code (step ). However, since the start of the access code is synchronized with the start of the short code, the BS  is only required to search every N chips; where N=the length of the short code. In summary, the BS  quickly acquires the access code of the proper phase and power level by: 1) detecting the short code; and 2) determining the proper phase of the access code by searching every N chips of the access code from the beginning of the short code.","If the proper phase of the access code has not been detected after searching the number of phases in the maximum round trip delay the BS  restarts the search for the access code by searching every chip instead of every N chips (step ). When the proper phase of the access code has been detected (step ) the BS  transmits an access code detection acknowledgment (step ) to the SU  which ceases the transmission power increase (step ) upon receiving this acknowledgment. With the power ramp-up completed, closed loop power control and call setup signaling is performed (step ) to establish the two-way communication link.","Referring to , although the starting power level Pis the same as in the prior embodiment, the SU  may ramp-up the transmission power level at a much higher rate by using a short code. The short code is quickly detected after the transmission power level surpasses the minimum detection level, thus minimizing the amount of transmission power overshoot.","Although the same short code may be reused by the SU , in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the short codes are dynamically selected and updated in accordance with the following procedure. Referring to , the period of the short code is equal to one symbol length and the start of each period is aligned with a symbol boundary. The short codes are generated from a regular length spreading code. A symbol length portion from the beginning of the spreading code is stored and used as the short code for the next 3 milliseconds. Every 3 milliseconds, a new symbol length portion of the spreading code replaces the old short code. Since the spreading code period is an integer multiple of 3 milliseconds, the same short codes are repeated once every period of the spreading code.","A block diagram of the BS  is shown in FIG. . Briefly described, the BS  comprises a receiver section , a transmitter section  and a diplexer . An RF receiver  receives and down-converts the RF signal received from the diplexer . The receive spreading code generator  outputs a spreading code to both the data receiver  and the code detector . In the data receiver , the spreading code is correlated with the baseband signal to extract the data signal which is forwarded for further processing. The received baseband signal is also forwarded to the code detector  which detects the access code or the short code from the SU  and adjusts the timing of the spreading code generator  to establish a communication channel .","In the transmitter section  of the BS , the transmit spreading code generator  outputs a spreading code to the data transmitter  and the pilot code transmitter . The pilot code transmitter  continuously transmits the periodic pilot code. The data transmitter  transmits the short code detect indication and access code detect acknowledgment after the code detector  has detected the short code or the access code respectively. The data transmitter also sends other message and data signals. The signals from the data transmitter  and the pilot code transmitter  are combined and up-converted by the RF transmitter  for transmission to the SUs .","A block diagram of the SU  is shown in FIG. . Briefly described, the SU  comprises a receiver section , a transmitter section  and a diplexer . An RF receiver  receives and down-converts the RF signal received from the diplexer . A pilot code detector  correlates the spreading code with the baseband signal to acquire the pilot code transmitted by the BS . In this manner, the pilot code detector  maintains synchronization with the pilot code. The receiver spreading code generator  generates and outputs a spreading code to the data receiver  and the pilot code detector . The data receiver  correlates the spreading code with the baseband signal to process the short code detect indication and the access code detect acknowledgment transmitted by the BS .","The transmitter section  comprises a spreading code generator  which generates and outputs spreading codes to a data transmitter  and a short code and access code transmitter . The short code and access code transmitter  transmits these codes at different stages of the power ramp-up procedure as hereinbefore described. The signals output by the data transmitter  and the short code and access code transmitter  are combined and up-converted by the RF transmitter  for transmission to the BS . The timing of the receiver spreading code generator  is adjusted by the pilot code detector  through the acquisition process. The receiver and transmitter spreading code generators ,  are also synchronized.","An overview of the ramp-up procedure in accordance with this embodiment of the invention is summarized in . The BS  transmits a pilot code while searching for the short code (step ). The SU  acquires the pilot code transmitted from the BS  (step ), starts transmitting a short code starting at a minimum power level Pwhich is guaranteed to be less than the required power, and quickly increases transmission power (step ). Once the received power level at the BS  reaches the minimum level needed for detection of the short code (step ) the BS  acquires the correct phase of the short code, transmits an indication of this detection, and begins searching for the access code (step ). Upon receiving the detection indication, the SU  ceases transmitting the short code and starts transmitting an access code. The SU  initiates a slow ramp-up of transmit power while sending the access code (step ). The BS  searches for the correct phase of the access code by searching only one phase out of each short code length portion of the access code (step ). If the BS  searches the phases of the access code up to the maximum round trip delay and has not detected the correct phase, the search is repeated by searching every phase (step ). Upon detection of the correct phase of the access code by the BS , the BS  sends an acknowledgment to the SU  (step ). Reception of the acknowledgment by the SU  concludes the ramp-up process. A closed loop power control is established, and the SU  continues the call setup process by sending related call setup messages (step ).","XXXXIII. Virtual Locating Of A Fixed SU To Reduce Re-Acquisition Time","A typical CDMA communication system is shown in FIG. . The system comprises a BS and a plurality of fixed subscriber units SU-SUlocated at various distances from the BS. The BS constantly transmits a forward pilot signal. The SUs maintain epoch alignment between the forward pilot signal and their internal PN code generator such that all signals transmitted from an SU are at the same PN code phase at which the forward pilot is received. The BS receives signals from SUs with a code phase difference between its forward pilot signal and the received signal corresponding to the two-way signal propagation delay between the BS and the SU.","For the BS to detect a signal, it must align the phase of its receive PN code generator to the phase of the received signal, thus \u201cacquiring\u201d the signal. The BS can receive an access signal with any code phase difference within the range of the cell. Therefore, the BS must test all code phases associated with the range of possible propagation delays of the cell to acquire the access signal.","Once a communication channel is established between the BS and the SU, the transmission power of the SU is controlled by a closed loop APC algorithm which prevents the power from each SU from excessively interfering with other SUs. During channel establishment, before the closed loop power control begins, an SU's transmission power is kept to a minimum by ramping-up from a low level and establishing the channel without the SU significantly overshooting (on the order of less than 3 dB) the minimum power necessary to operate the channel.","To establish a channel, each SU transmits an access signal for detection by the BS. The BS acquires the access signal and transmits a confirmation signal to each SU. The time required for the BS to acquire the access signal contributes directly to the time elapsed between a SU going \u201coff-hook\u201d, establishing a communication channel, connecting to the LE and receiving a dial tone. It is desirable to receive a dial tone within 150 msec of detection of \u201coff-hook\u201d.","The time distribution of acquisition opportunities is shown in  for a typical prior art SU located 20 km from a BS in a 30 km cell. For a BS which tests 8 code phases simultaneously at a PN rate of 12.48 MHz and a symbol rate of 64,000 symbols per second and takes an average of 7.5 symbol periods to accept or reject a particular group of code phases, the average time to test all code phase delays within the cell is approximately 37 msec, and any one SU can only be detected during an approximately 100 \u03bcsec window during that period. Assuming that the selection of initial SU transmission power level is 15-20 dB below the proper level and a slow ramp-up rate of between 0.05 and 0.1 dB\/msec, it could take 4-5 such 37 msec time periods, (or an average of approximately 200 msec,) for the BS to acquire a SU. This introduces an unacceptable delay in the channel establishment process which should be less than 150 msec. Accordingly, there is a need to reduce the amount of time required for a BS to acquire an SU.","The present invention includes a method of reducing the re-acquisition time of a fixed SU by a BS in a CDMA communication system by utilizing virtual locating of the SU. A BS acquires SUs by searching only those code phases concomitant with the largest propagation delay possible in the cell, as if all SUs were located at the periphery of the cell. An SU which has never been acquired by the BS varies the delay between the PN code phase of its received and transmitted signals over the range of possible delays in a cell and slowly ramps-up its transmission power until it is acquired by the BS. Upon initial acquisition by the BS the SU ceases ramping-up its power and varying the delay and internally stores the final value of the delay in memory. For subsequent re-acquisition, the SU adds the delay value between the PN code phase of its received and transmitted signals, making the subscriber virtually appear to be at the periphery of the cell. This permits a quick ramp-up of transmission power by the SU and reduced acquisition time by the BS.","Referring to , the propagation of certain signals in the establishment of a communication channel  between a BS  and a plurality of SUs  is shown. The forward pilot signal  is transmitted from the BS  at time t, and is received by a SU  after a propagation delay \u0394t. To be acquired by the BS  the SU  transmits an access signal  which is received by the BS  after a further propagation delay of \u0394t. Accordingly, the round trip propagation delay is 2\u0394t. The access signal  is transmitted epoch aligned to the forward pilot signal , which means that the code phase of the access signal  when transmitted is identical to the code phase of the received forward pilot signal .","The round trip propagation delay depends upon the location of an SU  with respect to the BS . Communication signals transmitted between a SU  located closer to the BS  will experience a shorter propagation delay than an SU  located further from the BS . Since the BS  must be able to acquire SUs  located at any position within the cell , the BS  must search all code phases of the access signal corresponding to the entire range of propagation delays of the cell .","It should be apparent to those of skill in the art that the establishment of a communication channel between a BS  and an SU  is a complex procedure involving many tasks performed by the BS  and the SU  which are outside the scope of the present invention. The present invention is directed to decreasing the reacquisition time of a fixed SU  by a BS  during the re-establishment of a communication channel.","Referring to , the tasks associated with initial acquisition of an SU  by a BS  in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention are shown. When an SU  desires the establishment of a channel  with a BS  with which it has never established a channel, the SU  has no knowledge of the two-way propagation delay. Accordingly, the SU  enters the initial acquisition channel establishment process.","The SU  selects a low initial power level and zero code phase delay, (epoch aligning the code phase of the transmitted access signal  to the code phase of the received forward pilot signal ), and commences transmitting the access signal  while slowly (0.05-0.1 dB\/msec) ramping-up transmission power (step ). While the SU  is awaiting receipt of the acknowledgement signal from the BS , it varies the code phase delay in predetermined steps from zero to the delay corresponding to the periphery of the cell , (the maximum code phase delay), allowing sufficient time between steps for the BS  to detect the access signal  (step ). If the SU  reaches the code phase delay corresponding to the periphery of the cell , it repeats the process of varying the code phase delay while continuing the slow power ramp-up (step ).","In order to acquire SUs  desiring access, the BS  continuously transmits a forward pilot signal  and attempts to detect the access signals  from SUs  (step ). Rather than test for access signals  at all code phase delays within the cell  as with current systems, the BS  need only test code phase delays centered about the periphery of the cell .","The BS  detects the access signal  (step ) when the SU  begins transmitting with sufficient power at the code phase delay which makes the SU  appear to be at the periphery of the cell , thereby \u201cvirtually\u201d locating the SU  at the periphery of the cell . The BS  then transmits an acknowledgement to the SU  which confirms that the access signal  has been received (step ) and continues with the channel establishment process (step ).","Once the SU  receives the acknowledgement signal (step ), it ceases the ramp-up of transmission power, ceases varying the code phase delay (step ) and records the value of the code phase delay for subsequent re-acquisitions (step ). The SU  then continues the channel establishment process including closed-loop power transmission control (step ).","On subsequent re-acquisitions when an SU  desires the establishment of a channel  with a BS , the SU  enters the re-acquisition channel establishment process shown in FIG. . The SU  selects a low initial power level and the code phase delay recorded during the initial acquisition process, (shown in FIG. ), and commences continuously transmitting the access signal  while quickly (1 dB\/msec) ramping-up transmission power (step ). While the SU  is awaiting receipt of the acknowledgement signal from the BS , it slightly varies the code phase delay of the access signal  about the recorded code phase delay, allowing sufficient time for the BS  to detect the access signal  before changing the delay (step ). The BS  as in , transmits a forward pilot signal  and tests only the code phase delays at the periphery of the cell  in attempting to acquire the SUs  within its operating range (step ). The BS  detects the access signal  when the SU  transmits with sufficient power at the code phase delay which makes the SU  appear to be at the periphery of the cell  (step ). The BS  transmits an acknowledgement to the SU  which confirms that the access signal  has been received (step ) and continues with the channel establishment process (step ).","When the SU  receives the acknowledgement signal (step ) it ceases power ramp-up, ceases varying the code phase delay (step ) and records the present value of the code phase delay for subsequent re-acquisitions (step ). This code phase delay may be slightly different from the code phase delay initially used when starting the re-acquisitions process (step ). The SU  then continues the channel establishment process at the present power level (step ). If an SU  has not received an acknowledgement signal from the BS  after a predetermined time, the SU  reverts to the initial acquisition process described in FIG. .","The effect of introducing a code phase delay in the Tx  and Rx  communications between the BS  and an SU  will be explained with reference to . Referring to , a BS  communicates with two SUs , . The first SU  is located 30 km from the BS  at the maximum operating range. The second SU  is located 15 km from the BS . The propagation delay of Tx and Rx communications between the first SU  and the BS  will be twice that of communications between the second SU  and the BS .","Referring to , after an added delay value  is introduced into the Tx PN generator of the second SU  the propagation delay of communications between the first SU  and the BS  will be the same as the propagation delay of communications between the second SU  and the BS . Viewed from the BS , it appears as though the second SU  is located at the virtual range \u2032.","Referring to , it can be seen that when a plurality of SUs SU-SUare virtually relocated SU-SUto the virtual range , the BS must only test the code phase delays centered about the virtual range .","Utilizing the present invention, an SU  which has achieved a sufficient power level will be acquired by the BS  in approximately 2 msec. Due to the shorter acquisition time, the SU  can ramp-up at a much faster rate, (on the order of 1 dB\/msec), without significantly overshooting the desired power level. Assuming the same 20 dB power back-off, it would take the SU  approximately 20 msec to reach the sufficient power level for detection by the BS . Accordingly, the entire duration of the re-acquisition process of the present invention is approximately 22 msec, which is an order of magnitude reduction from prior art reacquisition methods.","An SU  made in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . The SU  includes a receiver section  and a transmitter section . An antenna  receives a signal from the BS , which is filtered by a band-pass filter  having a bandwidth equal to twice the chip rate and a center frequency equal to the center frequency of the spread spectrum system's bandwidth. The output of the filter  is down-converted by a mixer  to a baseband signal using a constant frequency (Fc) local oscillator. The output of the mixer  is then spread spectrum decoded by applying a PN sequence to a mixer  within the PN Rx generator . The output of the mixer  is applied to a low pass filter  having a cutoff frequency at the data rate (Fb) of the PCM data sequence. The output of the filter  is input to a codec  which interfaces with the communicating entity .","A baseband signal from the communicating entity  is pulse code modulated by the codec . Preferably, a 32 kilobit per second adaptive pulse code modulation (ADPCM) is used. The PCM signal is applied to a mixer  within a PN Tx generator . The mixer  multiplies the PCM data signal with the PN sequence. The output of the mixer  is applied to low-pass filter  whose cutoff frequency is equal to the system chip rate. The output of the filter  is then applied to a mixer  and suitably up-converted, as determined by the carrier frequency Fc applied to the other terminal. The up-converted signal is then passed through a band-pass filter  and to a broadband RF amplifier  which drives an antenna .","The microprocessor  controls the acquisition process as well as the Rx and Tx PN generators ,. The microprocessor  controls the code phase delay added to the Rx and Tx PN generators , to acquire the forward pilot signal , and for the SU  to be acquired by the BS , and records the code phase difference between these PN generators. For re-acquisition the microprocessor  adds the recorded delay to the Tx PN generator .","The BS  uses a configuration similar to the SU  to detect PN coded signals from the SU . The microprocessor (not shown) in the BS  controls the Rx PN generator in a similar manner to make the code phase difference between Rx PN generator and the Tx PN generator equivalent to the two-way propagation delay of the SU's  virtual location. Once the BS  acquires the access signal  from the SU , all other signals from the SU  to the BS  (traffic, pilot, etc.) use the same code phase delay determined during the acquisition process.","It should be noted that although the invention has been described herein as the virtual locating of SUs  at the periphery of the cell  the virtual location can be at any fixed distance from the BS .","Referring to , the tasks associated with initial acquisition of a \u201cnever-acquired\u201d SU  by a BS  in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention are shown. The SU  continuously transmits an epoch aligned access signal  to the BS  (step ) when the establishment of a channel  is desired. While the SU  is awaiting the receipt of a confirmation signal from the BS , it continuously increases the transmission power as it continues transmission of the access signal  (step ).","To detect SUs which have never been acquired, the BS  transmits a forward pilot signal  and sweeps the cell by searching all code phases corresponding to the entire range of propagation delays of the cell (step ) and detects the epoch aligned access signal  sent from the SU  after the transmission has achieved sufficient power for detection (step ). The BS  transmits an acknowledgement to the SU  (step ) which confirms that the access signal  has been received. The SU  receives the acknowledgment signal (step ) and ceases the increase in transmission power (step ).","The BS  determines the desired codephase delay of the SU  by noting the difference between the Tx and Rx PN generators , after acquiring the SU . The desired code phase delay value is sent to the SU  (step ) as an OA&M message, which receives and stores the value (step ) for use during re-acquisition, and continues with the channel establishment process (steps  and ).","Referring to , an alternative method of fast reacquisition in accordance with the present invention is shown. When a communication channel must be reestablished between the SU  and the BS , the SU  transmits the access signal  with the desired code phase delay as in the preferred embodiment.","With all of the previously acquired SUs  at the same virtual range, the BS  need only search the code phase delays centered about the periphery of the cell to acquire the access signals  of such SUs  (step ). Thus, an SU  may ramp-up power rapidly to exploit the more frequent acquisition opportunities. The SU  implements the delay the same way as in the preferred embodiment. The BS  subsequently detects the SU  at the periphery of the cell (step ), sends an acknowledgment signal to the SU (step ) and recalculates the desired code phase delay value, if necessary. Recalculation (step ) compensates for propagation path changes, oscillator drift and other communication variables. The BS  sends the updated desired code phase delay value to the SU  (step ) which receives and stores the updated value (step ). The SU  and the BS  then continue the channel establishment process communications (steps  and ).","Note that this embodiment requires the BS to search both the code phase delays centered on the periphery of the cell to re-acquire previously acquired SUs and the code phase delays for the entire cell to acquired SUs which have never been acquired.","Referring to , the tasks associated with initial acquisition of a never-acquired SU  by a BS  in accordance with a second alternative embodiment of the present invention are shown. In the embodiment shown in , when a never-acquired SU  is acquired, the access signal  remains epoch aligned to the forward pilot signal . In this embodiment, the BS  and SU  change the code phase alignment of the access signal  from epoch aligned to delayed, (by the code phase delay), to make the SU  appear at the periphery of the cell. This change is performed at a designated time.","Steps  through  are the same as the corresponding steps  through  shown in FIG. . However, after the BS  sends the desired delay value to the SU  (step ) the BS  sends a message to the SU  to switch to the desired delay value at a time referenced to a sub-epoch of the forward pilot signal  (step ). The SU  receives this message (step ), and both units ,  wait until the switchover time is reached (steps , ). At that time, the BS  adds the desired delay value to its Rx PN operator (step ) and the SU  adds the same desired delay value to its Tx PN generator (step ). The SU  and the BS  then continue the channel establishment process communication (step , ).","XXXXIV. Parallel Packetized Intermodule Arbitrated High Speed Control and Data Bus","For communication within a digital device, such as between a CPU (central processing unit), memory, peripherals, I\/O (input\/output) devices, or other data processors, a communication bus may be employed. As shown in , a communication bus is a set of shared electrical conductors for the exchange of digital words. In this manner, communication between devices is simplified, thereby obviating separate interconnections.","A communication bus typically contains a set of data lines, address lines for determining which device should transmit or receive, and control and strobe lines that specify the type of command is executing. The address and strobe lines communicate one-way from the CPU. Typically, all data lines are bidirectional. Data lines are asserted by the CPU during the write instruction, and by the peripheral device during read. Both the CPU and peripheral device use three-state drivers for the data lines.","In a computer system where several data processing devices exchange data on a shared data bus, the two normal states of high and low voltage (representing the binary 1's and 0's) may be implemented by an active voltage pullup. However, when several processing modules are exchanging data on a data bus, a third output state, open circuit, must be added so that another device located on the bus can drive the same line.","Three-state or open-collector drivers are used so that devices connected to the bus can disable their bus drivers, since only one device is asserting data onto the bus at a given time. Each bus system has a defined protocol for determining which device asserts data. A bus system is designed so that, at most, one device has its drivers enabled at one time with all other devices disabled (third state). A device knows to assert data onto the bus by recognizing its own address on the control lines. The device looks at the control lines and asserts data when it sees its particular address on the address lines and a read pulse. However, there must be some external logic ensuring that the three-state devices sharing the same lines do not talk at the same time or bus contention will result.","Bus control logic or a \u201cbus master\u201d executes code for the protocol used to arbitrate control of the bus. The bus master may be part of a CPU or function independently. More importantly, control of the bus may be granted to another device. More complex bus systems permit other devices located on the bus to master the bus.","Data processing systems have processors which execute programmed instructions stored in a plurality of memory locations. As shown in , the processed data is transferred in and out of the system onto the bus, by using I\/O devices interconnecting with other digital devices. A bus protocol, or handshaking rules delineate a predetermined series of steps to permit data exchange between the devices.","To move data on a shared bus, the data, recipient and moment of transmission must be specified. Therefore, data, address and a strobe line must be specified. There are as many data lines as there are bits in a word to enable a whole word to be transferred simultaneously. Data transfer is synchronized by pulses on additional strobe bus lines. The number of address lines determines the number of addressable devices.","Communication buses are either synchronous or asynchronous. In a synchronous bus, data is asserted onto or retrieved from the bus synchronously with strobing signals generated by the CPU or elsewhere in the system. However, the device sending the data does not know if the data was received. In an asynchronous bus, although handshaking between communicating devices assures the sending device that the data was received, the hardware and signaling complexity is increased.","In most high-speed, computationally intensive multichannel data processing applications, digital data must be moved very rapidly to or from another processing device. The transfer of data is performed between memory and a peripheral device via the bus without program intervention. This is also known as direct memory access (DMA). In DMA transfers, the device requests access to the bus via special bus request lines and the bus master arbitrates how the data is moved, (either in bytes, blocks or packets), prior to releasing the bus to the CPU.","A number of different types of bus communication systems and protocols are currently in use today to perform data transfer. As shown in the table of , various methods have been devised to manipulate data between processing devices. Data communication buses having powerful synchronous\/high-level data link control SDLC\/HDLC protocols exist, along with standardized parallel transmission such as small computer system interface (SCSI) and carrier-sense multiple-access\/collision-detection (CSMA\/CD)(Ethernet) networks. However, in specialized, high-speed applications, a simplified data communication bus is desired.","The present invention includes a parallel packetized intermodule arbitrated high speed control data bus system which allows high speed communications between microprocessor modules in a more complex digital processing environment. The system features a simplified hardware architecture featuring fast first-in\/first-out (FIFO) queuing operating at 12.5 MHz, TTL CMOS compatible level clocking signals, single bus master arbitration, synchronous clocking, DMA, and unique module addressing for multiprocessor systems. The present invention includes a parallel data bus with sharing bus masters residing on each processing module decreeing the communication and data transfer protocols.","The high-speed intermodule communication bus (HSB) is used for communication between various microprocessor modules. The data bus is synchronous and completely bidirectional. Each processing module that communicates on the bus will have the described bus control architecture. The HSB comprises eight shared parallel data lines for the exchange of digital data and two additional lines for arbitration and clock signals. No explicit bus request or grant signals are required. The HSB can also be configured as a semi-redundant system, duplicating data lines while maintaining a single component level. The bus is driven by three-state gates with resistor pullups serving as terminators to minimize signal reflections.","To move data on the HSB, each processing module must specify the data, the recipient, and the moment when the data is valid. Only one message source, known as the bus master, is allowed to drive the bus at any given time. Since the data flow is bidirectional, the bus arbitration scheme establishes a protocol of rules to prevent collisions on the data lines when a given processing module microprocessor is executing instructions. The arbitration method depends on the detection of collisions present only on the arbitration bus and uses state machines on each data processing module to determine bus status. Additionally, the arbitration method is not daisy chained, allowing greater system flexibility.","The state machines located on each processing module are the controlling interface between the microprocessor used within a given processing module and the HSB. The circuitry required for the interface is comprised of a transmit FIFO, receive FIFO, miscellaneous directional\/bidirectional signal buffers and the software code for the state machines executed in an erasable programmable logic device (EPLD).","The HSB  of the present invention is shown in simplified form in FIG. . The preferred embodiment comprises a bus controller , a transmit FIFO , a receive FIFO , an eight bit parallel data bus  and a serial arbitration bus . The ends of the bus  are terminated with a plurality of resistive dividers to minimize signal reflections. An internal 8 bit address and data bus  couples the transmit  and receive  FIFOs and bus controller  to a CPU  and DMA controller  located on a given processor module . The internal address and data bus  also permits communication between the CPU  and bus controller  and various memory elements such as PROM , SRAM , and DRAM  required to support the applications of the data processing module .","The HSB  is a packetized message transfer bus system. Various processor modules  can communicate data, control and status messages via the present invention.","The HSB  provides high speed service for a plurality of processor modules  with minimum delay. The message transfer time between modules is kept short along with the overhead of accessing the data bus  and queuing each message. These requirements are achieved by using a moderately high clock rate and a parallel data bus  architecture. Transmit  and receive  FIFOs are used to simplify and speed up the interface between a processor module  CPU  and the data bus .","Referring to , a common clock signal (HSB_CLK)  comprising a TTL compatible CMOS level signal with a frequency nominally 12.5 MHz and a duty cycle of approximately 50% synchronizes all HSB  components and executions. The clock  pulse may originate in any part of the complete digital system and its origination is beyond the scope of this disclosure.","The parallel databus  (HSB_DAT) lines 0-7, provides 8 bidirectional TTL compatible CMOS level signals. Only one message source, the bus controller or master , is allowed to drive the bus  at any one time. A bus arbitration scheme determines which out of a plurality of processing module may become bus master and when.","The relationship of the data  and control signal transitions to the clock  edges are important to recovering the data reliably at a receiving module. Data is clocked out from a transmitting module  onto the data bus  with the negative or trailing edge of the clock signal . The data is then clocked on the positive or leading edge of the clock signal  at an addressed receiving module. This feature provides a sufficient setup and hold time of approximately ns without violating the minimum setup time for octal register .","Before data can be transmitted on the data bus , the bus controller  must obtain permission from the arbitration bus  to prevent a possible data collision. The message source must win an arbitration from a potential multiplicity of processor module  access requests. The winner is granted temporary bus mastership for sending a single message. After the transfer of data is complete, bus mastership is relinquished, thereby permitting bus  access by other processor modules .","No explicit bus request and grant signals are required with the serial arbitration method of the present invention. The preferred method eliminates complex signaling and signal lines, along with the requisite centralized priority encoder and usual granting mechanism. The arbitration method is not daisy chained so that any processor module location on the bus  may be empty or occupied without requiring a change to address wiring.","In the present invention, the open-collector arbitration bus  permits multiple processing modules  to compete for control of the data bus . Since no processing module  in the digital system knows a priori if another processing module has accessed the arbitration bus , modules within the HSB system may drive high and low level logic signals on the HSB simultaneously, causing arbitration collisions. The collisions occur without harm to the driving circuit elements. However, the collisions provide a method of determining bus activity.","The arbitration bus  includes pullup resistors connected to a regulated voltage source to provide a logic 1 level. The arbitration bus driver  connects the arbitration bus  to ground to drive a logic 0 level. This results in a logic 1 only when no other processing module  drives a logic 0. The arbitration bus  will be low if any processing module  arbitration bus  driver  asserts a logic 0.","As known to those familiar with the art, the connection is called \u201cwired-OR\u201d since it behaves like a large NOR gate with the line going low if any device drives high (DeMorgan's theorem). An active low receiver inverts a logic 0 level, producing an equivalent OR gate. Using positive-true logic conventions yields a \u201cwired-AND,\u201d using negative logic yields a \u201cwired-OR.\u201d This is used to indicate if at least one device is driving the arbitration bus  and does not require additional logic. Therefore, if a processing module  asserts a logic 1 on the arbitration bus  and monitors a logic 0, via buffer  on monitor line  (BUS_ACT_N), the processing module  bus controller  determines that a collision has occurred and that it has lost the arbitration for access.","The arbitration method depends on the detection of collisions and uses state machines  and  within the bus controller  on each processing module  to determine arbitration bus  status as arbitration proceeds. All transitions on the arbitration bus  are synchronized to the bus clock . Each processor module  has a unique programmed binary address to present to the arbitration bus . The device address in the current embodiment is six bits, thereby yielding  unique processing module  identifications.","Each processing module  bus controller  located on the HSB  monitors, (via a buffer ), and interrogates, (via a buffer ), the arbitration bus (HSBI_ARB1_N) . Six or more high level signals clocked indicate that the bus is not busy. If a processing module  desires to send a message, it begins arbitration by serially shifting out its own unique six bit address onto the arbitration bus  starting with the most significant bit. Collisions will occur on the arbitration bus  bit by bit as each bit of the six bit address is shifted out and examined. The first detected collision drops the processing module  wishing to gain access out of the arbitration. If the transmit state machine  of the sending module  detects a collision it will cease driving the arbitration bus , otherwise it proceeds to shift out the entire six bit address. Control of the data bus  is achieved if the entire address shifts out successfully with no errors.","A priority scheme results since logic 0's pull the arbitration bus  low. Therefore, a processor module  serially shifting a string of logic 0's that constitute its address will not recognize a collision until a logic 1 is shifted. Addresses having leading zeroes effectively have priority when arbitrating for the bus . As long as bus  traffic is not heavy, this effect will not be significant.","In an alternative embodiment, measures can be taken to add equity between processor modules  if required. This can be done by altering module arbitration ID's or the waiting period between messages.","Once a processor module  assumes bus mastership it is free to send data on the data bus . The bus controller  enables its octal bus transceiver (driver)  and transmits at the clock  rate. The maximum allowed message length is 512 bytes. Typically, messages will be 256 bytes or shorter. After a successful arbitration, the arbitration bus  is held low by the transmitting processor module  during this period as an indication of a busy arbitration bus .","Once the data transfer is complete, the bus controller  disables its octal bus transceiver (drivers)  via line  (HSB_A_EN_N) and releases the arbitration bus  to high. Another arbitration anywhere in the system may then take place.","An alternative embodiment allows bus  arbitration to take place simultaneous with data transfer improving on data throughput throughout the digital system. In the preferred embodiment, the delay is considered insignificant obviating the added complexity.","The bus controller  is required to control the interface between the processing module  microprocessor  and the HSB  and between the HSB and the bus (data bus  and arbitration bus ) signals. In the preferred embodiment the bus controller  is an Altera  series erasable programmable logic device (EPLD). The 8 bit internal data bus  interfaces the bus controller  with the processor module  CPU . The processor module  CPU  will read and write directly to the bus controller  internal registers via the internal data bus . The bus controller  monitors the arbitration bus  for bus status. This is necessary to gain control for outgoing messages and to listen and recognize its address to receive incoming messages. The bus controller  monitors and controls the data FIFO's  and , DMA controller  and bus buffer enable .","The components used in the preferred embodiment are shown in Table 15.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0503","num":"0510"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00019","num":"00019"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 15"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"MANU-",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"FAC-",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["QTY","TURER","PART NUMBER","DESCRIPTION","ELEMENT"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","IDT","IDT7202LA-50J","1Kx9 Receive","5024"]},{"entry":[{},"or",{},"FIFO"]},{"entry":[{},"Samsung","KM75C02AJ50"]},{"entry":["1","IDT","IDT7204LA-50J","4Kx9 Transmit","5026"]},{"entry":[{},"or",{},"FIFO"]},{"entry":[{},"Samsung","KM75C04AJ50"]},{"entry":["1","TI","SN74ABT125","Quad tristate","5058"]},{"entry":[{},"or",{},"driver"]},{"entry":[{},"TI","SN74BCT125"]},{"entry":["3","TI","SN74ABT245","TTL Octal","5060"]},{"entry":[{},"or",{},"Buffers"]},{"entry":[{},"TI","SN74BCT245"]},{"entry":["1","Altera","7128E","erasable","5022"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"programmable"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"logic device"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Address decoding and DMA gating are required and are performed in the bus controller . The bus controller  also contains a number of internal registers that can be read or written to. The CPU  communicates with and instructs the bus controller  over the 8 bit internal data bus .","Loading the transmit FIFO  is handled by the bus controller , DMA and address decoding circuits contained within the bus controller . Gaining access to the bus  and unloading the FIFO  is handled by the transmit state machine.","On power up, the bus controller  receives a hardware reset . The application software running on the processor module  CPU  has the option of resetting the bus controller  via a write strobe if the application requires a module reset. After a reset, the bus controller  monitors the arbitration bus  on line  to determine bus activity and to sync with the data bus .","After a period of inactivity the bus controller  knows that the bus  is between messages and not busy. A processor module  can then request control of the bus via arbitration. If no messages are to be sent, the bus controller  continues to monitor the arbitration bus .","The processor module CPU  writes messages into the transmit FIFO  at approximately 20 Mbps. The DMA controller, a Motorola 68360  running at 25 MHz will be able to DMA the transmit FIFO  at approximately 12.5 Mbps. Since only one message is allowed in the transmit FIFO  at any one time, the CPU  must buffer additional transmit messages in its own RAM . Since the maximum allowable message length is 512 bytes with anticipated messages averaging 256 bytes, a FIFO length of 1 Kb is guaranteed not to overflow. Once a message has been successfully sent, the transmit FIFO  flags empty and the next message can be loaded.","A typical 256 byte message sent by a processing module  CPU  at 12.5 MBps will take less than 21 \u03bcsec from RAM  to transmit FIFO . Bus arbitration should occupy not more than 1 \u03bcsec if the bus is not busy. Total elapsed time from the loading of one transmit message to the next is approximately 43 to 64 \u03bcsec. Since not many messages can queue during this period, circular RAM buffers are not required.","As shown in , during DMA transfers, the DMA controller  disables the processor module  CPU  and assumes control of the internal data bus . The DMA transfer is brought about by the processor module  or by a request from another processor module . The other processor  successfully arbitrates control of the data bus  and signals the processor module CPU . The CPU  gives permission and releases control of bus . The processor module CPU  signals the DMA controller  to initiate a data transfer. The DMA controller  generates the necessary addresses and tracks the number of bytes moved and in what direction. A byte and address counter are a part of the DMA controller . Both are loaded from the processor module CPU  to setup the desired DMA transfer. On command from the CPU , a DMA request is made and data is moved from RAM memory  to the transmit FIFO .","A transfer on the bus  is monitored by each processing module  located on the bus . Each bus controller  in the entire processor system contains the destination addresses of all devices on the bus . If a match is found, the input to that receiving processing module  FIFO  is enabled. Since multiple messages may be received by this FIFO , it must have more storage than a transmit FIFO . The receive FIFO  has at a minimum 4KB\u00d79 of storage. This amount of storage will allow at least 16 messages to queue within the receive FIFO  based on the message length of 256 bytes. A message burst from multiple sources could conceivably cause multiple messages to temporarily congest the receive FIFO . The receiving module CPU  must have a suitable message throughput from the receive FIFO  or else a data overflow will result in lost information. DMA is used to automatically transfer messages from the receive FIFO  to RAM . The transfer time from the receive FIFO  to RAM  is typically 21 \u03bcsec.","When a message is received by the bus controller , a request for DMA service is made. Referring to , the DMA controller  generates a message received hardware interrupt (DMA DONE) and signals processor module CPU  that it has control of the internal bus . An interrupt routine updates the message queue pointer and transfers the contents of receive FIFO  to RAM memory . The DMA controller  is then readied for the next message to be received and points to the next available message buffer. This continues until all of the contents of the receive FIFO  are transferred. An end of message signal is sent by the receive FIFO  to the DMA controller  via the bus controller . The processor module  CPU  then regains control of the internal communication bus .","The total elapsed time that it takes for a source to destination message transfer is approximately 64 to 85 \u03bcsec. As shown in , the time is computed from when a processor module  starts to send a message, load its transmit FIFO , arbitrate and acquire the data bus , transfer the data to the destination receive FIFO , bus the message to the CPU  and then finally transfer the message into RAM  of the recipient module . The actual throughput is almost 200 times that of a 8 KBps time slot on a PCM highway.","Controlling the HSB  requires two state machines; one transmitting information , the other receiving information . Both state machines are implemented in the bus controller  as programmable logic in the form of Altera's MAX +PLUS II, Version . state machine syntax.","Any arbitrary state machine has a set of states and a set of transition rules for moving between those states at each clock edge. The transition rules depend both on the present state and on the particular combination of inputs present at the next clock edge. The Altera EPLD  used in the preferred embodiment contains enough register bits to represent all possible states and enough inputs and logic gates to implement the transition rules.","A general transmit program flow diagram  for the transmit state machine is shown in FIG. . Within the general flow diagram  are three state machine diagrams for the inquire , arbitrate  and transmit  phases of the transmit state machine.","The processor module CPU  initiates the inquire phase . As shown in , eight states are shown along with the transition rules necessary for the bus controller  to sense bus activity. After initiation, a transmit request is forwarded to the bus controller  to see if there is bus activity. The bus controller  monitors the arbitration bus  for a minimum of 7 clock cycles. Six internal bus controller addresses are examined for collisions. If no collisions are detected, a request to arbitrate is made on the inactive bus.","As shown in , the arbitrate request sets a flip-flop  and begins sending out a unique identifier followed by six address bits on the arbitration line (HSBI ARB1_N) . A collision is detected if any of the bits transmitted are not the same as monitored. If the six bits are successfully shifted onto the bus , then that particular bus controller  has bus mastership and seizes the bus. A transmit FIFO  read enable is then set. If any one of the bits suffers a collision, the arbitration bus  is busy and the processor module  stops arbitrating.","Referencing , the transmit FIFO  read enable sets a flip-flop  and initiates a transmit enable. The contents of transmit FIFO  are output through the bus controller , through octal bus transceiver , onto the data bus . The data is transmitted until an end of message flag is encountered. Once the transmit FIFO  is emptied, a clear transmit request signal is output, returning the bus controller  back to monitoring the bus .","The state machine for controlling the receive FIFO  is similarly reduced into two state machines. As shown in , a general flow diagram is shown for A controlling the receive FIFO .","Referencing , the bus controller  monitors the arbitration bus  for a period lasting seven clock cycles. Bus activity is determined by the reception of a leading start bit from another processor module  bus controller . If after seven clock cycles the bus has not been seized, a receive alert signal is input to receive flip-flop .","As shown in , the bus controller  examines the first bit of data transmitted and compares it with its own address. If the first data bit is the unique identifier for that bus controller , data is accumulated until an end of message flag is encountered. If the first data bit is not the unique identifier of the listening bus controller , the bus controller  returns to the listening state.","There are two embodiments for the software to transmit messages. The first embodiment will allow waiting an average of 5050 \u03bcsec to send a message since there are no system interrupts performed. This simplifies queuing and unqueuing messages. The second embodiment assumes that messages are being sent fast, the operating system is fast and preemptive, system interrupts are handled quickly, and idling of the processor  is not allowed while messaging.","Upon completion of the transmit DMA, data bus  arbitration must take place. After the data bus  has been successfully arbitrated, the bus controller  may release the transmit FIFO  thereby placing the contents on the data bus . An empty flag signals a complete transfer to the bus controller  and processor module  CPU .","XXXXV. CDMA Communication System Which Selectively Suppresses Data Transmissions During Establishment of a Communication Channel","One of the problems associated with wireless communication of data is that many different types of communicating nodes are currently in use including computers, facsimile machines, automatic calling and answering equipment and other types of data networks. These nodes may be able to communicate at a plurality of different data rates and must be properly synchronized to avoid losing data during the establishment or maintenance of a communication.","The present invention includes a feature which prevents the transmission of data between communicating nodes until the data communication rate required by the communicating nodes has been completely established throughout the system. The system selectively suppresses the confirmation tone that a receiving node sends to an originating node. Accordingly, the transmission of voice, facsimile or modem data is prevented until the communication path has been established at the desired communication rate. This permits the system to reliably transport encoded data at a plurality of data rates across a telecommunication system which may lack precise synchronization.","Referring to , the communication system  is generally connected to originating nodes  and terminating nodes . In order to conserve as much bandwidth as possible, the communication system  selectively allots the bandwidth required for supporting the data transmission rate required by the originating and terminating nodes , . In this manner, the system  ensures that the bandwidth is utilized efficiently. Voiced communications may be effectively transmitted across a 32 Kbs ADPCM channel. However, a high speed fax or data modem signal requires at least a 64 Kbs pulse code modulation (PCM) signal to reliably transmit the communication. Many other types of modulation techniques and data transmission rates may also be utilized by originating and terminating nodes , . The system  must be able to effectively allocate bandwidth and dynamically switch between these data communication rates and modulation schemes on demand.","The communication system  provides a communication link between the originating and terminating nodes , . The originating and terminating nodes ,  may comprise computers, facsimile machines, automatic calling and answering equipment, data networks or any combination of this equipment. For robust communication of data it is imperative to ensure that the communication system  switches to the data transmission rate required by the communicating nodes ,  prior to the transmission of any data.","Referring to , the typical procedure for establishing communications between originating nodes  and terminating nodes is shown. The originating node  periodically transmits a calling tone (step ) which indicates that a data communication, (not a voice communication), is to be transmitted. The calling tone which is sent from the originating node  to the terminating node  is detected by the terminating node  (step ) which initiates several actions. First, the terminating node  prepares to send a data communication (step ). Next, the terminating node  transmits an answering tone (step ) to the originating node  to confirm that the terminating node  has received the calling tone. Upon receipt of the answering tone (step ), the originating node  begins the transmission of data (step ), which is received by the terminating node  (step ). With the communication link established at the data transmission rate, the originating and terminating ,  nodes transmit and receive data until termination of the communication.","One problem with this process is that the transmission rate of the communication system  is transparent to both the communicating and terminating nodes , . Modification of the transmission rate from a low rate that supports voice communication to a high rate that supports encoded data communication ensures that data will be reliably and quickly transmitted over a communication channel. However, the new transmission rate must be completely established throughout the communication system  to prevent false interpretation of tones transmitted by the originating node . The originating node  may begin transmission of data at a high rate before the system  has fully switched from 32 Kbs ADPCM to 64 Kbs PCM resulting in loss of data.","In order to obviate tone misinterpretation and to prevent the resulting erroneous operation of the originating or transmitting nodes , , the present invention blocks the transmission of the confirming tone to the originating node  until the new data transmission rate has been completely established throughout the communication system . This prevents the reception of the answering tone at the transmitting node  and ensures the reliable transportation of encoded data at a higher rate across a communication system  which lacks the precise synchronization which would otherwise be required.","The operation of the system  of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIG. . The communication system  facilitates communications between an originating node  and a terminating node . As shown, the actions of the originating node  (steps ,  and ) and the actions of the terminating node  (steps , ,  and ) are the same as in FIG. . The operation of the communication system  is transparent to both the originating node  and the terminating node .","In operation, the originating node  periodically transmits a calling tone (step ) which indicates a data communication. The communication system  performs several actions in response to receipt of the calling tone (step ). First, the calling tone is received at 32 Kbs ADPCM which is the standard communication setting for voice communications. The system  detects the calling tone and initiates a switch to 64 Kbs PCM in order to handle the high-speed data transmission. This switch must be implemented by the BS , the SU  and the controller . Although the system  immediately begins the switching over to the new data transmission rate, the process takes approximately 1500 msec to implement. Accordingly, the system  transmits the calling tone to the terminating node  at 32 Kbs ADPCM.","The terminating node  detects the calling tone (step ) and prepares to send a data communication (step ). The terminating node  subsequently transmits the answering tone (step ) which, when received by the originating node, will cause the originating node  to begin transmission of data.","The communication system  receives the answering tone from the terminating node . However, the system  does not forward the answering tone to the originating node  until the switch to 64 Kbs PCM has been established throughout the system . After the system  has confirmed that the switch to 64 Kbs PCM has been achieved, it permits the answering tone to pass through to the originating node , which receives the tone (step ). In response to the answering tone, the originating node  begins transmission of data (step ). The system  receives the data and begins transmission of data at the new data transmission rate of 64 kbs PCM (step ) to the terminating node  which receives the data (step ). Since the communication channel has been established, the originating and terminating nodes ,  continue to communicate over the system  in this manner (steps ,  and ) until the communication is terminated.","Referring to , a more detailed block diagram of the controller  is shown. The controller  controls at least a portion of the communication link between two communicating nodes , . This link comprises the transmission path  from a first communicating node to the controller , the transmission path  within the controller , and the transmission path  from the controller  to the second communicating node. The transmission paths ,  to and from the controller  may include a plurality of BSs  and SUs  which are controlled by the controller .","It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the establishment of a communication channel between communicating nodes ,  is a complex procedure involving a plurality of tasks performed by the BS , the SU  and the controller . A detailed description of the entire procedure is outside the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, only those portions of the procedure for establishment of a communication channel relevant to the present invention will be described hereinafter.","The communications between an originating node  and a terminating node  are transmitted over a virtual channel as is well known by those of skill in the art. Since the entire spectrum is used by the CDMA communication system , communications from the originating node  to the terminating node  are transmitted over the same frequency band as communications from the terminating node  to the originating node . After the virtual channel has been established, the originating and terminating nodes ,  may freely communicate.","The controller  includes a calling tone detector , a microprocessor  and an answering tone blocker . The calling tone detector  monitors the communication channel which has been established in order to detect the calling tone. When a calling tone is transmitted from an originating node , the calling tone detector  detects the calling tone, which causes the controller  to initiate the switch to a higher data transmission rate. The microprocessor  subsequently informs any other BSs  or SUs  through which the communication is to be routed (hereinafter called communicating equipment) to initiate the switch to the higher data transmission rate.","The microprocessor  activates the answering tone blocker  which will prevent the answering tone from being transmitted through the system . Each piece of communicating equipment , ,  transmits an acknowledgment to the microprocessor  of the controller  when the higher data transmission rate has been achieved. The microprocessor  subsequently deactivates the answering tone blocker  which permits the answering tone to be forwarded to the originating node . The communicating nodes ,  commence data transmission over the communication system  at the higher data transmission rate.","Although the invention has been described in part by making detailed reference to the preferred embodiment, such detail is intended to be instructive rather than restrictive. For example, the functions performed by the controller  shown in  may, in an alternative embodiment, be performed by a BS  coupled with either the originating or terminating nodes . The functions of a BS  may also be combined with the controller , to form a master base station. Additionally, different data rates and modulation schemes may be employed.","XXXXVI. Efficient Multichannel Filtering for CDMA Modems","Each communication channel within a CDMA communication system typically uses DSP (digital signal processing) hardware and software to filter, weight, and combine each signal prior to transmission. The weighting, filtering and combining of multiple signal channels is performed in the transmit circuitry of a CDMA communication system BS.","Prior art CDMA modems require many multipliers and binary adders for channel weighting and combining. The filter operation used is equivalent to that of a FIR (finite impulse response or transversal) structure. Each individual FIR filter used also requires many multipliers and adders.","A multiplier implemented in digital form is inefficient and expensive. The expense is directly related to logic gate count. Binary adders are less costly than binary multipliers, however, their use should be minimized. To implement a design using binary multiplication and addition into an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) would be expensive to manufacture and would result in a more inefficient and slower signal throughput.","The disadvantage with prior art CDMA modems is the ability to weight, filter, and combine a plurality of single bit valued signal channels efficiently and accurately. When a multiplicity of signal processing channels are involved, the consistency between channels becomes important and the cost of hardware per channel escalates. In a CDMA communication system, it is necessary to use the minimum amount of power to achieve the minimum required bit error rate (BER) for maximum user capacity.","Each channel must have appropriate individual weights applied so that the same relative amplitudes are transmitted. After the weighting operation, each data stream is represented by multibit values. These are typically summed together in a large digital summing circuit that consists of a tree of numerous two input adders. The weighted and summed digital values are then filtered in a conventional FIR filter. The multipliers in the FIR process the multibit data and weighting coefficients to the desired precision. A multichannel filter for a CDMA modem constructed according to the teachings of the prior art would require separate FIR integrated circuits rather than total integration onto an economical ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).","The efficient, multichannel filter for CDMA modems of the present invention allows multiple channels consisting of serial, digital bit streams to be filtered by digital signal processing techniques performing sample weighting and summing functions. Each individual channel may have custom weighting coefficients or weighting coefficients common for all channels. If the weighting coefficients are by adaption, the same approach may be taken.","The multichannel FIR filter presented is implemented with no multipliers and a reduction in the number of adders. To increase the speed of operation, the filter structure utilizes look-up tables (LUTs) storing the weighting coefficients. The invention can be constructed either as a FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC. The use of LUTs save significant chip resources and manufacturing costs.","The multichannel FIR filter for CDMA modems in accordance with one aspect of the present invention is described with reference to the drawing figures where like numerals represent like elements throughout. Such modems are used in multichannel wireless communication stations in conjunction with the transmission and reception of communication signals.","By way of background, many systems have the property of having their outputs at a given instant of time depend not only on the input at the time, but on the entire, or immediate history of the input. Such systems are said to have memory, averaging past and present samples in arriving at an output. It is necessary to separate systems with memory into the classes of discrete and continuous systems. A discrete system is one whose inputs and outputs are sequences of numerical values rather than continuous functions of time.","A sequence of discrete values can be represented as X, where the value x is a quantity such as voltage. The subscript k represents the sequence number. Very often in digital signal processing, xrepresents a sampled waveform or signal where the subscript specifies the point in time at which the sample was taken. However, the subscript can represent an alternative meaning such as distance in a spatially sampled application. For a system to be physically realizable, the output must depend only on the present and past history of the input. No real system can have an output that depends on the future of the input. The dependence of the output of any physically realizable system on the input is indicated by:","\u2003y=\u0192()\u2003\u2003Equation (52)","where the input variables are x, the output variable is y, and \u0192(*) is any arbitrary function of n+1 variables. Although this function is too broadly defined to be analyzed in general, the subset of linear operations becomes very useful for a plurality of signal processing applications. These functions also prove to be much more tractable in analysis.","If the output depends on the previous n samples of the input (a system having a finite memory) in a linear fashion, Equation (1) can be written as: \n\n","Such a linear system is characterized by the N+1 weighting variables a, and by the bias b. An unbiased, discrete linear system is characterized by the weighting variables (a, a, . . . , a). If the input xis a delta function (unity for one sample and zero for all others), it can be seen that the output of Equation (2) is the sequence of weighting variables a, a, . . . , a. Therefore, the response to the input completely characterizes an unbiased, linear system.","There are certain types of linear systems with memory that can be analyzed using linear techniques. Even though digital signal processing is discrete by nature, if the input is samples of a continuous input and is sampled sufficiently fast, it is possible to simulate a continuous system using the samples as the input variables. The output then appears as a linear system with a long memory. One such system is a FIR filter . A fixed coefficient FIR filter is characterized by the input\/output Equation 54 as follows: \n\n\nas shown in , or expanded as\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation (55)\n\nwhere the FIR filter has an impulse response c, c, . . . ; xrepresents the discrete input signal samples at time k; care the filter coefficient weights; N are the number of taps; and yrepresents the output at time k. As shown in , the block diagram forms a tapped delay line with the coefficients being known as tap weights.\n","Digital filters are presently a common requirement for digital signal processing systems. In the field of discrete systems, the most popular type of digital filter using convolution is the FIR. FIR filters have two advantages. The first is that FIR filters are inherently stable. The finite length of the impulse response guarantees that the output will go to zero within N samples. The second advantage is that FIR filters can be designed and implemented. The FIR filter  can be physically realized by using digital shift registers , multipliers  and summers  as shown in FIG. . The discrete signals  are shifted into registers  by a sampling clock pulse . The registers  hold past values  of the sampled signal  as well as present values  required for mathematical convolution. The past  and present  values are multiplied  by filter weighting coefficients , summed  and then output .","Another way of representing a FIR filter structure  is shown in FIG. . The operation described can be shown to be the equivalent of  since:\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation (56)\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation (57)\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation (58)\n\nresulting in \n\n\nAs can be seen in  the weighting  of the discrete input samples  relies upon many multipliers .\n","A single channel of a multichannel FIR filter  for CDMA modems is shown in simplified form in FIG. A. The multichannel FIR filter  is shown as a single element with a multichannel input sequence Xentering the filter  and the filtered result yexiting. The subscript \u201ci\u201d identifies which channel from a plurality channels is being filtered. The multiple single bit data\/signal streams represent serial data streams that have been modulated with a pseudo noise (PN) spreading code. Each channel could represent user traffic channels at various data rates. Various types of signaling data might comprise other channels.","A typical example of an integrated service digital network (ISDN) CDMA modem would require five channels. Two channels would be 64 kbps traffic channels (B and B), a 16 kbps auxiliary signaling and packet channel (D), an order wire channel (OW), and a reverse automatic power control channel (APC).","For maximum user capacity in a CDMA system it is necessary to use the minimum amount of power to achieve the required BER. Each channel must have the appropriate individual weight applied so that the correct relative amplitudes are transmitted. After the weighting operation the individual data streams become multibit values. The data streams are summed together in a large digital summing circuit that consists of a tree of numerous two input adders. The weighted and summed digital values are then filtered in a conventional FIR filter. The FIR filter is required to pulse shape the input waveforms while suppressing out-of-band emissions. The multipliers in the FIR must handle the multibit data and coefficients to the desired precision.","In , four signal channels are input individually into separate FIR filters , (the clock signal has been omitted for clarity). The individually filtered signals are then weighted using multipliers  with a channel specific weighting coefficient  wfor power control, equalizing the power or gain between individual channels, before being input to a multichannel summer . Since all users occupy the same frequency spectrum and time allocation in spread spectrum communication systems, it is desired that each user is received with the same power level. The result, y, is a weighted sum of the individually FIR filtered multiple signal channels.","A CDMA transmitter combines many channels of varying types of digital signals (serial digital voice, power control, ISDN data). Typically, each channel is modulated with a different spreading code. The spreading code allows a CDMA receiver to recover the combined signals by use of the proper code during demodulation. Alternatively, any set of orthogonal functions could be combined with the preferred embodiment and later separated by correlation.","The output  of the multichannel FIR filter  is a weighted and filtered average. Although each channel has been described as a single bit valued serial data stream, multi-bit values or levels may be processed with the identical multichannel filter structure.","Referencing , the multichannel FIR filter  is shown using four tap FIR filters . The weighting of the discrete samples is performed by conventional multipliers . Each FIR structure is comprised of shift registers  and summers  for past  and present  sampled signals. Each tap weight coefficient  is multiplied by the respective channel power control weighting factor . The result is the same as shown in , but with the external multipliers inside the FIR  structures.","Hardware reduction is accomplished by sharing FIR registers and adders as shown in FIG. . Each multichannel processing element  performs part of the channel weighting , the FIR tap coefficient  multiply , and the summing  of the multiple channels for that tap. The partitioning of the discrete functions reveals the preferred embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0566","num":"0573"},"figref":"FIG. 78","b":["7052","7054","7028","7056","79"],"sub":["(o)k","(1)k","(N)k","k "]},"A mathematical function \u0192 of an argument x with a result of y is expressed as y=\u0192(x). The function performs a mapping of all values of x into another space of y values. A LUT performs this mapping for the values of interest in the preferred embodiment. The LUT memory device is presented with an address of a location within the memory circuit. The value previously stored at that location is delivered to the memory output data bus. The values of interest of x, which are discrete, are mapped into a binary number. Since the multichannel signals are represented by zero or one logic levels, they are used as bits to form a binary number. Every possible combination of channel values is therefore assigned a state number. This operation is represented as: \n\n","Each state is a binary number that references an address in the LUT. The output value from the LUT is the precomputed value of the function resultant that would occur given the argument corresponding to that address. This is illustrated as a tabular representation of the LUT contents. The function to be performed is the weighted sum of the multiple channels for a given single tap of the FIR structure.","For example, in an application using 4 channels (M=4), the LUT contents located at the 2nd tap of the multichannel FIR (j=2) would be as shown in Table 16.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0570","num":"0577"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 16"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Values of x",{},"LUT Value Stored At"]},{"entry":["x, x, x, x","Address Computation of A","Location A"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0000","0","0"]},{"entry":["0001","1=1","wc"]},{"entry":["0010","2=2","wc"]},{"entry":["0011","2+1=3","wc+ wc"]},{"entry":["0100","4=4","wc"]},{"entry":["0101","4+1=5","wc+ wc"]},{"entry":[". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":[". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":["1101","8+4+1=13","wc+ wc+ wc"]},{"entry":["1110","8+4+2=14","wc+ wc+wc"]},{"entry":["1111","8+4+2+1=15","wc+ wc+ wc+ wc"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The LUT  memory words contain precomputed values corresponding to the current input address value as shown in FIG.
