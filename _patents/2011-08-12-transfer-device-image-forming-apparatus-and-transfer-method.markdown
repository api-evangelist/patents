Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a transfer device for and a transfer method of transferring a toner image carried on a surface of an image carrier to a recording sheet. The present invention relates further to an image forming apparatus using the transfer device and the transfer method.","2. Description of the Related Art","Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486 discloses an image forming apparatus of this kind. This image forming apparatus forms a toner image on a surface of a drum-shaped photosensitive element by a known electrophotography process. An endless intermediate transfer belt serving as an image carrier is brought into contact with the photosensitive element, whereby a primary transfer nip is formed. In the primary transfer nip, the toner image on the photosensitive element is primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer belt. A secondary transfer roller serving as a nip forming member is brought into contact with the intermediate transfer belt, whereby a secondary transfer nip is formed. Inside a loop of the intermediate transfer belt, a secondary-transfer counter roller is disposed such that the intermediate transfer belt is interposed between the secondary-transfer counter roller and the secondary transfer roller. The secondary-transfer counter roller disposed inside the loop is grounded, while the secondary transfer roller disposed outside the loop is applied with a secondary transfer bias. This creates a secondary transfer electric field between the secondary-transfer counter roller and the secondary transfer roller, which moves electrostatically the toner image from the secondary-transfer counter roller side to the secondary transfer roller side. Then, the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt is secondarily transferred to a recording sheet which is fed into the secondary transfer nip at a timing synchronized with a transfer operation of the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt by the action of the secondary transfer electric field.","With this configuration, if a sheet, such as a Japanese sheet having a high degree of surface roughness is used as the recording sheet, a light-and-shade pattern according to the surface roughness is easily generated in an image. This light-and-shade pattern is due to the insufficient amount of toner transferred to recessed portions which brings lower image densities in the recessed portions of the sheet surface than protruding portions. For this reason, in the image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, as the secondary transfer bias, a bias composed only of a DC voltage is not used but a superimposed bias in which a DC voltage is superimposed on an AC voltage is applied. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486 reports a test result presenting that applying such a secondary transfer bias (superimposed bias) suppresses occurrence of a light-and-shade pattern as compared with a case of using a secondary transfer bias composed only of a DC voltage. Further, the same document also reports another test result. The test result implies that, as a peak-to-peak voltage Vpp of an AC component of the secondary transfer bias increases from a near zero voltage, image densities of recessed portions on the surface of a recording sheet increase gradually, whereas if the value of the Vpp is larger than twice the DC voltage, as the Vpp increases, the image densities of the recessed portions decrease. According to this test result, the densities of the recessed portions become the highest by adopting the value of the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp at a timing that is immediately before a change from a tendency to increase the image densities of the recessed portions on the surface of the recording sheet to a tendency to decreases the image densities of the recessed portions in a process of gradually increasing the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp, that is, the value of the Vpp which is about twice the DC voltage is used.","However, the inventors of the present invention have found through the tests that, in a case of focusing only on transferring a sufficient amount of toner into the recessed portions of the surface of the recording sheet, that is, in a case of applying the value of the Vpp which is about twice the DC voltage, a good result is not obtained. That is, it is found that in order to obtain a sufficient image density in the recessed portions, the value of the Vpp must be more than that value. Specifically, according to the tests of the inventors of the present invention, unlike the test results disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, even when the value of the Vpp was larger than twice the DC voltage, the image densities of the recessed portions increased as the value of the Vpp increased. However, when the value of the Vpp was made relatively large, in a particularly deep recessed portion of the recessed portions, a discharge occurred between the bottom of the particularly deep recessed portion and the intermediate transfer belt, resulting in white dots, dot-shaped lacks, in the image. If a number of white dots are generated and the white dots are connected long, it may appear the image densities of the recessed portions fall significantly short of the mark. However, a shortage in the image densities and the white dots are completely different phenomena. Specifically, the shortage in the image densities is caused when an insufficient amount of toner is transferred from the intermediate transfer belt or the like into the recessed portions of the surface the recording sheet, whereas the white dotes are generated when the toner oppositely charged due to the discharge cannot be transferred into the recessed portions. Even in an image in which a large number of white dots were generated so that it appeared as if a significant storage in the image densities of the recessed portions was caused, a higher image density than that obtainable in a case that the Vpp was set at twice the DC voltage was obtained in a relatively shallow recessed portion of the recessed portions. In other words, it is considered that even in the tests disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, if the white dots and the shortage in the image densities are precisely distinguished, similarly to the tests conducted by the inventors of the present invention, even in a high potential area where the potential is larger than twice the DC voltage, the image densities increase as the value of the Vpp increases. Further, according to the tests of the inventors of the present invention, in order to obtain allowable levels of image densities at the recessed portions, the value of the Vpp needs to be four times larger than the DC voltage.","Moreover, it has also been found that, for example, even when the value of the Vpp is made larger than four times the DC voltage, if a sheet having a relatively large thickness or a relatively high degree of surface roughness is used as the recording sheet, sufficient image densities may not be obtained at the recessed portions on the surface of the recording sheet.","For this reason, the inventors of the present invention conducted tests using recording sheets having a large thickness and a high degree of surface roughness, and, as a result, found that, in order to obtain sufficient image densities at the recessed portions of the surface of the recording sheet, the value of the Vpp should be made larger than six times the DC voltage.","Until now, the image forming apparatus having a configuration in which the toner image is transferred to the recording sheet at the secondary transfer nip has been described. However, even in a configuration in which a toner image is transferred from a photosensitive element to a recording sheet at a transfer nip formed by contact of the photosensitive element and a transfer roller or the like, the same problems may occur.","It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transfer device that includes: an image carrier for carrying a toner image; a nip forming member for forming a transfer nip between the nip forming member and an image carrier by contacting with a front surface of the image carrier; and a transfer bias applying unit for applying a transfer bias, thereby transferring the toner image carried on the image carrier to a recording material at a position of the transfer nip. The transfer bias applying unit applies the transfer bias in which an AC component and a DC component are superimposed and in which a peak-to-peak voltage of the AC component is larger than 6 times an absolute value of a voltage of the DC component.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus includes the above-mentioned transfer device. The transfer device transfers the toner image carried on the surface of the image carrier or a latent image carrier to the recording material inserted into the transfer nip formed by contact of the image carrier and the nip forming member, or a transfer nip formed by contact of the latent image carrier and the nip forming member.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transfer device that includes: a nip forming member for forming a transfer nip by contacting with a front surface of an image carrier; a rear-surface abutting member for contacting with a rear surface of the image carrier; and a voltage output unit for outputting a voltage to generate a potential difference including a DC component and an AC component between the rear-surface abutting member and the nip forming member or a pressing member, the pressing member pressing the nip forming member toward the image carrier. A toner image carried on a front surface of the image carrier is transferred to a recording material inserted into the transfer nip. The voltage output unit is configured to output, as the voltage, a voltage satisfying a relation of \u2018\u2159\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 between a peak-to-peak voltage Vpp [V] of an AC component and an offset voltage Voff [V] which is an hourly averaged value of a potential. As the offset voltage Voff, generated is a voltage that causes a potential of the nip forming member or the pressing member to be larger than a potential of the rear-surface abutting member on an opposite polarity side to a charged polarity of toner.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus includes the above-mentioned transfer device. The transfer device transfers the toner image carried on the surface of the image carrier or a latent image carrier to the recording material inserted into the transfer nip formed by contact of the image carrier and the nip forming member, or a transfer nip formed by contact of the latent image carrier and the nip forming member.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transfer method that includes: a nip forming process of forming a transfer nip between a nip forming member and an image carrier by bringing the nip forming member into contact with a front surface of the image carrier, the front surface carrying a toner image; and","a transfer process of transferring the toner image carried on the image carrier to a recording material at a position of the transfer nip by applying a transfer bias. The transfer bias applied at the transferring is a transfer bias in which an AC component and a DC component are superimposed and in which a peak-to-peak voltage of the AC component is larger than 6 times an absolute value of a voltage of the DC component.","The above and other objects, features, advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Prior to proceeding to description of an embodiment of an electrophotographic type of color printer (hereinafter, simply referred to as a printer) as an image forming apparatus to which the present invention is applied, hereinafter, a printer according to a reference example to be helpful in understanding the present invention will be described.","First, a basic configuration of the printer according to the reference example will be described.  is a schematic view illustrating a configuration of the printer according to the reference example. In , the printer according to the reference example includes four image forming units Y, M, C, and K for forming toner images of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K), a transfer unit  serving as a transfer device, an optical writing unit , a fixing unit , a paper cassette , and a pair of registration rollers .","The four image forming units Y, M, C, and K have the same configuration except that Y toner, M toner, C toner, and K toner, having colors different from each other, are respectively used as image forming substances, and are replaced when reached the ends of their life spans. For example, as shown in , the image forming unit K for forming a K toner image includes a drum-shaped photosensitive element K serving as a latent-image carrier, a drum cleaning unit K, a neutralization unit (not shown), a charging unit K, a developing unit K, and so on. These units may be held in a common holding element, and be integrally attached to and detached from a main body of the printer, such that the units can be replaced at the same time.","The photosensitive element K has a drum shape in which an organic photosensitive layer is formed on a surface of a drum base and whose outer diameter is about 60 mm, and is driven to rotate clockwise in  by a driving unit (not shown). The charging unit K brings a roller charging unit K, to which a charging bias is applied, into contact or close proximity with the photosensitive element K so as to cause discharge between the roller charging unit K and the photosensitive element K, thereby uniformly charging the surface of the photosensitive element K. In the reference example, the surface of the photosensitive element K is uniformly charged to a negative polarity which is the same as a normally charged polarity of toner. As the charging bias, a bias in which an AC voltage is superimposed on a DC voltage is used. The roller charging unit K is formed by covering a surface of a metal cored bar with a conductive elastic layer made of a conductive elastic material. Instead of the method of bringing a charging member such as the roller charging unit into contact or close proximity with the photosensitive element K, a corona charger may be used.","The uniformly charged surface of the photosensitive element K is optically scanned by a laser beam coming from the optical writing unit to be described, so as to hold a K latent image. The K latent image is developed by the developing unit K using K toner (not shown) so as to be a K toner image. Then, the K toner image is primarily transferred on to an intermediate transfer belt  to be described.","The drum cleaning unit K removes transfer residual toner attached to the surface of the photosensitive element K after passing through the primary transfer process (a primary transfer nip to be described). The drum cleaning unit K includes a cleaning brush roller K driven to rotate, a cleaning blade K configured to bring a free end into contact with the photosensitive element K in a state in which the cleaning blade K is supported in a cantilever fashion, etc. The transfer residual toner is scraped off the surface of the photosensitive element K and is carried by the rotating cleaning brush roller K, or is scraped off the surface of the photosensitive element K and is dropped by the cleaning blade. Incidentally, the cleaning blade K contacts with the photosensitive element K in such a manner that the free end thereof contacts with the photosensitive element K at an upper stream position than the cantilever-like supported end thereof with respect to the rotation direction of the drum (photosensitive element K). Such a contact manner is called herein a \u201ccounter direction contact\u201d.","The neutralization unit neutralizes residual charge of the photosensitive element K cleaned by the drum cleaning unit K. The surface of the photosensitive element K is initialized by the neutralization, so as to be ready for the next image formation.","The developing unit K includes a developing unit K containing a developing roller K, and a developer feed unit K for stirring and feeding a K developer (not shown). The developer feed unit K includes a first feed chamber for accommodating a first screw member K and a second feed chamber for accommodating a second screw member K. Each of the screw members includes a rotation shaft member in which both end portions in an axis line direction are rotatably supported by bearings, respectively, and a spiral blade provided to protrude in a spiral shape on a peripheral surface of the rotation shaft member.","The first feed chamber accommodating the first screw member K and the second feed chamber accommodating the second screw member K are divided by a partition wall. At both end portions of the partition wall in a screw axis line direction, communication openings are formed to communicate both feed chambers each other. The first screw member K feeds a K developer (not shown) carried in the spiral blade from a rear side to a front side in a direction perpendicular to the plane of  while stirring the developer in the rotation direction of the first screw member by the rotation thereof. Since the first screw member K and a developing roller K to be described are disposed in parallel to face each other, in this case, the feed direction of the K developer is also a direction along a rotation axis line direction of the developing roller K. The first screw member K feeds the K developer to a surface of the developing roller K along the axis line direction thereof.","The K developer fed up to the vicinity of a front-side end portion of the first screw member K in  enters the second feed chamber through the communication openings provided in the vicinity of the front-side end portion of the partition wall in , and is carried in the spiral blade of the second screw member K. Then, the K developer is fed from the front side to the rear side in  while being stirred in the rotation direction of the second screw member K by the rotation thereof.","Inside the second feed chamber, a toner density sensor (not shown) is provided on a lower wall of a casing to detect a K toner density of the K developer in the second feed chamber. As the K toner density sensor, a sensor formed of a permeability sensor may be used. Since the permeability of the K developer containing the K toner and a magnetic carrier has a correlation with a K toner density, the permeability sensor detects the K toner density.","In this printer, Y, M, C, and K toner supplement units (not shown) are provided to supplement Y, M, C, and K toner into the second feed chambers of the Y, M, C, and K developing units, respectively. A control unit of the printer stores Vtref for Y, M, C, and K, which are target values for output voltage values from the Y, M, C, and K toner density detecting sensors, in a RAM. In a case that the differences between the output voltage values from the Y, M, C, and K toner density detecting sensors and the Vtref for Y, M, C, and K exceed a predetermined value, the Y, M, C, and K toner supplement units are driven for time periods according to the differences. Therefore, the Y toner, the M toner, the C toner, and the K toner are supplemented into the second feed chambers of the Y, M, C, and K developing units.","The developing roller K accommodated in the developing unit K faces the first screw member K and also faces the photosensitive element K through the opening provided to the casing. The developing roller K includes a cylindrical developing sleeve composed of a non-magnetic pipe driven to rotate, and a magnetic roller fixed inside the developing roller K so as not to rotate with the sleeve. The developing roller K feeds the K developer fed from the first screw member K to a developing area facing the photosensitive element K by the rotation of the sleeve while holding the K developer on a surface of the sleeve by a magnetic force emanating from the magnetic roller.","A developing bias is applied to the developing sleeve, the developing bias having the same polarity as the toner, being higher than a potential of the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive element K, and being lower than a uniformly charged potential of the photosensitive element K. Therefore, between the developing sleeve and the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive element K, a developing potential serves to move the K toner on the developing sleeve toward the electrostatic latent image. Further, between the developing sleeve and a surface portion of the photosensitive element K, a non-developing potential serves to move the K toner on the developing sleeve toward the sleeve surface. The actions of the developing potential and the non-developing potential selectively transfer the K toner on the developing sleeve to the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive element K, thereby developing the electrostatic latent image into a K toner image.","In  described above, even in the Y, M, and C image forming units Y, M, and , similarly to the K image forming unit K, Y, M, and C toner images are formed on the photosensitive elements Y, M, and C.","Above the image forming units Y, M, , and K, the optical writing unit  serving as a latent image writing unit is disposed. The optical writing unit  optically scans the photosensitive elements Y, M, C, and K by laser beams coming from laser diodes on the basis of image information transmitted from an external device such as a personal computer. Y, M, C, and K electrostatic latent images are formed on the photosensitive elements Y, M, C, and K by the optical scanning. Specifically, on the uniformly charged entire surface of the photosensitive element Y, at a portion irradiated with a laser beam, a potential is lowered. Therefore, the potential of the portion irradiated with the laser beam becomes the electrostatic latent image having a potential lower than the potential of the other area (surface portion). Also, the optical writing unit  irradiates the photosensitive elements with a laser beam L coming from a light source through a plurality of optical lenses and mirrors while polarizing the laser beam L in a main scan direction by a polygon mirror driven to rotate by a polygon motor (not shown). The optical writing may be performed by LED beams coming from a plurality of LEDs of an LED array.","Below the image forming units Y, M, , and K, a transfer unit  is disposed as a transfer device which endlessly moves the endless intermediate transfer belt  counterclockwise in  while hanging the endless intermediate transfer belt . The transfer unit  includes not only the intermediate transfer belt  serving as an image carrier, but also a driven roller , a secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , a cleaning backup roller , four primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K, a nip forming roller , a belt cleaning unit , a potential sensor , and so on.","The intermediate transfer belt  is hung by the driven roller , the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , the cleaning backup roller , and the four primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K disposed inside the intermediate transfer belt . The intermediate transfer belt  endlessly moves counterclockwise by a rotation force of the driven roller  driven to rotate counterclockwise in  by a driving unit (not shown). As the intermediate transfer belt , an intermediate transfer belt having the following characteristics is used. That is, the thickness is 20 \u03bcm to 200 \u03bcm, preferably, about 60 \u03bcm. Also, the volume resistivity is 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm to 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, preferably, about 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm (measured with HIRESTA-UP (MCP-HT45) manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation under the condition of applied voltage of 100 V). Further, the material is composed of a carbon-dispersed polyimide resin.","The intermediate transfer belt  moving endlessly are interposed between the four primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K and the photosensitive elements Y, M, C, and K. Therefore, the front surface of the intermediate transfer belt  and the photosensitive elements Y, M, C, and K come into contact with each other so as to form primary transfer nips for Y, M, C, and K. A primary transfer bias is applied to each of the primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K by a transfer bias power supply (not shown). Therefore, transfer electric fields are formed between the Y, M, C, and K toner images on the photosensitive elements Y, M, C, and K and the primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K. The Y toner formed on the surface of the Y photosensitive element Y for Y enters the primary transfer nip for Y by the rotation of the photosensitive element Y. Then, the Y toner is primarily transferred from the photosensitive element Y to the intermediate transfer belt  by actions of the transfer electric field or the nip pressure. Next, the intermediate transfer belt  to which the Y toner image has been transferred in that way passes through the primary transfer nips for M, C, and K, in turn. Then, the M, C, and K toner images on the photosensitive elements M, C, and K are sequentially primarily transferred to be superimposed on the Y toner image. A four-color superimposed toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt  by the primary transfer of the superimposing.","The primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K are composed of elastic rollers having metal cored bars and conductive sponge layers fixed on the metal cored bars, and have the following characteristics. That is, the external diameter is 16 mm. Also, the diameter of the cored bars is 10 mm. Further, the resistance R of the sponge layers calculated from a current I flowing when a voltage of 1000 V was applied to the cored bars of the primary rollers in a state that a grounded metal roller with an external diameter of 30 mm is pressed against the sponge layers with a force of 10 N, on the basis of Ohm's law (R=V\/I) is about 3\u00d710\u03a9. With respect to the primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K, the primary transfer bias is applied under constant current control. Instead of the primary transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K, transfer chargers, transfer brushes, and the like may be used.","The nip forming roller  of the transfer unit  is disposed outside a loop of the intermediate transfer belt , such that the intermediate transfer belt  is interposed between the nip forming roller  and the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  on the inside of the loop. Therefore, the front surface of the intermediate transfer belt  and the nip forming roller  come into contact with each other so as to form a secondary transfer nip. While the nip forming roller  is grounded, a secondary transfer bias is applied to the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  by a secondary transfer bias power supply . Therefore, between the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  and the nip forming roller , a secondary transfer electric field is formed to electrostatically move the toner having the negative polarity from the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  to the nip forming roller .","Below the transfer unit , the paper cassette  accommodating a pile of a plurality of recording sheets P is disposed. The paper cassette  brings the top recording sheet P of the sheet pile into contact with a paper feeding roller , and the paper feeding roller is driven to rotate at a predetermined timing, so as to send the recording sheet P toward a paper conveying path. In the vicinity of an end of the paper conveying path, the pair of registration rollers  is provided. If the recording sheet P sent from the paper cassette  is inserted between the pair of registration rollers , the rollers immediately stop rotating. Then, the pair of registration rollers  restarts rotating to send the recording sheet P toward the secondary transfer nip at a timing capable of being synchronized with the four-color superimposed toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  in the secondary transfer nip. The four-color superimposed toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  brought into close contact with the recording sheet P in the secondary transfer nip is secondarily transferred to the recording sheet P at once by the actions of the secondary transfer electric field or the nip pressure, so as to be a full-color toner image together with the white color of the recording sheet P. If passing through the secondary transfer nip, the recording sheet P having a surface on which the full-color toner image has formed in that way leaves the nip forming roller  and the intermediate transfer belt  through self stripping.","The secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  has the following characteristics. That is, the external diameter is about 24 mm. Also, the diameter of the cored bar is about 16 mm. The surface of the cored bar is covered with a conductive NBR-based rubber layer, and the resistance R thereof is 1\u00d710\u03a9 to 1\u00d710\u03a9, preferably, about 4\u00d710\u03a9. The resistance R is a value measured by the same method as that used for the primary transfer rollers.","Also, the nip forming roller  has the following characteristics. That is, the external diameter is about 24 mm. Also, the diameter of the cored bar is about 14 mm. The surface of the cored bar is covered with a conductive NBR-based rubber layer, and the resistance R thereof is 1\u00d710\u03a9 or less. The resistance R is a value measured by the same method as that used for the primary transfer rollers.","The secondary transfer bias power supply  includes a DC power supply and an AC power supply, and can output a bias in which an AC voltage is superimposed on a DC voltage, as the secondary transfer bias. An output terminal of the secondary transfer bias power supply  is connected to the cored bar of the nip forming roller . The potential of the cored bar of the nip forming roller  becomes almost the same value as an output voltage value from the secondary transfer bias power supply . As for the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , the cored bar is grounded (connected to the ground). Instead of grounding the cored bar of the nip forming roller  while applying the superimposed bias to the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  may be grounded while applying the superimposed bias to the cored bar of the nip forming roller . In this case, the polarity of the DC voltage is changed. Specifically, as shown in , in a case that the superimposed bias is applied to the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  on condition that the toner having the negative polarity is used and the nip forming roller  is grounded, as the DC voltage, a DC voltage having the negative polarity like the toner is used to make an hourly averaged potential of the superimposed bias have the negative polarity like the toner. In contrast, in the case that the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  is grounded and the superimposed bias is applied to the nip forming roller , as the DC voltage, a DC voltage having the opposite polarity to that of the toner is used to make the hourly averaged potential of the superimposed bias have the positive polarity opposite to that of the toner. Instead of applying the superimposed bias to the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  or the nip forming roller , a DC voltage may be applied to any one roller, and at the same time, an AC voltage may be applied the other roller. As the AC voltage, an AC voltage having a sinusoidal waveform is used; however, an AC voltage having a rectangular waveform may be used. In a case that a sheet, such as plain paper, having a low degree of surface roughness is used as the recording sheet P without using a sheet, such as a type of Japanese paper, having a high degree of surface roughness, since a light-and-shade pattern according to the roughness pattern of the paper surface is not generated, a bias composed only of a DC voltage may be applied as the transfer bias. However, in the case that a sheet, such as a type of Japanese paper, having a high degree of surface roughness is used, it is required to change the transfer bias from the bias composed only of the DC voltage to the superimposed bias.","On the intermediate transfer belt  after passing through the secondary transfer nip, transfer residual toner that has not been transferred onto the recording sheet P is attached. The transfer residual toner is cleaned from the belt surface by the belt cleaning unit  that is in contact with the front surface of the intermediate transfer belt . The cleaning backup roller  disposed on the inside of the loop of the intermediate transfer belt  backs up the cleaning on the belt by the belt cleaning unit  from the inside of the loop.","The potential sensor  is disposed on the outside of the loop of the intermediate transfer belt . Also, the potential sensor  faces a portion wound around the grounded driven roller , in the entire area in the circumferential direction of the intermediate transfer belt , with a gap of about 4 mm. When the primarily transferred toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  reaches a position where the toner image faces the potential sensor , the potential sensor  measures a surface potential of the toner image. As the potential sensor , EFS-22D manufactured by TDK Corporation is used.","On the right side of the secondary transfer nip in , the fixing unit  is disposed. In the fixing unit , a fixing nip is formed by a fixing roller  containing a heat generating source such as a halogen lamp and a pressing roller  rotating while being in contact with the fixing roller  with a predetermined pressure. The recording sheet P sent into the fixing unit  is inserted into the fixing nip with a posture in which an unfixed-toner-image holding surface of the recording sheet P comes into close contact with the fixing roller . Then, the toner of the toner image is softened and the full-color image is fixed under the influence of heating or pressing. The recording sheet P discharged from the fixing unit  is discharged to the outside of the apparatus through a post-fixing conveying path.","In a case of forming a monochrome image, support plates (not shown) supporting the primary transfer rollers Y, M, and C for Y, M, and C in the transfer unit  move so as to keep the primary transfer rollers Y, M, and C away from the photosensitive elements Y, M, and C. Thereby, the front surface of the intermediate transfer belt  is separated from the photosensitive elements Y, M, and C, and is in contact only with the photosensitive element K for K. In this state, among the four image forming units Y, M, , and K, only the image forming unit K for K is driven, such that the K toner image is formed on the photosensitive element K.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["39","39","39"]},"In , an offset voltage Voff is the value of the DC component of the secondary transfer bias. Also, a peak-to-peak voltage Vpp is the peak-to-peak voltage of the AC component of the secondary transfer bias. In the printer according to the reference example, as described above, the secondary transfer bias is a superimposed bias of the offset voltage Voff and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp, and the hourly averaged value of the secondary transfer bias becomes the same value as the offset voltage Voff. Also, in the printer according to the reference example, as described above, the secondary transfer bias is applied to the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller and the cored bar of the nip forming roller is grounded (0 V). Therefore, the potential of the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller itself becomes the potential difference between both cored bars. The potential difference between both cored bars is composed of a DC component Eoff having the same value as the offset voltage Voff and an AC component Epp having the same value as the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp.","As shown in , in the printer according to the reference example, a negative voltage is used as the offset voltage Voff. Since the polarity of the offset voltage Voff of the secondary transfer bias applied to the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  is made negative, in the secondary transfer nip, the toner having the negative polarity can be relatively forced from the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  side to the nip forming roller  side. When the polarity of the secondary transfer bias is negative like the toner, in the secondary transfer nip, the toner having the negative polarity is electrostatically forced from the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  side to the nip forming roller  side. Thereby, the toner on the intermediate transfer belt  is transferred onto the recording sheet P. Meanwhile, when the polarity of the secondary transfer bias is the positive polarity opposite to that of the toner, in the secondary transfer nip, the toner having the negative polarity is electrostatically drawn from the nip forming roller  side toward the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  side. Thereby, the toner transferred onto the recording sheet P is redrawn to the intermediate transfer belt . However, since the hourly averaged value (the same value as the offset voltage Voff in the present embodiment) of the secondary transfer bias has the negative polarity, relatively, the toner is electrostatically forced from the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  side to the nip forming roller  side. In , a return potential peak value Vr represents a positive peak value having the opposite polarity to that of the toner.","Next, the tests conducted by the inventors of the present invention will be described.","The inventors of the present invention prepared a print test apparatus having the same configuration as the printer according to the reference example. Then, various print tests were conducted by using the print test apparatus. In the various tests, as the developer, a substance containing grinded polyester-based toner having an average grain diameter of 6.8 \u03bcm and magnetic carriers having an average grain diameter of 55 \u03bcm and having surfaces covered with resin layers was used.","First Print Test","As the offset voltage Voff, \u22120.8 kV was used. Specifically, in the print test, since the nip forming roller  was grounded, the DC component of the secondary transfer bias composed of the superimposed bias was set at \u22120.8 kV. Also, as the AC component, an AC component having a peak-to-peak voltage Vpp of 2.5 kV was used. The frequency f [Hz] of the AC component and a process linear velocity (the linear velocities of the intermediate transfer belt and the photosensitive elements) were appropriately changed. Under conditions different from each other in the frequency f and the process linear velocity, black solid test images were output on recording sheets P that were plain paper. Then, the qualities of the output black solid images were visually evaluated on a two-point scale. Cases where density irregularity (pitch irregularity) synchronized with the frequency of the AC component was not visible were marked with \u2018\u2218\u2019, and cases where density irregularity (pitch irregularity) synchronized with the frequency of the AC component was visible were marked with \u2018x\u2019.

Also, in a case that the process linear velocity v was set at 141 mm\/s, it was possible to prevent occurrence of the pitch irregularity by setting the frequency f of the AC component at 200 Hz or greater. The lower limit of the frequency f capable of preventing occurrence of the pitch irregularity changes according to the process linear velocity v, and this is because the number of alternating electric fields acting the toner in the secondary transfer nip changes according to the process linear velocity v. Specifically, hereinafter, a nip width is defined as d [mm]. In that case, the nip width equals a length in a roller surface movement direction of the secondary transfer nip, which is formed by the direct contact of the intermediate transfer belt  and the nip forming roller  in a state that the recording sheet P is not inserted therebetween. A nip transit time [s] required for secondary-transfer-nip transit is expressed in a formula of \u2018(Nip Width d)\/(Process Linear Velocity v)\u2019. Meanwhile, under conditions of the frequency f [Hz], the period [s] of the AC component of the superimposed bias is expressed in a formula of \u20181\/(Frequency f)\u2019. Therefore, in the nip transit time, a one-period waveform of the AC component is applied by the number of times (d\u00d7f\/v). In the print test apparatus, the nip width d is 3 mm. As shown in Table 1, when the process linear velocity v is 282 mm\/s, a required number of waveforms can be calculated to about 4.26 (3\u00d7400\/282), since a lower limit of the frequency \u201cf\u201d capable of preventing an occurrence of the pitch irregularity is 400 Hz. This means that the occurrence of pitch irregularity can be avoided by working alternating electric fields to the toner within the secondary transfer nip approximately by the number of times 4.26. In a case that the process linear velocity \u201cv\u201d is 141 mm\/s, a required number of waveforms can be calculated to about 4.26 (3\u00d7200\/141), since a lower limit of the frequency \u201cf\u201d capable of preventing an occurrence of the pitch irregularity is 200 Hz. This is the same value as that in the case of 400 Hz. From these, it can be said that it is possible to obtain a good image without the pitch irregularity by causing the alternating electric fields to act about four times during the secondary-transfer-nip transit. In other words, in order to obtain a good image without the pitch irregularity, a condition of \u20184<d\u00d7f\/v\u2019 needs to be satisfied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"Second Print Test","As the recording sheet P, instead of the plain paper, FC Japanese paper type \u2018SAZANAMI\u2019 (a trade name) (manufactured by NBS Ricoh Co., Ltd.) was used. The FC Japanese paper type \u2018SAZANAMI\u2019 is paper having surface roughness like Japanese paper. If this paper is used, a light-and-shade pattern according to the surface roughness is likely to be generated. A black solid image being 70 mm long and 55 mm wide was used as a test image to be output.

The appearance of the white dots due to the discharge was evaluated as follows. That is, a case that white dots considered to be due to the discharge were not recognized was rated as Rank 5. Also, a case that a level at which white dots were recognized to a minor extent, but the number of the recognized white dots was small and the sizes of the white dots were small such that there was no problem in the image quality to be supplied to the users was rated as Rank 4. Further, a case that more white dots were recognized and more problems were noticeable, as compared to Rank 4, was rated as Rank 3. Furthermore, a case that further more white dots were recognized as compared to Rank 3 was rated as Rank 2. Moreover, a case that white dots are recognized in the entire image and that is worse than Rank 2 was rated as Rank 1.

If attention is focused on only the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions, not the three items, when combinations of the offset voltages Voff and the peak-to-peaks voltage having coordinates lower than the straight line L in  are used, the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions becomes better. The straight line L is represented as Equation of \u2018Vpp=\u22124\u00d7Voff\u2019. Therefore, if the secondary transfer bias satisfying a condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 is used, sufficient image densities can be obtained at the recessed portions of the sheet surface.","For reference, a black solid image output under a condition of a DC voltage of \u22122.5 kV acting as the secondary transfer bias and capable of making the image densities of the recessed portions the highest in the test (in which the secondary transfer bias is composed only of the DC component) shown in Table 2 is shown in . Also, a black solid image output under a condition in which the DC voltage (offset voltage Voff) is \u22121.0 kV and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp is 5.0 kV, among the bias conditions shown in , is shown in . It can be seen that, if the superimposed bias is used as the secondary transfer bias, it is possible to significantly improve the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions, as compared to a case of using the secondary transfer bias composed only of the DC component.","As an image forming apparatus using a secondary transfer bias composed of a superimposed bias, an image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486 is known. However, because of the below-mentioned reasons, in this image forming apparatus, it is difficult to obtain Rank 4 or higher with regard to the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions. That is, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, FIG. 5 shows the following test results. That is, on condition that 2.0 kV is used as Vdc corresponding to the DC component of the secondary transfer bias composed of the superimposed bias, 1 kV to 4 kV is used as an AC component Vac, and 2 kHz is used as the frequency f of the AC component, a whited grade corresponding to the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions is evaluated. Unlike the printer according to the reference example, the Vdc and Vac are applied to the nip forming roller and the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller is grounded. Then, a DC component having a positive polarity is used as the Vdc, such that the toner is electrostatically drawn from the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller side to the nip forming roller side in the secondary transfer nip so as to be secondarily transferred onto the recording sheet. FIG. 5 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486 shows a graph. This graph represent following: As the AC component Vac gradually increases from 0 kV to 2.0 kV, the whited grade is gradually improved, and when the AC component Vac reaches 2 kV, the whited grade is most materially improved. If the AC component Vac is larger than 2.0 kV, as the AC component Vac increases, the whited grade goes steadily downhill. The maximum value of the Vac shown in the graph is 4 kV, and when the Vac is 4 kV, the whited grade becomes the worst result. In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, whether the AC component Vac is a peak-to-peak voltage or is an amplitude which is half that of the peak-to-peak voltage is not explicitly stated. However, in cases where \u2018ac\u2019 is simply stated, there are many cases representing the latter. Assuming that the Vac is the amplitude, in the test shown in FIG. 5 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, if the condition on which the Vac is set at 2.0 kV to obtain the best result is replaced with a condition of the printer according to the reference example, the offset voltage Voff becomes \u22122.0 kV and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp becomes 4.0 kV. Also, if the condition on which the Vac is set at 4 kV to obtain the worst result is replaced with a condition of the printer according to reference example, the offset voltage Voff becomes \u22122.0 kV and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp becomes 8.0 kV. On the basis of these conditions, the inventors of the present invention fixed the DC voltage (offset voltage Voff) of the superimposed bias at \u22122.0 kV in the print test apparatus, and output the black solid image on recording sheets (SAZANAMI) under each condition while gradually increasing the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp from 1 kV to 8 kV. Then, unlike the results of FIG. 5 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486, results in which the image densities of the recessed portions of the sheet surfaces gradually increased as the Vpp increased from 1 kV to 8 kV were obtained.","A black solid image output in the test on condition that the secondary transfer bias was composed only of the DC component of \u22122.0 kV is shown in . Also, a black solid image output on condition that the secondary transfer bias was composed of the DC voltage (corresponding to the offset voltage Voff in this example) of \u22122.0 kV and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp of 4.0 kV is shown in . This condition is the condition on which the best result was obtained in the test disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486. Further, a black solid image output on condition that the secondary transfer bias was composed of the offset voltage Voff of \u22122.0 kV and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp of 8.0 kV is shown in . This condition is the condition on which the worst result was obtained in the test disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-267486. All of the black solid images are 70 mm long and 55 mm wide. If attention is focused on only the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions, the best result was obtained in the black solid image shown in  among the three black solid images. This black solid image looks at the first glance like a significant shortage of the image densities at the recessed portions was caused. However, as seen from the fact that whited portions looking like groove-shaped recessed portions are remarkably larger than groove-shaped recessed portions of , the whited portions were generated by the linear connection of a large number of white dots due to the discharge, not to a shortage of the image densities of the recessed portions. The linearly connected white dots were generated along particularly deep recessed portions of the recessed portions of the sheet surface, and at recessed portions shallower than the particularly deep recessed portions, image densities higher than those of the recessed portions of  were obtained. Nevertheless, the image densities thereof were rated as Rank 3 lower than the allowable level.","In the condition in which the Voff is \u22122.0 kV and the Vpp is 4.0 kV to obtain the black solid image of , if the relation between both voltages is expressed as Equation, Equation of \u2018\u00bd\u00d7Vpp=|Voff|\u2019 is obtained. This condition deviates significantly from the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp=|Voff|\u2019 which the inventors of the present invention derived by the second print test (which is also the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Epp=|Eoff|\u2019 in the present example). Also, in the condition in which the Voff is \u22122.0 kV and the Vpp is 8.0 kV to obtain the black solid image of , if the relation between both voltages is expressed as Equation, Equation of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp=|Voff|\u2019 is obtained. This condition is close to but deviates slightly from the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 which the inventors of the present invention derived by the second print test. Under the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp=|Voff|\u2019, the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions of Rank 3 could be obtained at the most (see ). From the above, it was found that, in obtaining the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions of Rank 4 or higher, a condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 needs to be satisfied.","As described already, in the print test apparatus, since the cored bar of the nip forming roller  is grounded while the secondary transfer bias is applied to the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , the DC component potential difference Eoff which is the hourly averaged value of the potential difference between both rollers becomes the same value as the offset voltage Voff which is the DC component of the secondary transfer bias. In a case that a DC voltage is applied to the cored bar of the nip forming roller  instead of grounding the cored bar of the nip forming roller , a superimposed value of the DC voltage applied to the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  and the DC voltage applied to the cored bar of the nip forming roller  is handled as the offset voltage Voff. In other words, even when the DC voltage is applied to the cored bar of the nip forming roller  instead of grounding the cored bar of the nip forming roller , the DC component potential difference Eoff and the offset voltage Voff become the same value.","As the method of creating a potential difference including a DC component and an AC component between a nip forming member such as the nip forming roller  and a rear-surface abutting member such as the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , the following six manners can be exemplified.","(1) A superimposed bias is applied to the nip forming member, and the rear-surface abutting member is connected to the ground.","(2) A superimposed bias is applied to the nip forming member, and a DC bias is applied to the rear-surface abutting member.","(3) An AC bias composed only of an AC component is applied to the nip forming member, and a DC bias is applied to the rear-surface abutting member.","(4) The nip forming member is connected to the ground, and a superimposed bias is applied to the rear-surface abutting member.","(5) A DC bias is applied to the nip forming member, and a superimposed bias is applied to the rear-surface abutting member.","(6) A DC bias is applied to the nip forming member, and an AC bias composed only of an AC component is applied to the rear-surface abutting member.","Next, a transfer test conducted by the inventors of the present invention will be described.","The inventors of the present invention made a special transfer test apparatus, in order to reveal a cause for which the sufficient image densities could be obtained at the recessed portions and a light-and-shade pattern according to the surface roughness could be made less conspicuous than the related art, by satisfying the condition \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["210","231","220","241","242","243","244","210","211","212","211","213","212","210","210","220","215","210","231","220","212","210"]},"The developing unit  has the same configuration as the developing unit of the printer according to the reference example, and includes a screw member , a developing roller , a doctor blade , and so on. The developing roller  is driven to rotate in a state that a developing bias is applied thereto by means of a power supply .","If the transparent substrate  moves to a position, which is directly above the developing unit  and faces the developing roller  with a predetermined gap, at a predetermined speed by the movement of the substrate supporting unit, toner on the developing roller  is transferred onto the transparent electrode  of the transparent substrate . As a result, on the transparent electrode  of the transparent substrate , a toner layer  having a predetermined thickness is formed. The amount of attached toner per unit area relative to the toner layer  can be adjusted by a toner concentration of a developer, an charge amount of the toner, a developing bias value, a gap between the substrate  and the developing roller , a movement speed of the transparent substrate , and a rotation speed of the developing roller , and so on.","The transparent substrate  having the toner layer  formed thereon moves in a parallel manner to a position facing a recording sheet  attached on the planer metal plate  with a conductive adhesive. The metal plate  is disposed on a substrate  having a load sensor installed therein, and the substrate  is disposed on the Z stage . Also, the metal plate  is connected to a voltage amplifier . A transfer bias composed of a DC voltage and an AC voltage is input to the voltage amplifier  by a waveform generating unit , and the transfer bias amplified by the voltage amplifier  is applied to the metal plate . If the Z stage  is driven to raise the metal plate , the recording sheet  begins to come into contact with the toner layer . When the metal plate  is further raised, the pressure onto the toner layer  increases. The rise of the metal plate  is stopped so that an output of the load sensor becomes a predetermined value. In the state that the pressure is the predetermined value, the transfer bias is applied to the metal plate  and the behavior of the toner is observed. After the observation, the Z stage  is driven to lower the metal plate  so that the recording sheet  is detached from the transparent substrate . At that time, the toner layer  is transferred onto the recording sheet .","The observation of the behavior of the toner is performed by using the microscope  and the high-speed camera  disposed above the substrate . Since all layers composing the substrate , which are the glass plate , the transparent electrode , and the transparent insulating layer , are totally made of transparent materials the behavior of the toner under the transparent substrate  can be observed from the topside of the transparent substrate , through the transparent substrate .","As the microscope , a microscope known as a zoom lens VH-Z75 (manufactured by Keyence Corp.) was used. Also, as the high-speed camera , a FASTCAM-MAX 120KC (manufactured by Photron, Inc.) was used. The FASTCAM-MAX 120KC (manufactured by Photron, Inc.) is controllably driven through the personal computer . The microscope  and the high-speed camera  are supported by a camera supporting unit (not shown). The camera supporting unit is configured to be capable of adjusting the focus of the microscope .","The behavior of the toner is shot as follows. That is, first, an illumination beam is irradiated from a light source  onto an observation point for observing the behavior of the toner and the focus of the microscope  is adjusted. Next, the transfer bias is applied to the metal plate  so as to move the toner of the toner layer  attached to the lower surface of the transparent substrate  toward the recording sheet . At this time, the behavior of the toner is shot using the high-speed camera .","Comparing the transfer test apparatus shown in  with the printer according to the reference example, there is a difference in the configuration of the transfer nip for transferring the toner onto the recording sheet. Therefore, their transfer electric fields acting the toner differ from each other, even with the identical transfer bias. In order to find an appropriate observation condition, even in the transfer test apparatus, the transfer bias condition to obtain good reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions was examined. As the recording sheet , duodecimo paper of LEATHAC 66 (a trade name) (manufactured by Tokush Paper Kabushiki Kaisha) having a ream weight of 260 kg was used. LEATHAC 66 is paper having a higher degree of surface roughness than \u2018SAZANAMI\u2019. As the toner, a mixture of Y toner having an average grain diameter of 6.8 \u03bcm and a small amount of K toner was used. In the transfer test apparatus, since the transfer bias is applied to a rear surface of the recording sheet, the polarity of the transfer bias capable of transferring the toner onto the recording sheet is opposite to that of the printer according to the reference example (that is, a positive polarity). As the AC component of the transfer bias composed of the superimposed bias, an AC component having a sinusoidal waveform was used. The toner layer  was transferred onto the recording sheet  in an amount of attached toner of 0.4 mg\/cmto 0.5 mg\/cm, while the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp was changed from 400 V to 2600 V in units of 200 V in a state that the frequency f of the AC component was fixed at 500 Hz and the DC voltage (corresponding to the offset voltage Voff in the present example) was fixed at 200 V. As a result, on condition that the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp was set at 800 V or less, the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions became lower than Level 4, but on condition that the Vpp was set within a range of 900 V to 2200 V, the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions became Level 4 or higher. Even in the transfer test apparatus, similarly to the print test apparatus, under the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>Voff\u2019, the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions could be made up to an allowable level. On condition that the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp was set at 2400 V, the reproducibility of the densities of the recessed portions was an allowable level, but white dots exceeding an allowable level occurred.","Next, the microscope  was focused on the toner layer  on the transparent substrate , and the behavior of the toner was shot on condition that the DC voltage (corresponding to the offset voltage Voff in the present example) was set at 200 V and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp was set at 1000 V, that is, under the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019. Then, the following phenomenon was observed. That is, toner particles in the toner layer  reciprocates between the transparent substrate  and the recording sheet  by alternating electric fields formed by the AC component of the transfer bias, and as the number of times of the reciprocation increases, the amount of reciprocating toner particles increases. Specifically, in the transfer nip, for every one period (1\/f) of the AC component of the transfer bias, the alternating electric fields acts once, such that the toner particles reciprocate once. In the first one period, as shown in , only toner particles existing on the surface of the toner layer  escape from the layer. Then, the toner particles enter the recessed portions of the recording sheet  and then return to the toner layer . At this time, the returned toner particles hit other toner particles of the toner layer  such that the adhesion of the hit toner particles to the toner layer  and the transparent substrate  is weakened. Therefore, in the next one period, as shown in , more toner particles than those in the previous one period escape from the toner layer . Then, the toner particles enter the recessed portions of the recording sheet , and then return to the toner layer  again. At this time, the returned toner particles hit other toner particles still remaining in the toner layer  such that the adhesion of the hit toner particles to the toner layer  and the transparent substrate  is weakened. Therefore, in the next one period, as shown in , further more toner particles than those in the previous one period escape from the toner layer . In this way, whenever toner particles reciprocate, the number of toner particles gradually increases. It could be found that, by doing so, a sufficient amount of toner had been transferred when the nip transit time had elapsed (a time corresponding to the nip transit time had elapsed in the transfer test apparatus).","Meanwhile, on condition that the DC voltage was set at 200 V and the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp was set at 800 V, that is, on condition that \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 is not satisfied, the behavior of the toner was shot, and the following phenomenon was observed. That is, among the toner particles of the toner layer , toner particles existing on the surface of the layer escaped from the layer and entered the recessed portions of the recording sheet P in the first one period. However, thereafter, the entered toner particles remained in the recessed portions without going toward the toner layer . When the next one period came, toner particles that newly escaped from the toner layer  and entered the recessed portions were very few. Therefore, at a time point when the nip transit time elapsed, only a small amount of toner particles had been transferred into the recessed portions of the recording sheet P.","As described above, it could be found that the phenomenon as shown in  was caused by satisfying the condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019, thereby transferring a sufficient amount of toner into the recessed portions of the recording sheet P. Also, in order to cause the phenomenon as shown in , it is required to make the toner particles reciprocate at least twice in the transfer nip. For this reason, it is required to set the nip transit time to twice or more the period of the AC component. Preferably, as described already, it is preferable to make the alternating electric fields act 4 times or more in the transfer nip (f>(4\/d)\u00d7v).","Third Print Test","As the recording sheet P, instead of SAZANAMI, duodecimo paper of LEATHAC 66 (a trade name) (manufactured by Tokush Paper Kabushiki Kaisha) having a ream weight of 260 kg was used. The basis weight of the duodecimo paper of LEATHAC 66 having the ream weight of 260 kg becomes 302 g\/m. Currently, in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, the maximum paper thickness in design is generally set to a basis weight of 300 g\/m. In other words, the duodecimo paper of LEATHAC 66 having a ream weight of 260 kg is paper having the general maximum paper thickness which the image forming apparatus can handle and a high degree of surface roughness like the Japanese paper. On condition that the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp was set at 6 kV and the offset voltage Voff was set at 1 kV, a print test was conducted by using the duodecimo paper of LEATHAC 66 having the ream weight of 260 kg. This print test satisfies the above-mentioned condition of \u2018\u00bc\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019. Nevertheless, sufficient image densities could not be obtained at some of the recessed portions of the sheet surface. Causes for which there is a difference from the second print test were only the paper thickness or a depth of the roughness. From this, it could be found that, even when the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp is set higher than four times the absolute value of the offset voltage Voff, if a sheet having a comparatively large thickness or a comparatively high degree of surface roughness is used as the recording sheet P, sufficient image densities are not obtained at the recessed portions on the sheet surface.","Fourth Print Test","Next, black solid images were tested under various potential conditions by using the duodecimo paper of LEATHAC 66 having the ream weight of 260 kg. The frequency f of the AC component of the superimposed bias was fixed at 500 Hz. Also, the process linear velocity v was fixed at 282 mm\/s.

As for measurement points, the surface of a recording sheet was observed with a microscope and five points to be areas to be tested were selected at random from the entire surface. With respect to each of the points, the maximum cross-section height Pt (JIP B 0601: 2001) of a cross-section curve was measured on condition that the an evaluation length was set at 20 mm and a reference length was set at 20 mm. Then, among the obtained five maximum cross-section heights Pt, an average value of the top three was obtained. The above processes were performed on the same kind of three recording sheets, and an average of average values of the three sheets was obtained as the maximum depth of the roughness.","Next, a characteristic configuration of a printer according to a first embodiment will be described. Unless otherwise stated, the configuration of the printer according to the first embodiment is the same as that of the printer according to the reference example. In the printer according to the first embodiment, the condition of \u2018\u2159\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 is provided as the potential difference between the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  and the cored bar of the nip forming roller , and the secondary transfer bias power supply  is configured as a potential difference generating unit to apply the secondary transfer bias such that the potential of the cored bar of the nip forming roller  is larger than the potential of the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  on the opposite polarity side to the charged polarity of the toner. Therefore, as the inventors clarified in the tests, regardless of the thickness and the maximum depth of the roughness of the recording sheet P, it is possible to make a light-and-shade pattern according to the surface roughness of the sheet hardly noticeable as compared to the related art. Here, the secondary transfer bias is for causing the potential difference in any one of the above-mentioned six manners, and includes not only a bias applied to only any one of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  and the nip forming roller  but also biases respectively applied to both sides.","Also, in the printer according to the first embodiment, the frequency f of the AC component of the secondary transfer bias, the nip width d [mm] of the secondary transfer nip, and the process linear velocity v which is the belt surface movement velocity are set such that a condition of \u2018f [Hz]>(4\/d)\u00d7v\u2019 is satisfied. This setting makes it possible to prevent occurrence of the pitch irregularity, as described already.","In the print test apparatus used in the test, a toner image potential Vtoner which is the potential of a single-color solid toner image (1 cm\u00d71 cm) during power-up is about \u221280 V. It is required to make the absolute value of the offset voltage Voff larger than the toner image potential Vtoner.","The toner image potential Vtoner can be obtained as follows. That is, in a case of forming a black toner image, the surface potential of a black solid image is referred to as the toner image potential Vtoner. Here, the black solid image is an image in which each pixel of the entire area of 1 cm\u00d71 cm has a black pixel value. The black solid image has the same image structure as a solid image obtained by printing an all-black image made in a monochrome grayscale mode with Photoshop (a registered trademark), which is image software manufactured by Adobe Systems Inc., from a PostScript correspondence printer driver. Meanwhile, in a case of forming a color image, a surface potential of a toner layer on the belt when a two-color solid image with superimposed magenta and cyan is overlappingly transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt  is referred to as the toner image potential Vtoner. In this case, the two-color solid image is an image having the same image structure as a toner image (the same laser writing) when a superimposed image of an all-magenta image and an all-cyan image made in a CMYK color mode with Photoshop manufactured by Adobe Systems Inc. is printed. A reason for making the two-color solid image have the same image structure as the solid image made with Photoshop manufactured by Adobe Systems Inc. is that PostScript is the most general data standard used for DTP and the like.","The white dots due to the discharge occur when the peak-to-peak voltage Vpp is relatively large and |Voff| is relatively large. This corresponds to a case that a peak value Vt (see ) having a polarity for moving the toner from the intermediate transfer belt  side to the recording sheet P is relatively large. It can be considered that the peak value Vt expressed as Equation of \u2018|Vt|=|Voff|+|Vr|\u2019 is associated with occurrence of the white dots due to the discharge. From , in a case that the polarities of the Vt and the Voff are negative, since \u2018Vt=\u2212\u00bd\u00d7Vpp+Voff\u2019 is satisfied, a relation of \u2018Voff=\u00bd\u00d7Vpp+Vt\u2019 is established. Meanwhile, since the straight line L shown in  is expressed as Equation of \u2018Voff=\u00bd\u00d7Vpp\u22124.55\u2019, it can be said that noticeable white dots are generated in an area in which the Vt is \u22124.55 kV or greater.","The inventors of the present invention checked generated voltages of abnormal images caused by discharge under a plurality of conditions having the minimum Voffmin of the Voff of an area in which good images are obtained, and, as a result, found that the Vt is associated with the occurrence of the white dots due to the discharge, as expected, and the maximum Vtmax and the minimum Voffmin of the peak value Vt capable of keeping the occurrence of the white dots at an allowable level is represented as a relational expression of \u2018Vtmax=1.7\u00d7Voffmin\u22123.1\u2019. Considering a case of using toner having a positive polarity as the toner, it is preferable to satisfy a relational expression of \u2018|Vtmax|=1.7\u00d7|Voffmin|+3.1\u2019 which is a modification of the above-mentioned relational expression.","Further, in the printer according to the first embodiment, the secondary transfer bias power supply  is configured to apply a bias satisfying the relational expression of \u2018|Vtmax|=1.7\u00d7|Voffmin|+3.1\u2019 as the secondary transfer bias.","In the present invention, the volume resistivities and resistances of the intermediate transfer belt , the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , and the nip forming roller  are not limited to those of the first embodiment. However, if the resistances are excessively high, since charge given to the surfaces of the members by discharge or the like is accumulated and the electric field changes with time, it is not preferable. In a case that a unit for removing the charge is not provided, it is preferable to use members having volume resistivities of 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less as the intermediate transfer belt , the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller , and the nip forming roller .","In non-contact transfer using a corotron or the like which does not form a nip, a condition of \u2018\u2159\u00d7Vpp>(hourly averaged value of wire potential difference)\u2019 similar to the condition of \u2018\u2159\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 may be satisfied. However, the case of the corotron is completely different from the present invention in that an AC component is used for only generating ions from wires and reciprocation of toner as described above does not occur. The inventors of the present invention conducted the followings so as to confirm that reciprocation of toner does not occur in the non-contact transfer of the corotron or the like. That is, a PET film having one side with an aluminum layer deposited thereon was prepared. The PET film was disposed on the corotron with the aluminum surface facing a toner side (intermediate transfer belt side), and a change of the potential of the aluminum layer with time was measured. The potential of the aluminum layer was measured by using Model 344 that was a surface electrometer manufactured by Trek Inc. As a result, any change of the potential supporting reciprocation of toner was not confirmed.","Until now, the example in which the secondary transfer nip is formed by bringing the intermediate transfer belt  and the nip forming roller  into contact with each other has been described. However, the secondary transfer nip may be formed by bringing the intermediate transfer belt  and an endless nip forming belt into contract with each other. In this case, between the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  disposed on the inside of the loop of the intermediate transfer belt  and a cored bar of a pressing roller which is a pressing member pressing the nip forming belt toward the intermediate transfer belt  on the inside of a loop of the nip forming belt, a potential difference may be generated to satisfy the condition of \u2018\u2159\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 and to make a potential of the cored bar of the pressing roller larger than the potential of the cored bar of the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  on the opposite polarity side to the charged polarity of the toner.","Also, the example in which the present invention is applied to the secondary transfer nip formed by bringing the intermediate transfer belt  which is an image carrier and the nip forming roller  which is a nip forming member into contact with each other has been described. However, it is possible to apply the present invention to a transfer nip which is formed by bringing a rear-surface abutting member into contact with a rear surface of an endless-belt-shaped photosensitive element which is an image carrier, pressing the rear-surface abutting member toward the endless-belt-shaped photosensitive element, and bringing the photosensitive element into contact with a nip forming member, and feeding a recording material through there so as to transfer an image on the photosensitive element onto the recording material.","The present invention can also be applied to a secondary transfer nip of a printer having the configuration as shown in . This printer includes developing units Y, M, C, and Bk for Y, M, C, and Bk around one photosensitive element . In a case of performing image formation, first, the surface of the photosensitive element  is uniformly charged by a charging unit , and then a laser beam modulated on the basis of image data for Y is irradiated onto the surface of the photosensitive element , thereby forming an electrostatic latent image for Y on the surface of the photosensitive element. Then, the Y electrostatic latent image is developed by a developing unit Y, so as to obtain a Y toner image, which is primarily transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt . Next, transfer residual toner on the surface of the photosensitive element  is removed by a drum cleaning unit , and then the surface of the photosensitive element  is uniformly recharged by the charging unit . Next, a laser beam modulated on the basis of image data for M is irradiated onto the surface of the photosensitive element , thereby forming an electrostatic latent image for M on the surface of the photosensitive element . Then, the M electrostatic latent image is developed by a developing unit M, so as to obtain an M toner image. Then, the M toner image is primarily transferred to overlap the Y toner image on the intermediate transfer belt . Thereafter, in the same way, a C toner image and a K toner image obtained through development on the photosensitive element  are sequentially primarily transferred to be superimposed on the YM toner image on the intermediate transfer belt . As a result, a four-color superimposed toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt .","Next, the four-color superimposed toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  is secondarily transferred onto a surface of a recording sheet at the secondary transfer nip at once, whereby a full-color image is formed on the recording sheet. Then, the full-color image is fixed to the recording sheet by a fixing unit , and then the recording sheet is discharged to the outside of the apparatus.","In the printer having the above-mentioned configuration, the secondary transfer bias power supply  may be configured like that of the reference example.","The examples in which the present invention is applied to the electrophotographic printers have been described. However, the present invention can also be applied to an image forming apparatus for forming an image by a toner scattering type. This toner scattering type is a type that directly attaches toner groups scattered in dots from a toner scattering device to a recording sheet or an intermediate recording element without using a latent-image carrier, thereby directly forming a toner image on the recording sheet or the intermediate recording element. The toner scattering type is used for an image forming apparatus disclosed Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-307737 and the like. The present invention can be applied to a transfer nip for transferring the toner image from the intermediate recording element which is an image carrier to the recording sheet.","Next, a printer according to a second embodiment will be described.

In the latent image potential measuring process, first, patch-shaped electrostatic latent images having a size of 1 cm by 1 cm are formed on the photosensitive elements Y, M, C, and K, and the potentials of the patch-shaped electrostatic latent images are detected by the potential sensors Y, M, C, and K. Then, the detection results are stored in a data storing unit such as a RAM. The transfer bias power supplies Y, M, C, and K calculate the potential differences, which make relation of \u2018\u2159\u00d7Vpp>|Voff|\u2019 be satisfied and make the potentials of the cored bars of the transfer rollers larger than the potentials of the electrostatic latent images on the photosensitive elements on the opposite polarity side to the charged polarity of the toner, on the basis of the potentials of the patch-shaped electrostatic latent images of Y, M, C, and K transmitted from the control unit. Then, the transfer bias power supplies Y, M, C, and K output transfer biases (superimposed biases) to make it possible to obtain the calculation results.","The embodiments described above are merely illustrative, and the present invention has specific effects for each of the following aspects.","Aspect A","In an aspect A, as an image carrier, an intermediate transfer element such as an intermediate transfer belt which faces a latent image carrier such as a photosensitive element and on which a toner image developed on the latent image carrier is primarily transferred is used. Also, as a nip forming member, the nip forming roller  or the like is used which is in contact with a front surface of the intermediate transfer element so as to form a secondary transfer nip together with the intermediate transfer element. Further, as a first member, a rear-surface abutting member such as the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  or the like being in contact with a rear surface of the intermediate transfer element at a secondary transfer nip is used. Furthermore, the nip forming member is also used as a second member. With this configuration, between the nip forming member and the intermediate transfer element, regardless of the thickness and maximum depth of a recording sheet P, sufficient image densities can be obtained at recessed portions on the surface of the sheet.","Aspect B","In an aspect B, a transfer bias applying unit such as the secondary transfer bias power supply  is configured to apply, as a transfer bias, a bias satisfying a relation of \u2018f>(4\/d)\u00d7v\u2019 among a frequency f [Hz] of an AC component, a nip width d [mm] which is a contact length of an image carrier and the nip forming member in a surface movement direction of the image carrier at the transfer nip, or a contact length of an intermediate transfer element and the nip forming member in a surface movement direction of the intermediate transfer element at a secondary transfer nip, and a surface movement velocity v [mm\/s] of the image carrier or the intermediate transfer element. With this configuration, as described above, it is possible to obtain good images without pitch irregularity.","Aspect C","In an aspect C, there are provided a nip forming member being in contact with a front surface of an image carrier such as an intermediate transfer belt so as to form a transfer nip, a rear-surface abutting member such as the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  being in contact with a rear surface of the image carrier, and a voltage output unit such as the secondary transfer bias power supply  outputting a voltage to cause a potential difference including a DC component and an AC component between the nip forming member or a pressing member pressing the nip forming member toward the image carrier, and the rear-surface abutting member by the output voltage therefrom. Then, a toner image carried on a front surface of the image carrier is transferred to a recording sheet inserted into the transfer nip. Even in this configuration, regardless of the thickness and maximum depth of the roughness of a recording sheet, sufficient image densities can be obtained at recessed portions on the surface of the sheet.","Aspect D","In an aspect D, the potential difference is caused between a cored bar of the nip forming member or a cored bar of the pressing member pressing the nip forming member toward the image carrier, and a cored bar of the rear-surface abutting member, in the aspect C. With this configuration, in a recording sheet on which the toner image is transferred therebetween, regardless of the thickness and maximum depth of the roughness of the sheet, sufficient image densities can be obtained at recessed portions on the surface of the sheet.","Aspect E","An aspect E uses an intermediate transfer element having a front surface on which a toner image developed on a surface of a latent image carrier such as a photosensitive element is primarily transferred, as the image carrier in the aspect C or the aspect D. Also, as the nip forming member, the nip forming roller  or the like being in contact with the front surface of the intermediate transfer element so as to form a secondary transfer nip is used. Further, a voltage output from a voltage output unit such as the secondary transfer bias power supply  is applied to at least any one of (i) a rear-surface abutting member such as the secondary-transfer rear-surface roller  being in contact with the rear surface of the intermediate transfer element and (ii) the nip forming member, thereby causing the potential difference. Even in this configuration, as for a recording sheet on which the toner image is transferred between the intermediate transfer element and the nip forming member, regardless of the thickness and maximum depth of the roughness of the sheet, sufficient image densities can be obtained at recessed portions on the surface of the sheet.","Aspect F","In an aspect F, a voltage output unit such as the secondary transfer bias power supply  is configured to output a voltage satisfying a relation of \u2018f>(4\/d)\u00d7v\u2019 among a frequency f [Hz] of an AC component, a nip width d [mm] which is a contact length of an image carrier and the nip forming member in a surface movement direction of the image carrier at the transfer nip, or a contact length of an intermediate transfer element and the nip forming member in a surface movement direction of the intermediate transfer element at a secondary transfer nip, and a surface movement velocity v [mm\/s] of the image carrier or the intermediate transfer element, as the voltage in any one of the aspects C, D, and E. With this configuration, as described above, it is possible to obtain good images without pitch irregularity.","According to the invention, as clarified by the inventors through tests, sufficient image densities can be obtained at recessed portions of a surface of a recording member.","Although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments for a complete and clear disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art that fairly fall within the basic teaching herein set forth."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
