title: Extensible tree views for managing datacenter resources
abstract: A method for a GUI for client software that is a part of an application program for managing datacenter resources includes receiving as input one or more specifications, where each specification includes a hierarchy of queries. The method also includes determining one or more target data sources for each query in each hierarchy. Additionally, the method includes issuing the query to each target data source determined for the query, after adapting the query to a format that is acceptable to the target data source. The method further includes receiving the results of each query from the target data source, integrates the results into a hierarchy, and submitting the hierarchy to the client software for display in a tree view in the GUI.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An application program for managing a datacenter runs on a server and can be accessed through a network by a system administrator with a client device such as a laptop computer running client software with a graphical user interface (GUI). Often, the GUI for the client software is integrated with web-browser functionality.","The application program for managing a datacenter enables the management (including load balancing) of many host servers running many virtual machines each having many virtual storage devices such as virtual disks or virtual network interface controllers (NICs).","Multiple object models in the form of graphs can be used to represent the physical resources (e.g., datacenters, host servers, etc.) and virtual resources (e.g., virtual machines, virtual disks, etc.) managed by an application program for managing datacenter resources. In these graphs, a node might represent a resource (e.g., a host server) and an edge between nodes might represent a relationship between resources (e.g., between a host server and a virtual machine). Of course, such graphs tend to be complex, both in terms of the number of nodes involved and in terms of the number of edges between those nodes. Consequently, the graphs do not lend themselves to extensible display in a GUI.","The first example embodiment provides a method for a GUI for client software that is a part of an application program for managing datacenter resources. The method includes receiving as inputs two object models represented as graphs whose nodes are data elements and whose edges are relationships between data elements. The method filters a tree model from the two graphs using one or more specifications, where each specification contains a hierarchy of queries. Then the method displays the tree model in a tree view in the GUI. In this embodiment, the method generates a single tree from two or more models, where references between the two or more models are merged.","The second example embodiment also provides a method for a GUI for client software that is a part of an application program for managing datacenter resources. The method includes receiving as input one or more specifications, where each specification includes a hierarchy of queries. The method determines one or more target data sources for each query in each hierarchy. Then the method issues the query to each target data source determined for the query, after adapting the query to a format that is acceptable to the target data source. The method then receives the results of the query from the target data source and submits the results as a hierarchy for display in a tree view in the GUI.","In the third example embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium with an executable program stored thereon, is provided. The program instructs a microprocessor to perform the following operations: receiving as inputs two object models represented as graphs whose nodes are data elements and whose edges are relationships between data elements, filtering a tree model from the two graphs using one or more specifications, where each specification contains a hierarchy of queries, displaying the tree model in a tree view in the GUI, and generating a single tree from two or more models, where references between the two or more models are merged.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the example embodiments may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail, if already well known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","101","102","102","101","102","101","102"]},"Additionally, the virtual machine manager  has access through a bus and\/or network to virtual\/physical storage . In an example embodiment, the network might be a storage area network (SAN).","In the example depicted in , virtual machine manager  is also connected by a network to three host servers (, , and ), each of which might also include volatile memory, persistent storage, and an x86-family microprocessor connected by one or more buses, as well as an associated operating system such as Windows\u2122, Linux\u2122, or MacOS\u2122. Additionally, each host server  might be running virtualization software, which enables the creation and execution of a virtual machine running a guest operating system (e.g., Windows\u2122, Linux\u2122, or MacOS\u2122), in an example embodiment.","In an example embodiment, the specification processor described below might be a part of the client software  and the tree view described below might be part of the GUI for the client software . However, in another example embodiment, the specification processor might be a part of a virtual machine manager  with which the client software  interfaces through an API. Also, in an example embodiment, the data sources described below might stored on virtual\/physical storage .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As depicted in , GUI view  includes tree view  as a child view. A location (e.g., LDGANVC45) is the root node  of the tree or outline depicted in the tree view . The child node  of the root node  is a datacenter (e.g., New Datacenter). In turn, the child node  had two children of its own, child node and child node . Child node represents a cluster of hosts (e.g., a cluster of hypervisor hosts). Child node represents host (e.g., a hypervisor). At the leaf level of the tree or outline depicted in tree view  are two virtual machines, e.g., vm which is a child of node and vm which is a child of node . Child node also has a host as a leaf node. In one embodiment, the content of these subnodes (that is, the children of the subnodes such as \u201ccluster\u201d) come from different vendors, entities or authors. These content and their format may not be known at the time of designing of GUI view .","As indicated above, tree view  might be displayed by a GUI for the client software , in an example embodiment. In another example embodiment, tree view  might be displayed by a GUI for virtual machine manager .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","301","1","301"]},"It will be appreciated that the specifications  might have different authors, in an example embodiment. Thus, the author of one of the specifications might be a developer who designs and implements the GUI for the client software  or the developer who designs and implements the virtual machine manager . The author of another one of the specifications might be the user. And the author of yet another one of the specifications might be a third-party developer who enhances the client software  or the virtual machine manager , e.g., with a plug-in for a web browser. That is to say, a specification might be authored by any person with adequate knowledge of the datacenter's object models or associated graphs persistently stored in the data sources (e.g., data source or data source ).","Moreover, in an alternative example embodiment, the underlying application program might not be a virtual machine manager, but rather an application program that manages virtual resources other than virtual machines, e.g., virtual storage. Or the application program might be an application program that manages physical storage.","In operation  of the sequence shown in , the specification processor  might adapt a query from one of the specifications so that it is in a format acceptable to the data source associated with the query. For example, a query might be written in XQuery\/XPath but the data source associated with the query might be a Structured Query Language (SQL) database instead of an XML database. The specification processor  would translate the query from XQuery\/XPath to a SQL command (or more generally, an API call) before proceeding to operation  of the sequence. It will be appreciated that two or more XQuery\/XPath queries might result in only a single SQL command, e.g., through the use of relational algebra. Similarly, a single XQuery\/XPath query might result in two or more SQL commands. That is to say, the relationship between queries and API calls can be one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.","In operation  of the sequence shown in , the specification processor issues a call to an API associated with a data source. As depicted in , API is associated with data source and API is associated with data source . As suggested earlier, data source might include data that is different from the data in data source , both in terms of format and in terms of content. For example, data source might be a SQL database and data source might be an XML database, e.g., XML-enabled or native XML. In operation  of the sequence, the specification processor  receives the results (e.g., which might be the requested data or a Boolean value indicating absence of the requested data) from the API calls made in operation .","In operation  of the sequence shown in , the specification processor might combine data received from disparate data sources before creating the hierarchy to populate a tree (or outline) view. Then in operation  of the sequence, the specification transmits the hierarchy to other modules in the client software for display in a tree view in the client software's GUI.","Here it will be appreciated that there might be other uses for the hierarchy than populating a tree view in a GUI. That is to say, the hierarchy might be used as an intermediate representation that is input into another process (e.g., a process which performs a search) that does not involve the display of a view or even the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["102","101","401","402"]},"In operation , the specification processor determines one or more target data sources (e.g., XML database or SQL database) for each query in each specification. Then in operation , the specification processor issues the query to each target data source, adapting the format of the query to a format that is acceptable to the target data source. Here, it will be appreciated that the query might be unchanged from the query in the specification, as described in greater detail below. Alternatively, the query might be translated to an API call as discussed earlier. Or the query might be combined with other queries by the specification processor, using, for example, a relational algebra.","In operation , the specification processor receives the query results from each target data source. As noted above, the results might be data values (including character strings as described below) or Boolean values that indicate the absence of data values. Then in operation , the specification processor integrates and submits the results as a hierarchy for display in tree view in a GUI by, for example, client software for an application program that manages datacenter resources. Here it will be appreciated that integration might involve inserting data at various locations into a hierarchy that can be used to populate the tree view. In an example embodiment described below, this hierarchy might be driven by the initial specification and the subsequent specification that extends the initial specification. Also in an example embodiment, other modules (e.g., window modules) in the client software might be responsible for the actual display of the hierarchy assembled by the specification processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 5","i":["a ","e "],"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":"501"},"Data source , also shown in , is an XML database whose file is identified as Authors.xml.

The inventions also relate to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus may be specially constructed for that purpose or it may be a general-purpose computer selectively activated or configured by a computer program stored in the computer. In particular, various general-purpose machines may be used with computer programs written in accordance with the teachings herein or it may be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the operations.","The inventions can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include hard drives, network attached storage (NAS), read-only memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, magnetic tapes, and other optical and non-optical data storage devices. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over a network-coupled computer system so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.","It will be further appreciated that the instructions represented by the operations in the above figures are not required to be performed in the order illustrated and that all of the processing represented by the operations might not be necessary to practice the inventions. Further, the processes described in any of the above figures can also be implemented in software stored in any one of or combinations of the RAM, the ROM, or the hard disk drive.","Although the foregoing inventions have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications can be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
