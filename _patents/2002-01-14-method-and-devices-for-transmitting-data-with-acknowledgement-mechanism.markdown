title: Method and devices for transmitting data with acknowledgement mechanism
abstract: A first unit successively transmits data blocks destined for a second unit. For at least some of the transmissions of blocks, the second unit returns an acknowledgement signal indicating whether the data block transmitted has been correctly received. The first unit transmits a redundancy block with regard to a block previously transmitted for which the acknowledgement signal received indicates incorrect reception. Each block transmitted is accompanied by an identification signal indicating whether it is a redundancy block. The first unit associates each acknowledgement signal received with a block transmitted in a temporal relation determined with the reception of this acknowledgement signal. In response to the reception of an identification signal inconsistent with an acknowledgement signal previously returned, the second unit returns to the first unit a restart command signal for the transmission of the blocks.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to techniques for data transmission using acknowledgement mechanisms within the framework of automatic repeat request (ARQ) procedures.","It applies in particular, but not exclusively, to the hybrid (HARQ) ARQ procedures provided for in certain mobile radio communication systems.","In these techniques, the data are sent in blocks, and the receiver unit returns acknowledgement signals to the transmitting unit indicating which blocks have been improperly received and\/or properly received. The acknowledgement may be positive (the properly received blocks are signalled), negative (the blocks not received, or received with insufficient reliability, are signalled) or binary (for each block, the receiving unit returns a positive or negative acknowledgement). After having tagged an improperly received block, the transmitting unit can effect a repetition of this block so as to palliate its initial improper reception, or send redundancy information so as to increase the probability of detection of the data.","Here the term \u201cblock\u201d should be understood to mean the data unit forming the subject of an acknowledgement. It should be noted that such a data block can be sent in the form of several separate packets, on different physical resources or at different instants on the same physical resource.","Usually, the blocks sent are numbered, the number being present in a block header. The acknowledgement then identifies by its number the block to which it pertains. The transmitting unit therefore unambiguously identifies the blocks which are to form the subject of repeats.","In certain cases, the sequence number is not available at the level of the module of the receiving unit which processes the acknowledgement mechanism. This may occur when the acknowledgement mechanism is implemented in low layers of the OSI model, in particular in the physical layer.","In such a case, the identification of the blocks acknowledged positively or negatively can result from a certain synchronism between the receiving and transmitting units. Given that the acknowledgement signal relating to a block will be received in a time span determined after the transmission of this block, the transmitting unit can effect the association allowing it to determine the repeats to be performed.","It may happen that a transmission error adversely affects the acknowledgement signal returned by the receiving unit with respect to a block. For example, if a negative acknowledgement returned by the receiving unit is interpreted as a positive acknowledgement by the transmitting unit, the latter transmits a new block when the receiving unit waits for a repeat of the block previously improperly received.","This type of error poses a difficulty in the HARQ procedures in which, when the receiving unit receives a block improperly, it combines this reception (insufficient by itself) with the reception of the repeated or redundant block. Reception diversity is thus obtained, increasing the probability of proper reception of the data. However, an ambiguity regarding the identity of a block sent (sending of a new block or repeat) then leads to false recombinations. These errors are liable to persist since the receiving unit continues to request the resending of the ambiguous block.","It should be noted that various types of repetition and of combination of the repeated blocks may be used (see for example, WO 00\/62467):\n\n","To alleviate the difficulties related to possible improper reception of the acknowledgement signal, there may be provision for the transmitting unit to transmit with each block an indication regarding the type of this block, namely newly sent block or redundancy block subsequent to a negative acknowledgement.","When an acknowledgement signal is improperly received or improperly interpreted by the transmitting unit, this indication allows the receiving unit to be aware that a signalling error is involved. Nevertheless, an ambiguity regarding the nature of this error remains since the receiving unit cannot know whether the error has not occurred in the course of the sending of the block type indication. Given that the block accompanying the indication in accordance with which the receiving unit identifies an error is not the same depending on the direction of transmission in which this error is involved, the combining schemes, hard or soft, are also flawed.","An object of the present invention is to propose an acknowledgement and redundancy mechanism which limits the ambiguities regarding the identification of the blocks sent.","The invention thus proposes a method of transmitting data, wherein a first unit successively transmits data blocks destined for a second unit on a channel, and for at least some of the transmissions of blocks, the second unit returns an acknowledgement signal to the first unit, indicating whether the data block transmitted has been correctly received. The first unit transmits on said channel a redundancy block with regard to at least some of each block previously transmitted for which the acknowledgement signal received indicates incorrect reception, each block transmitted being accompanied by an identification signal indicating whether said block is a redundancy block. The first unit associates each acknowledgement signal received with a block transmitted in a temporal relation determined with the reception of said acknowledgement signal. In at least some of the cases of reception of an identification signal inconsistent with an acknowledgement signal previously returned, the second unit returns to the first unit a command signal for restarting the transmission of the blocks.","When the second (receiving) unit detects an inconsistency between an identification signal and an acknowledgement signal which it has previously returned, it signals it to the first (transmitting) unit, so that the sending of the blocks can restart on unambiguous bases.","Several modes of restart may be adopted.","In a first mode, one seeks to avoid any loss of block, so that the transmitting unit holds in memory any block which it has transmitted until the positive acknowledgement of the block is confirmed by the absence of reception of a restart command signal liable to cast doubt on this acknowledgement. In response to the reception of a restart command signal subsequent to the reception by the second unit of an identification signal inconsistent with the acknowledgement signal returned with regard to a first data block, the first unit then restarts the transmission of the successive blocks from said first data block.","In a second mode, one seeks rather to avoid delays in the sending of the sequence of blocks, by accepting that a few losses of block may occur. In response to the reception of a restart command signal subsequent to the reception by the second unit of an identification signal inconsistent with the acknowledgement signal returned with regard to a first data block, the first unit then restarts the transmission of the successive blocks from a data block following said first data block.","In an advantageous embodiment, the blocks are transmitted in turn over K subchannels, the first unit comprising K buffer memories wherein are temporarily recorded the data blocks respectively transmitted over the K subchannels, K being a number at least equal to 1 determined in such a way that the acknowledgement signal relating to a data block transmitted over one of the K subchannels is received before the transmission of the next block over said subchannel, said next block being a redundancy block with regard to said data block transmitted when the acknowledgement signal received indicates incorrect reception. When K=1, the ARQ procedure is of the \u201cstop-and-wait\u201d type. It is possible to take K=2 to increase the transmission throughput or K>2 if the propagation and processing delays are relatively large.","In the first mode of restart, the buffer memories may have a capacity of two data blocks. In the second mode, they may have a capacity of one block.","Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a device for transmitting data, comprising means for transmitting successive data blocks destined for a remote unit and means for receiving an acknowledgement signal returned by the remote unit and indicating whether a data block transmitted has been correctly received, the means for transmitting blocks being arranged so as to transmit a redundancy block with regard to at least some of each block previously transmitted for which the acknowledgement signal received indicates incorrect reception, each acknowledgement signal received being associated with a block transmitted in a temporal relation determined with the reception of said acknowledgement signal. The device furthermore comprises means for transmitting an identification signal accompanying each block transmitted and indicating whether said block is a redundancy block, the means for transmitting blocks being arranged so as to restart the transmission of the blocks in response to the reception of a restart command signal originating from the remote unit and indicating an inconsistency between an identification signal received and an acknowledgement signal previously returned by the remote unit.","A third aspect of the invention pertains to a device for receiving data in the form of data blocks successively transmitted by a remote unit on a channel, comprising means for receiving an identification signal accompanying each block transmitted and indicating whether said block transmitted is a redundancy block, and means for transmitting an acknowledgement signal returned to the remote unit and indicating whether a data block transmitted has been correctly received, a redundancy block being transmitted by the remote unit with regard to each block previously transmitted for which the acknowledgement signal received indicates incorrect reception. The receiving device furthermore comprises means for transmitting a restart command signal for the transmission of the blocks which is returned to the remote unit in at least some of the cases of reception of an identification signal inconsistent with an acknowledgement signal previously returned to the remote unit.","The invention is described below in its application to a UMTS network operating in FDD (frequency division duplex) mode.  shows the architecture of such a UMTS network.","The mobile service switches , belonging to a core network (CN), are linked on the one hand to one or more fixed networks  and on the other hand, by means of a so-called Iu interface, to control equipment  or RNCs (\u201cRadio Network Controllers\u201d). Each RNC  is linked to one or more base stations  by means of a so-called Iub interface. The base stations , distributed over the territory covered by the network, are capable of communicating by radio with the mobile terminals , , called UE (\u201cUMTS Equipment\u201d). The base stations can be grouped together to form nodes called \u201cnode B\u201d. Certain RNCs  may furthermore communicate with one another by means of a so-called Iur interface. The RNCs and the base stations form an access network called UTRAN (\u201cUMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network\u201d).","The UTRAN comprises elements of layers  and  of the OSI model with a view to providing the links required on the radio interface (called Uu), and a stage A for controlling the radio resources (RRC, \u201cRadio Resource Control\u201d) belonging to layer , as is described in the 3G TS 25.301 technical specification \u201cRadio Interface Protocol\u201d version 3.2.0 published in October 1999 by the 3GPP (3Generation Partnership Project). As seen from of the higher layers, the UTRAN acts simply as a relay between the UE and the CN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["15","15","2","16","16","17","17","1","18","18","19","19","18","18"]},"Represented in the architecture of  is a layer  bis in which a procedure of HARQ type is implemented with regard to some of the transport channels. Considered below is the particular case, non-limiting, in which these channels subjected to the HARQ procedures are DSCH downlink shared channels useable within the framework of a service of HSDPA type (\u201cHigh-Speed Data Packet Access\u201d). The HARQ modules A, B of  may be seen as belonging to layer  or to layer  (in particular, they could form an extension of the MAC sublayer for the shared channels).","There are various ways of adapting the architecture of protocols according to  to the hardware architecture of the UTRAN according to , and in general various organizations can be adopted depending on the types of channels (see section 11.2 of the 3G TS 25.401 technical specification \u201cUTRAN Overall Description\u201d, version 3.1.0 published in January 2000 by the 3GPP). The RRC, RLC and MAC stages are located in the RNC . When several RNCs are involved, the MAC sublayer can be proportioned among these RNCs, with appropriate protocols for the exchanges on the Iur interface, for example ATM (\u201cAsynchronous Transfer Mode\u201d) and AAL2 (\u201cATM Adaptation Layer No. 2\u201d). These same protocols may also be employed on the Iub interface for the exchanges between the MAC sublayer and layer . In the embodiment described here, the HARQ modules A are situated in the nodes B.","Layers , bis and  are each commanded by the RRC sublayer, whose characteristics are described in the 3G TS25.331 technical specification \u201cRRC Protocol Specification\u201d, version 3.1.0 published in October 1999 by the 3GPP. The RRC stage A, B supervises the radio interface. Moreover, it processes streams to be transmitted to the remote station according to a \u201ccommand plan\u201d, as opposed to the \u201cuser plan\u201d which corresponds to the processing of the user data arising from layer .","The RLC sublayer is described in the 3G TS 25.322 technical specification \u201cRLC Protocol Specification\u201d, version 3.1.2 published in October 1999 by the 3GPP. In the transmit direction, the RLC stage A, B receives, according to the respective logical channels, data streams consisting of service data units (RLC-SDU) arising from layer . An RLC module of the stage A, B is associated with each logical channel so as in particular to perform a segmentation of the RLC-SDU units of the stream into protocol data units (RLC-PDU) addressed to the MAC sublayer and comprising an optional RLC header. In the receive direction, an RLC module conversely performs a reassembling of the RLC-SDU units of the logical channel from the data units received from the MAC sublayer.","Depending on the logical channels and under the command of the RRC stage, the RLC sublayer can render a service of transfer in transparent mode, in acknowledged mode or in non-acknowledged mode. In transparent mode, the RLC sublayer sends protocol data units (PDUs) of the higher layers without adding information, possibly with a segmentation and reassembly function. In the non-transparent modes, an RLC header comprising a sequence number is added to the data sent. An acknowledgement mechanism based on the sequence numbers placed in the RLC headers is provided in acknowledged mode.","The MAC sublayer is described in the 3G TS 25.321 technical specification \u201cMAC Protocol Specification\u201d, version 3.1.0 published in October 1999 by the 3GPP. It maps one or more logical channels onto one or more transport channels TrCH. In the transmit direction, the MAC stage A, B can multiplex one or more logical channels in one and the same transport channel. On such a transport channel, the MAC stage A, B delivers successive transport blocks TrBk each consisting of an optional MAC header and an RLC-PDU unit arising from an associated logical channel.","For each TrCH, the RRC sublayer provides the MAC sublayer with a set of transport formats (TFS, \u201cTransport Format Set\u201d). A transport format comprises a transmission time interval TTI equal to 10, 20, 40 or 80 ms, a transport block size, a transport block set size and parameters defining the protection scheme to be applied in the TrCH by layer  for detecting and correcting transmission errors. Depending on the current bit rate on the logical channel or channels associated with the TrCH, the MAC stage A, B selects a transport format from the TFS assigned by the RRC sublayer, and it delivers in each TTI a set of transport blocks complying with the selected format, whilst indicating this format to layer .","Layer  can multiplex several TrCHs on a given physical channel. In this case, the RRC sublayer assigns a set of combinations of transport formats (TFCS, \u201cTransport Format Combination Set\u201d) to the physical channel, and the MAC sublayer dynamically selects a combination of transport formats from this TFCS set, thereby defining the transport formats to be used in the various multiplexed TrCHs.","These transport formats define in particular the channel coding to be applied for the modules A, B so as to detect and\/or correct the transmission errors.","The channel coding mechanism used comprises in particular the adding of a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) to the transport blocks so as to detect errors in their transmission. This detection can also result from the error correcting decoder using turbo codes or convolutional codes. The module A, B of the receiving unit can thus identify blocks received incorrectly and inform the higher layers of this.","UMTS uses the spread spectrum CDMA technique, that is to say the symbols transmitted are multiplied by spreading codes consisting of samples called \u201cchips\u201d whose rate (3.84 Mchip\/s in the case of UMTS) is greater than that of the symbols transmitted. The spreading codes distinguish various physical channels PhCH which are superimposed on the same transmission resource consisting of a carrier frequency. The auto- and cross-correlation properties of the spreading codes enable the receiver to separate the PhCHs and to extract the symbols intended therefor. For UMTS in FDD mode on the downlink, a scrambling code is allocated to each base unit, and various physical channels used by this base station are distinguished by mutually orthogonal channel codes (channelization codes). The base station can also use several mutually orthogonal scrambling codes. On the uplink, the base station uses the scrambling code to separate the transmitting UEs, and possibly the channel code to separate the physical channels arising from one and the same UE. For each PhCH, the overall spreading code is the product of the channel code and the scrambling code. The spreading factor (equal to the ratio of the chip rate to the symbol rate) is a power of 2 lying between 4 and 512. This factor is chosen as a function of the bit rate of symbols to be transmitted on the PhCH. The various physical channels are organized in 10 ms frames which follow one another on the carrier frequency used by the base station. Each frame is subdivided into 15 time slots of 666 \u03bcs. Each slot can carry the superimposed contributions of one or more physical channels, comprising common channels and DPCH (\u201cDedicated Physical CHannel\u201d) dedicated channels. The contribution from a DPCH to a time slot in FDD mode comprises:\n\n","The DPCH can thus be viewed as aligning a physical channel dedicated for control, or DPCCH (\u201cDedicated Physical Control CHannel\u201d), corresponding to the TFCI, TPC and PL fields, and a physical channel dedicated for the data, or DPDCH (\u201cDedicated Physical Data CHannel\u201d), corresponding to the data fields.","The shared channels of DSCH type only exist in the downlink direction. A DSCH is a transport channel shared dynamically among several UEs. Layer  maps it onto one or more physical channels (PhCH), without applying macrodiversity (the DSCH is therefore sent only in one cell).","In FDD mode, the DSCH is defined as an extension of a dedicated transport channel (DCH). The allocation of the resources relating to the DSCH is signalled to each UE concerned by using the TFCI sent on the DPCCH of the dedicated channel. The TFCI thus carries the information according to which a given code of the DSCH must be listened to by the UE. As a variant, the information sent on the downlink DCH can specify that the UE must listen to the DSCH in a certain period and decode the addressing data contained in the blocks.","The HARQ procedure applied to the DSCH also requires exchanges of signalling between the node B and the UE. The DPCCHs of the dedicated uplink and downlink channels can be used to send this signalling information, especially by means of a particular coding of the states of the TFCI (provision may also be made for a specific field separate from the TFCI field).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","17","18","19"]},"In the downlink direction, the HARQ module A modifies the coding of the TFCI received from the MAC sublayer A, as illustrated by the multiplexer , so as to supply an N\/C (\u201cNew\/Continue\u201d) binary indication which echoes the acknowledgement signals received. The states of the TFCI sent on the downlink DPCCH thus make it possible to identify whether the corresponding block sent on the DSCH is a new data block (N) or a redundancy block (C).","In the uplink direction, the coding of the TFCI by the UE determines an uplink indication which can take three states:\n\n","A decoding of this uplink TFCI, shown diagrammatically by the demultiplexer , makes it possible to extract this indication from the HARQ module A of node B.","In the node B, the N\/C signal is produced and the ACK\/NAK\/RESTART signal is processed by a control module  which manages the transmission of the data blocks arising from the RLC\/MAC layer. These blocks (TrBk) are placed in a transmission queue  as and when they are delivered by layer .","For the transmission of these blocks, node B uses K subchannels (K\u22671). For each subchannel i, the module A comprises a buffer memory where the blocks sent are stored temporarily. In practice, the queue  and the K buffer memories , , . . . may be embodied with a single memory component in which the addresses are managed by the module  so that a block is assigned logically either to the queue  or to one of the buffer memories .","The blocks are transferred successively from the queue  to the physical layer. Transmission is distributed in turn between the K subchannels (which are not distinguished in the physical layer). Each block forming the subject of a transmission on a subchannel i is recorded in the corresponding buffer memory so as to be able to be retransmitted on the same subchannel should a NAK signal relating to it be received.","Given that the HARQ layer does not have access to the RLC headers of the blocks, the module A has no numbering information for these blocks. The assigning of an ACK\/NAK signal to a block previously transmitted stems from the instant of reception of this ACK\/NAK signal.","By way of example, the case where K=2 may be considered. The downlink transmission on the DSCH channel is effected according to an alternation of two types of periods, one for the transmission of blocks on subchannel , and the other for the transmission of blocks on subchannel . These periods have a duration (for example a few tens of milliseconds) such that the acknowledgement signal for a block sent on one of the subchannels is received and interpreted by the node B before the start of the next period allotted to this subchannel, that is to say in the course of the following period allotted to the other subchannel. If this condition cannot be complied with in view of the propagation times within the cell and of the processing times for the blocks and signalling information, it is possible either to increase the duration of these periods, or to increase the number K.","The transmission control module  processes the acknowledgement signals ACK\/NAK received from the UE and controls accordingly the transferring of the blocks to the physical layer from the memory , , , . . . . It thus fixes the N\/C indication taken into account in the coding of the TFCI sent.","The HARQ module B of the UE is shown diagrammatically in . The positive or negative acknowledgement of a data block received is decided by a module  as a function of the success or of the failure of the decoding by the physical layer. The latter supplies for example a binary signal for each block, indicating whether it has been correctly received in accordance with the channel decoding and the CRC decoding operated in the stage B.","The ACK\/NAK decisions taken successively, as well as the N\/C signals received successively by decoding the downlink TFCI (shown diagrammatically by the demultiplexer ) are supplied to a module  which decides whether or not to assign the RESTART state to the uplink indication returned by means of the coding of the TFCI (shown diagrammatically by the multiplexer ). The module  consists essentially of an automaton which goes to the RESTART state when it receives, with a block sent on one of the subchannels, an N\/C signal inconsistent with the ACK\/NAK acknowledgement signal which has been returned with regard to the previous block received on the same subchannel.","The decisions taken by the modules  and  are supplied to a module  which effects, as the case may be, the combining of the successive sendings of the same block.","As long as the negative acknowledgement has not been returned, the module  simply sends the MAC sublayer B the transport block arising from the physical layer B, B. When a negative acknowledgement (NAK) is decided, the corresponding block is recorded in a buffer memory , in the form of soft or hard symbol values. During the next reception on the same subchannel, this block is read from the memory  and combined with the block received by the module  so as to reattempt to extract the data so as to communicate them to the MAC layer. If this attempt fails, a new negative acknowledgement is returned and the repeat of the block can also be recorded in the buffer memory .","When the automaton  goes to the RESTART state with regard to one of the subchannels, the buffer memory  is purged as far as any blocks stored in respect of this subchannel are concerned, and the next block received on this subchannel will be processed by the module  as if the previous block had been acknowledged positively.","In the charts of , it has been considered that K=2 and that each of the K buffer memories of the module A has a capacity of just one transport block.","These figures illustrate the sending of a sequence of six blocks B\u2013B. The upper part of the charts shows the content of the transmission queue  just before the transmission of the current block. Underneath can be seen the content of the buffer memory or of the current subchannel just after the transmission of this block. The line \u201cnode B Tx\u201d illustrates the transmission of the current block from the node B, the N\/C indication sent in parallel on the downlink DPCCH being shown in brackets (this line shows the alternation of the periods relating to the two subchannels, it being noted that the sending of the block can occur at any moment, in one go in or several goes, inside each period as a function of the signalling information sent on the dedicated downlink channel). The line \u201cUE Rx\u201d shows the blocks received by the UE as well as the N\/C indications received concomitantly. The line \u201cUE Tx\u201d shows the ACK\/NAK\/RESTART indications returned by the UE on the uplink DPCCH. The line \u201cnode B Rx\u201d shows the reception of these indications by the node B. The propagation times on the downlink and uplink are respectively denoted \u03c4and \u03c4. The maximum processing time for a block received by the UE is denoted \u03c4. The maximum processing time for the uplink indication ACK\/NAK\/RESTART by the node B is denoted \u03c4.","On each chart, the arrow F represents an error of transmission or of interpretation of one of the indications of the HARQ procedure which are transmitted on the DPCCHs, and the arrow F\u2032 represents an inconsistency detected by the module  of the UE between an N\/C indication received on the downlink DPCCH and an ACK\/NAK signal previously returned.","In the example of , the block B is improperly received by the UE which returns a negative acknowledgement which the node B interprets in error as a positive acknowledgement. The next block B sent on the subchannel is then accompanied by the indication N. After having noted the inconsistency, the UE returns a RESTART indication so that, in the next period relating to subchannel , the node B resends the code B accompanied by the indication N (and not C). It should be noted that if the uplink indication had been set to the NAK state instead of RESTART, the UE would have continued to wait for a redundancy block corresponding to B, which would not have been despatched by the node B. By virtue of the RESTART indication, subchannel  is prevented from being blocked in this way until the expiry of the retransmit time outs or until a maximum number of resends is reached. An appreciable gain in terms of capacity and transmission delay is therefore obtained.","In the example of , the negative acknowledgement returned by the UE is correctly interpreted by the node B, but it is the redundancy indication (C) accompanying the repeat of the block B which is interpreted erroneously by the UE as an indication of new send (N). In this case, the block B is still present in the buffer memory when the node B receives the RESTART indication. It is noted that all the blocks may then be correctly received by the UE.","When the UE notes an inconsistency after having returned a negative acknowledgement, it cannot know whether the error configuration is that of  or that of , that is to say whether it is receiving block B or block B, so that the combining module  cannot operate satisfactorily. Consequently, the UE drops the reception of the current block and sends back the RESTART indication so that the transmission of the blocks restarts on consistent bases.","In the error configurations of , the inconsistency F\u2032 is observed by the UE after it has returned a positive acknowledgement ACK. The error occurs on the downlink DPCCH in the case of  and on the uplink DPCCH in the case of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 to 8","FIG. 5"],"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIGS. 9 to 11","FIG. 5"]},"In the embodiments of , each buffer memory , of the HARQ module A of node B stores the two most recent data blocks of the subchannel.","In the case of , the behaviour of the UE is the same as in the exemplary embodiment illustrated by . On receiving the RESTART indication for one of the subchannels (subchannel  in the example), the node B does not repeat the last block sent on this subchannel (B) but rather the previous block (B). This block is the one in respect of which it is not certain that it has been correctly received by the UE. Specifically, for this block the UE has returned an ACK\/NAK acknowledgement signal whose N\/C echo as interpreted by the UE has revealed an inconsistency.","The mode of restart according to  therefore makes it possible to guarantee proper reception of each of the blocks.","In this embodiment, it is noted that the node B must re-transmit each of the blocks B and B with the indication N after having received the RESTART indication. Consequently, the total sending time is greater than that of the similar error configuration in the embodiment of .","It may however happen that the block received accompanied by an N\/C indication revealing an inconsistency F\u2032 may be correctly decoded by the physical layer B of the UE. It can therefore be envisaged that the UE may acknowledge this block positively at the same time as it returns the RESTART indication.","Such an embodiment is illustrated by . In this embodiment, the UE also decodes the blocks received with an N\/C indication revealing an inconsistency. The uplink indication coded in the TFCI can then take four states:\n\n","The ACK or NAK state is decided under the same circumstances as before. The R-A state corresponds to RESTART when the receiver has been able to decode the block accompanied by the N\/C indication revealing an inconsistency. This correct decoding can result from the physical layer B alone or from the physical layer supplemented by the HARQ layer combining module . The R-N state corresponds to RESTART when the receiver has been incapable of decoding the block accompanied by the N\/C indication revealing an inconsistency.","In response to the R-N state decoded in the uplink TFCI, the node B operates in the same way as in the case of receiving the RESTART signal in the previous embodiments. In response to the R-A state, as shown in , the node B restarts with a new send (N) of the block whose proper reception by the UE is not ensured, but the block which followed (transmitted with the N\/C indication whose reception revealed the inconsistency) is not resent, except in the case where a second RESTART indication (R-A or R-N) is received very soon afterwards for the same subchannel. To do this, the module  reads the first block (B) from the buffer memory so as to have it transmitted by the physical layer with the indication N then, in the subsequent next period of the subchannel, it instructs the transmission:\n\n","By comparing , it may be seen that the distinguishing of the positive and negative acknowledgements in the presence of a RESTART allows a time saving in the sending of the blocks, without losing the guarantee of reception by the UE. However, this requires that sufficient states of coding of the uplink TFCI be available to take into account an additional state of the HARQ indication.","In the embodiment illustrated by , the UE behaves as in the case of . It decodes the blocks received with an N\/C indication revealing an inconsistency, so as to positively acknowledge those which are correctly received. However, each buffer memory , of the node B is configured to store just one block at a time, as in the case of . The first block (B) being no longer available in the buffer memory so as to be retransmitted after reception of the R-A, the latter state brings about a response of the node B identical to the response to an ACK. Consequently, the UE can return an ACK in place of the R-A, and they are reduced to three states of coding of the uplink HARQ indication.","Such an embodiment according to  does not require any additional bandwidth nor any additional complexity as compared with the embodiment of . It may be seen that it makes it possible to send the sequence of blocks in a smaller number of periods. The behaviour of the node B, and the possible loss of blocks are the same in both cases. The RESTART (R-N) indication is resurrected by the UE when two conditions are fulfilled: noting of an inconsistency F\u2032 and incorrect or insufficient decoding of the concomitant block.","The previous discussion shows that certain parameters related to the determination and to the processing of the RESTART signals may depend on the configuration of the link established on the DSCH, in particular:\n\n","Advantageously, these parameters may be fixed by the RRC stage during a phase of configuring a link between the node B and the UE, when establishing or reconfiguring the DSCH.","The size of the buffer memories is a configuration parameter for the restarting of the transmission of the blocks by the node B. It is supplied by the RRC module A to the module  which manages the memory and controls the transmission. It need not be supplied to the UE.","On the other hand, the number of states of the uplink indication retained by the RRC layer must be supplied to the HARQ modules A, B of the node B and of the UE."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 to 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 9 to 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
