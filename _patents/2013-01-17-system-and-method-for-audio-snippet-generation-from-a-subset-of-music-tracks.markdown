{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A growing number of services provide large collections of music over the Internet. As more and more artists create music, the sizes of these collections continue to grow. Users of these musical services frequently discover artists and genres that they were previously unaware of. In these cases, it may be difficult and time consuming to gauge whether a particular artist or genre is preferable to the user, which may influence the user's decisions, e.g., to purchase the artist's music.","For instance, some artists have extensive collections of musical works that span large periods of time and a variety of musical styles.

Grouping the plurality of audio files from the determined similarities may comprise associating each audio file with the respective similarity data generated for the audio file. The similarity data may be a similarity matrix.","Selecting audio files from the group to create the subset of audio files may comprise selecting a most diverse and highest quality subset of audio files. Quality of an audio file may be associated with a measure of popularity of the audio file.","Generating the audio snippet from the subset of audio files may comprise extracting an audio segment from each audio file in the subset of audio files and concatenating the extracted audio segments into the audio snippet.","The method of this embodiment may further comprise detecting a musical event in each audio file in the subset of audio files; and extracting an audio segment from each audio file based on the detected musical event.","Another example embodiment describes a system for generating audio snippets comprising: a storage device storing a plurality of audio files; and a snippet generator configured to: extract features from a plurality of audio files; determine similarities from the extracted features; associate each audio file with the determined similarities; select a subset of audio files from the plurality of audio files; and generate an audio snippet from the subset of audio files.","The system may further comprise a database, comprising the storage device, connected to a network; a server, hosting the snippet generator, connected to the network and accessing the database through the network; and a client device configured to connect to the network and request generation of the audio snippet by displaying a graphical user interface and receiving input.","Determining similarities from the extracted features may comprise generating similarity data for each audio file in the plurality of audio files, the similarity data indicating musical stylistic similarities between each audio file in the plurality of audio files and each other audio file in the plurality of audio files.

Techniques for generating audio snippets are described in detail below. The snippet generator  may be implemented as a hardware component, a software component, or any combination thereof.","Referring to , in one embodiment, an application programming interface (API)  of an application engine or app engine  provides many resources to an application or session (e.g., Internet session, communications session, etc.) hosted by the server  of . In turn, the app engine  depends on resources provided from an API exposed by a resources infrastructure layer  and a networking layer , which are supported by the server  and their operating system(s) . The app engine  and the resource infrastructure layer  connect requests, e.g., HTTP, from a client to an application or session hosted by the server .

The system includes a snippet requestor , a GUI , a snippet generator , and a database . The snippet requestor  may be the user , the client , or an appliance for automatically requesting the generation of an audio snippet by identifying a collection (or set) of audio files and transmitting a request for an audio snippet from the collection, which is described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","500","10","100","500","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["550","510","520","530","540","510","540","505","500","5100","510","510","5100","5100","510","5200","520","5300","530","5400","540","550","5200","5100","5300","5200","5100","5400","5100","5400","505","500","5100","5400","510","540","550"]},"Returning to , the snippet requestor  interacts with the GUI  to generate and\/or transmit the request to the snippet generator . As mentioned, the request identifies the set of files used to generate the snippet. Upon receiving the request, the snippet generator  generates the snippet by accessing and analyzing audio files comprising the collection (or set) identified in the request. In , the collection may be stored in database . In the example that follows, each file in the collection is an audio file comprising a musical track and the audio snippet is a combination of segments from each musical track in a subset of the audio files in the collection.","Once a snippet request is received, the snippet generator  extracts audio features from each track in the collection of audio files identified in the request. Examples of audio features include, but are not limited to, time and frequency domain features such as energy envelope and distribution, frequency content, harmonicity, spectral flux, and pitch. A stabilized auditory image (SAI) is another example of an audio feature. Additional examples of an audio feature include audio features that are sensitive to musical beat and rhythm, such as autocorrelation and the output of beat tracking algorithms. In some embodiments, features include mel-frequency cepstral coefficients representing a short-term power spectrum of sound. Any technique for extracting audio features may be used.","One example of extracting audio features from an audio track involves partitioning the track into frames of short duration (e.g., 50 milliseconds). An audio image, such as a stabilized auditory image (SAI), is generated for each frame, and used to calculate a dense vector feature for each frame. These dense vector features are subjected to vector quantization into a vector quantization codebook using, e.g., a winner-take-all algorithm. Thereafter, a histogram for the track is generated by summing across all of the vector quantization codes for all the frames. In this example, a histogram is generated for each track in the collection of audio files.","As illustrated in , extracted features may be expressed as a vector representation of audio. In , a track  is partitioned into frames, and a SAI is generated for each frame (such as SAIs -). The SAIs are processed to generate a vector representation (vector ) of the track .","Returning to , the snippet generator  determines, based on the features extracted from the tracks, similarities\u2014such as musical stylistic similarities\u2014among the tracks in the collection. Other similarities, such as artist, album, genre, instrumentation, time period, label, producer, production quality, production origin (e.g., live or studio), and song length may be used as well. Any suitable technique for determining track-to-track similarity may be employed. For example, a supervised learning model, such as the Wsabie algorithm, may be used to capture musical stylistic similarities on a track-by-track basis. That is, each track in the collection may be compared to each other track in the collection to measure similarities.","The Wsabie algorithm\u2014an example of a supervised learning model\u2014learns from training data to produce a ranked list of similar items based on a query item. Features, such as the audio features described above, are projected into a new numerical space of the appropriate dimensionality (e.g., 100) referred to as an \u201cembedding.\u201d A projection is accomplished using a matrix of weights that are adapted such that musically-similar items are near one another in the embedding space. Any distance function, such as vector dot product (correlation) or cosine distance (vector distance), can be used to compare items in the embedding space. The effect of using the Wsabie algorithm is that the raw audio feature space is warped to capture similarities found in the training data.","In the example previously described, where audio features are extracted and a track-level histogram is generated for each track in the collection, a supervised learning model may be used to transform the track level histograms into a dense space (e.g., 100-dimensional space) which captures similarities.","Information or data describing the determined similarities is organized and maintained so as to be available to access and use. In this manner, a library of similarity data, expressing track-to-track similarities, may be generated and maintained. In the example of , the similarity data may be organized and maintained in the database . In some cases, the similarity data for each track is stored in a database keyed by a track identifier of the track corresponding to the data. Alternatively, similarity data for a given track is added as metadata to the audio file corresponding to the track.","After determining the track-to-track similarities, the snippet generator  selects or identifies the most diverse and highest quality subset of tracks from the collection provided in the request. Diversity among the tracks in a collection of audio files is measured by analyzing the similarity data. In one embodiment, determinantal point processes (DPPs) are employed to select the most diverse and highest quality subset of tracks from the collection of audio files. Given a set of objects, where the quality of each object and the similarity between all possible pairs of objects in the set are known, DPPs provide a framework for choosing a diverse and high quality subset of the objects. DPPs are grounded in probabilistic principles and are used to compute conditional distributions that are useful when making inferences. Additionally, it is possible to learn and use parameters established by DPPs, such as parameters for the optimal weighting of quality and similarity features.","In some embodiments, quality is associated with the popularity of a track. Popularity, in turn, may be measured by the number of times an audio file or track is executed (played) on a media player, downloaded and\/or purchased from a service or website, and the like. The popularity of a track may also be indicated by ratings, such as user ratings, of the track. All other techniques for measuring an audio track's popularity are within the scope of this disclosure.","Once the most diverse and highest quality subset of tracks is determined, the snippet generator  selects a portion or segment from each track in the subset and combines the portions into an audio snippet. In one embodiment, each segment used to form the snippet is of a predetermined duration (such as ten seconds) and from a predetermined location (such as the temporal middle) of the track. Thus, a ten second segment from the middle of each track may be used to generate the snippet in this example. As should be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan, a segment of any duration from any location may be selected from an audio track. Additionally, the selected segments may be combined in any manner or order. The example of  illustrates joining segments - to form snippet  by concatenation. However, other techniques are within the scope of this disclosure.","In another example, a segment used to form a snippet is identified by detecting a event in the track. The event may be a musical event, such as a given set of lyrics, a crescendo or decrescendo, a certain beat or harmony, a riff, or a chorus to name a few. For example, techniques for identifying riffs in music can be used to determine appropriate segments to combine into an audio snippet. As another example, the event may be a word, phrase, sentence, expression, and the like in an audio track of a speech.","In some embodiments, the system for generating audio snippets is implemented in a networked environment, such as the environment of . In these embodiments, the snippet requestor  includes the user  and\/or the client , the GUI  includes the GUI  of the client , the snippet generator  includes an application hosted by and residing at the server , and the database  includes the database \u2014all of which are connected to and interact through the network . In these embodiments, the GUI may be provided by an Internet browser (executing on the client) accessing a website (hosted by the server) for browsing audio files, generating audio snippets, and the like. The snippet generator resides on the server and interacts, e.g., through the network, with the database to generate the snippet, and with the client to receive requests and present or transmit snippets. In this case, the files used to create a snippet are maintained the database or the server.","In other embodiments, the system for generating audio snippets is implemented in a client, such as client  of . In these embodiments, the snippet requestor  includes the user  and\/or the client , the GUI  includes the GUI  of the client , and the snippet generator  includes the snippet generator  of the client . In these embodiments, the GUI may be an application interface of an application residing on the client . Additionally, the database may include one or more applications (such as the applications  of ) and one or more computer readable storage media (such as the memory  and\/or the storage device(s) ) of the client  of . In this case, the snippet generator and the files used to form a snippet reside on the client.","In yet another embodiment, the some components of a system for generating audio snippets are implemented in a networked environment while other components are implemented on a client. For example, a snippet generator residing on a client may access a collection of audio files on database or server through a network to generate an audio snippet. As another example, a snippet generator residing on a client may access a database of similarity data through a network, download similarity data associated with a given set of tracks stored on the client, and employ the similarity data to generate a snippet from the tracks stored on the client. As should be apparent, the various components of the system for generating audio snippets presented in this disclosure may be distributed over a network or centrally located without limitation and without deviating from the desired result, i.e., the generation of one or more audio snippets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Step : Extract Features from Files.","The process begins at step . Given a collection of files, such as a collection of audio files or audio tracks, features are extracted from each file in a collection. In some situations, the features are audio features which may include, but are not limited to, an SAI, time and frequency domain features (e.g., energy envelope and distribution, frequency content, harmonicity, spectral flux, and pitch), etc. Any technique for extracting features may be used.","Step : Determine Similarities from the Extracted Features.","Once the features are extracted in step , the process moves to step . Here, similarities, such as musical stylistic similarities, among the files in the collection are identified. Other similarities, such as artist, album, genre, instrumentation, time period, label, producer, production quality, production origin (e.g., live or studio), and song length may be used as well. Any suitable technique for determining file-to-file similarity may be employed. For example, a supervised learning model\u2014such as the previously described Wsabie algorithm\u2014may be used to capture musical stylistic similarities on a file-by-file basis. That is, each file in the collection may be compared to each other file in the collection to measure similarities.","Step : Annotate and\/or Index.","Following step , similarity information or data corresponding to each file is organized, indexed, and maintained so that it may be accessed for further use. In one example, the similarity data is maintained in a database keyed by a file identifier of the file corresponding to the data. Alternatively, the similarity information derived for a given file may be associated with, stored in, added to, linked to, embedded within, etc. the file. Thus, the file may be annotated with the similarity information.","Step : Select Most Diverse and Highest Quality Subset of Files.","After determining the file-to-file similarities in step , the most diverse and highest quality subset of files from the collection is identified. Diversity among the files is determined by analyzing the similarity data. DPP techniques, as mentioned above, may be employed in step . Regarding quality, in some embodiments quality is associated with the popularity of a file. Popularity, in turn, may be measured by the number of times the file is used, accessed, downloaded, purchased, and the like. Popularity may also be indicated by a rating system, such as a user rating system. All other techniques for measuring an popularity are within the scope of this disclosure.","Step : Merge a Segment of Each File in the Subset into a Snippet.","A portion or segment from each file in the subset (determined in step ) is selected. Thereafter, the selected portions are merged into a snippet. In some embodiments where the size or length of the files can be measured temporarily, each segment used to form the snippet may be a predetermined duration (such as ten seconds) and from a predetermined location (such as the temporal middle) of the file. In these embodiments, any duration from any location may be selected for each file (see e.g.,  where segments from different locations are selected). Additionally, the selected segments may be merged in any manner or order. In another example, a segment used to form a snippet is identified by detecting a event in the file.","Once a snippet is generated it can be presented, transmitted, viewed, consumed, listened to, saved, stored, and so on based on the type of snippet and its desired use. Additionally, a snippet may be generated in real-time or generated and stored for later use. For example, once a snippet is generated, the snippet may be indexed and maintained in a database. Thus, if two requests for a snippet from the same collection of files is received, the later of the two requests may be satisfied by accessing the previously generated snippet in the database.","While the aspects and techniques of the disclosure have described generating an audio snippet from a collection of audio files, the disclosure is not limited thereto. The aspects and techniques described herein may be employed to generate a snippet from any collection, such as a collection of video files, a library of documents (such as literary works), and the like.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and \u201cat least one\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
