title: Steering and directional reversing control for waterjet propulsion
abstract: Waterjet flow emerging from a jet propulsor body through a cross-sectionally circular duct is conducted through a cross-sectionally rectangular duct passage extending through transition and exhaust aft sections attached to and angularly adjusted relative thereto. Under selective maneuver controls within the propulsor body, the transition section is angularly adjusted relative to the body while pivotal vanes and flaps on the exhaust section are angularly adjusted to direct exit outflow through the exhaust section for steering and reversing purposes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to hull integrated waterjet propulsion having directional steering and reversing facilities.","Waterjet propulsion devices for submersible vehicle hulls do not have directly associated therewith controls for steering and reversing propulsion thereof because of certain drag and damage problems imposed by existing jet propulsion steering and reversing control facilities that are available for surface vessels. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a waterjet propulsion system applicable to underwater vehicles having steering and reversing facilities without imposition of drag and damage problems.","Pursuant to the present invention propulsion jet flow is directed axially through a cross-sectionally circular nozzle duct within an underwater sea vehicle into a cross-sectionally rectangular exhaust duct for vane controlled deflection during exit outflow therefrom. Also provided on the exhaust duct are angularly controlled flaps through which jet stream flow is selectively diverted rearwardly to exit directly from the exhaust duct, while electrically motorized means for rotation of the exhaust duct about the axis of the nozzle duct is also provided to angularly adjust such rearwardly diverted exiting of the jet stream flow.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an axially elongated and generally cylindrical revolution body  adapted to be mounted in a hull  of an underwater sea vessel vehicle for propulsion thereof. The body  has a closed forward end portion  from which it extends toward a converging aft end section  projecting from the sea vessel hull  for exposure to the seawater. Enclosed within the end section  of the body  is a jet propulsor  as shown in . The jet propulsor  is of a generally well known type into which an inflow of water from an inlet opening  is conducted through a cross-sectionally circular inlet conduit  axially aligned with a cross-sectionally circular outflow nozzle conduit  as shown in . Jet propelling outflow through the nozzle conduit  is directed into a cross-sectionally rectangular transition duct  within a rotatable convergent section  extending rearwardly from the aft end section  as shown in ,  and . Waterjet outflow from the transition duct  is conducted into a cross-sectionally rectangular exhaust duct section  fastened to the duct  as shown in ,  and , from which the waterjet outflow exits to impart propulsion force through the body  to the seawater vessel hull  along an axis  of the body .","As denoted in , the transition duct  has a radially extending flange  mounting an internal spur gear  within the aft end section  for meshing engagement with a pinion gear  driven through a right angle gear box  by an electric motor  positioned within the end section . Thus, under control of the motor  the transition duct section  may be angularly adjusted relative to the end section  of the body  by rotation relative thereto about the axis . An annular low friction seal plate  is shown positioned between the transition duct flange  and the body duct section  to maintain sealage within the body end sections  and  during rotational adjustment under steering operation as hereinafter explained. Support for the rotational end section  during such steering rotation thereof is provided for by an annular bearing assembly  on the aft section  at the seal plate  as shown in .","As shown in , exit outflow of jet streams from the exhaust duct  is directionally controlled by deflection vanes  pivotally mounted inside of the exhaust duct  at its exit end. All of the vanes  are interconnected by linkage  so as to be rotated together in phase for steering purposes by an electric drive motor  through a rotary to linear motion converter type actuator , to which the linkage  is connected. Such in-phase angular positioning of the vanes  within 45\u00b0 and rotational adjustment of the exhaust duct  by rotation of the body end section  connected thereto from the neutral position of the exhaust duct  as shown in  to angularly adjusted positions within 90\u00b0 as shown in  will correspondingly effect a change in directional propulsion steering.","Referring now to , the exhaust duct  rotatable with the transition end section  about the axis , is formed by an assembly of an outer butterfly flap  and an inner butterfly flap . Both the outer and inner flaps  and  are angularly displaced about a pivot  from positions in contact with each other as shown in  respectively aligned with linear actuators  and  in their retracted conditions mounted by a pivot  at the aft end of the transition duct . In such positions of the flaps  and  aligned with the linear actuators  and  as shown in , jet stream flow is confined to the exhaust duct  for outflow from its exit end under directional control as aforementioned. When the flaps  and  are pivotally displaced by the linear actuators  and  to the positions shown in , exit of the jet stream flow along the axis  from the exit end of the exhaust duct  is blocked by the inner flaps . Jet stream outflow is then reversed and directed backwardly by the outer flaps .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["40","50","60","62","66","68","40","50","28","46","70","60","62"]},"Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings.
