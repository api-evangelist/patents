title: Interface for exchanging context data
abstract: A facility for exchanging context attributes is described. A characterization module receives an invocation request to provide an attribute value that was generated by a requesting attribute consumer. The received invocation request identifies the attribute whose value is to be provided. In response to receiving the invocation request, the characterization module provides a value for the identified attribute to the requesting attribute consumer.

No. 11\/075,529, filed Mar. 8, 2005, entitled \u201cINTERFACE FOR EXCHANGING CONTEXT DATA,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 7,478,331, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 6,466,232, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention is directed to the field of context modeling and, more particularly, to the field of data exchange for context modeling.","Wearable computers are devices that commonly serve as electronic companions and intelligent assistants to their users. A wearable computer is typically strapped to its user's body or carried by its user in a holster, and can contain a variety of both input and output devices. A wearable computer can output information to its user using, for example, display eyeglasses, audio speakers, or a tactile output device. A wearable computer can receive instructions and other input from its user via input devices such as a keyboard, various pointing devices, or an audio microphone. A wearable computer can receive information about its surroundings using sensors, such as barometric pressure and temperature sensors, global positioning system devices, or a heart rate monitor for determining the heart rate of its user and can receive additional information via communication devices, such as various types of network connections. A wearable computer can exchange information with other devices using communication schemes such as infrared communication, radio communication, or cellular modems.","Many applications for wearable computers utilize data received by the wearable computer from sensors. For example, a position mapping application for a wearable computer may utilize data received from a global positioning system device to plot its user's physical location and determine whether that position is within a special region. In this example, the global positioning system device produces data that is consumed by the position mapping-application.","In conventional wearable computer systems, the position mapping application would be designed to interact directly with the global positioning system device to obtain the needed data. For example, the application may be required to instruct the device to obtain position information, retrieve the information obtained by the device, convert it to conventional latitude and longitude representation, and determine whether the represented location is within the special region.","Such direct interaction between applications and sensors to obtain and process data has significant disadvantages. First, developing an application to interact directly with a particular sensor can introduce into the application dependencies on that sensor. Accordingly, the application may need to be subsequently modified to interact successfully with alternatives to that sensor provided by other manufacturers, or even to interact successfully with future versions of the sensor from the same manufacturer.","Second, direct interaction between the application and the sensor can give rise to conflicts between multiple applications that consume the same data. For example, if the position mapping application was executing on the same wearable computer as a second application for determining the user's distance from home that also used the global positioning system device, the two applications' interactions with the device could interfere with one another.","Third, direct interaction between the application and the sensor can give rise to conflicts between multiple sensors that produce the same data. For example, if the position mapping application was executing on a wearable computer that had access to both the global positioning system device and an indoor positioning system, the application might well have trouble determining which device to use to determine the user's current position, and\/or have trouble reconciling data produced by both devices.","Fourth, performing the derivation of abstract information from data observable by sensors in each application that requires the derived abstract information necessitates redundant functionality in each such application, and precludes the development of multiple competing algorithms to derive the same abstract information; rather than having to themselves process data from the sensor to derive more abstract information from data observable by sensors, it would be advantageous for applications to be able to rely on a separate programmatic entity to derive such abstract information. For example, it would be more convenient for the position mapping application to be able rely on a separate programmatic entity to determine whether the user is in a special region based upon the user's location. It would further be advantageous for such applications to share a single separate programmatic entity, rather each implementing the same derivation functionality.","Accordingly, a facility for exchanging information between sensors and applications in a wearable computer system would have significant utility.","A software facility for exchanging information between sources of context data and consumers of context data (\u201cthe facility\u201d) is provided. In a preferred embodiment, a characterization module operating in a wearable computer system receives context information, in the form of individual attributes each modeling an aspect of the wearable computer system, its user, or the surrounding environment, from one or more context servers, and provides it to one or more context clients. The facility reduces dependencies of context client applications on specific sensors and other input devices, reduces conflicts between context client applications that consume the same context data, resolves conflicts between multiple sensors or other input devices that produce the same data, isolates the derivation of derived attributes from context client applications, and therefore obviates the redundant effort of implementing the derivation of derived attributes in each context server, and facilitates the development and use of competing algorithms to derive derived attributes.","Attributes represent measures of specific context elements such as ambient temperature, location and current user task. Each attribute preferably has the following properties: a name, a value, an uncertainty level, units, and a time stamp. Attributes provided through the characterization module by a context server may either be \u201cmeasured,\u201d in that they are directly received from an input device, or \u201cderived,\u201d in that they are the result of performing processing on values directly obtained from input devices other attributes. Indeed, a derived attribute may be produced by performing additional processing on other derived attributes. Context servers, in addition to providing attributes through the characterization module, may also provide other functions. For example, an application, such as an electronic mail application, could serve as a context server by providing attributes through the characterization module. In addition to the source of attributes described above, such an \u201cexpanded\u201d context server may provide attributes relating to the other functions of the expanded context server. For example, an electronic mail application context server could provide an attribute indicating other new messages are waiting. Indeed, the same program module may operate both as a context client and a context server.","Two or more different context servers may preferably supply to the characterization module their own values for a single attribute. For example, a first context server can supply a value for a user.location attribute based on data received from a global positioning system device, while a second context server can supply a value for the user.location attribute based on data received from an indoor positioning device. These separate values for the same attribute are referred to as separate \u201cinstances\u201d of the attribute. The characterization module preferably provides a variety of different approaches, called \u201cmediators,\u201d for determining, when an attribute requested by a context client has more than one instance, what attribute value to provide in response to the attribute request.","When the characterization module obtains an attribute value from a context server, it preferably caches it for responding to future requests for the attribute from context clients. Such attribute requests may specify a specific instance of the attribute\u2014that is, a specific context server from which the attribute is to be obtained\u2014or may specify that the attribute is to be obtained by applying a particular mediator to whatever instances of the attribute are available, or may utilize a default mediator to mediate between available instances of the attribute. When the characterization module receives an attribute request from a context client, it identifies the attribute instances available to satisfy the request, and, for each, determines whether the value for the attribute instance cached by the characterization module was obtained sufficiently recently from the corresponding context server. If not, the characterization module requests an updated value for the attribute instance from the corresponding context server before performing any necessary mediation and returning a value to the context client.","Context servers and context clients preferably interact with the characterization module by calling functions provided by the characterization module. These functions are said to collectively comprise an \u201capplication programming interface\u201d (or \u201cAPI\u201d) to the characterization module.","A context client that seeks to request a particular attribute or attribute instance may call a LaunchContextServer function to launch a particular context server that is not executing. Each executing context server preferably registers with the characterization module by calling a RegisterContextServer function, identifying itself. The context server goes on to make an instance of an attribute available to context clients via the characterization module by following a CreateAttributeInstance function. A particular context server may preferably provide a number of different attributes by calling the CreateAttributeInstance function multiple times. Before seeking to consume an attribute, a context client calls a RegisterContextClient function, identifying itself. In order to consume an attribute, a context client calls a RegisterToConsumeAttributeOrInstance function, identifying itself and an attribute that it seeks to consume. To help determine which attributes to consume, a context client may call a EnumerateAttributes function to obtain a list of the attributes available from the characterization module. In order to actually retrieve an attribute value, a context client calls a GetAttribute function, identifying the attribute and any attribute processing that should be applied, such as a specific type of mediation between different instances of the attribute obtained from different context servers. For attributes that have multiple instances in the characterization module, a context client may call a GetAllAttributeInstances function to obtain a value of the attribute for each attribute instance. To force a particular context server to reevaluate all of its attribute instances, a context client may call a CompleteContextServerEvaluation function. Also, to retrieve attributes reflecting aspects of the configuration of the characterization module, a context client or other program may call a GetCharacterizationModuleAttribute function. A context client that consumes a particular attribute may create a condition in the characterization module that tests that attribute by calling a CreateCondition function. Once a context client has created a condition, it can evaluate the condition by calling an EvaluateCondition function, identifying the condition. Once a context client has created a condition, it may go on to call a CreateConditionMonitor function to create a condition monitor that monitors the condition and notifies the context server when the condition is satisfied. To suspend operation of a created condition monitor, a context server may call a StopConditionMonitor function, and to resume its operation, may call a StartConditionMonitor function. The context server may remove a condition monitor that it created by calling a RemoveConditionMonitor function, and, correspondingly, may remove a condition that it created by calling a RemoveCondition function. A context client may unregister to consume a particular attribute by calling an UnregisterToConsumeAttributeOrInstance function. A context client may unregister itself with the characterization module by calling an UnregisterContextClient function. A context server may\u2014though need not\u2014remove attribute instances that it has registered by calling a RemoveAttributeInstance function. Before it does, however, it may\u2014though need not\u2014first call a CheckAttributeInstanceDependencies function to determine whether any context clients currently depend upon that attribute instance. Once it has removed its attribute instances, a context server may unregister with the characterization module by calling an UnregisterContextServer function. These API functions are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with an example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","110","120","124","130","122","132","134","136","116","128","121"]},"In the current environment, computer  is accessible to a computer  (e.g., by being in line-of-sight wireless proximity or by being reachable via a long-distance communication device such as a cellular phone) which also has a variety of input and output devices. In the illustrated embodiment the computer  is non-portable, although the body-mounted computer of the user can similarly communicate with a variety of other types of computers, including body-mounted computers of other users. The devices from which the non-portable computer can directly receive information include various user input devices  and various user sensor input devices . The non-portable computer can output information directly to a display , a speaker , an olfactory device , and a printer . In the illustrated embodiment, the body-mounted computer can communicate with the non-portable computer via a wireless transmission medium. In this manner, the characterization module can receive information from the user input devices  and the user sensor devices  after the information has been transmitted to the non-portable computer and then to the body-mounted computer. Alternately, the body-mounted computer may be able to directly communicate with the user input devices  and the user sensor devices , as well as with other various remote environment sensor input devices , without the intervention of the non-portable computer . Similarly, the body-mounted computer may be able to supply output information to the display , the speaker , the olfactory device , and the printer , either directly or via the non-portable computer, and directly to the telephone . As the user moves out of range of the remote input and output devices, the characterization module will be updated to reflect that the remote devices are not currently available.","The various input devices allow the characterization module or an application such as a context server (not shown) executing on the computer system  to monitor the user and the environment and to model their current condition. Such a model can be used by various applications, such as context clients, for various purposes. A model of the current conditions can include a variety of condition variables that represent information about the user, the computer, and the user's environment at varying levels of abstraction. For example, information about the user at a low level of abstraction can include raw physiological data (e.g., heart rate and EKG) and geographic information (e.g., location and speed), while higher levels of abstraction may attempt to characterize or predict the user's physical activity (e.g., jogging or talking on a phone), emotional state (e.g., angry or puzzled), desired output behavior for different types of information (e.g., to present private family information so that it is perceivable only to myself and my family members), and cognitive load (i.e., the amount of attention required for the user's current activities). Background information which changes rarely or not at all can also be included, such as the user's age, gender and visual acuity. The model can similarly hold environment information at a low level of abstraction, such as air temperature or raw data from a motion sensor, or at higher levels of abstraction, such as the number and identities of nearby people, objects, and locations. The model of the current conditions can additionally include information added explicitly from other sources (e.g., application programs), as well as user-specified or system-learned defaults and preference information.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computer systems  and , as well as their various input and output devices, are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The computer systems may contain additional components or may lack some illustrated components. For example, it is possible that the characterization module can be implemented on the non-portable computer, with the body-mounted computer replaced by a thin context client such as a transmitter\/receiver for relaying information between the body-mounted input and output devices and the non-portable computer. Alternately, the user may not wear any devices or computers.","In addition, the body-mounted computer may be connected to one or more networks of other devices through wired or wireless communication means (e.g. wireless RF, a cellular phone or modem, infrared, physical cable, a docking station, etc.), either with or without support from other computers such as the computer . For example, the body-mounted computer of a user can make use of output devices in a smart room, such as a television and stereo when the user is at home, if the body-mounted computer can transmit information to those devices via a wireless medium or if a cabled or docking mechanism is available. Alternately, kiosks or other information devices can be installed at various locations (e.g., in airports or at tourist spots) to transmit relevant information to body-mounted computers within the range of the information device.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that specialized versions of the body-mounted computer and characterization module can be created for a variety of purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","230","210","250","222","223","224","225","226","228","231","232","233","234","237","235","236","237","231","237"]},"The facility preferably utilizes a plain-language, hierarchical, taxonometric attribute nomenclature to name attributes. The attribute names within the nomenclature are preferably specific so that there is no ambiguity as to what they represent. The facility preferably supports the extension of the nomenclature by adding new attribute names that conform to the hierarchical taxonomy of the nomenclature. The nomenclature preferably has attribute names relating to the user, such as user.position, user.speed, and user.direction providing information about the user's position, speed, and direction, respectively. The nomenclature preferably contains attribute names for various user moods, such as user.mood.happiness, user.mood.anger, and user.mood.confusion. The nomenclature preferably includes attribute names for user activities, such as user.activity.driving, user.activity.eating, and user.activity.sleeping. The nomenclature preferably includes attribute names for user physiology values, such as user.physiology.pulse, user.physiology.body_temperature, and user.physiology.blood_pressure. The nomenclature preferably includes attribute names for similar attributes of people other than the user, such as person.John_Smith.mood.happiness. The nomenclature preferably includes attribute names for aspects of the computer system or \u201cplatform.\u201d For example, the nomenclature preferably includes attribute names for aspects of the platform's user interface, such as platform.user_interface.oral_input_device_availability and platform.user_interface.visual_output_device_availability. The nomenclature preferably includes attribute names for attributes relating to the central processing unit, or \u201cCPU,\u201d of the platform, such as platform.cpu_load and platform.clock_speed. The nomenclature preferably also provides attribute names for aspects of the local environment, such as environment.local.time, environment.local.temperature, and environment.local.ambient_noise_level. The nomenclature preferably also includes attribute names for remote environments, such as environment.place.chicago.time and environment.place.san_diego.temperature. The nomenclature preferably further provides attribute names relating to specific applications. For example, the nomenclature preferably provides attribute names for aspects of an electronic mail application, such as application.mail.available, application.mail.new_messages_waiting, and application.mail.messages_waiting_to_be_sent. In this manner, the attribute nomenclature used by the facility provides effective names for attributes relating to the user, the computer system, and the environment.

For example, context client  consumes user.location attribute . It can be seen that certain software modules may act both as a context server and as a context client. For example, software module  is both a context server and a context client, as it provides the user.in_region attribute , as well as consuming a user.location attribute . It can also be seen that a context client consumes more than one attribute. For example, context client  consumes both user.in_region attribute  and user.elevation attribute . To determine which attributes are currently available, any of the context clients may request that the characterization module enumerate the available attributes. In response to such a request, the characterization module would enumerate the user.location attribute, the user.location attribute, and the user.in_region attribute. Additional preferred embodiments permit context clients to otherwise limit attribute enumeration requests. For example, a context client may request enumeration of all user interface attributes by specifying the wildcard-expanded attribute name platform.user_interface.*.","The characterization module preferably implements the API functions described in detail below in order to obtain attribute values from context servers and provide them to context clients.
