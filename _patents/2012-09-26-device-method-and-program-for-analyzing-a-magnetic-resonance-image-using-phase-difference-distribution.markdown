One of main causes of the Alzheimer's disease is known as a protein called amyloid \u03b2 accumulated in the brain. However, a diameter of the amyloid \u03b2 is about 0.1 mm or less, and it is considered that the amyloid \u03b2 cannot directly be portrayed by means of a current image detecting device for health care services.","By the way, most of medical imaging equipment such as an MRI is aimed at directly portraying a target tissue or lesions. However, in the medical field, there is a limitation of an imaging time, and there is a limitation of the resolution in the image which can be imaged within the limited time. Under the limitation, the target tissue or the lesions cannot be directly portrayed. Of course, in high-resolution image equipment, the portraying is possible, but the high-resolution image equipment is beyond a range of the health care services, and expensive.","Of course, in the case of using a superhigh magnetic MRI (for example, MRI of 7 Tesla and the like), direct portraying is possible, but the superhigh magnetic MRI is beyond the range of the health care services provided under medical insurance. An image diagnosis method requiring expensive equipment which is beyond the range of the health care services provided under medical insurance cannot be said as the solution of a current urgent medical problem, and a method of detecting a tissue or lesions, which cannot be portrayed by means of medical imaging equipment such as an MRI, realistically within a current range of health care services provided under medical insurance has been required.","For this reason, for example, the MR system disclosed in Patent Document 1 images a high-resolution MR image with a magnetic field strength of 3 tesla or more by using a 3D inclined double echo pulse sequence, and collects image data of the MR image for two different echo times so that a 3D phase image is collected.","In addition, in order to measure a predetermined component and a linear component regarding nonuniformity of the magnetic field, since a smoothing spherical harmonic function is subtracted from the measured value collected between the MRIs to obtain a local change of the magnetic field in the area of interest. Since ability to measure a magnetic field variation in the brain by the MRI is increased according to the square of B0, measurement of magnetism and iron of the brain is more sensitive according to the technique disclosed in the Patent Document 1.","Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-28151","However, the technique disclosed in the aforementioned Patent Document 1 has an intention of increasing the entire sensitivity in the MRI, and only, directly portraying the MR image. Further, it is unclear whether a tissue or lesions, which cannot be portrayed by means of medical imaging equipment such as an MRI, is detected within the current range of health care services provided under medical insurance. In addition, the MRI which does not adopt the technique disclosed in the aforementioned Patent Document 1 cannot achieve the improved sensitivity.","One or more embodiments of the present invention provide an image analysis device, an image analysis method, and an image analysis program which can detect a tissue or lesions, which cannot be portrayed by means of medical imaging equipment such as an MRI, realistically within a current range of health care services.","One or more embodiments of one aspect of the present invention may provide an image analysis device for analyzing a magnetic resonance image obtained from a living body, including: a phase difference distribution creating unit configured to create a distribution of phase difference or phase (Hereinafter, \u201cphase difference\u201d and \u201cphase\u201d are uniformly referred to as \u201cphase difference\u201d) of a magnetic resonance image obtained from a predetermined area of the living body; a fitting unit configured to fit the phase difference distribution created by the phase difference distribution creating unit with a plurality of function groups; and a verifying unit configured to verify normality of the living body included in the predetermined area, on the basis of the magnetic susceptibility of the tissue included in the predetermined area determined on the basis of the parameters of the plurality of function groups fit to the phase difference distribution by the fitting unit.","Further, the aforementioned image analysis device includes various forms to be embedded in other devices, or implemented together with other methods, and the like. Further, the present invention may be implemented by an image analysis system including the image analysis device, an image analysis method having a process corresponding to the configuration of the aforementioned device, an image analysis program implementing a function corresponding to the configuration of the aforementioned device in a computer, a recording medium readable by the computer recoding the image analysis program.","As described above, according to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a minute change in tissue may be detected by using an MRI phase difference image which is sensitive to a minute magnetic change of the tissue. In other words, a phase change due to a partial volume effect of the tissue is determined as a change in phase difference distribution of a predetermined target area (in one or more embodiments below, referred to as an area of interest), and as a result, existence of the target tissue may be stably verified by using an MRI which has a short imaging time and low magnetic field intensity.","Instead of directly creating an image of pixel by pixel having high accuracy by an unrealistic method for a long imaging time, it is considered that a detecting method using short-time imaging or low-magnetic field equipment is facilitated in the industry and the medical field. Further, the method may be used without changing a device in the related art or introducing an additional device because of software processing.","In embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one with ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the invention.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described according to the following order.","(1) Configuration of embodiments:","(2) Creating phase difference image:","(3) Determining process:","(4) Creating of shape image:","(5) Summary:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","1","1","20","26"]},"The MRI device  illustrated in  includes a coil system  and a control system .","[Coil System ]","The coil system  includes, for example, a static magnetic coil portion , an inclined magnetic coil portion , and a radio frequency (RF) coil portion . The coil portions have, for example, substantially cylindrical shapes, and are disposed so that central axes (not illustrated) are the same as each other. A bed portion  supporting the subject  is disposed in a plane including the central axes.","The bed portion  is disposed in a bore A (internal space) of the coil system . The subject  on the bed portion  is carried in or out the bore A by moving the bed portion  by means of a carrying means (not illustrated). Further, in one or more embodiments, as illustrated in , a direction parallel with the central axis is represented as a Z axis, and two directions which are perpendicular to the Z axis and perpendicular to each other are represented as an X axis and a Y axis.","The static magnetic coil portion  generates a static magnetic field in the bore A. The static magnetic coil portion  is configured by, for example, a superconductive coil, a normal conductive coil, or the like. A direction of the static magnetic field generated by the static magnetic coil portion  is substantially parallel with the Z-axial direction. Further, in , an example in which a body-axial direction of the subject  is parallel with the direction of the static magnetic field is described, but the body-axial direction may be perpendicular to the direction of the static magnetic field.","The inclined magnetic coil portion  generates an inclined magnetic field (gradient magnetic field), for example, in three axes which are vertical to each other, that is, slide-axial, phase-axial, and frequency-axial directions. The inclined magnetic coil portion  is configured by three kinds of coils, for example, a slide-axial coil, a phase-axial coil, and a frequency-axial coil. In this case, any of the X axis, the Y axis, and the Z axis may be a slide axis. For example, when the Z axis is the slide axis, the X axis may be the phase axis, and the Y axis may be the frequency axis.","Further, the MR signal may be collected even in a coordinate system (for example, polar coordinate system) in addition to the above Cartesian coordinate system, and when the MR signal is collected in the coordinate system, a proper axis (for example, a radial direction and an angular direction) is set in the coordinate system.","The RF coil portion  generates an RF magnetic field exciting a spin of the subject  in a static magnetic space and receives the MR signal generated according the spin excited by the RF magnetic field. Further, a coil receiving the MR signal in the RF coil portion  may be used together with a coil generating the RF magnetic field, or may be installed separately from the coil generating the RF magnetic field. Further, the RF coil portion  may be configured by a single coli, or for example, a plurality of coils - to - (multi-channel) as illustrated in . Further, when the RF coil portion  is configured by the multi-channel, the RF coil portion  may obtain the MR signal for each channel.","The MR signal is obtained by, for example, a pulse sequence of a gradient echo (GE), and becomes a sampling signal for a frequency domain, that is, a Fourier space (k space). The GE system includes, for example, a steady state, in addition to the GE. Further, the pulse sequence may be, for example, a balanced steady state free precession (SSFP) and a true fast imaging with steady-state precession (TrueFISP), and may be a spin echo (SE) and the like which are not the GE.","[Control System ]","The control system  includes, for example, a static magnetic power supply , an inclined magnetic power supply , a transmitting unit , a receiving unit , and a sequence controller , as illustrated in .","The static magnetic power supply  supplies power to the static magnetic coil portion  and drives the coil system . When the power is supplied to the static magnetic coil portion , the static magnetic field is generated in the bore A. The inclined magnetic power supply  supplies the power to the inclined magnetic coil portion  according to a control signal input from the sequence controller . A desired inclined magnetic field (gradient magnetic field) is generated in the slide-axial, phase-axial, frequency-axial directions by supplying the power to the inclined magnetic coil portion , respectively.","The transmitting unit  applies the RF signal to the RF coil portion  according to the control signal input from the sequence controller .","The receiving unit  receives the MR signal generated by driving the coil system . For example, the MR signal received from the RF coil portion  is detected to generate complex data (raw data) which is digitalized by performing necessary signal processing and analog-to-digital (A\/D) converting. Of course, the receiving unit  directly A\/D-converts the detected MR signal to generate the raw data. The raw data generated by the receiving unit  is output to, for example, the sequence controller .","The sequence controller  drives the inclined magnetic power supply  for driving the MRI device , the transmitting unit , and the receiving unit . For example, the sequence controller  drives the inclined magnetic power supply , the transmitting unit , and the receiving unit  by applying the control signal to the inclined magnetic power supply , the transmitting unit , and the receiving unit .","The control signal is generated according to the pulse sequence defining a size, an applying time, and an applying timing and the like of a pulse current applied to the inclined magnetic power supply , the transmitting unit , and the receiving unit . Information on the pulse sequence is input to the sequence controller  from the information processing device  to be described below. Further, the sequence controller  outputs the raw data input from the receiving unit  to the information processing device .","The control system  further includes the information processing device  as illustrated in . The information processing device  includes, for example, an operation unit A, an input unit B, a display unit C, and a memory unit D.","The input unit B is a device which inputs user's information to the inside of the information processing device  as digital data, and for example, configured by a keyboard, a mouse, a scanner, or the like.","The display unit C displays a result (for example, shape image) processed by the operation unit A, a dialog for inputting data such as an imaging condition, or the like, and for example, is configured by a display device such as a liquid crystal display.","The memory unit D stores various programs controlling the MRI device , and for example, a program  used for a determination process to be described below, a phase difference enhancement imaging program and the like which are used to create the shape image to be described below, or the like.","The operation unit A analyzes and executes commands of various programs, and for example, is configured by a central processing unit (CPU). In the operation unit A, the program  stored in the memory unit D is loaded at the same time of starting the MRI device , and as a result, the operation unit A analyzes and executes the command of the program  according to a user's instruction.","Further, the operation unit A may be configured by hardware corresponding to functions of the various programs (for example, the program ). Hereinafter, various commands of the program  are executed in the operation unit A to create the phase image.","Next, creation of the phase difference image performed in the MRI device  will be described. In order to obtain the phase difference image, the intensity image and the phase image are required. The images may be obtained by using the pulse sequence of the GE, but may use, for example, another pulse sequence included in the GE system or a pulse sequence other than the GE system.","The phase image obtained by the pulse sequence of the GE system is proportional to the product \u0394B\u00d7TE of a change amount \u0394B of a local magnetic field (local magnetic field as compared with an external magnetic field) made by the tissue included in each pixel and an echo time TE required for imaging. Accordingly, in order to extract large phase (difference) information from the phase image, the TE is increased, or a function enhancing the \u0394B (so-called an enhancement function is changed to be stronger.","In detail, the imaging is performed by using a predetermined pulse sequence. The number of imaging may be once, and may be several times for statistical processing. Further, in the case where the RF coil portion  is configured by the multi-channel to obtain the MR signal for each channel, an arithmetic mean of the MR signals obtained for each channel is calculated, and the intensity image and the phase image are created by using the arithmetic mean of the MR signals. Further, when the arithmetic mean is calculated, sensitivity correction for each MR signal may be performed in advance.","(Obtaining Raw Data R)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","26","26"]},"First, the operation unit A outputs a control signal requesting to obtain the raw data by using the predetermined pulse sequence to the sequence controller . Then, the control signal according to the predetermined pulse sequence is output from the sequence controller  to the inclined magnetic power supply , the transmitting unit , and the receiving unit .","When the control signal is input, the inclined magnetic power supply  and the transmitting unit  output a predetermined current pulse to the coil system , and the RF coil portion  detects the MR signal. Here, the detected MR signal is converted into the raw data R by the predetermined signal processing in the receiving unit .","The receiving unit  inputs the raw data R to the sequence controller , and the sequence controller  transmits (inputs) the raw data R to the operation unit A. As such, the operation unit A obtains the data (the raw data R) corresponding to the MR signal.","(Creating Intensity Image M(x) and Phase Image P(x))","Next, the operation unit A is disposed in a k space in which the raw data R input from the sequence controller  is set in an internal memory (not illustrated). Hereinafter, the data disposed in the k space is referred to as a k spatial data S(k).","The operation unit A performs inverse Fourier transform with respect to the k spatial data S(k), and reconfigures a complex image \u03c1(x). The complex image \u03c1(x) is an image in which a real image exists in a real part and an imaginary image exists in an imaginary part, as illustrated in the following Equation 1.\n\n[Equation 1]\n\n\u03c1()=|\u03c1()|\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The operation unit A obtains an intensity image M(x) and a phase image P(x) from the complex image \u03c1(x).","(Creating Phase Difference Image PD(x))","In one or more embodiments, when the MR signal is obtained, a long TE is used. Accordingly, phase wrapping occurs in the phase image P(x), and the phase exceeds 2\u03c0 to obtain a phase value obtained by subtracting 2 \u03c0n (n is an integer) form a real phase. As a result, the phase image P(x) becomes a stripe image and thus does not have an original phase value. In this case, the operation unit A removes the phase wrapping and simultaneously, performs a process for extracting the phase difference.","In detail, the operation unit A, first, performs Fourier transform with respect to the complex image \u03c1(x), and returns the complex image \u03c1(x) to the k spatial data S(k). In addition, the operation unit A reads the k spatial data S(k) disposed in the k space. Next, the operation unit A performs inverse Fourier transform for data L(k)\u00d7S(k) obtained through a low pass filter (LPF) with respect to the k spatial data S(k) to obtain a complex image \u03c1\u2032(x). Further, the L(k) is a function of the LPF.","Next, the operation unit A creates a phase difference image PD(x) by using the complex images \u03c1(x) and \u03c0\u2032(x). In detail, the operation unit A performs a complex quotient operation that divides the complex image \u03c1(x) by the complex image \u03c1\u2032(x) to create the phase difference image PD(x). Accordingly, the phase wrapping of the phase portion is removed.","In this case, the phase difference included in the phase difference image PD(x) has a width of 2\u03c0, and in one or more embodiments, the phase difference included in the phase difference image PD(x) is assumed as \u2212\u03c0\u2266PD(x)<\u03c0. A sign of the phase difference included in the phase difference image PD(x) is determined by \u2212\u03b3\u00d7\u0394B\u00d7TE.","However, the sign of the phase difference included in the phase difference image PD(x) may be changed by changing definition of the LPF and definition of the complex quotient when extracting the phase difference image PD(x) without changing the size of the phase difference. Accordingly, in order to correspond to this, particularly, the definition is set so that the sign is negative with respect to a venous blood. Further, the \u03b3 is a positive proportion integer, and for example, corresponds to a gyromagnetic ratio of hydrogen.","Next, an area interested by the user of the MRI device  (hereinafter, referred to as an area of interest) is set with respect to the phase difference image, and a predetermined operation process is performed with respect to the phase difference image included in the corresponding area of interest. Normality (or abnormality) of the tissue included in the area of interest may be determined by the operation process.","Hereinafter, referring to , the process for determining the normality (or abnormality) of the tissue included in the area of interest will be described. The data processing illustrated in  is performed by the control system  under the control of the operation unit A. The operation unit A receives the instruction from the user to start an operation of the data processing illustrated in , when the creation of the phase difference image is completed.","[Displaying of Area Definition Interface]","When the processing starts, an interface for defining a cross section or a part of a space imaged in the MRI device  is displayed on a screen of the display unit C (S). The interface may display the intensity image, the phase image, or the like created on the basis of the MR signal and defines a predetermined area on the image by an area definition means such as a closed curve (an edge and the like) or a coordinate value.","[Setting of Area of Interest]","Next, an operator of the MRI device  defines the cross section or the part of the space imaged in the MRI device  as the area through the interface displayed on the display unit C (S). Here, the area defined by the operator is the area of interest. The operator defines an area supposing that an abnormal tissue may be included as the area of interest when the image displayed on the display unit C is observed. Further, the area of interest may be a 2-dimensional space or a 3-dimensional space.","[Creating Phase Difference Distribution]","When the area of interest is set, the operation unit A obtains the entire phase data of the MR signals obtained from the tissue included in the area of interest, and compiles statistics on the phase data to create the phase difference distribution in which a horizontal axis is set as a phase value and a vertical axis is set as a data number (S).","Next, a function group using for fitting the phase difference distribution is selected (S). Here, the operator selects a proper function group according to a target tissue, lesions, a disease condition, an imaging method, or the like. Further, in the case where an object is predetermined, step S is skipped, and a basic function group according to the target may be automatically applied. Further, the basic function group is prepared according to a target tissue, lesions, a disease condition, an imaging method, or the like, and a proper function group according to the object may be selected by selecting the object from a selection screen.","[Fitting]","Next, with respect to one phase difference distribution created in one area of interest, fitting is simultaneously performed by a plurality of functions (S). That is, one phase difference distribution is close to a curve of overlaying the plurality of functions. In the plurality of functions, various functions may be adopted, and a Gauss distribution, a Lorentz distribution, a binomial distribution, or the like are exemplified.","Of course, the plurality of functions is not necessarily limited to the distribution functions, and need not be orthogonal to each other. Further, the plurality of functions may be configured by combining different kinds of functions. Further, when the fitting is performed by an operation of a computer, the plurality of functions is required to be finite.","Here, at least one of a plurality of functions used in the fitting may use the Gauss distribution. A signal distribution obtained by any tissue is a random variable represented by a sum of a plurality of independent factors, and secured to follow the Gauss distribution by a central limit theorem.","Each function used for the fitting has one to a plurality of parameters for changing a function shape, when the fitting is performed by using the plurality of functions, at least, it is necessary to adjust parameters larger than or equal to the number of functions used for fitting.","Actually, while the plurality of parameters is properly changed, a parameter set closest to overlapping of the phase difference distribution and the plurality of functions is searched. In this case, when the fitting function is the Gauss distribution, the parameter is small as three, and the parameters are easily adjusted. Further, the approximate degree of the plurality of functions and the phase difference distribution may be evaluated by, for example, a least-square method and the like.","In one or more embodiments to be described below, as the plurality of functions, a double Gauss distribution model having two Gauss distributions is adopted. Since the Gauss distribution has three parameters of a height, a central position (average), and a standard deviation \u03c3 (or variance \u03c3^2), in the double Gauss distribution model, the fitting is performed by adjusting six parameters.","The following Equation 2 represents a function used for fitting in the double Gauss distribution model.\n\n[Equation 2]\n\n(\u03b8)=\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nIn the Equation 2, Acorresponds to a height of a first Gauss distribution, Bcorresponds to a reciprocal number of variance of the first Gauss distribution, and Ccorresponds to a central position of the first Gauss distribution. In addition, Acorresponds to a height of a second Gauss distribution, Bcorresponds to a reciprocal number of variance of the second Gauss distribution, and Ccorresponds to a central position of the second Gauss distribution.\n","[Display]","The parameter set obtained by fitting described above becomes the combination of values characterizing magnetic susceptibility of the tissue included in the area of interest. That is, a parameter set in the case where the area of interest includes an abnormal tissue having different magnetic susceptibility from the normal tissue is different from the parameter set in the case where the area of interest includes only the normal tissue.","Then, the parameter set obtained by fitting is displayed on the display unit C (S), or the degree of deviation (normality (or abnormality) of the tissue) from the normal tissue of the tissue included in the area of interest is calculated on the basis of the parameter set to be displayed on the display unit C (S). When the display is performed, the operator may obtain a reference for determining whether the tissue included in the area of interest is normal or abnormal, and obtain a reference of the deviation degree from the normal tissue.","[Description of Experimental Result]","Herein, a result of an experiment, in which with respect to the phase difference distribution obtained from a brain parenchyma of a mouse, fitting is performed in the double Gauss distribution model, will be described. In the experiment, in a mutant APP (Amyloid precursor protein) gene manipulated mouse with an amino acid substitution that causes an Alzheimer's disease in humans and a control mouse genetically controlled so that various properties are constant, the phase difference distribution in the brain was examined.","In detail, brains of the gene manipulated mouse and the control mouse are extracted and then imaged by using a 3D-FLASH (3D-Fast Low Angle Shot) with a 7T-MRI device to obtain the intensity image and the phase image at the same time. A main imaging condition is TR\/TE: 50\/12.8 ms, Flip Angle: 20\u00b0, Matrix Size: 194\u00d7128\u00d782 (0.08 mm isovoxel), and adding: 24 times.","In the experiment, the intensity image and the phase image obtained from a cortex, a hippocampus, and a thalamus in the brain are used. Particularly, many senile plaques, as one of pathological changes of the Alzheimer's disease, are accumulated in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus. Further, it is known that iron is deposited in the senile plaques, and it is considered that a change in magnetic susceptibility due to the iron may be determined as the phase signal. In detail, the area of interest including a portion where the senile plaques exist is set, and with respect to the phase difference distribution of the phase value of each magnetic resonance signal collected from the brain parenchyma, the fitting is performed in the double Gauss distribution model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIGS. 5 to 7"]},"Here, when comparing contribution ratios (heights) of the Gauss distributions in a fitting curve, in , the first Gauss distribution has a height 7 to 8 times larger than the second Gauss distribution, and in , the first Gauss distribution has a height substantially the same as the second Gauss distribution. However, in , like , the first Gauss distribution has a height 8 to 9 times larger than the second Gauss distribution. That is, it can be seen that the contribution ratio (height) of each Gauss distribution may not be adopted as a determining reference of the existence of the abnormal tissue because each case varies even in the same lesion.","Next, when comparing standard deviations (widths) of the Gauss distributions, in , both the first Gauss distribution and the second Gauss distribution represent sharp distributions, and particularly, the second Gauss distribution has a width (for example, half width) smaller than the first Gauss distribution, or any Gauss distribution has a width (for example, half width) smaller than the phase difference distribution. Meanwhile, in , the second Gauss distribution has a width (for example, half width) larger than the first Gauss distribution, and further, the second Gauss distribution has a width (for example, half width) larger than the phase difference distribution. That is, it can be seen that the standard deviation (width) of the Gauss distribution may be a determining reference of the existence of the abnormal tissue because a clear difference is observed in the normal tissue of the control mouse and the tissue including the senile plaque of the gene manipulated mouse.","The following discussion is made based on the above experimental results.","First, it is considered that the first Gauss distribution configuring the fitting curve illustrated in  is caused by a noise component. It is expected that an error occurs in the phase difference due to a thermal electrical noise, a digital rise noise generated by cutting, or the like. It is known that the noises follow the Gauss distribution, and it is considered that a relatively high Gauss distribution occurs. Accordingly, in the case where the phase difference distribution is fit with the plurality of functions, it is considered that when the Gauss distribution is adopted in at least one of the plurality of functions, a good fitting result may be obtained.","Further, it is considered that the second Gauss distribution illustrated in the fitting curve illustrated in  is related to a tissue including any magnetic material. The phase difference distribution illustrated in  is obtained from the area of interest set so that the senile plaque is included. The senile plaque is the tissue including iron having magnetism as described above, and has a relatively large standard deviation when the phase difference distribution of the tissue including a magnetic material is fit with the Gauss distribution.","Further, when comparing cuffs of the phase difference distributions in , and , the phase difference distribution illustrated in  has a sharp increase relatively close to the Gauss distribution, but the phase difference distribution illustrated in  have a wide cuff as compared with the Gauss distribution at the same height, and any broad phase difference distribution coexists. That is, it is suggested that when the cuff of the phase difference distribution is wider than that of the Gauss distribution at the same height, a tissue including any magnetic material is included in the area of interest.","Further, it is considered that when the Gauss distribution of which a center is shifted to the + side is fit, the tissue including a magnetic material in which the phase is shifted to the + side, and it is considered that when the Gauss distribution of which a center is shifted to the \u2212 side is fit, the tissue including a magnetic material in which the phase is shifted to the \u2212 side. As a result, it may be considered that overlapping of a distribution of the magnetic susceptibility of the normal tissue and the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility of the abnormal tissue becomes a distribution of the phase image.","Further, a difference in center between the phase difference distribution and the second Gauss distribution is large in , as compared with . For the reason, when the phase difference of the normal tissue is 0, the Gauss distribution having a center close to the phase difference of 0 is considered as the Gauss distribution represented by the normal tissue, and the Gauss distribution having the center far away from the phase difference of 0 is considered as a tissue having high possibility that a large amount of tissue other than the normal tissue is included. That is, it is considered that a distance between a center of the Gauss distribution corresponding to the normal tissue and a center of the Gauss distribution corresponding to the abnormal tissue becomes a reference indicating normality (or abnormality) of the tissue included in the area of interest.","Next, a phase difference enhancement imaging method of enhancing a specific phase difference, which is performed by using a fitting function obtained by using a double Gauss distribution model, will be described. Further, the phase difference enhancement imaging method is a method of expressing an image portion corresponding to phase information selected by enhancement by an enhancement function w(\u03b8) on the intensity image M(x), by selecting a part of the obtained phase difference image PD(x) and selecting the part or all thereof. According to the phase difference enhancement imaging method, an image created by the enhancement function w(\u03b8) may be provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 8"]},"In the double Gauss distribution model, as described above, in the case where the abnormal tissue including the magnetic material is included in the area of interest, the second Gauss distribution has a larger standard deviation and a wider base than the first Gauss distribution. Accordingly, it is considered that the second Gauss distribution indicating the distribution of the abnormal tissue enhances the tissue having a phase larger than or equal to the first Gauss distribution indicating the distribution of the normal tissue to provide a shape image with improved visibility ease of the abnormal tissue.","(Creating Phase Difference Image PD(x))",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"26"},"The phase difference distribution is changed, for example, like models illustrated in , by a change in the LPF size. That is, a width of the phase difference distribution which is substantially symmetrical based on the phase difference of zero is reduced while the LPF size is increased. As a result, the phase difference image mainly has a value of the zero phase difference and a value near the zero phase difference, and thus a contrast of the tissue is hardly given as the phase difference image. Meanwhile, with respect to a tissue having a minute structure, in the case of using a large LPF, the contrast is easy to be given as compared with a case of using a small LPF.","The phenomenon is easily understood when considering that the complex quotient used when the phase difference image is obtained corresponds to the subtraction on the index. That is, with respect to exp(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6\u2032)(\u03c6: entire phase including phase wrapping, and \u03c6\u2032: phase of a low pass component (low frequency component) including phase wrapping), in the case where the LPF size becomes the overall image size, all the frequencies are included, and as a result, when \u03c6=\u03c6\u2032, the phase difference may be close to zero. Accordingly, the width of the phase difference distribution is decreased.","However, this is only an extreme trend, and in a general tissue, it is actually impossible to expect which distribution becomes in the case of using any filter. In order to respond to the change in the phase difference distribution, in one or more embodiments, the distribution flexibly responsible as the enhancement function to be described below is selected, and as illustrated in , the distribution having different frequency distributions with respect to the same phase difference have the same contrast.","For example, the operation unit A selects a width of the phase difference and a central value thereof so that the contrast of the target tissue has a desired size. Further, the selecting of the width of the phase difference and the central value thereof may be performed by not the operation unit A but the user of the MRI device . In this case, the operation unit A selects the phase \u03b8 of the target tissue to which the change of the phase difference distribution) by filtering is added.","Subsequently, the operation unit A enhances the selected phase \u03b8 with the enhancement function w(\u03b8) to obtain an enhancement image w(PD(x)).","Here, as the enhancement function w(\u03b8), an exponential function is used. In one or more embodiments, an example of the exponential function uses a \u03c0 function. The \u03c0 function is represented by the following two Equations.\n\n(\u03b8)=1 . . . (\u2212\u03c3\u2266\u03b8\u2266\u03c3)\n\n(\u03b8)=exp(\u2212\u00d7(Abs(\u03b8)\u2212\u03c3)) . . . (\u03b8 is beyond the above range)\n","(Determination of a, b, and \u03c3)","All the parameters a, b, and \u03c3 have real values. The parameters a and b are to adjust the degree of the phase difference enhancement, and determined by the filter size of the LPF. The parameters a and b are determined so as to maximize a contrast C or a contrast noise ratio CNR of the target tissue and the background thereof. The parameter \u03c3 is to reduce a noise on the phase difference image PD(x), and determined by a standard deviation of a tissue in which a phase average value on the phase difference image PD(x) is near 0 (zero). The parameter \u03c3 may be required based on the data obtained from many experiments. However, the tissue in which the phase average value is near 0 (zero) may not exist on all the phase difference images PD(x) imaged at one time. In this case, the parameter \u03c3 is determined by, for example, the contrast C or the contrast noise ratio CNR.","Further, the aforementioned contrast C is determined by representing a difference between a signal w(PD(x1))\u00d7M(x1) after enhancing the target tissue at a position x1 on the image and a signal w(PD(x2))\u00d7M(x2) of a background of the tissue enhanced at a position x2 on the image as an absolute value, as illustrated in the following Equation.","Further, the contrast C\u2014the contrast noise ratio CNR is represented by c\/\u03c3\u2032 as illustrated in the following Equation. Further, \u03c3\u2032 is determined by a standard deviation on the enhancement image of the target tissue or a standard deviation on the enhancement image of the background of the target tissue.","However, when the \u03c3\u2032 is determined, the aforementioned standard deviation may not be adopted. In this case, a standard deviation of an external signal of the subject  or a standard deviation according to a difference method may be adopted. Only the noise portion of the phase difference may be removed by using the \u03c0 function defined by \u03c3 determined as described above to create the phase difference enhancement image having a high S\/N ratio.\n\n=Abs(((1))\u00d7(1)\u2212((2))\u00d7(2))\n\n\n","Further, Abs(\u03b8) represents an absolute value of \u03b8. The \u03c0 function is a function in which the phase difference image PD(x) is not enhanced in the range of Abs(\u03b8)\u2266\u03c3, but enhanced in another range. Since the \u03c0 function may be approximated to any power function with any precision, as compared with a case of using a polynomial expression as the enhancement function, more flexible enhancement may be performed.","For example, when the filter size of the LPF is changed according to a size of the imaging area, the distribution of the phase difference is slightly changed according to the change in size. Meanwhile, when the filter size of the LPF is changed while the size of the imaging area is constantly fixed, the distribution of the phase difference is largely changed according to the change in size. As such, in the case where imaging conditions and the like are different from each other, the distributions of the phase difference are different from each other. Accordingly, in the case of always using the same enhancement function regardless of the imaging condition and the like, each contrast is changed, and thus the enhancement of the target tissue may not be clearly performed. Meanwhile, in one or more embodiments, as described above, the parameters a, b, and \u03c3 of the enhancement function have real values to be flexibly changed according to the imaging condition and the like. Accordingly, even though the imaging condition is changed, the contrast may be equally or equivalently maintained.","(Creation of Shape Image I(x))","Next, the operation unit A, for example, masks the intensity image M(x) to the enhancement image w(PD(x) according to a predetermined mode (rule) to obtain a shape image I(x). A detailed condition when masking the intensity image M(x) to the enhancement image w(PD(x) may be set according to a target to be enhanced, and basically, may be set according to four kinds (tissue enhancement, vascular enhancement, entire enhancement, and structure enhancement) of enhancement modes to be exemplified below.","For example, as both the parameter a and the phase difference image PD(x) are positive or negative, any one of the tissue enhancement and the vascular enhancement may be selected. The entire enhancement does not depend on the signs of the parameter \u03c3 and the phase difference image PD(x), but in the structure enhancement, for example, a value of a phase difference \u03b1 (hereinafter, simply referred to as a phase difference \u03b1) made by a structure in the cortex is obtained by an experiment in advance, and a conditional expression is set according to a size relation between the phase difference \u03b1 and the phase difference image PD(x).","Enhancement mode A (tissue enhancement)\n\n()=(())\u00d7() . . . (()\u22670)\n\n()=() . . . (()<0)\n","Enhancement mode B (vascular enhancement)\n\n()=(())\u00d7() . . . (()\u22660)\n\n()=() . . . (()>0)\n","Enhancement mode C (entire enhancement)\n\n()=(())\u00d7()\n","Enhancement mode D (structure enhancement)\n\n|\u03b1|<\u03c3\n","When PD(x)\u22660,\n\n()=(())\u00d7() . . . (\u2212|\u03b1|\u2266()\u2266\u2212\u03c3)\n\n()=() . . . (()<\u2212|\u03b1|)\n","When PD(x)>0,\n\n()=(())\u00d7()\n","In the enhancement mode A, the operation unit A extracts a portion where the phase difference image PD(x) is 0 (zero) or more and enhances only the portion to create the shape image I(x). In this case, the portion where the phase difference image PD(x) is negative may not be enhanced. In the enhancement mode A, the shape image I(x) becomes the tissue enhanced image.","In the enhancement mode B, the operation unit A extracts a portion where the phase difference image PD(x) is 0 (zero) or less and enhances only the portion to create the shape image I(x). In this case, the portion where the phase difference image PD(x) is positive may not be enhanced. In the enhancement mode B, the shape image I(x) becomes the blood vessel enhanced image.","In the enhancement mode C, the operation unit A creates the shape image I(x) by enhancing the entire phase difference image PD(x). In the enhancement mode C, the shape image I(x) becomes the entirely enhanced image including the tissue, the blood vessel, and the like.","In the enhancement mode D, the operation unit A enhances a portion filling \u2212|\u03b1|\u2266PD(x)\u2266\u2212\u03c3 when the phase difference image PD(x) is 0 (zero) or less to create the shape image I(x). In this case, the portion filing PD(x)<\u2212|\u03b1| is not enhanced. Further, the operation unit A creates the shape image I(x) by using the conditional expression described above even when the phase difference image PD(x) is larger than 0 (zero). In the enhancement mode D, the shape image I(x) becomes the structure enhanced image. Further, since the phase difference \u03b1 is made by the structure in the cortex, the shape image I(x) actually becomes the image in which the cortex structure is enhanced.","As such, in one or more embodiments, an anatomical location of the brain function against the tissue contrast expressed by each shape image I(x) may be more accurately specified by changing a masking method of the enhancement images w(PDr(x)) and w(PDa(x)) and the intensity image M(x).","According to one or more embodiments described above, when analyzing an MR image obtained from a living body, the phase difference distribution of an MR signal obtained from an area of interest is created, the phase difference distribution is simultaneously fit with a plurality of function groups, and normality of the living body included in the area of interest is verified based on the magnetic susceptibility of the tissue included in the area of interest which is determined on the basis of the parameters of the plurality of function groups fit to the phase difference distribution. Accordingly, a tissue or lesions, which cannot be portrayed by means of medical imaging equipment such as an MRI, may be realistically detected within the current range of health care services provided under medical insurance.","Further, the technology is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments or modified example, but includes components acquired by substituting the respective components disclosed in the aforementioned embodiments or modified example with each other or changing combinations of the respective components, components acquired by substituting the respective components disclosed in known technology and the aforementioned embodiments or modified example with each other or changing combinations of the respective components, and the like.
