No. 61\/315,527 filed Mar. 19, 2010.","N\/A","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to an electronic record system, and more particularly, to an electronic medical record device and management system that is encrypted to authenticate, authorize and deny access to the system and patient information based on a user's encryption security level, facilitates electronic updating of patient information on the device and in the system by authorized users and manages the storage, flow and access to medical information stored in a database or data warehouse.","2. Description of the Background Art","Patient medical information, dental information, personal information, insurance information, charts and diagnostic test results have been traditionally maintained in paper medical files or in some respects on a computer system, and managed by the doctors' offices. The problem with traditional systems and methods is that only the patient's doctor has access to personal information and other doctors and medical personnel do not have immediate access when they may need it to treat a patient, especially in emergencies. Right now, hospitals and doctor offices do not share medical information electronically and do not have the ability to access a patient's medical and related information outside of their own internal system. To obtain needed patient medical information, a doctor or medical personnel must try to locate a patient's doctor and wait for the information or spend time tracking down needed medical and related information. If unsuccessful, the medical personnel must run tests, which may not be needed or may administer medical treatment or medicine that is detrimental to the patient. This is not only financially costly, but it cost a patient's life.","When a patient is treated by emergency medical personnel at a remote location or in a hospital emergency room, doctors want and need to know important medical information of the patient to properly treat them without risking harm or even death to the patient. Attending physicians and nurses need to know what medications the patient takes, whether the patient is allergic to any medicine or has any diseases, heart disease or any other relevant health condition. If a patient is in a comatose state, unconscious or unable to recall their doctor's name or their actual medical history and information, it makes it much more difficult and dangerous for the attending physician to administer care. In these situations, prior to treating the patient, the attending physician has to spend time, energy and resources to determine a patient's medical status. This increases the costs of treating a patient and greatly increases the risk of additional suffering by the patient, permanent health consequences or even potential death.","Attempts have been made to create medical cards and systems with electronically stored medical information of a person that can be accessed electronically and a universal medical information system. These devices and systems, however, have not been adopted by the medical community for several reasons. For instance, current medical information cards known are easily manipulated as they are not encrypted to control access. Conventional medical cards also fail to satisfy HIPAA requirements because they are not secure, are unreliable and easily manipulated by the owner or caring medical personnel. Accordingly, medical doctors and nurses do not and cannot rely on the health information contained on a patient's medical card.","There are many patents and published patent applications that disclose a variety of medical health cards and record systems, but they fail to adequately and effectively address these reliability and accessibility issues as contemplated by the instant invention disclosed herein. Accordingly, they have not been adopted for mainstream use or for use to make the medical record industry electronic. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 7,395,215, issued to Grushka, discloses a portable personal health information package comprising a database management software program and portable computer readable storage device wherein the owner has absolute control on the availability, completeness, accuracy, integrity, confidentiality, security, backups and access to his health data.

The USB device  may be secured on a card, wrist band or any other practical device that allows an attending physician to plug it into a USB drive on a computer to access the information on the device. The USB device  is plugged into a computer so as to electronically communicate with an authorization server -. Referring to , the authorization server comprises a web site , logon validation processing unit , patient validation server , tracking server  and database . The logon validation server  validates a person logging onto the system , the patient validation server  determines whether a patient is current and registered, the tracking server  tracks the activity on a client's account and the database  stores the requisite medical data. A user  or client  accessing the system  does so through the Internet, which connects one to the website . The medical information system  also comprises a document handler  that is accessed through the authorization server -. The document handler  communicates with and provides controlled access to a plurality of databases, such as a doctor's office database , patient medical information database , hospital database , EMS database , insurance database , pharmacy database , laboratory databases  and others . Alternatively, all data may be stored on and accessed from one or main database. With reference to , patients, hospitals, pharmacies, police, fire rescue, diagnostic labs and, or doctors access the website  over the Internet  and through the authorization server -. The authorization server - allows or denies access to the document management system .","With reference to the drawings, the system  comprises an authorization server - having a document policy manager system, document management system  and main database . The document policy manager is in two places simultaneously. Part A of the document policy manager resides on the document management side, working with the document handler. Part B of the document policy manager resides on the authorization side. When data records want to be accessed, Part B calls upon Part A for permission. If approved, Part A sends a key to Part B allowing access to and opening one or more parts within the data record. At the same time, Part A and B instructs the authorization server - to initiate its functions. Referring to , the document management system  comprises a document creator system , document storage system , document handler system , Part A of the document policy manager system  and a storage array network controlled server  (the \u201cSAN system\u201d). The document creator system  pulls information from data sources, then constructs a file based on the data received. Once the file is made, the document creator transmits the file to the document storage system . The document storage system  selects the record folder for placing the file received from the document creator . Once the files are placed in the record folder, the folder is passed to the document handler system . The document handler system , scans the record folder for any updates that may have been placed in the folder. The document handler system  waits for the document policy manager (Part A)  before sending the record folder to the SAN system . Once the document creator system  and document storage system  transmits the data, the document handler system  continues to hold the folder while it waits for the file-by-file access assignment as determined by the document policy manager system . When this done, the document policy manager  releases the record to the document handler system  for placement in the SAN server . The SAN system  stores the most updated record fold at all times.","With reference to the drawings, the document policy manager  simultaneously resides in two locations. Part A resides on the document management system  side to work with the document handler  and Part B resides on the authorization server -, i.e. the authorization side. When a data record wants to be accessed, Part B calls upon Part A. For permission, Part A passes a key to Part B allowing designated parts of the dat record to be opened or accessed. At the same time, Part A and Part B instruct the authorization server - to start its functions. Part B of the document policy manager system , i.e. authorization server, comprises a server tracking system , server login password system , server update manager system  and management schema  in the server tracking system . The only way to access the web server - is through the data record schema  in the server tracking system . The server login password system  tracks local IP addresses and record header data, such as date and time, to determine who is accessing the system , what information is being sought, why the information is needed and when it is being requested. When data outside the system  is trying to be accessed, the server login password system  generates a \u201clogon script\u201d that places the user in one of three positions, i.e. patient mode, practitioner mode and, or emergency mode. Once one of the three modes is established, the login password system  contacts the document policy manager system  for keys to pass along to the logon scrip found in the data record. This allows access to the files needed within the data record. It is important to note, that the tracker server monitors everything going on during a session. The login password system  works with the document policy manager system  to determine which files within the record may be accessed. The server update manager system , scans the data record for file updates that need to be placed in the data record. The update manager  also checks file size and conductivity speed for download.
