title: Rotational power transmitting drive component with improved acoustic and assembly characteristics
abstract: A structural power transmitting component embodies a shaft and a gear or pulley held threadedly positioned on the shaft by four nuts while interconnected by a torque transmitting wedge and key. The shaft is especially configured to establish structural interrelationships with the nuts, wedge, key and gear so as to facilitate assembly and disassembly of the component as well as to maintain the wedge and key deformed under engagement by the nuts to avoid development of internal clearances during start-up and stoppage of torque transmission to thereby preclude generation of noise during such operational start-up and stoppage of transmission through the component.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to the construction and installation of parts forming a torque transmitting component.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Power transmitting systems currently utilized in certain installations such as submarines are a source of transient noise during short operational starting and finishing periods. Such systems involve a power shaft to which a pulley or gear is connected by well known facilities involving for example a key, spline or force fit. However, such connection facilities have certain handicaps involving development of looseness between the parts producing impact and acoustic noise problems. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a more quiet and dependable drive arrangement involving the shaft and rotational pulley or gear so as to avoid such acoustic problems.","In accordance with the present invention, a rotational member such as a pulley or gear is wedgedly positioned at a desired location over a flat surface of an intermediate portion of a power shaft between cross-sectionally circular end sections thereof, by means of a tapered key extending through a slot in the gear in contact with the flat shaft surface. The gear is positioned and held assembled in the desired location by locator and lock nuts threadedly mounted on the shaft in contact with one axial side of the gear, while inner and outer nuts are threaded onto the shaft in axial engagement with the key and the wedge on the other side of the gear, so as to facilitate installation and hold the installed gear in position without development of any clearance during operation of an associated powered system so as to avoid operationally induced acoustic noise problems.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an assembled drive component  having an axially elongated drive shaft  on which a torque transmitting member such as a pulley or a peripherally toothed gear  is mounted for rotation with the shaft  about an axis . The gear  is in abutment on one axial side thereof with a locator nut  for its positioning on the shaft  in spaced relation to one axial shaft end . The gear  is locked in such position on the shaft , as hereinafter explained, by an end lock nut  and an outer lock holding nut  which is axially spaced from the gear  on that side thereof opposite the gear positioning nuts  and . Also positioned on the shaft  as shown in  is an inner holding nut  axially extending into the outer lock holding nut .","The assembled component  also features a tapered key  positioned within a slot formed in the gear  and through a tapered wedge  through which the shaft  extends within the gear  as shown in . The key  and the wedge  are respectively in axial abutment with the outer lock nut  and the inner holding nut  in the fully assembled condition of the component as shown in . Such key  and the wedge  then also project axially from the gear  into a recess  formed in the locator nut .","As shown in , the shaft  is configured so as to accommodate reception and installation thereon of the gear , the four nuts , ,  and , the wedge  and the key . Toward that end, the shaft  cross-sectionally deviates from axially aligned cross-sectionally circular end sections  and  of smaller diameter at the opposite axial shaft ends  and . A radially larger intermediate portion of the shaft  extends between the end sections  and , on which all of the parts , , , ,  and  are positioned. Such intermediate portion of the shaft  includes threaded sections  and  extending from the end section  on which the nuts  and  are respectively positioned. A non-threaded section  of the intermediate shaft portion extends axially from the threaded section  to a somewhat radially larger threaded section  on which the outer lock nut  is positioned by the inner nut , threadedly positioned on both the shaft section  and a threaded section  extending toward the end section . All of the intermediate shaft sections , ,  and  form a flat surface  radially inward on one (upper) side relative to the cross-sectionally circular shaft section . The shaft section  is also flattened on the other (lower) side thereof over which the end lock nut  is positioned. The diameter of the threaded shaft section  is also larger than the diameter of shaft section  to provide an added advantage in the event loosening of the nuts  and  occurs.","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the shaft  is configured so as to receive the gear  over the flat surface  of a width sufficient to receive the tapered key  thereon as shown in . Such key  transmits torque between the shaft  and the gear , and prevents slippage therebetween because of its retention within the tapered wedge , so as to eliminate clearance. The locator nut  is positioned on the threaded section  of the shaft  for proper positioning of the gear , while the lock nut  prevents angular displacement of the locator nut  through which such desired location of the gear  is established and maintained.","During installation of the component , the lock nut  is tightened against the lock nut  after the desired positioning of the gear  is established with the wedge  and key  in full contact throughout. The wedge  is dimensioned to allow for its circumferential deformation when pressed inside the tapered slot formed in the gear  receiving the key , which is deformed inside such key slot by axial engagement with the outer nut . Accordingly, when so installed, movements between the gear  and shaft  under load are avoided.","Disassembly of the component  is facilitated by use of the flattened sections  and  of the shaft  as a gripping location thereon to unbolt and remove the nuts  and . The inner nut  may then be unbolted without disturbing the outer nut . The gear  may then be more readily disassembled by disengaging the wedge  therefrom for example.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["5","6","7","4","4","5","5","6","6","7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 1\u20137"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
