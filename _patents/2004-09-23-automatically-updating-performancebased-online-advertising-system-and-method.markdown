{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED DOCUMENTS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention claims benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/504,963 to HOROWITZ et al., entitled \u201cPERFORMANCE-BASED ONLINE ADVERTISING SYSTEM AND METHOD,\u201d filed Sep. 23, 2003, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to online advertising systems and methods, and more particularly to a system and method for performance-based online advertising.","2. Discussion of the Background","In recent years, methods, such as Cost-Per-1,000 (CPM), Cost-Per-Click (CPC), and the like, have been developed for calculating charges for advertising online. The CPM method is a holdover from traditional media advertising and typically is an unreliable, underperforming, administratively burdensome and untargeted format for advertisers seeking to maximize Return-On-Investment (ROI) for online advertising campaigns. For example, the CPM method charges advertisers based solely on the number of times the advertisement is delivered on a Web page (i.e., the number of impressions). The CPM method has typically been sold on the basis of delivering traffic and branding.","The CPC method charges for advertisements based on a cost associated with each selection of or click on an advertisement. CPC is a much more accountable means of developing a price for an advertisement, such as a keyword listing, text link, phrase, banner, button, pop-up or pop-under. The CPC format charges advertisers based on the volume of end users that click on the target advertisement, where the Click-Through Rate (CTR) for the advertisement is given by the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions. Unlike the CPM format, the CPC format has not typically been sold with any premium built in for advertiser branding.","However, online advertisers have become very focused on ROI and on minimizing financial risk. Accordingly, a growing percentage of advertisers employ software tools and operational capability to track ROI on a real-time basis. As a result, the online advertising market has evolved from a largely impression-based CPM medium, where, for example, an advertiser pays for exposure, including bulk advertising purchases, to a performance-based medium, such as a CPC campaign, where an advertiser pays for end-user click-throughs to a destination site. As a result of this evolution, average advertiser ROI for online campaigns has risen for advertisers who use CPM-based and CPC-based campaigns.","Based on the higher targeted ROI potential of CPC campaigns, acquisition costs, and ROI measurement, CPC advertising has captured an increasing percentage of the advertising dollars from the CPM market. However, while CPC campaigns offer advertisers higher targeted ROI than CPM campaigns, such campaigns create challenges for advertisers. For example, an advertiser that enters into a CPC campaign must actively monitor the performance of such campaigns, carefully scrutinizing the quality of referred users, spending habits of referred users, the resulting conversion rates from any particular click source, and the daily, weekly and monthly amounts the advertiser has agreed to pay for particular keywords, phrases, text links, advertisement placements, etc. Accordingly, it is an ongoing challenge for advertisers using CPM and CPC campaigns to monitor the campaigns and translate the CPM or CPC costs into a Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA), and compare the various net CPA numbers across the dozens or sometimes hundreds of parallel campaigns that they may be running at any given time. This ongoing analysis leads to more work on the part of the advertiser to respond to variances in the performance and the cost of such campaigns, and in adjusting the CPM or CPC as necessary on a regular or sometimes daily or even real-time basis.","Therefore, there is a need for a system and method for online advertising that addresses the above and other needs. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments provide a system and method for providing a true cost-per-acquisition (CPA)-based advertising model where an advertiser pays only for acquisitions (and does not directly pay for the media buy). In an exemplary embodiment, the system and method generate advertisements which are automatically placed on advertisement networks, such as Enhance Interactive, Overture, etc., at prices the system determines. For example, advertisements can be generated and distributed to traffic sources on behalf of advertisers who have pre-determined a price they are willing to pay for a designated action, such as the sale of a product, the acquiring of a new customer or a new applicant. In turn, the system will determine the placement of the advertisement within distribution sources.","Accordingly, the exemplary aspects of the present invention provide a system, method, and computer program product for online advertising, including computing and dynamically updating a cost-per-click (CPC) value of an advertisement for an advertisement traffic source based on a variable; and automatically uploading and distributing the advertisement to the traffic source. The variable includes price, advertisement traffic source, and\/or advertiser variables. Further embodiments include dynamically updating an advertisement listing that has a cost-per-acquisition (CPA)-based value with associated CPC or cost-per-1000 (CPM) values; and distributing the advertisement listing to an advertisement distribution network that serves the listing based on the CPC or CPM values. The distribution network includes CPC-based, CPA-based, and\/or CPM-based distribution networks. Further embodiments include determining a CPC value for a CPA-based advertisement; and placing the advertisement on an advertising network at the determined CPC based on a ratio of an expected number of conversions at a CPA value divided by a number of clicks at the CPC.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, by illustrating a number of exemplary embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The present invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Generally, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a system, and method for implementing a performance-based online advertising service for advertisers that addresses the above and other needs with CPM and CPC methods, and provides the ability to advertise on a CPA basis. Advantageously, with the exemplary embodiments, the risk associated with the fluctuations in conversion costs when buying advertising on a CPC or CPM basis, for example, such as when the cost for the number of clicks and associated CPC exceeds the advertiser target CPA, can be eliminated.","Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments are directed to a system and method for implementing a performance-based online advertising service for advertisers that provides the ability to advertise on a CPA basis. The CPA format of the exemplary embodiments can include a model that creates pricing competition, wherein CPA can be an evolution of CPC advertising, as the advertiser can pay a CPA according to the demand for end users generating an event that is of value to the advertiser. In an exemplary embodiment, an event can include the signup of a new customer, a transaction, bid, click, lead, and the like, during a given period of time after accessing a target advertisement.","In an exemplary embodiment, performance-based advertising can include Paid Placement, Paid Listings, Paid Submission, Paid Inclusion, Pay-Per-Click (PPC) formats, and the like, for example, that allow advertisers to purchase click-throughs to a specified destination that are generated from advertisements. In an exemplary embodiment, such advertisements can take the form of text links, banners, search results, media files, buttons, and the like. The location or placement of advertisements delivered through the performance-based advertising of the exemplary embodiments can be determined based on the amount an advertiser is willing to pay for a keyword, phrase, text link, advertisement placement, the relevancy of a particular advertisement, and the like. For example, an advertiser who agrees to pay $0.10 per click-through on text link advertisements displayed in certain search engine results, can have the text link advertisements displayed higher in the search engine results than the text link advertisements of an advertiser who agrees to pay $0.09 per click-throughs on the same search engine results. Further exemplary embodiments can include exceptions and\/or variations to such ranking, for example, by incorporating relevancy in some form, such as the amount of times an advertisement has been clicked, the applicability to a query string, and the like, into a ranking algorithm.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to  thereof, there is illustrated an exemplary performance-based online advertising system . In , the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can include one or more Advertisers , a Production Site , an Advertiser Site , one or more Distribution Partners , one or more End Users , and one or more computing devices thereof. The Production Site  can include an Advertisement Server User Interface , an Advertisement Database (DB) , and an Advertisement Server  that can be integrated with or separate from the Production Site  or third party site (e.g., Atlas, etc.). The one or more computing devices of the Advertisers , the Production Site , the Advertiser Site , the Distribution Partner , and the End Users  can communicate with each other over a communications network , such as the Internet.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertisement Server  can include software that manages the serving, recording, and the like, of advertisement information, for example, including queries, impressions, click-throughs, conversions, sign-ups, leads, sales, bids, acquisitions, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertisement Database  can be configured as a back-end database that the Advertisement Server  and Advertisement Server User Interface  can interact with to store, retrieve, and the like, advertisement information, for example, including advertisement keywords, descriptive text, pricing, and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertisement Server User Interface  can include any suitable software, Application Programming Interface (API), and the like, that provides facilities for the Advertiser  to enter an advertising campaign, set the CPA pricing (or set the necessary data to calculate the CPA) for keywords, phrases, text links, banners, buttons, pop-ups and pop-unders, and the like, associated with a particular advertisement. In an exemplary embodiment, via the Advertisement Server User Interface , the user can observe the progress of the campaign of the user, review clicks and other statistics for ongoing and historical campaigns, and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertiser  can include one or more campaigns for a company (or companies) that wish to advertise services, products, and the like, through the Production Site . For example, the Advertiser  can include an agency entering multiple campaigns for multiple client companies. In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertiser Site  can include a Web site or any other relevant destination associated with advertisements that the Advertiser  enters into the Advertisement Server . For example, an Advertiser  can include a department store that has designed a landing page tied to a specific advertisement for shoes, etc.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Distribution Partner  can include an online publisher, for example, including owners and distributors of online content, search tools, and the like, that partner with the Production Site . The Distribution Partner  also may be owned and operated, in certain cases, by the Production Site . In an exemplary embodiment, the Distribution Partner  can query the Production Site  for advertisement listings that the Distribution Partner  can then integrate into Web pages, newsletters, e-mails, and the like, of the Distribution Partner  for serving to the End Users  visiting the destination of the Distribution Partner .","In an exemplary embodiment, the End User  can include a user of an Internet Web browser program, such as Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and the like, or e-mail or news group software, such as Outlook, Hotmail, and the like, to view Web sites, newsletters, e-mails, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the Production Site  can include a site hosting the Advertisement Server , the Advertisement Server User Interface , the Advertisement Database , the associated software and hardware components, and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Production Site  can be owned by the Production Site  or a Production Company, for example, including a Publisher Site, such as an online newspaper, an advertising network of Web sites, a portal, search engine or directory, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, an Advertisement Query can include a request made by a Web server or Web browser of the Advertisement Server  of the Production Site  to retrieve advertisements. In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertisement Database  can include, for example, a Structured Query Language (SQL) database server to store the various types of advertisement information.","The exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can be employed by the Advertisers  to promote, market, sell, advertise, and the like, goods, services, and the like, to the End Users  worldwide through a Cost-Per-Acquisition\/Action (CPA) Internet advertising model, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the advertising can be based on and include, for example, keywords, phrases, text links, banners, buttons, interstitials, pop-ups and pop-unders, and the like, and can be provided in a most efficient and cost-effective manner. Advantageously, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can deliver a very high and\/or specifically targeted Return-On-Investment (ROI) for online advertising campaigns by mirroring the target acquisition cost of the Advertisers  and minimizing the risk and financial exposure associated with underperforming traffic for the Advertisers . In an exemplary embodiment, this can be accomplished by filtering out advertisements that are not making money or by the system paying less money for placement of such advertisements on the Distribution Partner . Thus, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can remove the delta between the actual cost of acquiring an online event (e.g., a new advertiser signup, a transaction, a bid, etc.) and what the Advertisers  have historically paid or are willing to pay for such an event.","In a manner similar to CPC advertising, the Advertisers  can provide the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  with keywords, phrases, text links, banners, buttons, interstitials, pop-ups and pop-unders, and the like, that are relevant to the advertisement campaigns of the Advertisers . However, unlike CPC advertising, the Advertisers  can generate advertisements based on keywords, phrases, and the like, based on the price that the Advertisers  are willing to pay on a per event CPA basis (e.g., thirty dollars per customer purchasing an airline ticket, ten dollars for a new customer signup, fifty dollars for a customer who makes a purchase over one thousand dollars, and the like). In an exemplary embodiment, one or more suitable algorithms or a combination thereof can be employed to determine the rankings of the advertisements for the Advertisers  and in turn send the aggregated results (e.g., the result set of all advertisement purchasing keywords, phrases, text links, banners, buttons, pop-ups and pop-unders, and the like, on an event CPA basis) to the Distribution Partner  in the form of CPA, CPC, CPM or any suitable relevant metric based on the criteria of the Distribution Partner . In an exemplary embodiment, such conversion of the advertisements into a CPA, CPC or other form can be performed by the Production Site .","In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertisers  using the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can receive impressions for their advertisements and click-throughs to their Web site or desired destination for free and need only pay for confirmed events, such as new customer signups, bids, leads, clicks, purchases, transactions, and the like, or the completion of a desired effect for any suitable goods, service or action, such as a lead, sale, acquisition, sale over a specific amount, and the like, by the End Users  and as dictated by the Advertisers . For example, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can be configured to charge the Advertisers  based on any suitably trackable event, for example, including a new user sign-up, a lead, a click-through to an advertiser on the site of the Advertisers , a flat transaction fee, a percentage of the transaction, a bid being made on a product, a product being put up for bid, any suitable combination of the above, and the like.","The exemplary performance-based online advertising system  also can be configured to track leads, sales, acquisitions, deferred conversions, and the like. Deferred conversions, for example, can include users who return to a given destination subsequent to the initial session, after being directed to the destination through an advertisement of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system . The exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can be configured to charge the Advertisers  accordingly. For example, the Advertisers  can be charged a higher fee for an event that occurs within 30 minutes of the click-through, as compared to an event that happens 24-48 hours after the click-through.","In a further exemplary embodiment, information in the Advertisement Database  can be used to insert advertisements into one or more listing engines, advantageously, without being concerned with how such listing engines are implemented (e.g., how listing engines deliver advertisements). For example, the exemplary system need be concerned to the extent that the system is buying advertising inventory based on the ability of the corresponding advertisement traffic to convert for the advertiser. In this case, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system , advantageously, need not actually serve any advertisements. In addition, for the sake of efficiency and robustness, a scheduler and log processor can be employed for handling communications between the Advertisement Server  and the Advertisement Database .","The exemplary performance-based online advertising system  represents the next evolution of online advertising. The CPA alternative and the advertiser ranking algorithms of exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can capture a significant percentage of CPC and CPM advertisers and expand the existing universe of online advertisers, as the ROI potential can exceed both CPC and CPM-based formats and provide the advertiser with greater specificity of ROI. Using the exemplary performance-based online advertising system , advantageously, the Advertisers  may be willing to pay their typical CPA or greater than their typical average CPA paid in standard campaigns, for example, since the exemplary performance-based advertising system  eliminates most of the management costs and financial risk associated with CPM and CPC advertising formats.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","102","202","122","202"]},"The Advertisement Server  can employ an Advertiser Ranking and Output process , for example, to determine an algorithm applied for each keyword, phrase, etc., to determine a Conversion Rate (e.g., for determining the CPA, CPC equivalent or CPM equivalent to be delivered to the Distribution Partner ) that can be updated in real-time or near real-time as conversions are passed on to the Advertisement Server  by the Advertiser Site  or the End User , and the like. The Advertisement Database  can be used to implement an Advertiser Test Period process , for example, to track the conversion rates or clicks over a predetermined period of time (e.g., a day, a week, a month, etc.) or after a predetermined number of clicks or conversions have been recorded, and the like. A presentation layer  can employ a Results Display process , for example, to order the Advertisers  according to the ranking algorithm, to display output results as CPM equivalent, CPC equivalent, CPA equivalent or other variable, which upholds a ranking value, and the like. The results can be output by the presentation layer  to a Distribution Partner .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["302","304","124","102","122","122"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertiser  inputs can include the same basic information typically entered for a CPC campaign. However, rather than defining the CPC the Advertisers  are willing to pay, the Advertisers  determine the CPA or CPAs (or provide the data necessary to calculate the CPA or CPAs) the Advertisers  are willing to pay for the advertisements, and the action or actions that determine the acquisition or acquisitions. Once the relevant information of the Advertisers  is captured, the Advertisers  can then undergo a test period where the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  performs various analyses to determine initial advertisement placement, ranking, and the like.","At step , the Advertisement Server  can read the advertisement campaign information from the Advertisement Database , as determined by step , and which can include the test period for the Advertisers . Unless waived or not required by the provider of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system , the Advertisers  can undergo the initial test period for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., a day, a week, a month, etc.) or after a predetermined number of clicks or conversions have been recorded, and the like, to record accurate information that can be used to establish Conversion Rates (e.g., total click-throughs divided by total acquisitions) that are tracked by the Advertisement Server  of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system . Once the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  has gathered the Conversion Rate data, a suitable algorithm can be applied to determine the appropriate ranking, priority, and the like, for the Advertiser . In an exemplary embodiment, meta-information can be employed regarding conversion rates to determine the reliably of conversion rate data. For example, it may be determined that the conversion rate data is unreliable in which case the corresponding advertising campaign may not be run at all. When the test period has concluded, the Conversion Rates can be updated in real-time or near real-time, for example, as information is received from the Advertisers  and the End Users , summarizing the acquisitions of the Advertisers .","At step , for example, on an ongoing periodic basis, as determined by step , the Advertisement Server  can generate a new priority for serving the advertisement campaigns based on the latest advertisement serving information, for example, including queries, impressions, click-throughs, conversions, average purchase amounts, CPAs, Conversion Rates, click-through rates, rank at which the advertisements historically had been served, click-through rates when the advertisements were historically served at various ranks, relevancy, and the like.","At step , results of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can be presented, for example, rank-ordered, through a process whereby the CPA of each of the Advertisers  represents the amount each of the Advertisers  can pay for each acquisition generated from a click-through on an advertisement. The Advertiser  positioning can be determined by any suitable algorithm that assigns a rank that takes into account the CPA, the Conversion Rate, a budget of the Advertiser  (e.g., if the budget is limited), and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, an advertiser with the highest ranking receives first position and the remaining Advertisers  appear in descending order based on the aforementioned algorithm. The exemplary performance-based online advertising system  then can distribute the results to a distributor via CPC equivalent, CPA or any suitable alternative pricing form that establishes appropriate ranking for the Advertisers  based on a suitable algorithm thereof.","In an exemplary embodiment, at the time the Distribution Partner  calls for a set of advertisements that match some predetermined criteria, and which can take many forms, for example, including via keyword and\/or phrase entry in a search box or placement on a Web page, newsletter or e-mail, the relevant advertisements can be placed in the appropriate ranking as dictated by the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  algorithm and distributed through the Presentation Layer  to the Distribution Partner .","In an exemplary embodiment, if the End User  clicks-through on an advertisement of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system , the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can record the relevant action or actions that the user engages in on the property of the Advertisers . If the third party does not complete the relevant action, then no fees can be due. If, however, the third party does complete the relevant action, then the CPA that the Advertisers  were willing to pay for a customer on that advertisement is recorded as a debit in the accounts of the Advertisers .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["402","110","108","108","110","108","100","110","108","110","404","108","126","406","126","408","108","110","410","110","126"]},"At step , the Advertisement Server  can log the click-through and redirect the Web browser of the End User  or pop up a new Web browser for the End User  to the destination (e.g., Web page, landing page, and the like) of the Advertiser Site . At step , the End User  visits the Advertiser Site  and information regarding a unique advertisement click identifier, information detailing that the End User  originated from the Production Site , and the like, can be determined.","At step , tracking of the End User  can be performed. In an exemplary embodiment, the Production Site , and\/or the Advertiser  perform tracking of the End User  by assigning a unique identifier to the End User  and identifying actions performed by the End User . In an exemplary embodiment, if the End User  is a new user on the Advertiser Site , then when the Advertiser  assigns the End User  the unique identifier, the Web browser of the End User  can be redirected to the Advertisement Server  of the Production Site . In a further exemplary embodiment, the Advertiser Site  can submit a request to the Advertisement Server  of the Production Site . The redirect or request can include the unique identifier of the End User  for the Advertiser Site , an originating advertisement query, click information, and the like.","In a still further exemplary embodiment, a unique identifier need not be assigned to the End User , but rather a cookie, including the advertiser ID, click ID of clicks the End User  has recently made, and the like, can be employed to track the End User . Similarly, a unique ID assigned to the End User  by the Advertiser Site  need not be employed, but rather the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  can assign a unique ID to the End User . For example, in step , the End User  can be tracked by employing a cookie having information that varies depending on the type of tracking scheme being employed or an ID can be passed in the redirect and the Advertiser site  can remember the ID and return it to the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  either in a tracking pixel request or in a direct request from the Advertisement server .","In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertisement Server , for example, can ensure that the End User  has a unique identifier for the Production Site , can store a mapping between the unique identifiers of the Advertiser Site  and the Production Site , can store originating advertisement query and click information, if necessary can redirect the Web browser of the End User  back to the Advertiser Site , and the like.","As determined at step , the End User  may or may not visit subsequent unrelated sites or may quit their Web browser. As determined at step , the End User  returns to or remains at the Advertiser Site . At step , the End User  performs an action on the site of the Advertiser  that corresponds to an event or acquisition. At step , for example, when the End User  visits a Web page associated with the event or acquisition, the Advertiser Site  serves the Web page to the Web browser of the End User . In an exemplary embodiment, the Web page can include software code, an applet, a plug-in, and the like, to cause the Web browser of the End User  to make a request of the Advertisement Server  of the Production Site , passing along information that includes the unique identifier of the End User  on the Advertiser Site , the most recent unique click-through identifier for the Production Site  that took the End User  to the Advertiser Site , and the like. At step , the Advertisement Server  can log the conversion or acquisition that took place, and can deduct the CPA amount for the involved advertisement campaign from the account of the Advertiser . In a further exemplary embodiment, if the Advertiser  is to be invoiced, the Advertisement Server  can log the fact that such advertiser needs to billed the applicable amount.","Thus, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system embodiments, advantageously, can provide (i) dynamic ranking, prioritizing, and serving of an advertisement for an advertiser paying on a CPA basis based on conversion information, (ii) tracking of a user between a visit or visits to a Web site through clicking on an advertisement, (iii) tracking of the time of actual conversion or acquisition, including a deferred conversion, (iv) tracking of standard conversions that occur during a session in which a user clicks on a relevant advertisement, (v) entering, ranking, displaying, and tracking of a response to an advertisement for which payment is made by an advertiser on a CPA basis, (vi) saving of campaign management time of an advertiser and reducing a delta between a target CPA of the advertiser and an amount paid for an advertisement, (vii) distributing CPA-based advertisements to Internet-based advertising distribution networks, including at least one of Cost-Per-1,000 (CPM) advertising distribution networks, CPC advertising distribution networks, and CPA advertising distribution networks, (viii) delivering of CPA-based advertisements in a variety of formats, including at least one of a CPC-equivalent format, a CPM-equivalent format, and a CPA format, and (ix) tracking of end user conversions and end user acquisitions associated with an advertisement through a verifiable means, including tracking of the end user, direct tracking of conversion information on a site of an advertiser, and tracking of an advertiser passing conversion information back to an advertising server.","The present invention includes recognition that CPC-based advertising has become the prevailing pricing model for online advertising because it has resonated with advertisers as easier, more measurable and more equitable than CPM-based pricing. Nevertheless, as the pay-per-click market becomes more mature, advertisers have realized that not all clicks are created equal. Advertisers measure success in terms of return-on-ad-spend (ROAS) or Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) rather than the number of Web site visitors they receive, and are beginning to place demands on the marketplace to account for these metrics.","For an advertiser, managing to an ROAS is an overly complex exercise due to the sophistication needed to truly optimize ad campaigns across multiple networks. The growth in bid management, including outsourcing the administration of pay-per-click campaigns, is one result of this complexity.","Some bid management companies have priced their services to advertisers with a CPA component. For example, a bid management company may simply pass along the CPC charges from a paid listing search engine and base its service fees to advertisers on a percentage of the sales registered through the advertising campaign. However, this is not a true CPA-based pricing model because the advertiser still pays for each click generated. Bid management also fails to account for the perceived risk that an advertising campaign may not convert at all, and therefore advertisers limit their spending to reduce that perceived risk.","Accordingly, in a further exemplary embodiment, an internal sign-up process and listings management system can be provided. In a further exemplary embodiment, an external or automated sign-up process, listings management and reporting, accepting of credit cards, and placing of advertisements on additional advertising networks (e.g., the Overture network) can be provided. Still further exemplary embodiments can support additional advertising networks or online networks and provide a more sophisticated advertising placement formula.","The following exemplary embodiments cover the navigation, access rules and design for an exemplary User Interface tool. For example, the User Interface can be simple (e.g., can be based on text or graphics) and can be configured to provide (1) signing-up of advertisers; (2) advertiser information, including viewing advertisers, an all campaigns page, a campaign page, an advertisement group (Ad group) page, and billing history and administration; (3) advertiser searching; (4) reports, including targeted conversion rate by keyword, targeted conversion rate by advertisement traffic source, revenue by advertiser, revenue by day, and revenue by hour; and (5) administrative tools, including super user, and targeted conversion rate tools.","In an exemplary embodiment, an advertising group (Ad group) can have a specific conversion (or acquisition) action and cost for that acquisition associated with it (e.g., the CPA can be tied to the Ad group). An advertising group can have multiple keywords, each with its own creative, wherein a creative can be a title, display URL, clickthrough URL, description, and the like. For example, one campaign can be Microsoft Office with two Ad groups: Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. The Microsoft Word Ad group might have a CPA of $5.00, and the keywords associated with this Ad group might be \u201cword processor,\u201d \u201cmicrosoft office,\u201d and \u201cmicrosoft word.\u201d Each of those keywords may have its own unique title, description, clickthrough URL destination URL, and the like. In a further exemplary embodiment, one advertiser can have multiple accounts with multiple campaigns, and the like, associated with the advertiser.","In an exemplary embodiment, the ALL CAMPAIGNS page can have a list of all campaigns for a single advertiser. The page also can have high-level statistics for each campaign and the ability to view, modify, pause or delete that campaign. The page also can allow a user to create a new campaign.","In an exemplary embodiment, the CAMPAIGN page can display information on a single advertising campaign. The page also can have high-level statistics for the advertising campaign and the ability to view, modify the settings, pause or delete the campaign.","In an exemplary embodiment, the AD GROUP page can display information on all keywords for a single Ad group. The page also can have high-level statistics for the keywords and the ability to view, modify the settings, pause or delete the Ad group. In an exemplary embodiment, the CREATIVES page is accessed from the ad group page, and allows a user to edit a creative.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can display the billing history of an account and allow an administrator to record payments on that account and set a credit limit for that account. In an exemplary embodiment, advertisers have access to a series of reports available on web pages that display conversions, revenue generated from the advertising campaign, ROI (e.g., (revenue\u2212cost)\/cost), and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can use a cookie-based tracking system and can include all features included in the tracking system, including (1) a cookie that can be dropped on a user's browser before redirecting to the user's destination; and (2) a pixel image on the destination site's acquisition page that can register a conversion for the system. In a further exemplary embodiment, the system also can be configured to utilize a back channel, and the like, for the advertiser to share information and to maintain security of purchasing and other information for the advertiser.","In an exemplary embodiment, conversion tracking can support order size (or CPA amount), volume (e.g., number of products sold), and the like. One cookie can be used to register multiple conversions over time. For example, assuming that an office supply store has agreed to pay $25 for the sale of a printer, $5 for the sale of one ream of paper, and $10 for each ink cartridge sold. Then, assuming a user purchases one printer, one ink cartridge, and three reams of paper, in either one session or within a predetermined conversion time period, this would count as five conversions totaling $50.","In an exemplary embodiment, each conversion can be identified by country according to the IP address of the click. The system conversions can be treated and reported separately from the listing engine conversions. Partners can use the system Conversion Tracking Tool or the listing engine tool. In situations where a partner advertiser will not allow the system to track conversions, instead opting to use its own tracking tool, (a) an interface can be employed for sales to enter conversion data by keyword, time-of-day, etc., as they receive data from partners or (b) an API can be employed for partners to post the conversion data automatically to the system.","In an exemplary embodiment, the cookie can record conversions that occur up to a predetermined number of days (e.g., 90 days) from when the original click took place for a unique user. If any conversion takes place, the cookie can be reset for the unique user to the predetermined number of days. This can happen multiple times. For each advertiser, the system can track the conversion rate per listing engine search partner ID or by tracking conversion rate of affiliates or domains of partners of the listing engines.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can adjust in real time or near real time which search partners receive system paid listings and at what price, based on a targeted conversion rate. This adjustment can be automatic and apply to all listings. This information also can be tracked and available for reporting by day (e.g., conversion rate per partner per day). The targeted conversion rate can be adjustable per partner or per advertiser.","In an exemplary embodiment, for a given advertiser, the system can balance higher converting search partners with lower converting search partners to maximize advertiser budgets within the confines of a targeted conversion rate. For example, assuming the target conversion rate is 1%, if an advertiser is converting at 1.5%, then the system can activate lower converting search partners to maximize the number of conversions within the overall budget constraints of that advertiser.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can be configured to employ a different CPC per traffic source partner. The system can have a different set of traffic rules for system listings than for regular paid listings within the traffic source. The system can narrow the set of traffic sources that system advertisements are distributed on (e.g., on a system-wide level). For each advertiser, the system can track the conversion rate per keyword. For each advertiser and each keyword, a conversion rate can be tracked for each CPC.","In an exemplary embodiment, partner rank can be defined as the order (e.g., 1st, 2nd) of a system advertisement displayed on a traffic source. For example, a traffic source that is a search engine may pull listings from multiple PPC engines, and order them based on CPC. The top listing would be considered 1st. For each advertiser and each listing, a click-through rate and conversion rate can be tracked for each partner rank.","In an exemplary embodiment, for a given advertiser, the system can balance higher converting search partners with lower converting search partners to maximize advertiser budgets within the confines of a targeted conversion rate. Accordingly, for a given advertiser, the system can balance higher converting keywords with lower converting keywords to maximize spend. For example, assuming the target conversion rate is 1%, if an advertiser is converting at 1.5%, then the system can activate lower converting search partners to maximize the number of conversions within the overall budget constraints of that advertiser. In a further exemplary embodiment, the system can determine whether a keyword is \u201coverbought\u201d or \u201cunderbought\u201d according to related keywords, and can funnel money towards keywords where the CPC is relatively \u201ccheap\u201d and funnel money away from keywords where the CPC is relatively \u201cexpensive.\u201d For example, the placement of system advertisements can be determined based upon the expected number of conversions at the CPA divided by the number of clicks at the CPC. When that ratio is above the targeted conversion rate expectations of the system, the acceptable CPC goes up for the corresponding advertisement. When that ratio is below the targeted conversion rate expectations of the system, the acceptable CPC goes down or the corresponding advertisement is dropped.","In an exemplary embodiment, any suitable algorithm for adjusting CPC based on the conversion rate can be employed. Once the conversion rate is found, the lowest CPC that will be at or above the targeted conversion rate expectations can be chosen. The conversion rate can be automatically recalculated and the CPC can be readjusted based on such calculations.","As previously described, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  of  includes the Production Site  having the Advertisement Server User Interface , the Advertisement Database , and the Advertisement Server , with a communications link between the Advertisement Database  and the Advertisement server . Accordingly, the exemplary performance-based online advertising system  of  represent a complete and integrated system for serving advertisements and charging by CPA or by any other suitable means of determining a charge for advertisements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","500","500","104"]},"The exemplary performance-based online advertising system  employs an architecture where the advertisement server need not talk directly to the advertisement database, but rather employs intermediary programs, such as a scheduler that reads information from the advertisement database, digests the information, and updates the information on the advertisement server used to select and serve the advertisements, and a log processor that reads information from the advertisement server and writes the information to the advertisement database. Advantageously, such an architecture decouples the advertisement server from the advertisement database so that advertisements can be served even if the advertisement database is down. This also moves expensive computations off the advertisement server and into the scheduler and log processor machines to reduce overhead in the advertisement server, reduce stress on the advertisement database, and increase scalability. Additional components to the dataflow can be employed, such as a queue where advertisements wait for approval, and the like.","Accordingly, in , a User Interface\/API layer  is accessible via the Internet to authenticated users, including both external Advertisers  and internal Administrators . Accessibility to pages and features of the User Interface  can be determined by the type of user. The User Interface  can be used to add new data to the Advertisement Database  or display and edit existing data from the Advertisement Database . The User Interface  also can be used to display information from a Reporting Database .","An API layer  can be provided as a representation of a means for system components to talk to one or more Listing Engines  and can be used to present a uniform interface across the Listing Engines  for a Scheduler  and Report Fetcher . In an exemplary embodiment, the API layer  can include the Report Fetcher  module for fetching reports from the Listing Engines , and a module for pushing listing changes in the Advertisement Database  to the listing engines .","In an exemplary embodiment, the Report Fetcher  can be configured to run infrequently, for example, pulling summarized reports from the Listing Engines  once per day, once per week, and the like. The report data can be rolled up as needed and inserted into the Reporting Database . In an exemplary embodiment, the Listing Engines  can be periodically queried to obtain accurate click counts, costs, and the like. Although clicks could be counted and click costs could be tallied internally, such numbers may not be accurate since it would not be known whether a listing engine considered any given click to be fraudulent, and it would not be known with certainty the CPC for any given click due to data propagation delays, and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the push portion, for example, can be run as a separate process, and the like, and can receive update information from the Scheduler  and the Advertisement Database . The Advertisement Database  can be configured to store data that defines the listings and to communicate update data to the API push layer . In a further exemplary embodiment, updates can go from the Scheduler  through the API layer  to the Listing Engines .","The Reporting Database  can be on the same physical database as or a separate database from the Advertisement Database . A Listing Engine Database  can be configured to store information for the Listing Engine . Some of the data employed for reporting (e.g., advertisement traffic source, etc.) can be made easily available from the Listing Engine Database , and may otherwise be difficult to obtain. In an exemplary embodiment, the Listing Engines  can be configured to store information for the Scheduler , the Report Fetcher , the Log Processor, and the like.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Scheduler  can be configured to be responsible for scheduling insertion, modification, and removal of listings on the Listing Engines  (e.g., via the API layer ) as data is inserted and modified via the User Interface  or when the Scheduler  determines that a listing change is needed. The Scheduler  can be further configured to be responsible for periodically revising the CPC of listings based on click, conversion information, and the like. Such a period can be flexible and can be based on time intervals, click counts, conversion counts, combinations thereof, and the like. The CPC can be determined with any suitable number of granularities, including on a global basis, on per listing engine basis, on a per advertisement traffic source basis, on a per day of week basis, on a per hour basis, on a per geographical region basis, and the like. The Scheduler  can be further configured to be responsible for dropping underperforming listings based on some predetermined criteria, and the like, wherein the listings can be reinstated as more click data, conversion data, and the like, becomes available.","In an exemplary embodiment, a Trial component  can be included as a specialized component of the Scheduler , and can be responsible for determining acquisition rates for added listings, and the like. The Trial component , for example, can send listings to a CPC-based listing company (e.g., Enhance Interactive, Overture, GoClick, Google, etc.) at a fixed CPC. The listing then can be run for a predetermined length of time, and the conversion rate seen during such a period can be used to calculate the initial CPC for all of the Listing Engines . In an exemplary embodiment, the Trial component  can use the Listing Engine Database  to acquire specialized information, such as traffic quality measurements, and the like, for conversion rate tracking.","In an exemplary embodiment, a Click Server  can be configured to handle clicks made by an End User  clicking on listing results. The Click Server  can extract and log the listing ID and other information, which can be encrypted and placed in a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), can give a browser of the End User  a cookie that can be used to identify the click for matching with subsequent conversions, and can redirect to the URL of the listing (e.g., an Advertiser Site ). Accordingly, when the End User  clicks on a listing result, the Click Server  passes the corresponding click information to the Log Processor .","In an exemplary embodiment, a Conversion\/Pixel Server  can be configured to handle conversion-related requests that allow tracking of conversions, and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the Advertiser  can include a conversion completion page at the Advertiser Site  that can include a mechanism in the HTML to cause the browser of the End User  to make a request for a tracking pixel, and the like, to the Conversion Server . The Conversion Server  then can take the cookie set by the Click Server  and extract information from the request URL, which identifies the listing, and log such information to the Log Processor . In an exemplary embodiment, a conversion can match zero or more clicks, and a click can match zero or more conversions, depending on the tracking format employed.","In an exemplary embodiment, a Back Channel  can be configured as an alternative to the Conversion Server  for tracking conversions. For example, instead of tracking conversions via a browser request, the Advertiser Site  through the Back Channel  (e.g., over HTTP, etc.) can contact the Log Processor  and send the corresponding information for logging and identifying the end user .","In an exemplary embodiment, the Log Processor  can be configured to periodically contact the Click Server , the Conversion Server , and the Back Channel  to retrieve the corresponding click and conversion logs, and write such data to the Reporting Database . The Log Processor  also can be configured to queue listings for the Scheduler  to check on after a predetermined number of clicks or conversions have been logged, handle accounting and budget caps, and the like. Advantageously, the Log Processor  decouples the Click Server , the Conversion Server , and the Back Channel  from the Reporting Database  and the Advertisement Database . The Log Processor  also provides security since the Click Server  and the Conversion Server  need not employ database passwords, provides fault tolerance by allowing the Click Server  and the Conversion Server  to operate while the Reporting Database  and\/or the Advertisement Database  are down, and provides efficiency by consolidating data into large transactions.","In an exemplary embodiment, a Billing component  can be configured as a separate process that handles settling account charges with a Billing Database , based on data in the Reporting Database . The Billing component  can be configured to run on a daily basis, weekly basis, and the like. The Billing component  also can be configured to include code that can be used by the Log Processor  to perform local authorizations, and the like, as needed.","In an exemplary embodiment, the End User  is a person, entity, system, program, and the like, interacting with the exemplary system  (e.g., via a browser, API, etc.). The sequence of events triggered by the End User  include the End User  performing a search that returns data from one or more listings placed with one or more of the Listing Engines . When the End User  clicks on a listing placed by the exemplary performance-based online advertising system , the browser of the End User  fetches a URL from the Click Server , and the Click Server logs the click and redirects to the browser of the End User , after zero or more redirects, to the URL of the listing (e.g., the Advertiser Site ).","At some later time, the End User  completes a conversion. The conversion completion page can include some code, tag, and the like, to cause the browser of the End User  to make a request, for example, for a tracking pixel, and the like, to the Conversion Server . The Conversion Server  then checks the request for the cookie set by the Click Server , and extracts information from the request URL, which identifies the Advertiser , the listing, and the like, and logs such information to the Log Processor . In an exemplary embodiment, the conversion can be matched to a previous click either by the Conversion Server  or by subsequent processing. A conversion can match zero or one click, and a click can match zero, one or more conversions.","In the exemplary performance-based online advertising system embodiments, in many cases, components are drawn as single machines, modules, or components, but in practice can be run on several single machines, modules, or components at once. For scalability, reliability, and redundancy, any one of the logical components of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system embodiments can be implemented by one or more physical components, e.g., multiple scheduler and log processor machines running either in parallel or in reserve as hot or cold backups, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s).","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can be configured to pick keywords for the advertiser. For example, an advertiser can purchase an advertisement, including a clickurl, title, description, etc., but without a need to associate any keyword to the advertisement. The system then can automatically select relevant keyword(s) for the advertisement, for example, based on performance metrics seen in the past, such as query rates, clickthrough rates, conversion rates, and the like, and perform advertising based on the selected keyword(s). In a further exemplary embodiment, the system can perform translation (e.g., AccuMatch, etc.) on the keyword(s) picked by the advertiser, and place listings on based on additional keywords determined based on the translation.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can be configured to automatically perform listing in Paid Inclusion (PI) engines, for example, after determining conversion rates, as Paid Inclusion (PI) engines tend to be flat rated. Advantageously, such an exemplary system can generate a relatively good ROI, assuming accurately determined expected clickthrough rates.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system can be configured as a marketing solution, wherein an advertiser can pick site(s) to advertise or a list of URLs, and the system can go behind the scenes and automatically set up a whole package of listings (e.g., for PPC and PI listing engines), including choosing keyword(s), advertisement topic(s), and the like, based on content, editorial review, and the like.","The exemplary embodiments, advantageously, can include an internal sign-up process and listings management, simple conversion tracking by keyword, Enhance Interactive network support, simple targeting (CPC, keyword), external sign-up process and listings management, Showbox showcase site, Overture network support, agency API, keyword suggestion support, advanced budgeting tools, Google network support, keyword matching rules, advanced tracking (daypart, days of week, local), targeted conversion rate targeting, advanced targeting (daypart, days of week, local), professional services tracking, conversion rate tracking on third party API, extended networks support (FWHT, LOOK), professional services targeting, account management (internal), budgeting (internal), conversion rate by CPC (targeting), conversion rate by CPC (tracking), conversion rate by keyword (targeting), conversion rate by keyword (tracking), conversion rate by advertisement traffic source (targeting), conversion rate by advertisement traffic source (tracking), conversion tracking (single product support), conversion tracking BrochureWare, CTR (tracking), CTR by CPC (targeting), CTR by CPC (tracking), customer reports (external), listings manager (internal), management reports (internal), rank (tracking), credit card\/billing processing, account management (external), automatic deposit calculator, automatic e-mail system, budgeting (external), conversion tracking (multi-product\/multi-customer, conversion tracking (type support), conversion tracking wizard (external), external Brochureware, gambling\/adult flagging, geotargeting (tracking), keyword suggestion tool, conversion rate by rank (tracking), CTR by rank (tracking), dayparting (tracking), days of the week (tracking), geotargeting (targeting), keyword matching and filtering support, local target (tracking), targeted conversion rate targeting, ad copy type analysis, automatic price setting by industry, automatic price setting by keyword, banner advertising support, conversion rate by rank (targeting), conversion tracking (third party API), conversion tracking (type targeting), CTR by rank (targeting), dayparting (targeting), days of the week (targeting), geotargeting wizard (external), landing page type analysis, local target (targeting), targeted conversion rate targeting (advanced), ad copy type analysis and targeting, contextual ad placement, local wizard (external), and the like.","The above-described devices and subsystems of the exemplary performance-based online advertising system embodiments can include, for example, any suitable servers, workstations, Personal Computers (PCs), laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Internet appliances, handheld devices, television browsers, cellular telephones, wireless devices, other devices, etc., capable of performing the processes of the exemplary embodiments.
