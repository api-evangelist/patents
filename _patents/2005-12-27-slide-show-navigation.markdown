{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention claims priority from the following provisional patent application, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference:\n\n","The present invention is related to the following pending utility patent applications, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference:\n\n","The present invention relates generally to displaying images within the context of an application such as an email application, and more particularly to improved techniques for navigating within a series of images such as a slide show.","Conventionally, there is no convenient way to browse and view a series of image attachments received via email without leaving that email application. Images can appear inline in the body of the email, but browsing through a series of image attachments is restricted to vertically scrolling the body of the email. The presentation size of these image attachments is also restricted to the size of the email application view window, which is typically small. Existing software applications that allow a user to browse and view images, are not generally integrated into email applications. Additionally, a user may have to download and import the images into such software applications in order to view them, but this takes time and is often not desired when the user just wants to quickly see the images in a received email message.","In addition, it is often difficult to navigate within a series of images such as within a slide show. An image may be shown, with arrows for moving forwards and backwards. Such a display does not facilitate instantaneous movement from one image to a second image that is not adjacent to the first. Such a display also fails to provide the user with a sense of the context of the current image within the overall slide show or set of images. There is no easy and convenient way to switch between the full-sized view and a view that reveals context.","Image navigation systems and software often provide a series of thumbnails, allowing the user to click on a thumbnail to see a full-sized version of the corresponding image. However, these schemes still provide no easy way to easily switch between a full-sized view and a view that provides context showing where the image fits within the overall slide show.","The present invention provides an improved mechanism for navigating within a series of images such as a slide show.","According to one aspect of the present invention, image attachments can be easily viewed without leaving an email application.","According to one aspect of the present invention, images are presented in a manner that provides for easy switching between full-sized and thumbnail view, and that preserves a sense of context so that the user knows where the image fits within the overall slide show. The user can easily switch between modes, and can easily move to any image within the slide show or image series.","According to one aspect of the present invention, the invention provides a full-screen slide show environment, with easy access to instantaneous navigation controls and thumbnails, all accessible directly within an email application.","One skilled in the art will recognize that these Figures are merely examples of the operation of the invention according to one embodiment, and that other user interface arrangements and modes of operation can be used without departing from the essential characteristics of the invention.","The present invention is now described more fully with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which several embodiments of the invention are shown. The present invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be complete and will fully convey the invention to those skilled in the art.","For illustrative purposes, the invention is described in connection with presenting images in an email application for an operating system such as MacOS X from Apple Computer, Inc. Various specific details are set forth herein and in the Figures, to aid in understanding the present invention. However, such specific details are intended to be illustrative, and are not intended to restrict in any way the scope of the present invention. In particular, one skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be used for navigating among images and\/or other non-image elements within any type of software application. In addition, one skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be used in connection with any input mechanism for selecting, manipulating, and moving on-screen images, including manipulation of an on-screen cursor using a pointing device, keyboard control, voice control, mouse wheel, touch screen control, or the like, or any combination of the above. In addition, the particular screen layouts, appearance, and terminology as depicted and described herein, are intended to be illustrative and exemplary, and in no way limit the scope of the invention.","In one embodiment, the present invention is implemented in a conventional personal computer system, such as a Macintosh, (available from Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.), running an operating system such as MacOS X (also available from Apple Computer, Inc.). The invention may be embodied in software that runs on the personal computer. The invention may be included as add-on software, or it may form part of the operating system itself, or it may be a feature of an application that is bundled with the computer system or sold separately. The various features of the invention as described herein include output presented on a display screen that is connected to the personal computer. In addition, the invention makes use of input provided to the computer system via input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or the like. Such hardware components, including their operation and interactions with one another and with a central processing unit of the personal computer, are well known in the art of computer systems and therefore are not depicted here. Several Figures are presented as screen shots depicting examples of the user interface as it might appear on a display screen or other output device. In addition, the techniques described herein can be implemented in other types of devices, including cell phones, personal digital assistants, television displays, kiosks, or the like.","User Experience","In one embodiment, the invention operates as follows:","Referring now to , there is shown a screen shot depicting an example of an email client application displaying a message . The user receives email message  that includes one or more image attachments . Slide show button  appears in header region  of message . In one embodiment, button  is only presented if message  contains images. In other embodiments, other mechanisms for activating a slide show may be provided, including keyboard commands, menu items, or the like.","The user can click on button  to initiate a slide show. The computer screen fades to black and then fades into a full screen view of the first image attachment. Referring now to , there is shown a screen shot depicting an example of an image  being displayed in a slide show, according to one embodiment of the present invention.","After a period (for example 3 seconds), the first image  fades into the next image attachment in the sequence, and so on until all the images have been viewed. Then, in one embodiment, the slide show repeats.","In an alternative embodiment, the slide show is presented within a window rather than occupying the entire screen. In another alternative embodiment, the slide show is presented in semi-transparent form overlaying the normal desktop display. In one embodiment, any or all of the characteristics of the slide show are configurable by the user (for example, whether it repeats, the size of the presentation, delay between one slide and the next, and the like).","Semi-transparent toolbar cluster  (or dock) appears at the bottom of the screen. It contains a series of buttons that allow the user to interact with the slide show. From left to right they are:\n\n","The Index Sheet button provides quick access to a screen depicting thumbnails. This may be overlaid on the existing desktop, as an opaque screen or a semi-transparent one. In one embodiment, the index sheet can be activated by moving the cursor to a predefined corner of the screen. The index sheet allows a user to easily see the context of the current image within the slide show, and also allows the user to quickly jump to any other image in the slide show.","Referring now to , there is shown a screen shot depicting an example of an index sheet , according to one embodiment of the present invention.","When the user presses the Index Sheet button in cluster  (or otherwise activates the index sheet), the current image  animates and scales smaller. At the same time all the other images in the slideshow also animate and scale smaller behind the current image. As the images scale smaller, they align along a position in a grid that reflects the order of the slideshow presentation, as shown in . The first image appears as a thumbnail A in the upper left, the next image appears as a thumbnail B to the right of the first image, and so on. The spread-out view of all the image thumbnails A through J forms index sheet ; it is organized in a rectangular grid akin to a photographic contact sheet that shows a number of images on a single page. In one embodiment, all images are scaled to the same size, or to approximately the same size except for deviations resulting from different aspect ratios. In one embodiment, the size of the thumbnails  is selected according to the number of images and the size of the available viewable area. In one embodiment, if there are too many images to show all thumbnails  within the viewable area, a scrolling arrangement or other arrangement for viewing subsets of the thumbnails  is used. In one embodiment, the size is specified by a user.","In one embodiment, thumbnails  are arranged according to the image sequence within the slide show. In one embodiment, the presentation is according to filename (alphabetically), or chronological order by date modified or date created, or size, or some other ordering mechanism. In one embodiment, the user can dynamically select the order.","The user can roll over any thumbnail  (in other words, cause the on-screen cursor to hover over the image) to reveal its title  and\/or to see other information about the image. In one embodiment, such information is shown in a semi-transparent manner superimposed on thumbnail  itself, as shown in the example of . In other embodiments, any other technique for displaying such information can be used. Any type of information can be displayed, including for example title, size, date created, date modified, or the like.","Clicking on a thumbnail  advances the slide show to that image and exits Index Sheet mode; the selected image animates and scales to full screen size while all the other images appear to scale to full screen size behind the selected image. Alternatively, the non-selected images may shrink until they are invisible, or they may fade to invisibility, or simply disappear as the selected image expands to fill the screen. Alternatively, they may simply appear to move behind the selected image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["301","201","302","302","201","302","302","201"]},"One skilled in the art will recognize that any other transition effect (or no transition effect) can be implemented without deviating from the essential characteristics of the present invention.","Add to iPhoto","At any point in the slide show presentation, the user can press the Add to iPhoto button to automatically add the currently viewed image to a photo management application (such as iPhoto, available from Apple Computer of Cupertino, Calif.) without exiting the slide show presentation. In one embodiment, the software displays an animation showing the currently viewed image being sucked into the Add to iPhoto button. This feature allows a user to browse a large series of images, and to easily choose which images he or she would like to import and keep for future use.","The present invention provides a slide show that is accessible from and works within an email application. As such, it does not require the user to leave the email environment in order to view their image attachments in an effective, versatile, full-screen, and pleasant way. In other embodiments, the features described above are provided within other types of applications, such as a file management application, presentation software, word processing software, or the like.","Architecture","In one embodiment, the above-described functionality is implemented as a standalone framework, so that any application or client can generate a user experience such as that described above. The present invention can be implemented in connection with images, PDF documents, text documents, or any other items or elements that can be presented visually.","In one embodiment, the invention is implemented as an application programming interface (API) in objC and\/or C, using a known technology such as ImageIO to load images of multiple formats. Image formats include, for example, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, or the like. Image inputs can be provided in any of a number of forms that either contain or point to images. Examples include file paths, URLs, NSFileWrappers, NSImages, CGImageRefs, or the like.","In one embodiment, the invention includes a dynamically created user interface that adapts to environmental conditions and\/or client feature sets. For example, in one embodiment, an Add to iPhoto button may be made available only if 1) the client application includes functionality for exporting images to iPhoto (i.e., if such an operation makes sense given the nature of the application), and 2) the iPhoto application is installed; otherwise, the Add to iPhoto button is not shown. In other environments or clients, the user interface may include other elements that are appropriate to those environments. For example, when the slide show of the present invention is being used in connection with an image viewer or search function, an Add to Mail button can be provided within the button cluster; when activated, this button would launch an email application and create a new email message with the selected image(s) attached. One skilled in the art will recognize that in other contexts, other buttons and operations would be applicable.","In one embodiment, the present invention displays various types of transitions. For example, when switching from one image to the next (in play mode, or in response to a user command), a distinctive transition may be shown; similarly, when switching from full-sized image mode to thumbnail mode, another transition may be shown. In one embodiment, these transitions are user-configurable. In one embodiment, they are implemented using a known video animation technology, assuming that the hardware video card supports such technology. In one embodiment, multiple transitions are available and can be applied in any combination.","In one embodiment, a particular type of transition and visual effect is used when switching from full-sized image mode to thumbnail mode and vice versa. An affine transform (translate\/scale) is applied to position each image during the index transform and in index sheet mode. In one embodiment, the thumbnail display is presented in a semi-transparent window so that underlying elements (such as the desktop or the full-sized image that was being displayed) are visible through the thumbnail display. One skilled in the art will recognize that such visual enhancements are optional, and that the present invention can be implemented using many different types of visual techniques.","In one embodiment, the Add to iPhoto function is performed using AppleScript. The system of the invention keeps track of the images that a user wants to add to iPhoto. Upon quitting or closing the slide show, iPhoto is automatically launched, and the selected images are added to iPhoto under the direction of an AppleScript script.","Referring now to , there is shown a block diagram depicting an example of a software architecture for implementing the present invention according to one embodiment. Slideshow framework  is software code that implements the invention. Any client application can call upon and interface with framework ; examples of such applications include an email application , search application (such as Apple's Spotlight) , viewer application (such as Apple's Preview) , or file management component of an operating system (such as Apple's Finder) .","Also shown is an example of code  that can be used by the calling application to invoke the slide show feature. Also shown is an example of code  in framework  for interfacing with the calling application.","Examples of header files for use in connection with an implementation of the present invention is as

It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without these specific details. For example, the present invention can be applied in any type of application, and for displaying any type of data, including image and non-image files. The particular layouts and user interface elements described herein and illustrated in the Figures are examples only.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Some portions of the detailed description are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.","The algorithms and modules presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatuses to perform the method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Furthermore, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art, the modules, features, attributes, methodologies, and other aspects of the invention can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination of the three. Of course, wherever a component of the present invention is implemented as software, the component can be implemented as a standalone program, as part of a larger program, as a plurality of separate programs, as a statically or dynamically linked library, as a kernel loadable module, as a device driver, and\/or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of skill in the art of computer programming. Additionally, the present invention is in no way limited to implementation in any specific operating system or environment.","It will be understood by those skilled in the relevant art that the above-described implementations are merely exemplary, and many changes can be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, it is intended to cover all such changes and modifications that come within the true spirit and scope of this invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings illustrate several embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
