In addition, nitric oxide-derived species display separate and unique pharmacological properties, specifically can mediate oxidation and nitration of biomolecules such as, for example, unsaturated fatty acids.","Various reactions yield products capable of concerted oxidation, nitrosation and nitration of target molecules. For example, nitric oxide may react with superoxide (O) to yield peroxynitrite (ONOO) and its conjugate acid, peroxynitritrous acid (ONOOH), the latter of which may undergo homolytic scission to form nitrogen dioxide (.NO) and hydroxyl radical (.OH). In some instances, biological conditions may favor the reaction of ONOO with COwhich yields nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO), which rapidly yields .NOand carbonate (CO) radicals via homolysis or rearrangement to NO and CO. During inflammation, neutrophil myeloperoxidase and heme proteins such as myoglobin and cytochrome c catalyze HO-dependent oxidation of nitrite (NO) to .NOresulting in biomolecule oxidation and nitration that is influenced by the spatial distribution of catalytic heme proteins. The reaction of .NO with Ocan also produce products that can be substrates or reactants for nitrosation and nitration. For example, the small molecular radius, uncharged nature and lipophilicity of .NO and Ofacilitate concentration of these species in biological membranes in a process referred to as the \u201cmolecular lens\u201d effect. The increase in concentration induced by .NO and Osolvation in hydrophobic cell compartments accelerates the normally slow reaction of .NO with Oto yield NOand NO. Finally, environmental sources also yield .NOas a product of photochemical air pollution and tobacco smoke.","Nitration of fatty acids by .NOcan occur through several methods. For example, during both basal cell signaling and tissue inflammatory conditions, .NOcan react with membrane and lipoprotein lipids. In both in vivo and in vitro systems, .NOhas been shown to initiate radical chain auto-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids via hydrogen abstraction from the bis-allylic carbon to form nitrous acid and a resonance-stabilized bis-allylic radical. Depending on the radical environment, the lipid radical species can react with molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical, which can react further to form lipid hydroperoxides then oxidized lipids. During inflammation or ischemia, when Olevels are lower, lipid radicals can react to an even greater extent with .NOto generate multiple nitration products including singly nitrated, nitrohydroxy- and dinitro-fatty acid adducts. These products can be generated via hydrogen abstraction, direct addition of .NOacross the double bond, or both, and in some cases, such reactions may be followed by further reactions of the intermediate products that are formed. Hydrogen abstraction causes a rearrangement of the double bonds to form a conjugated diene; however, the addition of .NOmaintains a methylene-interrupted diene configuration to yield singly nitrated polyunsaturated fatty acids.","The reaction of polyunsaturated fatty acids with acidified nitrite (HNO) can generate a complex mixture of products similar to those formed by direct reaction with .NO, including the formation of singly nitrated products that maintain the bis-allylic bond arrangement. The acidification of NO can create a labile species, HNO, which is in equilibrium with secondary products, including NO, .NO and .NO, all of which can participate in nitration reactions. The relevance of this pathway as a mechanism of fatty acid nitration is exemplified by physiological and pathological conditions wherein NO is exposed to low pH (e.g., <pH 4.0). This may conceivably occur in the gastric compartment, following endosomal or phagolysosomal acidification or in tissues following-post ischemic reperfusion.","Nitrated linoleic acid (LNO) has been shown to display robust cell signaling activities that are generally anti-inflammatory in nature. Synthetic LNOcan inhibit human platelet function via cAMP-dependent mechanisms and inhibits neutrophil O generation, calcium influx, elastase release, CD11b expression and degranulation via non-cAMP, non-cGMP-dependent mechanisms. LNOmay also induce vessel relaxation in part via cGMP-dependent mechanisms. In aggregate, these data, derived from a synthetic fatty acid infer that nitro derivatives of fatty acids (NO-FA) represent a novel class of lipid-derived signaling mediators. To date, a gap in the clinical detection and structural characterization of nitrated fatty acids has limited defining NO-FA derivatives as biologically-relevant lipid signaling mediators that converge .NO and oxygenated lipid signaling pathways.","Embodiments of the invention presented herein are directed to nutritional or dietary supplements, topical formulations, such as salves and lotions, and other nutraceutical compositions that include one or more activated fatty acids such as for example, nitro fatty acids.","In some embodiments, the nutraceutical supplements and topical formulations may include one or more nutraceutical other than nitro fatty acids such as one or more vitamins, one or more minerals, plant extracts or oils, rice bran oil, enzyme-treated stabilized rice bran, a solubilized fraction of rice bran oil, and derivatives thereof, glucosamine derivatives, methylsulfonylmethane, yucca concentrate, grape seed extract, beta-carotene, ephedra, ginko biloba, goldenseal, valerian, ginseng, green tea extract, and echinacea.

Similarly, other polyunsaturated fatty acids, with 3, 4, 5, 6 or more double bonds, can have one electron withdrawing at either position on any of the double bond carbons, including all possible permutations of positions and electron-withdrawing groups.","In other embodiments, a mono or polyunsaturated fatty acid may have two electron-withdrawing groups, and there are several ways that an unsaturated fatty acid can have two electron-withdrawing groups. For example, in one embodiment, an activated oleic acid (ocatadecac-9-enoic acid) which is an 18 carbon, \u03c9-6 fatty acid with one double bond (denoted \u201c18:1\u201d) between the 6(C-13) and 7(C-12) carbons, may have an electron withdrawing group at both C-13 and C-12. In another exemplary embodiment, an activated linoleic acid (octadeac-9,12-dienoic acid), which is an 18 carbon, \u03c9-6 fatty acid with two double bonds (denoted \u201c18:2\u201d) between the 6(C-13) and 7(C-12) carbons and the 9(C-10) and 10(C-9) carbons, may have an electron withdrawing group at any two of the positions C-9, C-10, C-12 or C-13, with the following possible permutations: C-9 and C-10, C-9 and C-12, C-9 and C-13. C-10 and C-12, C-10 and C-13, or C-12 and C-13. Similarly, other polyunsaturated fatty acids, with shorter or longer carbon chain lengths and 3, 4, 5, 6 or more double bonds, can have two electron withdrawing at two of the positions on any of the double bond carbons, including all possible permutations of positions and electron-withdrawing groups.","In analogy to the preceding descriptions of compounds with one electron-withdrawing group or two electron-withdrawing groups, it is also possible to have three, four, five or more electron withdrawing groups. Following the same logic above, in the preceding descriptions of compounds with one electron-withdrawing group or two electron-withdrawing groups, polyunsaturated fatty acids, with 3, 4, 5, 6 or more double bonds, can have multiple electron withdrawing (three, four, five or more, as available positions for substitution permit) at any of the positions on any of the double bond carbons, including all possible permutations of positions and electron-withdrawing groups.","The term \u201celectron-withdrawing group\u201d is recognized in the art and denotes the tendency of a substituent to attract valence electrons from neighboring atoms, i.e., the substituent is electronegative with respect to neighboring atoms. A quantification of the level of electron-withdrawing capability is given by the Hammett sigma (\u03c3) constant (see, e.g., J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, (1977 edition) pp. 251-259). The Hammett constant values are generally negative for electron donating groups and positive for electron withdrawing groups. For example the Hammett constant for para substituted NH(\u03c3[P]) is about \u22120.7 and the \u03c3[P] for a nitro group is about 0.8.","Embodiments of the invention encompass any known electron withdrawing group. For example, electron-withdrawing groups may include, but are not limited to, aldehyde (\u2014COH), acyl (\u2014COR), carbonyl (\u2014CO), carboxylic acid (\u2014COOH), ester (\u2014COOR), halides (\u2014Cl, \u2014F, \u2014Br, etc.), fluoromethyl (\u2014CF), cyano (\u2014CN), sulfonyl sulfone (\u2014SOR), sulfonic acid (\u2014SOH), 1\u00b0, 2\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 ammonium (\u2014NR), and nitro (\u2014NO). In some embodiments, the electron withdrawing group may be a strong electron withdrawing group having a \u03c3 of at least about 0.2, and in certain embodiments, the electron withdrawing group may form a dipole. For example, in particular embodiments, the electron withdrawing group may be a nitro, ammonium or sulfonyl. In other embodiments, the activated fatty acids of the invention may be additionally substituted by non-electron withdrawing groups or electron donating groups including, for example, alcohol (\u2014OH), reverse ester (\u2014OOCR), alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 amines (\u2014NR), nitrate (\u2014ONO), nitrito (\u2014ONO) and the like.","The fatty acids of embodiments may be any unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid known in the art. The term \u201cfatty acid\u201d describes aliphatic monocarboxylic acids. Various embodiments include nitrated fatty acid having an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain identical or similar to identified, naturally occurring fatty acids. For example, aliphatic hydrocarbon chains of known naturally occurring fatty acids are generally unbranched and contain an even number of from about 4 to about 24 carbons. Embodiments of the invention may encompass fatty acids having an odd number of carbons and\/or a non-naturally occurring linker. Some embodiments of the invention include fatty acids having from 4 to 22 carbons, and others include fatty acids having from 12 to 18 carbons in the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. In still other embodiments, fatty acids may have greater than 24 carbons in the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. The fatty acids of the invention may also be branched at one or more location along the hydrocarbon chain, and in various embodiments, each branch may include an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain of from 1 to 24 carbons, 2 to 20 carbons or 4 to 18 carbons.","The aliphatic hydrocarbon chain of fatty acids of various embodiments may be unsaturated or polyunsaturated. The term \u201cunsaturated\u201d refers to a fatty acid having a aliphatic hydrocarbon chain that includes at least one double bond and\/or substituent. In contrast, a \u201csaturated\u201d hydrocarbon chain does not include any double bonds or substituents. Thus, each carbon of the hydrocarbon chain is \u2018saturated\u2019 and has the maximum number of hydrogens. \u201cPolyunsaturated,\u201d generally, refers to fatty acids having hydrocarbon chains with more than one double bond. The double bonds of the unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids of various embodiments may be at any location along the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and may be in either cis or trans configuration. The term \u201ccis,\u201d refers to a double bond in which carbons adjacent to the double bond are on the same side and the term \u201ctrans\u201d refers to a double bond in which carbons adjacent to the double bond are on opposite sides. Typically \u201ccis\u201d is the same as Z and \u201ctrans\u201d is the same as E but sometimes the IUPAC rules for naming compounds will give the opposite of this, which is the typical case in nitroalkenes. For example, a nitroalkene can have the two carbon groups \u201ccis\u201d but the two groups that take priority for the naming of compounds (a nitro group on one carbon of the alkene and a carbon group on the other carbon of the alkene) are on opposite sides and thus are E. Therefore the nitroalkene analog of a \u201ccis\u201d double bond is actually an E nitroalkene. Similarly, the nitroalkene analog of a \u201ctrans\u201d double bond is actually a Z nitroalkene. Without wishing to be bound by theory, double bonds in cis configuration along the carbon chain (cis carbon chain but E nitroalkene) may induce a bend in the hydrocarbon chain. Double bonds in \u201ctrans,\u201d configuration along the carbon chain (trans carbon chain but Z nitroalkene) may not cause the hydrocarbon chain to bend.","Many unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been identified and are known to be naturally occurring. Such unsaturated or polyunsaturated naturally occurring fatty acids, generally, include an even number of carbons in their aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. For example, a naturally occurring unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acid may have, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and so on carbons and may include omega(\u03c9))-3, \u03c9-5, \u03c9-6, \u03c9-7, \u03c9-9 fatty acids and the like. Any such fatty acid may be useful in embodiments of the invention. The symbol \u2018\u03c9\u2019 is used to refer to the terminal methyl carbon of the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. The placement of the double bond of the co-X fatty acid is the carbon-carbon bond X number of carbons from the \u03c9 carbon. For example, an \u03c9-6 fatty acid has a double bond between the 6and 7carbons counting backward from the \u03c9 carbon and an \u03c9-3 fatty acid has a double bond between the 3and 4carbons counting backward from the \u03c9 carbon. Various embodiments of the invention include nitrated \u03c9-3 fatty acids, including, but not limited to, linolenic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentanoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, docosahexanoic acid and stearidonic acid; nitrated \u03c9-5 fatty acids including, but not limited to, myristoleic acid; nitrated \u03c9-6 fatty acids including, but not limited to, linoleic acid, gamma-linoleic acid, dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid and arachidonic acid; nitrated \u03c9-7 fatty acids including, but not limited to, palmitoleic acid; and nitrated \u03c9-9 fatty acids including, but not limited to, oleic acid and erucic acid. Of course, the fatty acids of the invention may also be referred to using IUPAC nomenclature in which the placement of the double bond is determined by counting from the carbon of the carboxylic acid, and \u2018C-X\u2019 denotes the carbon in aliphatic hydrocarbons using IUPAC nomenclature wherein X is the number of the carbon counting from the carboxylic acid. Embodiments of the invention also include synthetic equivalents to naturally occurring fatty acids and derivatives thereof.","In particular embodiments, the fatty acids utilized in embodiments of the invention may be omega-3 fatty acids. As used herein, the term \u201comega-3 fatty acids\u201d or \u201c\u03c9-3 fatty acids\u201d may include natural or synthetic omega-3 fatty acids, or pharmaceutically acceptable esters, derivatives, conjugates (see, e.g., U.S. Publication No. 2004\/0254357 to Zaloga et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,245,811 to Horrobin et al., each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), precursors or salts thereof and mixtures thereof. Examples of \u03c9-3 fatty acid oils include but are not limited to \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated, long-chain fatty acids such as a eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and \u03b1-linolenic acid; esters of \u03c9-3 fatty acids with glycerol such as mono-, di- and triglycerides; and esters of the \u03c9-3 fatty acids and a primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol such as fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters. In certain embodiments, the \u03c9-3 fatty acid oils may be long-chain fatty acids such as EPA or DHA, triglycerides thereof, ethyl esters thereof and mixtures thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the fatty acids may be esterified to more complex glycerolipids such as phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, or the like. The \u03c9-3 fatty acids or their esters, derivatives, conjugates, precursors, salts and mixtures thereof can be used either in their pure form or as a component of an oil, such as fish oil or plant oil, preferably purified fish oil or plant oil concentrates.","Various fish oils are known and useful as sources for \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, and \u03c9-9 fatty acids, and any such oil may be used in embodiments of the invention. For example, oils derived from herring, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, flounder, albacore tuna, krill, and salmon are useful sources of \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, and \u03c9-9 fatty acids. In other embodiments, commercially available \u03c9-3 fatty acids suitable for use in the invention may include, but are not limited to, Incromega F2250.

In certain embodiments, the \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, and \u03c9-9 fatty acids may be a mixture of several \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, and \u03c9-9 fatty acids such as OMACOR\u2122 omega-3 fatty acids which are combinations of EPA and DHA \u03c9-3 fatty acids, and are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,502,077, 5,656,667 and 5,698,594, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Similarly various plant oils are known and useful as sources for \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, and \u03c9-9 fatty acids, and any such oil may be used in embodiments of the invention. For example, olive oil, peanut oil, grape seed oil, sea buckthorn oil, sesame oil, and f poppyseed oil are useful sources of \u03c9-3, \u03c9-6, and \u03c9-9 fatty acids, and in particular \u03c9-9 fatty acids, such as, oleic acid. http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oleic_acid-cite_note-pmid17093176-2#cite_note-pmic117093176-2","Other embodiments of the invention include unsaturated or polyunsaturated non-naturally occurring fatty acids which may have an odd number of carbons such as, for example, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21 and so on. As in naturally occurring fatty acids, the one or more double bonds associated with non-naturally occurring fatty acids may be at any position along the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain, and the double bonds may be in either cis or trans configuration. In yet other embodiments, the non-naturally occurring fatty acids may include one or more linker groups which interrupt the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain.

All of the above salts can be prepared by those skilled in the art by conventional means from the corresponding compound of the present invention.","Activated fatty acids as described in various embodiments of the invention above, may be administered to individuals to treat, ameliorate and\/or prevent a number both acute and chronic inflammatory and metabolic conditions. In particular embodiments, activated fatty acids may be used to treat acute conditions including general inflammation, arterial stenosis, organ transplant rejection and burns, and chronic conditions such as, chronic lung injury and respiratory distress, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, neurodegenerative disorders and various skin disorders. However, in other embodiments, activated fatty acids may be used to treat any condition having symptoms including chronic or acute inflammation, such as, for example, arthritis, lupus, Lyme's disease, gout, sepsis, hyperthermia, ulcers, enterocolitis, osteoporosis, viral or bacterial infections, cytomegalovirus, periodontal disease, glomerulonephritis, sarcoidosis, lung disease, lung inflammation, fibrosis of the lung, asthma, acquired respiratory distress syndrome, tobacco induced lung disease, granuloma formation, fibrosis of the liver, graft vs. host disease, postsurgical inflammation, heart diseases, high blood pressure, hypertension, reperfusion syndrome, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), acute and chronic leukemia, B lymphocyte leukemia, neoplastic diseases, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, myocardial inflammation, psoriasis, immunodeficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, encephalomyelitis, edema, inflammatory bowel diseases, hyper IgE syndrome, cancer metastasis or growth, adoptive immune therapy, radiation burns, alopecia and the like.","For example, in one embodiment, an activated fatty acid may be administered to treat hypertension by lowering blood pressure to normal levels without reducing the blood pressure of the individual below normal levels even if the activated fatty acid is over-administered. Thus, without wishing to be bound by theory, the activated fatty acids of the invention may provide treatment of an individual without the negative affects associated with over-administration or over-treatment using traditional medications.","In a still further embodiment, activated fatty acids may be useful for ischemic preconditioning or protecting the heart from ischemic injury due to vessel spasm or blockage. For example, nitrated fatty acids produced by mitochondria in cells under ischemic conditions cause a number of physiological changes within the cell that increases cell survival under ischemic conditions. By providing activated fatty acids to an individual, similar ischemic preconditioning or protection may be achieved allowing for improved survival of for example, cardiac tissue under ischemic conditions or organs being preserved for optimizing viability and function upon transplantation. In particular embodiments, nutraceuticals including activated fatty acids may be provided to individuals at risk of heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, vascular blockage, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, heart valve diseases, cardiomyopathy, and the like to both reduce or alleviate the symptoms of such maladies and to increase the likelihood of survival in the event of, for example, a heart attack, arrhythmia, or artrial fibrillation or to more generally improve heart or circulatory system function.","In addition, activated fatty acid administration may be useful for activating a number of other factors important for cell signaling. For example, in one embodiment, activated fatty acids may be administered to induce gene expression and tissue activity of home oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which has been shown to mediate adaptive and protective responses during inflammation, and activation of an adaptive or protective inflammatory response mediated by HO may be useful in treating inflammatory diseases such as, but not limited to atherosclerosis, acute renal failure, vascular restinosis, transplant rejection, and sepsis. Thus, activated fatty acids may be useful for treating general inflammation resulting from surgery, injury or infection.","The nutraceuticals of the invention can be administered in any conventional manner by any route where they are active. Administration can be systemic or local. For example, administration can be, but is not limited to, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, oral, buccal, ocular, intravaginally, or inhalation. In certain embodiments, the administration may be parenteral. In some embodiments, the nutraceutical may be prepared in the presence or absence of stabilizing additives that favors extended systemic uptake, tissue half-life and intracellular delivery. Thus, modes of administration for the compounds of the present invention (either alone or in combination with other pharmaceuticals) can be injectable (including short-acting, depot, implant and pellet forms injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly). In some embodiments, an injectable formulation including an activated fatty acid may be deposited to a site of injury or inflammation, such as, for example, the site of a surgical incision or a site of inflammation due to arthroscopy, angioplasty, stent placement, by-pass surgery and so on.","In certain other embodiments, the compositions of the invention may be applied locally as a salve or lotion applied directly to an area of inflammation. For example, in some embodiments, a lotion or salve including activated fatty acids of the invention may be prepared and applied to a burn, radiation burn, site of dermal disorder, edema, arthritic joint or the like. Such salves and lotions, may include a topical formulation of one or more activated fatty acid in a dermatologically acceptable vehicle, and in particular embodiments, the topical formulation may as a nutraceutical salve or lotion which may contain for example, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate, collagen glucosamine, keratan sulphate, dermatan sulphate, vitamin C, green tea extract, shea butter, grape-seed extract, aloe extract, or mixtures thereof.","Various embodiments, of the invention are also directed to method for administering activated fatty acids. Specific modes of administration may vary and may depend on the indication. The selection of the specific route of administration and the dose regimen may be adjusted or titrated according to known methods in order to obtain the optimal response. The amount of compound to be administered is that amount which is therapeutically effective. The dosage to be administered will depend on the characteristics of the subject being treated, e.g., the particular animal treated, age, weight, health, types of concurrent treatment, if any, and frequency of treatments, and can be easily determined by one of skill in the art. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages may be determined with guidance, for example, from Goodman & Goldman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Ninth Edition (1996). Appendix II, pp. 1707-1711 or from Goodman & Goldman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Tenth Edition (2001). Appendix II, pp. 475-493 both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. With respect to conventional prenylation enzyme inhibitors, guidance may be obtained from art-recognized dosage amounts as described, for example, by J. E. Karp, et al., Blood, 97(11):3361-3369 (2001) and A. A. Adjei, et al., Cancer Research, 60:1871-1877 (2000) hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In various embodiments, an effective amount of an activated fatty acid delivered during each administration cycle of the nutraceutical may range from about 10 mg\/m\/day to about 1000 mg\/m\/day. In some embodiments, an effective amount may be about 20 mg\/m\/day to about 700 mg\/m\/day, and in others, an effective amount may be about 30 mg\/m\/day to about 600 mg\/m\/day. In particular embodiments, an effective amount may be about 50 mg\/m\/day, about 400 mg\/m\/day, about 500 mg\/m\/day, or about 600 mg\/m\/day. In yet other embodiments, an effective amount of an activated fatty acid may vary as treatment progresses. For example, a dosage regimen may be increased or decreased as treatment proceeds through administration cycles, or the daily dosage may increase or decrease throughout administration. In additional embodiments, greater than 1000 mg\/m\/day may be administered because even high doses of activated fatty acid are generally tolerable to the patient and may not produce undesired physiological effects.","In some embodiments, activated fatty acids administered may include up at least 5% by weight, at least 10% by weight, at least 20% by weight, at least 30% by weight, at least 40% by weight, at least 50% by weight, at least 60% by weight at least 70% by weight, at least 80% by weight, at least 90% by weight or at least 100% by weight of one or more species of activated fatty acid. In particular embodiments, a single species of activated fatty acid may make up at least 10% by weight, at least 20% by weight, at least 30% by weight, at least 50%, at least 60% by weight, at least 70% by weight, at least 80% by weight of the total activated fatty acid administered, and in other embodiments, a single species of activated fatty acids may make up about 5% to about 100% by weight, about 25% to about 75% by weight, or about 40% to about 55% by weight of the fatty acids administered. In particular embodiments, the ratio of activated fatty acid to non-activated may be from about 99:1 to about 1:99, about 1:4 to about 4:1, about 1:3 to about 3:1 or about 1:2 to about 2:1.","For example, in some embodiments, the activated fatty acids may be prepared from one of EPA or DHA or a combination of EPA and DHA. The composition administered may include about 5% to about 100% by weight, about 25% to about 75% by weight, or about 30% to about 60% by weight activated EPA and\/or activated DHA, and any remainder may be made up of non-activated EPA and\/or MIA. In compositions containing both activated EPA and activated DHA, the activated EPA and activated DHA may be present in a weight ratio of from 99:1 to 1:99, 1:4 to 4:1, 1:3 to 3:1, 1:2 to 2:1, or 1:1. In compositions containing activated EPA and\/or activated DHA as well as non-activated EPA and\/or DHA, the weight ratio of activated:non-activated may be from 99:1 to 1:99, 1:4 to 4:1, 1:3 to 3:1 or 1:2 to 2:1. In the embodiments described above, the percentage by weight may be based on the free acid or ester forms, although it is preferably based on the ethyl ester form of the \u03c9-3 fatty acids even if other forms are utilized in accordance with the present invention.","In still other embodiments, the activated fatty acid may be prepared from a different base fatty acid than the non-activated fatty acids with which it is combined. For example, in some embodiments, the activated fatty acid may be an activated linoleic acid, an activated oleic acid, or combinations thereof, and these activated fatty acids may be combined with non-activated EPA and\/or DHA. In such embodiments, the ratio of activated linoleic acid and\/or activated oleic acid to non-activated EPA and\/or DHA may be from about 99:1 to 1:99, 1:4 to 4:1, 1:3 to 3:1, 1:2 to 2:1, or 1:1. In particular embodiments, activated linoleic acid or oleic acid may be combined with EPA and DHA, and each of the three components may be provided in a ratio of from about 1:1:1, 2:1:1, 1:2:1, 1:1:2, 2:2:1, 1:2:2, 3:1:1, and the like.","In some embodiments, the dosage regimen as described above may be combined with a secondary form of treatment or a secondary agent. For example, activated fatty acids such as those described above may be combined with antioxidants, statins, squalene synthesis inhibitors, azetidinone-based compounds, low-density lipoprotein (EDL) catabolism activators, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) antagonists or agonists, antiarrhythmic agent, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the like, and combinations thereof.","The antioxidants of various embodiments, may include any antioxidant known in the art such as tocopherols, oils, such as soybean oil and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and lubricants such as fractionated coconut oil, lecithin and a mixture of the same.","Statins are drugs that lower blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutalyl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Examples of statin compounds include pitavastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and salts thereof. In certain embodiments, statins may be from naturally occurring sources may be used.

For example, in one embodiment, capsules may be produced by a method including the steps of preparing a sheet of an outer coating layer and one or more sheets of other layers, laminating the sheets, drying the laminated sheets to obtain a dried sheet, and encapsulating one or more activated fatty acid or one or more activated Only acids and one or more secondary agents within the dried sheet on a rotary filler to form a seamed capsule. In another embodiment, seamless capsules may be produced using an instrument equipped with two or more nozzles arranged concentrically. In other embodiments, gelatin capsules may be manufactured as, for example, a two-piece, sealed or unsealed hard gelatin capsule.","In another embodiment, a gelatin capsule including nitro fatty acids may be formed by the encapsulation of a dose of one or more nitro fatty acid in a gelatin capsule. In such embodiments, the gelatin capsule may be made of for example, gelatin, glycerol, water, a flavoring, a coloring agent and combinations thereof, and the nitro fatty acid dose may be, for example, 180 mg of nitrated EPA and 120 mg of nitrated DHA. The manufacturing process of such embodiments may include the steps of combining gelswatch ingredients, melting and forming a liquefied gelswatch, delivering the liquefied gelswatch and the nitro fatty acid to an encapsulation machine, encapsulating a dose of nitro fatty acid, drying the encapsulated dose, washing the encapsulated dose and packaging the nitro fatty acid capsules for shipment. The gelswatch ingredients may include any ingredients described herein that are useful in the production of gelatin capsules such as, for example, gelatin or a gelatin substitute such as modified starch or other suitable gelatin substitute known in the art, a softener such as glycerol or sorbitol or other suitable polyol or other gelatin softener known in the art, a flavoring agent such as strawberry flavor Firmenich #52311A or other suitable gelatin capsule flavoring known in the art and optionally a coloring agent such as keratin or other suitable gelatin capsule coloring agent known in the art.","In particular embodiments, the gel capsule may be formed from a gelswatch mixture of about 45 parts by weight of gelatin, about 20 parts by weight of glycerol, about 35 parts by weight of water and about 0.5 or more parts by weight of flavoring. The gelswatch ingredients may be heated to about 60\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. and mixed together to form liquefied gelswatch. The liquefied gelswatch and the nitro fatty acid may then be poured into an encapsulation machine. The encapsulation machine then forms the nitro fatty acid capsule by encapsulating the nitro fatty acid dose into a gelatin capsule.","The capsule can then be dried at a temperature of for example, about 20\u00b0 C. The water content of the capsule may be reduced by evaporation during the drying step. The capsule can then be washed and ready for packaging, selling, or shipping. In some embodiments, a sweetener or flavoring agent can be added to the capsule through a dipping process. In the dipping process, the gelatin capsule is dipped in a sweetener\/flavoring, solution and then dried, allowing for the sweetener to form a coating around the outside of the capsule. In some embodiments, a sweetener or flavoring agent may be added to the capsule through an enteric coating process, and in other embodiments, a liquefied sweetener or flavoring agent can be sprayed on to the outside of the gelatin capsule and dried. Other methods of making gelatin capsules are known in the art and contemplated.","In various embodiments, the one or more coatings on the capsule may be applied by any technique known in the art including, but not limited to pan coating, fluid bed coating or spray coating, and the one or more coatings may be applied, for example, as a solution, suspension, spray, dust or powder. For example, in some embodiments, a polymeric coating may be applied as aqueous-based solutions, organic-based solutions or dispersions containing and, in some embodiments, one or more secondary agent. In such embodiments, polymer-containing droplets may atomized with air or an inert gas and sprayed onto the a core containing the activated fatty acids, and in some embodiments, heated air or inert gas may be added to facilitate evaporation of the solvent and film formation. In the case of soft gelatin capsules, the processing parameters of spray rate and bed temperature must be controlled to limit solubilization and capsule agglomeration. Additionally, a high bed temperature may result in evaporation of residual water from the capsule shell, causing the capsule to become brittle. In addition, coating uniformity which includes mass variance of the coated capsules and variance of the content of the coated activated fatty acid and accuracy of deposition must be evaluated.","Gel capsules of various embodiments of the invention may be of any shape such as, but not limited to, round, oval, tubular, oblong, twist off, or a non-standard shape (e.g., animal, tree, star, heart, etc.), and the size of the capsule may vary in accordance to the volume of the fill composition intended to be contained therein. For example, in some embodiments, hard or soft gelatin capsules may be manufactured using conventional methods as a single body unit comprising the standard capsule shape. A single-body soft gelatin capsule typically may be provided, for example, in sizes from 3 to 22 minims (1 minim=0.0616 ml) and in shapes of oval, oblong or others. Similarly, hard gel capsules may be manufactured using conventional methods in standard shapes and various standard sizes, such as those designated (000), (00), (0), (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) where the largest number corresponds to the smallest size. Non-standard shapes may be used as well.","Other pharmaceutical formulations containing the compounds of the invention and a suitable carrier can be in various forms including, but not limited to, solids, solutions, powders, fluid emulsions, fluid suspensions, semi-solids, and dry powders including an effective amount of an activated fatty acid of the invention.

In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents and can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.","Preparation of an activated fatty acid in solid dosage form may vary. For example, in one embodiment, a liquid or gelatin formulation of the activated fatty acid may be prepared by combining the activated fatty acid with one or more fatty acid diluent, such as those described above, and adding a thickening agent to the liquid mixture to form a gelatin. The gelatin may then be encapsulated in unit dosage form to form a capsule. In another exemplary embodiment, an oily preparation of an activated fatty acid prepared as described above may be lyophilized to for a solid that may be mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier or diluent to form a tablet, and in yet another embodiment, the activated fatty acid of an oily preparation may be crystallized to from a solid which may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier or diluent to form a tablet.","Further embodiments which may be useful for oral administration of activated fatty acids include liquid dosage forms.
