No. 61\/641,468, filed May 2, 2012 which is herein incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to wireless signal communications and, more specifically, to a method and apparatus for providing a multifunctional meshed nanotube sensor.","The capability to provide multiple functions for a single device provides convenient savings in physical space and costs. One traditionally single-tasked device is an antenna. Antennas used in the communication of electromagnetic signals have been developed with a concern for size reduction while providing high fidelity information during transmission and\/or reception. Patch antennas have been a preferred choice of radio frequency (RF) front end design for their reliability and low profile topology. Such a profile makes them ideal for wireless systems where physical space on a wireless device is limited. Patch antennas are also lightweight and enable mounting onto various surfaces that are not suitable for dipole, wire loop, or multi-element antennas. The patch antenna has proven to be quite effective for a variety of applications, including terrestrial and satellite communications systems and various electromagnetic scanning arrays due to its low-profile, planar structure, reasonable bandwidth, and excellent gain.","Antenna material composition is crucial in ensuring the efficient and accurate transmission and\/or reception of wireless signals. The conductivity of these materials plays a critical role in not contributing to attenuation or distortion of signals already degraded by environmental factors experienced during propagation. Traditional patch antennas are constructed from conductive metals such as copper.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","115","125","130","100","105","110","125","130","145","140","100","135","100","120"]},"Military personnel and first responders carry various equipment to communicate with others and provide environmental information about their surroundings. For example, personnel may carry a wireless communications device as well as an environmental condition detector (e.g. temperature, pressure, gas, and the like). Carrying numerous devices decreases mobility, agility, and effectiveness of the user.","Thus, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus that can provide a multifunction sensor (e.g. both wireless communication as well as gas detection) in a compact lightweight form factor.","Embodiments of the present method and apparatus generally relate to a multifunction meshed patch sensor capable of simultaneous wireless communication and gas detection\/sensing. The patch sensor comprising a first nanotube thread and a second nanotube thread, the first nanotube thread and the second nanotube thread alternately crossing each other substantially orthogonally to define a mesh element, wherein the first nanotube thread further comprises a measurable invariant property and the second nanotube thread comprises a measurable variant property.","An embodiment of the present invention provides a multifunction sensor (e.g. an antenna and gas detector) integrated into a single device. In one embodiment, mesh construction of interwoven semiconductive and conductive nanotube threads capable of transceiving signals as well as changing properties when exposed to particular gases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","205","200","200","210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","305","300"],"sub":["r","r"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["435","400","405","412","430","405","435","415","420","400","410","425","435","435"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5"],"b":["505","500","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["505","510","515","510","515","505","500","500","520","530","530","530","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["640","645","600","635","600","605","645","610","640","610","645","615","620","620","600"]},"One exemplary embodiment design consists of a 2.65\u00d73.68 nm patch constructed from 50 \u03bcm diameter meshed CNT threads ,  residing on a ground plane (not shown) separated by a dielectric substrate . An exemplary construction of the substrate may include an RT\/Duriod 6010 (\u2208=10.2) feedline layer, RT\/Durioud 5870 (\u2208=2.33) for a patch layer. The mesh patch  of  connects to a microstrip feedline  through an aperture , as further illustrated in . The microstrip feedline  connects through a connector  to additional electronics for processing as will be discussed further below. Positioning of the aperture  is dependent on the size of the meshed patch  and the operating frequency and length of the feedline .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["800","625","630","625","650","630","625","680","635","650"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","890","801","801","815","805","810","809","813","800","805","810"]},"In one embodiment of the invention, defects are introduced into the semiconducting threads  of the patch . The defects ensure that the threads exhibit lower conductivity than their conductive thread neighbors  and acting almost as a dielectric buffer. The defects also provide more locations for reactive gas molecules to donate or accept electrons, thus increasing the likelihood that a reactive gas will cause a noticeable change in the semiconducting thread  permittivity. The arrangement of semiconducting and conducting threads may be varied in other embodiments. Gas detection capability is realized when an oxidizing or reducing gas  changes the permittivity of the semiconducting thread such that a received electromagnetic or wireless signal  is distorted. The distortion may then can be compared to a predetermined expected baseline signal to determine the presence of a gas and its concentration.","The system  further processes a signal from a coupler  which is then processed by a transceiver portion  and\/or a gas detector . The transceiver  comprises a circulator\/isolator , a first amplifier , a second amplifier , a mixer , a local oscillator , a signal detector , and a signal processor . A coupler  connects the transceiver  to the patch sensor . For communications signals, the patch sensor  operates as an antenna. The circulator\/isolator  directionally couples the signal to\/from the coupler  and to\/from the transceiver's receiver and transmitter. In a transmitter mode, a user interface  sends commands to the CPU\/Memory , such that there is a signal input  to a first amplifier  which passes the signal to the circulator\/isolator , and ultimately to the patch  for transmission. In a receiver mode, the transceiver  receives a signal from the circulator\/oscillator  via a second amplifier . The signal  is then mixed with a local oscillator  within a mixer . The local oscillator  is controlled (e.g. frequency and\/or phase locked) to the received signal. A signal detector  processes the mixed signal to create the oscillator control signal as well as provide detected signal information (e.g., modulation) to the signal processor. The signal processor  produces an output  that is coupled to the CPU\/Memory  and, ultimately, to the user interface . In some embodiments, the user interface  may comprise a display, keyboard, mouse, and other peripheral devices.","The gas detector  comprises an impedance detector , comparator operational amplifier  and threshold generator . The sensor  is coupled to an impedance detector . The impedance detector  senses the impedance of the sensor  (e.g. a resonance impedance by applying an RF signal to the sensor ). The impedance value is coupled to the comparator  and compared to a predetermined threshold level . A change in the impedance will show as a difference value of the resulting signal  that forms the output. The result may be processed and\/or stored in the CPU\/Memory  and ultimately displayed to the user through the user interface . The CPU\/Memory  may also provide analog to digital conversions, digital to analog conversions, and various digital signal processing. An all digital solution may be used by implementing the transceiver  and gas detector  as software modules within the CPU\/Memory . As such, the signals from the path sensor  would be digitized and processed as described above.","The multifunctional system  is implemented as a gas detector by taking advantage of newly discovered reactions of types of CNTs when introduced to particular oxidizing gases . Thus, the mesh antenna patch comprises two measurable properties, invariant and variant. The first invariant property allows the transceiver to communicate through the conductive lines . The second variable property interacts with the environment to provide a gas sensing capability through semiconductive lines . The reactions of the invariant property have been exploited as an ambient gas sensor by incorporating semiconductive SWNT thread lines  with a high number of defects along as part of an electromagnetic wave resonator of the embodiment. Oxidizing and reducing gases such as He (helium), Ar (argon), N(nitrogen), NH(ammonia) and O(oxygen) proximate to CNT threads temporarily affect the permittivity and conductivity of such CNTs in the semiconductive material.","In some embodiments, wireless communication is to be continuously performed through the transmission or reception of electromagnetic waves on the conductive threads . Simultaneously or nearly simultaneously, the semi-conductive threads  are performing gas sensing by detecting an impedance change. The radiating signals may originate from the patch  or in other embodiments may also be received from a separate source (not shown) which is distinct from the meshed patch antenna  structure in other embodiments.","A multifunctional device is thus realized when the invariant conductive CNT threads  serve as the meshed patch antenna structure and the variant semiconducting CNT threads  serve as dielectric spacer material with variable permittivity. In one embodiment, the meshed CNT thread patch  may simultaneously serve as both the radiating antenna for a communications system  and as the dielectric loaded resonator for a gas detector .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","901","939","900","901","930","935","940","955","945","945","950","955"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1040","1000","1005","1010","1030","1100","1005","1025","1020"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1105","1110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 8","FIG. 12"],"b":["1201","1220","1201","1210","1205","1200","1205","1215","1220","1215"],"sub":["3 ","11 ","r","3","r","r","3 ","3 "]},"In other exemplary embodiments, RF signals may also be processed such that the resonant or center frequency shift  will be compared to predetermined profiles of gases to determine the presence of a specific gas surrounding the sensor. Profiles may be calculated based on findings of predetermined results and thus compared to instant readings from the embodiment. This is because the center frequency shifts in direct response to the change in the permittivity of the CNT layer that occurs due to the presence of a reactive gas . Ultimately the exemplary embodiment would have the frequency shift  in the resonant frequency detected on semiconductive thread lines while maintaining communication of wireless signals on the first conductive thread lines of the mesh structure. Further embodiments may have the detected RF signal originate from conductive thread lines of the mesh or from a source completely external and separate from the mesh.","By bundling the nanotubes together into longer fibers such as threads or ropes, it has been determined that since nanotubes can be made into a thread, it can be woven together on a larger scale similar to and\/or in conjunction with textile threads. When implemented with textiles, air between layers may become the substrate or layers of textile threads may become the substrate for the nanotube threading.","Thus, specific embodiments not detailed herein will include the mesh pattern that may be incorporated into articles of clothing, wristbands, lightweight aircrafts, and have off-chip designs for processing may also be realized in the future. Fabrication steps will also include factors such as various crystalline structure as well as specific programmable functionality for gas detection and communication systems integration. Other embodiments are also able to detect EMI, moisture, temperature, humidity, and those environmental factors affecting dielectric properties and permittivity. Further future embodiments may include structures of different weave patterns, layers, or separate transmitting and receiving communication lines.","While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present disclosure, other and further embodiments may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present disclosure car be understood in detail, a more particular description of the embodiment, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.
