As shown in , the service provider server  includes a service interface application , which may be adapted to interact with the client device  to facilitate publishing and\/or sharing multi-media presentations over a network. In one example, the service provider server  may be provided and implemented by PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., USA.","The service application , in one embodiment, utilizes a collect module , a create module , and a publish module  to collect multi-media information, create multi-media presentations, and publish multi-media presentations, respectively. In various implementations, the modules , ,  enable users, such as the user , to collect diverse types of audio and visual media, create rich multi-media presentations with real-time editing and authoring using media software, such as Flash, and then share and\/or publish the rich multi-media, presentations with other users via the network . In one example, the collect, create, and publish modules , ,  may be implemented within, a standard web browser for interfacing with the user .","In one implementation, the user  is able to share multi-media presentations with other users via the media channels  and\/or embed multi-media presentations directly in webpages of other users, for example, the user  may provide a unique URL link for the multi-media presentation to other users. In another example, the user  may directly email multi-media presentations to multiple recipients and include a message with the email. In still another example, the user  may provide the source HTML (i.e., HyperText Markup Language) code to other users and\/or embed the source HTML code directly into other user's webpages. Still other examples include the ability to publish multi-media presentations on a website to sell a particular item or service for purchase. For items and\/or services, a media rich presentation helps users market and sell items and\/or services, which may be valuable for high-end or high-priced items and\/or services. Social and\/or dating sites may utilize these multi-media presentations to provide online users with a way to better present themselves to other online users. In various implementations, some types of webpages may be presented in a more dynamic manner by utilizing Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds, since, for example, a particular users presentation may be continually changing with, new media.","The service provider server , in various embodiments, may be configured to maintain, store and\/or archive multi-media presentations in a database , each of which may include information related to one or more users, such as the user , and one or more multi-media channels, such as multi-media distributions channels . In various examples, the multi-media presentations may include attributes stored as part thereof, and the attributes may be passed, to the service provider server  as part of a creating, publishing, and\/or sharing the multi-media presentations.","Referring to , the collect module , in one embodiment, enables the user  to collect audio, photographic images, video, and music media from various sources, such as a PC, RSS feeds, websites, and any other online source, via a user interface, such as the user interface application . In various implementations, the user interface application  comprises multiple tabs and\/or links for the various sources. Once collected, the media may be saved and categorized in the database  and edited on the system site via the service provider server . Editing may include one or more of sizing, rotating, overlying, moving and stacking various media, backward and forward with an overlay or stack. Video may be broken up automatically by the service provider server  into smaller segments. Selected video segments may be combined and\/or used as desired. Selected media may be placed on a virtual storyboard, such as a clipboard, on the same screen as the collection of media. Media may be edited either in the collection or in the storyboard. Placing desired media on the storyboard may be accomplished by dragging and dropping. In one example, the collect module  provides selected media on a storyboard. In another example, the collect module  provides media on a user's media page (i.e., not placed on the storyboard). In still another example, uploading media may be delayed until editing is completed.","Referring to , the create module , in one embodiments enables the user  to place selected media onto a presentation style, board, or collage. The service provider server  may automatically suggest a story idea to launch the creative process, or the user  may select a specific style or presentation tool. In one implementation, media from the storyboard may be dragged and dropped onto the presentation. Within the presentation, there may be multiple presentation styles, and media may be placed within a viewing window of each type of presentation style. Once in the presentation, the media may be edited. In one example, the media may be rotated, sized, cut-out (e.g., by selecting the boundaries of an image, such as with clicks to designate points along the boundary, enabling as coarse or line a resolution as desired), moved forward or backward in relation to adjacent media, slide multiple images to add or remove, spaces within the presentation, and adding a hotspot (e.g., selecting an area of the image for additional information, such as adding a link, video, text, etc.). Other editing features may include adding audio to the background, adding text, and\/or distorting images. In one aspect, the editing may be achieved in real-time so that the user  may quickly and easily see the results and change them as needed.","In one implementation, the create module  is adapted to provide multiple styles (e.g., a picture frame, a television, a billboard, etc.) within a single style presentation (e.g., a single pre-defined style) for use in the creation of rich multi-media presentations. In one example, users are provided a default list of styles. In another example, users may have styles that only the user, or a user group that the user belongs to, have access rights to. In one aspect, each pre-defined style includes a title, a thumbnail, customization metadata, and\/or an associated style engine . In one embodiment, the style engine includes application logic comprised, e.g., in a Flash file adapted to support a standardized interface. In one aspect, the service interface application  may include a studio application adapted to programmatically connect a loaded style engine to a current storyboard object and provide a data-driven user interface (UI) for customizing the currently active style.","Referring to , the publish module , in one embodiment, enables the user  to share, publish and\/or distribute the presentation when, for example, the presentation is completed. In one implementation, as described herein, the presentation may be saved in the database  of the service provider server . Once saved, the user  may share, publish and\/or distribute presentations to any selected channel, such as one or more of the multi-media channels . Any users on the network  having access to the channels  or website related to the channels  may refresh the view, which may automatically load the presentation into that channel and\/or website for viewing the content of the presentation. As such, the presentations may be distributed to various online websites, blogs, mobile video players, and IP TV networks, and\/or on the system site.","These modules , ,  may be combined, used, and\/or modified to provide the user  with different initial choices regarding the type of presentation and features desired for creating the presentation. The choices may be a simple, easy to use tool to quickly build presentations with dynamic content from RSS feeds and online albums. Accordingly, the user  may select a presentation style and then link it to the user's media libraries through RSS feeds that maintain an \u201calways on\u201d permalink to the content source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2B","b":["200","160","160"]},"Referring to , the method  comprises collecting media for a multi-media presentation (block ). In various implementations, media such as photographic images, audio, video, music, etc. may be collected from a variety of sources including local sources, such as a personal computer (PC), and online sources, such as the Internet, for use in the media presentation or media piece. For example, an online search engine may be accessed and one or more keyword searches may be utilized to search the Internet for various types of media content. In another example, additional media may be collected from other sources, such as media from a PC, which may be selected, uploaded and viewed. As such, media from different sources may be viewed by selecting corresponding media source tabs from the user interface application . Media may be viewed as individual media items or clustered such that each of the individual media items within the cluster may be viewed. In one aspect, the user interface application  interfaces with the service interlace application  via the network  to utilize the collect module  for collecting media. In another aspect, any media collected may be displayed on the user device  via the network  for viewing by the user  in a media collection area of the user interface application  (block ).","Next, the method  comprises populating a storyboard (block ). In one implementation, the user interface application  includes a graphical storyboard, which may be populated with collected media from one or more of the media items or a cluster of media items collected from various media sources. For example, the graphical storyboard may include one or more images of items and\/or clustered items collected from the Internet and items uploaded from a PC.","Next, optionally, one or more of the media items may be edited (block ). In various implementations, media positioned on the graphical storyboard may be edited prior to generating the media presentation or media piece, and\/or individual media items in a media cluster may be reordered.","Next, the media presentation or media piece may be created (block ). In one implementation, once media items have been collected and optionally edited, the media presentation or media piece may be created by selecting a creation operation via the user interface application . In one embodiment, the user interface application  interfaces with the service interface application  via the network  to utilize the create module  and the style engine for creating the media presentation or media, piece.","Next, creating the media presentation, and\/or media piece may include selecting and\/or customizing its style (block ) and previewing the selected and\/or customized style (block ). For example, referring to , the user interface application  may be adapted to provide the user  with a style access window  for creating multi-media presentations, wherein at least one style from a list of selectable styles may be selected from a styles menu tab. Referring to , the user interface application  may be adapted to provide the user  with a thumbnail window  from the styles menu tab to choose or select a particular style from the list of selectable styles. In various examples, presentation styles may include, but are not limited to, a slide show, a billboard, a kaleidoscope (e.g., a kaleidoscope presentation style , as shown in ), a television, a sheet scene, a landscape, a room with different viewing areas (e.g., one or more picture frames), and various other presentations styles. In various other examples, styles may also include pre-defined presentation themes, such as a graduation theme , as shown in . Other styles may include holidays (e.g., Christmas, Independence Day, Memorial Day, etc.), events (e.g., birthdays, parties, dances, etc.), achievements (e.g., promotions, rewards, milestones, etc.), and various other presentation themes.","In various embodiments, the selectable list of styles may include one or more of the following presentation styles and\/or presentation themes. One style may include a simple photo slider, in which the media is automatically presented as a sequence of photos. The user  may roll over the left or right side to see a previous media or a next media. Multiple media may be played in a sliding slide format. Another style may include a cut-out feature that allows the user  to cut out any portion of a photo and insert something else in that portion. For example, the user  may select a photo, such as from a user computer or web site. A portion of the selected photo is then cut out, using a simple point and click to mark the boundaries of the cut-out. The last point and click may be at the same spot as the first point and click to complete the boundary. That portion may then be removed, and a new media may be inserted, such as a photo or video. Examples include media within a billboard, an animal's mouth, picture frames in a photo, the moon, etc. Another style may include a tree that is automatically filled in with a suitable number of small television screens on its branches showing the selected media on the screens. Another style may include a page of postcards, such that when that style is selected, the previous chosen media are automatically tilled into the postcards on a single page. Another style may include the kaleidoscope format  of , in which the kaleidoscope continually shows and then changes to the next media in a kaleidoscope fashion or presentation. Another style may include a link (e.g., string) or multiple links of photos (e.g., a string of multiple photos) that the user  moves around a page, such as, e.g., to create a circular string of photos. Another style may include a media wall, wherein, e.g., two screens on a page continually change images of the selected media. Another style may be a simple slide show, in which media are shown automatically one at a time on the page, wherein images change within a defined time period.","In various embodiments, once a style is selected, the user  may select different variations of the style. For example, each particular style may have a different set of variations adapted for use with that style. Referring to the tree style, the user  may select different types of frames on the tree to include the media, the user  may select a specific background from an image, and the user  may use different style trees. In another example, referring to the photo slider, different types and styles of frames may be used, as well as different types of presentations, e.g., spacing between photos, no spacing, and background selection. Referring to the cut-out style, the user  may use a pre-determined cut-out such as postcards from different states or cities, the mouth of different animals, various media holders from, different rooms, a newspaper stand with moving background, a billboard from a fixed background or from user-selected background, a jeans pocket, from a class-room, or from a music player. Referring to a page of postcards, the user  may select different configurations of postcards on a page as well as different backgrounds for the page. Referring to the kaleidoscope style, the user  may select different kaleidoscope patterns. Referring to the link style and the media wall style, the user  may select from numerous different frames that comprise the media, such as televisions, cameras, and different styles, as well as different backgrounds for the page.","In various implementations, referring to , once a style is selected (block ), the style engine is adapted to load collected media into the selected style, wherein, e.g., media items from the storyboard may automatically flow into or populate the selected style for previewing (block ). For example, a clustered set of photos may be selected to play in a frame image, and a video clip may be selected to play on a television image. Some styles, such as the kaleidoscope style  of , may support movement of media, items as part, of a presentation style adapted to provide various customizable characteristics of movement, such as speed of media rotation, etc., within the style. In one implementation, the selected and\/or customized style may be displayed on the user device  via the network  for viewing or previewing by the user .","Next, in one embodiment, referring to , the selected and\/or customized style of the media presentation or media piece may be optionally edited (block ). For example, in reference to the selected and\/or customized styles, the user  may optionally edit the media presentation or media piece, such as selecting specific frames, setting the background (e.g., with a selected photo or video), adding background music that is adapted to play throughout the presentation, resizing the frame, etc. In one aspect, editing may depend on the selected and\/or customized style, as different styles may have different editing features.","In various implementations, if further editing of media presentation style is desired, style editing tools may be provided to the user interface application  via, e.g., the style engine and the create module . These editing tools may include the ability to play or preview the media presentation or media piece, edit the media presentation or media piece (e.g., scale, rotate and\/or move frames directly onto the media presentation or media piece), add text and\/or captions to the media presentation or media piece, add audio, sound, music and\/or voice-over to the media presentation or media piece, placement of a frame and\/or masking of the media presentation or piece, and add background, images and\/or color to the media presentation or media piece. For example, a sound feature may provide options, such as adding music to particular media or background, having the music vary in loudness depending on time and\/or spatial indicators, and having a repeating playlist that repeats particular music and\/or plays different segments, e.g., in a random manner or order.","Next, the method  comprises providing identifying information (block ) about the media presentation or media piece (e.g., a title, storage location and\/or various types of descriptive information) and deciding where to store the media presentation or media piece (block ). In one implementation, the user  may identify and\/or a select one or more distribution channels located on an associated server for storage of the media presentation or media piece or choose an alternative storage location in the network .","Next, the method  comprises publishing, sharing and\/or broadcasting the media presentation or media piece via the network (block ). In various implementations, the media presentation or media piece may be published or distributed to a site accessible via the network  for viewing by one or more other network users in communication with the network . For example, the media presentation or media piece may be directly emailed (block ) to one or more recipients (i.e., other network users), along with a message, in another example, an associated URL link (block ) for the media presentation or media piece may be given (e.g., via email or some type of text message) to one or more recipients (i.e., other network; users) for direct access to the media presentation, or media piece via the network . In still another example, source code (block ) for the media presentation or media piece may be obtained by the user  and embedded into a web page managed by the user  via the network .","As such, in various implementations, the user  may email the media presentation or media piece to other network users via the network , embed the media presentation or media piece in a web page that is accessible via the network , and\/or create a URL permalink of the media presentation or media piece to one or more of the multi-media distribution channels  in the network .","In one implementation, the service interface application  allows users to compose multi-media stories, presentations and pieces by laying out photographic images, video, text and audio on a stage, storyboard or collage. In one aspect, a multi-media story may begin from an unpopulated storyboard. The user  may select to view and work with a sample story until the user  is ready to begin the media story. Multi-media items from various sources may be viewed by selecting source tabs of the user interface application .","Once the user  is ready to create a media story, the user  accesses a collage storyboard. In one aspect, the storyboard or stage progressively moves in a first direction, such as a left or right direction, and when viewed, may appear as a movie adapted to present a linear narrative in time and\/or space. In another aspect, the stage may progressively move in a second direction, such as upward or downward. As such, this may also be presented as a movie adapted to present a linear narrative in time and\/or space. The vertical orientation may represent physical structures that have height and\/or depth, such as buildings, structures, monuments and\/or geological strata. In still another aspect, the stage may be adapted to progressively move in a plurality of directions and may be presented as real or virtual spaces in two or three dimensions.","In various implementations, multi-media items from various sources may be uploaded from the network , or previously collected media items may be used to populate the storyboard by selecting desired multi-media hems. A multi-media item may be repositioned within the storyboard by dragging and dropping the multi-media item to another location in the storyboard. Similarly, a multi-media item may be removed from the storyboard by dragging and dropping the multi-media item, from the storyboard. In one aspect, once multi-media items are positioned within the storyboard, the media story may be edited. In this regard, a rich interface may be presented to users within a predefined screen area.","In various embodiments, the service interface application  utilizes a number of innovative techniques. For example, a first technique utilizes one or more direct-attached media-specific tools. When selecting any media object on the stage, a highlight rectangle appears around the object. Attached to the rectangle around the media object are a number of tools, some generic for all media types, others specific to the media type. By showing the tools in close proximity to the media object, it is easier for users to understand the relationship of the tool to the media object. For each tool, an edge may be specified (e.g., expressed as a number from 0-3, 0=top, 1=right, 2=bottom and 3=left), a position along the edge (e.g., expressed, as a ratio of edge length) and an offset from the edge (e.g., expressed as a factor of the tool's size). Whenever updating a position of a tool, an absolute position may be calculated or recalculated based on various parameters.","In another example, another technique utilizes a rotation invariant display of tools. If a user  rotates a media object using a rotate tool, the associated tools remain fixed, to the original object constraint point (i.e., they do not rotate, thereby making it easier for the user to read the icons). Once a rotation is complete, the attached edge is calculated or recalculated based on the perceived edge, and if necessary fades the tool out from a previous location to a new location. As such, the user  may be accustomed to finding certain tools in certain positions relative to a media object, irrespective of the media object's rotation.","In another example, another technique utilizes a slide tool. When working with media that may progressively move in a particular direction, user selection and manipulation of individual media objects may become a challenge. Traditional techniques of multiple selection and direct manipulation break down when dealing with large documents. The slide tool allows the user  to perform an action that may be difficult, such as insert or remove horizontal space within a collage or story. The user  selects a media object to reveal the media specific tools. The slide tool is affixed to an edge of the media object, and when grabbed, the slide tool selects one or more media objects at or to the other edge of the selected media object, and allows side-to-side sliding during a user action. In one aspect, this technique may be utilized for a vertically oriented collage or story, which would present the slide tool on an upper edge of the selected media object and allow dragging of layers at or below the selected object.","In another example, another technique utilizes a drag and drop insertion. The user  may drag thumbnails representing media objects from a media tab and drop them onto the stage or storyboard. As the user  drags the thumbnail over the stage, an insertion point indicator is presented to the user  showing where an edge of the dropped item may be located during user action, such as, if the user's mouse is released. If the user's mouse hovers over the left edge of any existing media object on the stage, the indicator state switches to an insert mode. If the user releases the mouse while the indicator is in this mode, the underlying media object and all media objects to the right of the left edge of that media object will be offset to the right to allow for the dropped media object to fit on the stage without being obscured.","In another example, another technique utilizes one or more unconstrained animated button icons. Some applications use iconic images to represent actions that the user  may perform. As icons become smaller, they are difficult to discern and understand. The service interface application  uses animation and unbounded icons to convey visual information. In one aspect, a text tool icon in an idle state is an \u201cA\u201d (other applications often use a T as the text tool). On rollover, the A is revealed to be a window onto a cropped, sliding Add Text message, which animates to an edge. In another aspect, a soundtrack tool may be represented as a musical note, but on rollover, the notes play and rise outside of a representative button. To create these buttons, a designer may designate a static rectangle, which represents traditional bounds of the graphic. These bounds may be used by the button to determine the button bounds and scale. The innovative part is to not force all graphic icon content to lie within these bounds and set the button class to not clip its content. By triggering the animation on rollover, the design may exceed its bounds, while still preserving visual coherence in the idle state.","In another example, another technique utilizes one or more collapsible tabbed containers. When editing a collage or story, a button bar may represent one or more additional editing options. The collapsed bar may comprise a row of buttons, although each icon may be presented as a button rather than an icon. When the user  selects at least one of the buttons, the selected button transforms into a tab, and the bar expands horizontally to include the tab content. The user  may collapse the bar by selecting a close button in the bar or by selecting the currently open tab.","In another example, another technique utilizes an on-demand loading of media. A presentation may be represented as a document with a plurality of layers. Each layer may include various attributes, including position, scale, visual bounds, associated annotations (i.e., hotspots) and a target media asset, which may have layer specific properties, such, as playback behaviors. When a player loads a collage or story, the player requests the first page of the collage document and specifies a number of layers per page. The server returns up to a page worth of layers, sorted by x position in the collage. The player may download one or more pages of layers and create a local indexed list of layers. Then, based on the visual window, the player may filter the layers down to the currently visible. For each layer, if the layer hasn't already been loaded or queued for loading, the layer is queued for loading.","In one implementation, the user  may add one or more hotspots to the media presentation or piece. A hotspot may be identified by a title as a cursor is moved, over a designated hotspot area. Activating the hotspot by selecting the hotspot area may link, the user  to additional information relating to the hotspot item. For example, if an automobile is used as a media item within the collage storyboard, a hotspot may link the user  to additional information relating to the automobile, such as price, condition, and terms or sale. Hotspots may be specific to one part or element, of the media item, in this example, the user  may create a hotspot on the tire, which, when opened, may give the viewer access and\/or information on the tire, where to buy the tire, etc. Other hotspots may link the user to music or other audio clips, and other media may be uploaded into the collage storyboard from a clipboard or link to sale items posted on the Internet. Once the media piece has been created the media piece may be viewed, saved, previewed and\/or published. Once published, the user  may have options as to the playback. For example, the media presentation or piece may play continuously until stopped, play only for a specified number of times, play only once, etc.","In various implementations, using the various media creation and publishing tools described herein, a user  may quickly and easily create media rich presentations and use those presentations in numerous ways. Some examples include the ability to publish a presentation on a site to sell a particular item or service. For items or services, a media rich presentation, may assist the seller with marketing and selling the item or service, which may be valuable for high-end or high-priced items or services. Sellers may be able to cross sell or promote items or services or direct consumers to partner commercial sites using the hotspot feature. Social or dating sites may use these presentations to give its users a meaningful way to present themselves to others. Blogs and personal pages may be more dynamic using RSS feeds, since, for example, a particular user's presentation may be continually changing with new media.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","120","140","180","140","160","140","180","120","140","180","400"]},"In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, computer system , such as a personal computer and\/or a network server, includes a bus  and\/or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as processing component  (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), system memory component  (e.g., RAM), static storage component  (e.g., ROM), disk drive component  (e.g., magnetic or optical), network interface component  (e.g., modem or Ethernet card), display component  (e.g., CRT or LCD), input component  (e.g., keyboard), and cursor control component  (e.g. mouse or trackball).
