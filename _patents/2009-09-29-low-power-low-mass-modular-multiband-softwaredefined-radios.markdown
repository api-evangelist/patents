Haskins et. al, filed Sep. 30, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with U.S. Government support under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), contract number NNXD06AH71G. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Technical Field","Disclosed herein are methods and systems to implement and operate modular software-defined radios (SDRs), including SDRs for terrestrial and extraterrestrial use.","2. Related Art","Software-defined radios (SDRs) arose in the late 1970s in the defense sector. The term \u201csoftware-defined radio\u201d has been in use since at least 1991. An early U.S. military SDR initiative, named SpeakEasy, sought to use programmable processing to emulate multiple existing military radios operating in frequency bands between 2 and 2000 MHz, and to enable incorporation of new coding and modulation techniques in the future.","SDR development is driven predominantly by terrestrial needs, including military and emergency response needs, such as to provide interoperability amongst different equipment. For example, the U.S. military has developed a Joint Tactical Radio System to provide flexible and interoperable communications amongst hand-held, vehicular, airborne, dismounted, fixed base-station, and maritime radios.","Extraterrestrial environments present challenges that may not be encountered to the same degree in terrestrial environments, such as physical inaccessibility, higher signal propagation frequencies, radiation, relatively vast distances between transmitters and receivers, different mission requirements, and more onerous limitations on size, mass, and power consumption.","Designs developed for terrestrial applications are not necessarily suitable for extraterrestrial environments, and do not necessarily satisfy extraterrestrial challenges. Limited resources allotted for extraterrestrial programs may necessitate unconventional configurations of commercially available components, rather than design and manufacture of new components.","Disclosed herein are methods and systems to implement and operate software-defined radios (SDRs).","An SDR may be configured to perform a combination of numerically controlled fractional and integer frequency synthesis and direct digital synthesis to provide a set of relatively agile, flexible, low-noise, and low spurious, timing and frequency conversion signals. Frequency synthesis may include dithering to provide additional precision. Direct digital synthesis, mixing, sampling, sub-sampling, clock synthesis, and frequency synthesis, including dithering, or portions thereof, may be performed in hardware, firmware, software-configurable firmware, a processor in response to software, and combinations thereof.","An SDR may include software-configurable firmware modules to perform processing tasks in accordance with one or more software-defined personalities, wherein a personality may include a set of software-defined parameters.","Software configurable firmware modules may include one or more of a carrier tracking module to correct Doppler-induced errors in a receive path, a channel select module to define or select down-conversion channel frequencies and bandwidths and to demodulate data, a coherency calculation module to perform mathematics and signal processing to maintain an exciter path carrier signal coherent with a received signal in accordance with a turn-around ratio, an encoder module, including one or more encoder sub-modules, each configured to provide a corresponding encoding framework, a hardware interface firmware module to control receiver and exciter slices, and a host interface module to provide an interface to the SDR with respect to a host system.","Additional features and exemplary embodiments are provided in the description below and the accompanying drawings.","In the drawings, the leftmost digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","1","102","104","1","104","106","106","116","120","122"],"i":["i","j"]},"Exemplary signal processing tasks are disclosed herein with reference to one or more of a receiver slice , and exciter slice , DSP , processor , firmware , and hardware .

Encoder core  may include, for example, turbo encoding firmware. Encoder core  may be software-configurable to operate with respect to multiple rates and frame sizes without modification of firmware . The multiple rates and frame sizes may correspond to a Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard, such as a CCSDS 131.0-B-1 standard, titled \u201cTM Synchronization and Channel Coding,\u201d published in September 2003 by the CCSDS Secretariat, Office of Space Communication (Code M-3), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C. 20546.","Encoder core  may be implemented in a modular fashion, such that one or more sub-cores associated with corresponding encoding frameworks may be added to or removed from encoder core  with little or no impact on other cores or sub-cores. Encoder core  may include, for example, a low density parity check (LDPC) encoder core.","A hardware interface core  may include firmware to provide a relatively abstract interface to devices and sensors throughout SDR . Hardware interface core  may permit processor  to manipulate hardware slices and to support multiple receiver slices  and multiple exciter slices . Hardware interface core  may be configured to permit SDR  to operate with less than all permitted slices installed. For example, and without limitation, hardware interface core  may be configured to support up to two receiver slices  and up to two exciter slices , and may be operable with less than two receiver slices  and\/or two exciter slices . Hardware interface core  may be configured to provide variable refresh rates, such as to scale power consumption with capability. Hardware interface core  may be configured to initiate device scrubbing\/reloading and\/or failure detection and correction, such as in response to external device radiation faults.","A host interface core  may include firmware to provide a relatively abstract interface of SDR  to host  or other systems, alone or in combination with processor . Host interface core  may be implemented with a modular firmware configuration, which may permit customization of physical and electrical layers associated with radio interfaces, and which may permit SDR  to be reconfigured for different missions with little or no impact to other modules of the interface firmware. This may reduce non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs. Software associated with processor , which may include C code, may serve to abstract away relatively complex status collection and mode command routines. The software may be configured to provide various levels of in-flight reprogram-ability, which may vary amongst missions.","Firmware  may include firmware to monitor voltages and temperatures within SDR , which may be available as software-defined status telemetry points through interface  in . Interface  may include multi-master serial computer bus, such as an inter-integrated circuit (I2C) bus, to permit monitoring of voltages, temperature, and\/or other sensors, within SDR  and\/or external of SDR .","In , DSP  may include memory . In , memory  may include one or more of programmable read-only memory (PROM) , which may be used to store default or failsafe radio personalities and software, electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) , which may be used to store uploaded software-defined parameters or radio personalities, and static random access memory (SRAM)  for scratch and other temporary storage.","In , power converter  may be configured to generate a core set of one or more voltage levels, and S-band receiver slice -, exciter slices - and -, and DSP  may be configured to generate corresponding custom voltages from the standard secondary voltages. Power converter  may provide independent voltage banks for receiver slices , exciter slices , reference oscillator , and DSP , and may provide voltage sequencing within one or more of the banks, and may synchronize to reference oscillator .","Where power converter  operates on a single primary bus voltage input, DSP  and\/or host  may be configured to gate voltages associated with receiver slices  and exciter slices . Gating may be implemented within power converter  and\/or within receiver slices  and exciter slices .","SDR  may be configured with a pulse-off feature to momentarily turn off power converter , or portions thereof. This may reduce risk of damage where, for example, a primary bus voltage is hard-wired on. A pulse-off feature may be used to recover from single event effects due to radiation.","A plurality of exciter slices  may share a power converter secondary voltage bank, and may be configured to be independently gated on and off, such as with field-effect transistor (FET) switches within exciter slices , controlled by firmware .","Methods and systems disclosed herein may be implemented to provide desired RF performance and frequency band coverage with relatively low mass and low power consumption, and may be implemented substantially with commercially available components, which may reduce development and manufacturing costs. Alternatively, or additionally, band tuning capability may be provided with future monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) based voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) having relatively low-phase noise and low-power consumption.","A modular SDR, as disclosed herein, may be readily upgradeable with future technology and\/or modified for other applications.","The Unites States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has promulgated a Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) specification to define a standard architecture for space-qualified radios in support of NASA missions. STRS version 1.0 was released December 2005. SDR , or portions thereof, may be configured in accordance with a Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) specification promulgated by NASA, such as version 1.0, released December, 2005, and\/or subsequent versions.","Additional exemplary parameters and corresponding exemplary configurations of SDR  are provided in Table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Parameter","Exemplary Configuration"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Compatibility","TDRSS DG2 non-spread services (Single Access)"]},{"entry":[{},"STRS-00001 compatible SPM & RFM; GPM "]},{"entry":[{},"HAL\/API on space craft Host under development"]},{"entry":[{},"Capable of in-flight reconfiguration and personality "]},{"entry":[{},"updates; PROM & EEPROM for 4 personalities + 1 "]},{"entry":[{},"default"]},{"entry":["Mass","2.1 Kg w\/0.1\u2033 Al chassis (1.8 Kg estimated w\/0.1\u2033 "]},{"entry":[{},"Mg alloy)"]},{"entry":["Bus Power","16.8 W, 10M\/50M\/1 Mbps, OCXO warmup, flight "]},{"entry":[{},"FPGA estimated, all temperatures, all bus voltages "]},{"entry":[{},"(+22 to +34 V)"]},{"entry":[{},"11.4 W, 10M\/10M\/1 Mbps, OCXO at steady state, "]},{"entry":[{},"flight FPGA estimated, +28 V, +25\u00b0 C."]},{"entry":[{},"5.3 W, S-band Rx @ 1 Mbps, OCXO at steady "]},{"entry":[{},"state. +28 V, +25\u00b0 C."]},{"entry":["Temperature","operating in spec.: \u221225\u00b0 C. to +55\u00b0 C., ON "]},{"entry":[{},"survival: \u221235\u00b0 C. to +65\u00b0 C., cold start: \u221235\u00b0 C., "]},{"entry":[{},"storage: \u221235\u00b0 C. to +85\u00b0 C."]},{"entry":["Radiation","TID \u226750 Krads (Si) component tolerance at a "]},{"entry":[{},"shielding depth of 100 mils Aluminum; higher "]},{"entry":[{},"tolerance options available via spot and other shielding"]},{"entry":[{},"LET for SEL \u226780 MeV\/mg\/cm{circumflex over (\u2009)}2"]},{"entry":[{},"SEU: Error checking and correcting firmware included"]},{"entry":["Interfaces","LVDS Command\/Telemetry (In-test), upgradeable to "]},{"entry":[{},"Spacewire and others; RS-422 baseband telemetry "]},{"entry":[{},"output;"]},{"entry":[{},"LVDS UART Mode\/Status (In-test), upgradeable to "]},{"entry":[{},"Spacewire and others"]},{"entry":[{},"Serial Test Interface: LVDS or RS-232, upgradeable "]},{"entry":[{},"to others"]},{"entry":["S-band ","2200-2300 MHz. <1 mHz step resolution"]},{"entry":["Exciter","CW, BPSK, QPSK, PM: in-test: SQPSK, subcarrier, "]},{"entry":[{},"M-PSK & M-QAM (up 16)"]},{"entry":[{},"1 bps to ~75 Mbps (modulator-limited) uncoded; typically"]},{"entry":[{},"further limited by NTIA mask +12 dBm +\/\u22122 dB output "]},{"entry":[{},"power"]},{"entry":[{},"programmable modulation index. <1\u00b0 resolution, up to 64 "]},{"entry":[{},"hot swappable I\/Q calibration sets"]},{"entry":[{},"BER loss @ 10{circumflex over (\u2009)}\u22126 bit error rate (no NTIA mask): 0.5 dB "]},{"entry":[{},"(100 Kbps 45* PM); 0.5 dB (12.5 Mbps BPSK); 0.6 dB"]},{"entry":[{},"(25 Mbps QPSK) over temperature"]},{"entry":["Ka-band ","25.5-26.0 GHz, <1 mHz step resolution for 25.5-26.0 GHz, "]},{"entry":["Exciter","returnable on ground within 25.25-27.0 GHz"]},{"entry":[{},"CW, BPSK, QPSK, PM (45\u00b0 pk), other mod indices "]},{"entry":[{},"w\/backoff; in-test: SQPSK"]},{"entry":[{},"1 bps to 25 Mbps (modulator-limited) uncoded; +5 "]},{"entry":[{},"dBm +\/\u22122 dB output power. w\/ext, coax attenuator"]},{"entry":[{},"BER loss @ 10{circumflex over (\u2009)}\u22126 bit error rate (no NTIA mask): "]},{"entry":[{},"1.0 dB (100 Kbps 45\u00b0 PM); 1.1 dB (125 Mbps BPSK); "]},{"entry":[{},"1.2 dB (25 Mbps QPSK) over temperature"]},{"entry":["Data Encoder","programmable data formats: NRZ, Bi-phase, RZ.
