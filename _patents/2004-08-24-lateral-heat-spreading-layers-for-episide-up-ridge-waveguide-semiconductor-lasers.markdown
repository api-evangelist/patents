Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to heat dissipation layers for semiconductor devices, and more particularly to a semiconductor device with a metal layer above and beyond the region confined by the optical mode of a semiconductor laser which effectively transports heat away from that region and into the heat sink.","2. Description of the Related Art","Within this application several publications are referenced by Arabic numerals within brackets. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of all these publications in their entireties are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application for the purposes of indicating the background of the invention and illustrating the general state of the art.","During semiconductor laser continuous-wave (cw) operation, significant heat generation occurs within the active region of the semiconductor device. These devices are typically mounted onto temperature-controlled heat sinks to keep them from heating past their maximum operating temperature. Thermal coupling efficiency between the semiconductor laser structure and heat sink plays a significant role in determining the maximum operating temperature of a semiconductor laser (as measured at the heat sink). The technique of mounting the laser epi-side down on a heat sink has conventionally been the most effective method of heat removal in these devices. However, the epi-side down process is more complicated and has a significantly lower yield than the epi-side up process. Therefore, the epi-side up process is the preferred technique for manufacturing these semiconductor devices.","Ridge waveguide semiconductor lasers employ etching techniques to define mesa structures. These mesas improve laser performance by confining injected carriers and optical modes to the same region of space. The mesa is typically etched down through the laser structure's active region or even partially down through the lower cladding region.","Mid-wave (3\u20135 \u03bcm) and long-wave (8\u201312 \u03bcm) infrared (IR) semiconductor diode lasers (SDLs) are needed as sources for several civilian and military applications. These include local and remote chemical sensing, free-space optical communications, IR countermeasures, and IR ladars. For most applications, lasers are required that can operate under cw (or quasi-cw) conditions at ambient temperatures or at temperatures (T) accessible to thermoelectric coolers (T>approximately 240 K).","Despite the huge variety of commercially available SDLs emitting in the near-IR spectral region (\u03bb<approximately 1.6 \u03bcm), the options available at longer wavelengths (greater than approximately 2 \u03bcm) are few, usually unsatisfactory, and progressively worse as the wavelength increases. The technical reason for this circumstance is related to the reduced photon energy and the wavelength dependence of various loss and recombination mechanisms in SDLs. Until recently, there seemed to be little hope for significant increases in the cw operating temperatures of SDLs emitting at wavelengths greater than approximately 3 \u03bcm.","This circumstance changed with the demonstration of the quantum cascade (QC) laser and the type-II interband cascade (IC) laser. Both of these devices use multi-layered III\u2013V semiconductor structures that provide for electronic states between which lasing can occur with emission, in principle, at any wavelength greater than approximately 2.5 \u03bcm (IC) and approximately 3.5 \u03bcm (QC). Using band-gap engineering, they can be designed in ways that substantially reduce the significance of mechanisms (including Auger recombination) that plague more conventional SDLs. Moreover, the active regions of these lasers are cascaded in series allowing for a more effective use of applied bias. This leads to quantum efficiencies that can exceed the conventional limit of unity. Both of these attributes have led to the demonstration of improved power conversion efficiencies at the longer wavelengths compared with more conventional SDLs, and to date, encouraging results have been obtained using both designs. Examples of both the QC lasers and IC lasers are well known in the semiconductor industry.","An important additional advantage of the IC design is its use of active regions that rely on interband optical transitions (rather than the intersubband transitions used in the QC laser). This leads to higher radiative efficiencies and significantly reduced threshold currents. Calculations have predicted that IC lasers should be capable of operating under cw conditions up to room temperature with high output powers.","Since its first demonstration, IC laser performance has advanced considerably. Experimental work with these devices has led to IC lasers that have demonstrated high differential external quantum efficiency (>600%) and high peak output power (approximately 6 W\/facet at 80 K). In other conventional designs, high cw wall plug efficiency (>17% at 80 K) and operation at 300 K under pulsed conditions have been obtained.","Despite the achievement of lasing at 300 K, significant issues limiting high-temperature performance remain. Principal among these are the rapid increase of non-radiative processes with increasing active-region temperature (e.g., Auger processes) and the large accumulation of heat in the laser's active region at increased operating temperatures. The latter effect leads to a significant temperature offset, \u0394T, between the heat sink and active region temperatures under cw conditions. For example, in the IC laser that operated at 300 K under pulsed conditions, the maximum cw heat sink temperature was limited to approximately 150 K. This suggests that \u0394T can be quite large. The active\/injection regions of this device are surrounded by short period AlSb\/InAs strained layer superlattice (SLS) regions that form cladding layers required to confine the laser's optical mode. These SLS regions consist of many interfaces (often>700) that impede the flow of heat out of the laser's core region, and they are partly responsible for a large \u0394T.","For most diode lasers, including IC lasers, the behavior of the threshold current density Jwith active region temperature Tfollows the empirical relation J=Jexp(T\/T), where Jand Tare fitting parameters. The heat sink temperature Tis related to Tby T=T+RIV, where R is the device thermal resistance and V and I are the device's cw voltage and current, respectively. Here it is assumed that all dissipated energy goes into heat. One can combine these results to determine, for a given value of the thermal resistance R, the maximum heat sink temperature at which the device will operate under cw conditions.","This leads to T=T[Ln(T\/RVJ))\u22121], where Vis the threshold voltage across the device at the maximum cw operating temperature, and Ris the specific thermal resistance of the device defined by the product of R with A, the device's active region area (cavity length\u00d7mesa width). Examination of this expression shows that the maximum temperature of cw operation can be increased by raising T, the laser's characteristic temperature, and\/or by lowering R, J, and\/or V. These representations are equally valid when applied to the QC laser or any mid-wave or long-wave semiconductor laser where heat removal is essential because of the higher losses that plague the performance of semiconductor lasers at the longer wavelengths.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","130","120","140","100","130","140","120","130","120","100","160","170","180","110","190","100","130","160","170","130"],"sub":["2 ","2 "]},"The conventional sample  is then cleaved and soldered (with uncoated facets, epi-side-up) onto a Cu heat sink , and wires  are bonded to the metal contact .

The method further comprises forming a bonding layer adjacent to the substrate, forming a heat sink adjacent to the bonding layer, and evaporating a second metal layer in between the substrate and the heat sink.","As such, the invention discloses a means for reducing the semiconductor device thermal resistance and consequently the difference in temperature between the device active region and the heat sink. Moreover, the invention can be applied to a QC laser or other semiconductor laser and significant improvements in device performance will result. Moreover, the invention achieves significant reductions in thermal resistance (averaging 25 K\/W or 40% for 1 mm long devices), 80 K cw operation at 3.4 \u03bcm with high-power conversion efficiency (23%) and high differential external quantum efficiency (532%), and cw operation up to 214 K.","These, and other aspects and advantages of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.","The invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","As previously mentioned, there is a need for a new and improved semiconductor device to decrease the thermal resistance of IC lasers mounted in a conventional epi-side-up configuration. The invention provides a semiconductor device  manufactured by beginning with a p-type GaSb substrate  comprising a buffer layer . Then, an n-InAs\/AlSb SLS first cladding layer  is deposited over the buffer layer . Next, an active\/injection region (core region)  is deposited over the first cladding layer . Thereafter, an n-InAs\/AlSb SLS second cladding layer  is deposited over the active region . Next, an etching step occurs whereby portions of the first cladding layer , the active region , and the second cladding layer  are removed to create a defined mesa region .","Then, an insulator layer  is deposited over the mesa region . Next, an Au\/Ti metal contact layer (not shown) is evaporated over the insulator layer . This metal contact layer becomes a thicker electroplated metal layer  upon the deposition of extra metal (preferably gold) over the device . Also, an evaporated metal contact layer  is applied to the underside of the substrate . Next, a bonding layer  (eg. indium) is applied to the evaporated metal contact layer . Finally, a heat sink  (eg. copper, CVD diamond, or other suitable electrical insulating materials) is applied adjacent to the bonding layer . Wire connectors  are also attached to the metal contact . The completed device  is illustrated in .","Moreover, the invention achieves significant reductions in thermal resistance (averaging 25 K\/W or 40% for 1 mm long devices), 80 K cw operation at 3.4 \u03bcm with high-power conversion efficiency (23%) and high differential external quantum efficiency (532%), and cw operation up to 214 K.","Essentially, in order to reduce the thermal resistance of a semiconductor device, the invention performs the following steps. First, in a preferred embodiment the etching used to define the mesa region  is continued down through the lower SLS cladding material . However, the mesa device  does not have to be defined by deep etching. Rather, narrow trenches, which are well known in the art, can be used to define the mesa (laser) . Next, after the Au\/Ti contact is evaporated onto the device , the metal contact is used as an electrode to electroplate (EP) 3 \u03bcm of additional gold over the sample's top contact layer . In other words, the electroplated metal layer  is dimensioned to have a thickness of at least half a thickness of the mesa region . While the preferred thickness of the electroplated metal layer  is 3 \u03bcm, any thickness over 2 \u03bcm can be used. The device  provided by the invention is shown in  with arrows depicting the flow of heat way from the device's active region  illustrating the expected advantage of the invention's fabrication method. The idea is to move heat away from the active region  through the top and sides of the mesa region  and into the highly conducting EP Au layer  so that it can conduct away from the mesa  and down through the substrate  over a wider area than is provided by the conventional devices. Additionally, by removing larger sections of the lower cladding layer , the heat does not have to flow through the low-conductivity cladding, thereby resulting in increased heat flow out of the device .","In order to test the validity of the invention, thermal modeling was performed on structures representing the conventional methods as well as the method provided by the invention.  shows the cross-sectional geometry used for the thermal modeling of the conventional device structures. Only half of the 15 \u03bcm wide mesa chosen for the modeling is shown for ease of understanding. The thermal conductivities used in the modeling were Au: 317; SiO: 1.4; SLS cladding: 3.6; active\/injection region: 4.0; GaSb substrate: ; Indium (In) solder: ; and Cu heat sink: , all measured in W\/m K. The steady-state heat equation was solved for the temperature contours throughout the device structure assuming an applied bias of 7.0V (reasonable for an 18 cascade device emitting near 3.4 \u03bcm) and a current density of 300 A\/cm(corresponding to approximately twenty-five times the 80 K threshold current density for such devices). All of the applied power was dissipated as heat uniformly throughout the laser's active\/injection region. The heat sink was maintained at a fixed temperature, and heat flow was maintained continuously across material interfaces and forced to zero along the device's vertical centerline (by symmetry) and along external boundaries of the mesa and contact layers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},"In addition to these results, the merits of several other fabrication details were assessed using the thermal modeling. For example,  shows the predicted reduction in thermal resistance between the conventional (upper curve) and invention's (lower curve) fabrication methods as a function of mesa width. The relative thermal advantage of the invention's fabrication method is roughly independent of mesa width; the ratio of the new (invention) to old (conventional) thermal resistance drops from 65% to 60% between mesa widths of 4 and 50 \u03bcm.","In order to test the model predictions, an IC laser sample, designated as \u201cM84\u201d, is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a p-type GaSb substrate using well known techniques and using 18 cascaded stages similar to a other designs previously described. Next, mesa devices are fabricated according to the conventional methods.  shows the 80 K, L-I-V characteristics for a shallow etched, thin Au contact device (conventional device) that emits at 3.4 \u03bcm. The performance is shown with a low threshold current of 1.35 mA (corresponding to a threshold current density of 14.3 A\/cm). Initial slope efficiency (calculated between 1.5 and 5.0 mA) equals 0.97 W\/A. Assuming that both facets emit the same power, this corresponds to a differential external quantum efficiency of 532%; i.e., above threshold, approximately 5.3 photons (approximately 0.3 per stage) are emitted for each additional injected electron. The slope efficiency, averages between the threshold current and 20 mA, remains high at 0.86 W\/A, and the device emits 16 mW of optical power from a single facet at 20 mA of current with no sign of saturation at the currents measured. The kink in the I-V characteristic (circled), where the differential resistance drops precipitously, signals the onset of lasing and occurs at a bias of 6.78 V. The theoretical value, when all cascades line up, is equal to 18\u00d7(hc\/\u03bb). This gives a turn-on voltage of 6.56V, leaving a small wasted voltage of 0.22V or voltage efficiency near 96%. At 10 mA of injection current, the power conversion efficiency peaks at 23% (again assuming identical facets).","In order to assess the conventional device's thermal characteristics, pulsed and cw L-I data is taken at a sequence of heat sink temperatures, and threshold currents are determined.  shows the results of these measurements. The pulsed threshold current data fit the empirical relation given earlier while the cw data cannot fit to a straight line. The deviation from the straight-line fit signifies that the active region temperature exceeds the heat sink temperature. The data also shows that this temperature difference increases with increasing heat sink temperature as expected. Assuming that the active region temperature Tdetermines the threshold current density uniquely, a measure of \u0394T=T\u2212T(see ) at a given heat sink temperature allows for a determination of the thermal resistance R; \u0394T is divided by the product of the current and voltage at the same heat sink temperature. This leads to a resistance for this device of 125.4 K\/W. Using this data in the formula for the maximum cw operating temperature, leads to 180.9 K, in good agreement with the measured value of 178 K for the conventional device.","Similar data were taken for 15 other devices falling into two general classes: those fabricated using the conventional method (12 devices with a shallow etch and 3 a thin Au contact) and those fabricated with the inventive method (four devices with a deep etch and a thick EP Au contact). The shallow etch class includes devices with three cavity lengths (nominally equal to 2, 1, and 0.5 mm, respectively), and the deep etch class includes only devices with 1 mm long cavity lengths. The data from these tests containing the inventive fabrication devices all show thermal resistance values between 10 and 25 K\/W lower than that of any similar width conventionally fabricated device with the reduction averaging at approximately 25 K\/W or approximately 40% for all devices (appropriately scaled for cavity length). Moreover, all tested devices fabricated according to the invention operate at higher cw operating temperatures than conventionally fabricated devices of the same width.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["230","295","270","200","270","270"]},"As mentioned, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device , wherein the method, shown in the flow diagram of , comprises depositing  a first cladding layer  adjacent to a substrate , depositing  an active region  adjacent to the first cladding layer , depositing  a second cladding layer  adjacent to the active region , depositing  an insulator layer  around a side portion of the first cladding layer , the active region , and the second cladding layer , and evaporating  an electroplated (or otherwise-deposited) metal layer  adjacent the insulator layer , wherein the metal contact layer  is dimensioned and configured to laterally spread heat away from the semiconductor active region . The method further comprises forming  a bonding layer  adjacent to the substrate , forming  a heat sink  adjacent to the bonding layer , and evaporating  a metal layer  in between the substrate  and the heat sink .","Essentially, according to the invention when IC laser devices are covered with an approximately 3 \u03bcm thick Au layer  above an electrical contact layer (not shown), lateral heat flow is enhanced and device thermal resistances are reduced by an average of approximately 25 K\/W or 40% (1 mm long devices). The thickness of the Au layer  is at least half of the thickness of the active region . Additionally, improved device performances are achieved including cw 80 K power conversion efficiency of 23%, cw differential external quantum efficiency of 532%, and cw lasing up to 214 K.","In other words, to improve the thermal coupling between the active region  of an epi-side up ridge waveguide laser and the heat sink , thick electroplated gold , or other metal, is placed in contact with the exposed side and top surfaces of the etched ridge mesa . A thin dielectric layer  is used to electrically insulate the mesa sidewalls from the metal , and prevent a short circuit through the doped substrate  between the top and bottom metal contacts , , respectively. The thick metal layer  acts as a high thermal conductivity material surrounding the ridge mesa that improves the overall heat transfer out of the structure . Furthermore, the electroplated metal  is made to cover a large area allowing the heat generated within the narrow mesa  to spread over a larger portion of the substrate  at the level of the mesa device. This is an improvement over the typical epi-side up laser process that relies only on vertical heat conduction through the bottom cladding layer , passing into the substrate  through the small area defined by the mesa width. Additionally, the invention enables an increased laser operating temperature for the epi-side up process, which is favored from the manufacturing point of view.","The thermal resistance of any object is inversely proportional to its cross sectional area. Thus, if heat were forced to get to the heat sink only through the bottom of the narrow mesa region, as in the conventional devices, the effective area through which it must pass is the mesa surface area (cavity length\u00d7width). However, by allowing heat to extend beyond the mesa, as the invention provides, the heat can then conduct down through the substrate emanating from a larger effective area (reducing the resistance), thereby effectively working as if the mesa region were wider.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
