{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/143,797 filed Jun. 22, 2008 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field","The methods, systems, objects, features, and advantages of the present invention generally relate to transformer coupled position sensing and simulation thereof. In particular they relate to providing universal sensing, control, and simulation of synchros, resolvers, linear variable differential transformers (LVDT), and rotary variable differential transformers (RVDT).","2. Description of the Related Art","Converting angular rotation or linear displacement to an electrical signal may be performed by an AC transducer. Types of transducers include synchros, resolvers, and linear\/rotary variable differential transformers (LVDTs\/RVDTs). They can be used in a variety of applications, such as an inertial navigation reference unit (gyro or compass), an automatic direction finder (ADF), an omni range system, distance measurement equipment, cockpit indicators, landing-gear positioning and control, various industrial applications, motor control, position detection, machine tool control, oil field exploration, navigation, flight simulation, and many other relative position detection applications.","Synchros, resolvers, LVDTs, and RVDTs have been used in a variety of military and commercial systems for many years, because of the high degree of reliability when difficult environment conditions exist. The simplicity of operation when combined with superior reliability makes these non-contact position sensors a very attractive component of industrial control, operation, simulation and the like. In an example, a resolver or synchro in an automatic direction finder is used to provide an electrical signal that may drive an indicator. As an aircraft turns, the amount of coupling in the transducer changes proportionally. There are many other examples of use of these relative position sensing technologies that populate the known art.","While synchros, resolvers, LVDTs, and RVDTs output an electrical signal, the output signal typically must be converted to a digital signal for processing, and other operations associated with computerized motion sensing, control, simulation and the like. Digital converters are commonly configured with hardware that is tailored to meet voltage and frequency requirements associated with particular synchro, resolver, LVDT, or RVDT implementation specifications. Hardware-tailoring is commonly implemented through selection of certain combinations of electrical components that support the implementation specifications. However, there are a wide variety of implementation specifications across even a single industry, such as avionics. Therefore to offer products that can be sold to even a single customer in a single industry, a converter supplier may have to offer a variety of differently tailored converters. Consequently, each unique implementation requires a correspondingly uniquely tailored converter, resulting in increases in converter ordering complexity, service parts stocking, installation and maintenance procedures, and the like. Also, while hardware-tailored converters may facilitate digital conversion, they cannot be used with different synchro, resolver, LVDT, and\/or RVDT implementations. Therefore as new implementation requirements arise, new hardware-tailored converters must be designed, tested, and offered for sale, thereby slowing down converter customer development cycles. Hardware-tailored converters increase costs throughout the supply chain\u2014including manufacturers, distributors, integrators, customers, maintenance suppliers, and the like. There are certain implementations that hardware-tailored converters cannot support, such as calibration and test. Because the hardware is tailored to a particular implementation specification, determining a degree of calibration within the particular implementation specification cannot be achieved without changing the hardware, such as using a dedicated calibration or test device.","In an example, hardware tailoring may include using differential sensing circuits\u2014such as differential amplifiers to produce a measurable analog signal from the synchro, resolver, LVDT, or RVDT. Signal amplification is quite common in these applications because without a measurable signal, digital conversion is not possible. However, a 4-wire implementation requires different sensing hardware than a 5-wire or a 6-wire implementation. Consequently, even if frequencies and voltages are identical for each of the 4, 5, and 6-wire implementations, uniquely tailored differential sensing circuitry must be provided.","Reduction of power consumption is desirable for improving product reliability, cooling and operational costs, reduction in form factor, among others. Devices and systems that are configured to provide high drive currents demand more power for output driver circuits. Power consumption in high current output drivers is a function of the supply voltage presented to the device, so optimizing the supply voltage based on the output demand may provide a significant reduction in power dissipation of this portion of a system. Output drivers are known to be capable of providing high output current so long as a the supply voltage present exceeds the output signal voltage by at least a minimum threshold that is specified by the driver manufacturer. Therefore, dynamic signal-based power delivery, may ensure robust high current output capabilities while mitigating heat buildup in the vicinity of the output drivers. The following disclosure describes methods and systems for delivering supply voltage(s) to amplifier\/drivers of software controllable outputs that are described herein, wherein the supply voltages maintain the minimum threshold, while minimizing power consumption of the output drivers.","In an aspect of the methods and systems described herein, a method of dynamically powering a software configurable output may include receiving a representation of a signal; determining, based on a software configurable parameter of the software configurable output, an expected amplitude of a driven output of the signal; adjusting a power supply voltage based on the expected amplitude; and providing the power supply voltage to a power supply input of a signal driver for generating the driven output. In the method the software configurable outputs are suitable for providing at least one of rotor excitation signals and simulated stator output signals. Alternatively in the method, adjusting a power supply voltage comprises increasing the power supply voltage if the expected amplitude is greater than a current amplitude. Also, adjusting a power supply voltage comprises decreasing the power supply voltage if the expected amplitude is less than a current amplitude. In the method, receiving a representation of a signal comprises receiving digital waveform data and\/or receiving output control data. Note that the output control data affects one or more of gain, phase shift, and offset of the driven output.","In another aspect of the methods and systems described herein, a method of signal-based powering of a flight simulator signal driver may include providing a flight simulation signal to a signal driver for generating a flight simulator output and controlling a supply voltage for powering the signal driver so that the supply voltage tracks the simulation signal, wherein the supply voltage exceeds an amplitude of the flight simulator output by at least a power supply-to-signal threshold. In the method, controlling a supply voltage comprises generating feedback to a power supply based on the flight simulation signal. Also, the power supply is a DC\/DC power converter. Note that the flight simulator output comprises a simulated stator signal. In the method, controlling a supply voltage comprises determining, based on a change in the flight simulation signal, an expected amplitude of the flight simulator output and adjusting a power supply voltage based on the expected amplitude. Alternatively, controlling a supply voltage is based on output control data that affects one or more of gain, phase shift, and offset of the flight simulator output.","In yet another aspect of the methods and systems described herein, a system for dynamically determining a software configurable output power supply feedback signal may include a processor accessible memory for storing digital waveform data for presenting to a software configurable output; a power supply feedback generation engine for generating a digital representation of the power supply feedback signal based on the digital waveform data; a phase adjust facility for providing the waveform data to the feedback generation engine, wherein the waveform data is provided to the feedback generation engine shifted in time relative to presenting corresponding waveform data to the software configurable output; and a digital-to-analog converter for converting the digital representation of the power supply feedback signal to a signal that is suitable for controlling a power supply output voltage of an adjustable power supply. In the system, the software configurable outputs are suitable for providing at least one of rotor excitation signals and simulated stator output signals. Also, in the system the power supply feedback generation engine generates a digital representation of the feedback signal that indicates to the adjustable power supply to increase the power supply output voltage if the waveform data indicates an increase in amplitude of the software configurable output. The power supply feedback generation engine may also generate a digital representation of the feedback signal that indicates to the adjustable power supply to decrease the power supply output voltage if the waveform data indicates an decrease in amplitude of the software configurable output. In the system, the adjustable power supply is a DC\/DC power converter. Also in the system, the software configurable output is suitable for providing at least one of rotor excitation signals and simulated stator output signals. the system may further include a software configurable output feedback facility for providing a digital representation of the software configurable output to the power supply feedback generation engine.","With the applications of synchros, resolvers, LVDTs, and RVDTs covering a wide range of industries, uses, operating modes, tracking rates, environments, and the like; a wide range of these devices are available to support various implementation specifications. Features, configurations, and operating modes of these devices must support the application needs for avionics, simulation, training, test, measurement, industrial automation, motor control, robotics, navigation, and the like. Similarly, converters that facilitate digital acquisition, control, processing, and management of this wide range of devices in these highly varying applications may require a rich and broad set of features, capabilities, interfaces, and the like.

The platform may support programmable synchro\/resolver output or simulation features such as 3-wire and 4-wire configurations, up to 28 Vrms, and other features.","The example interface and output features described herein do not specifically limit the range of embodiments.

All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.","A position detection interface and control platform may be embodied in a layer structure that may conform to a base layer of an analog input family of products. The platform may be embodied as an attachment to the base layer. The platform may include a plurality of channels, wherein a channel has associated with it one or more input stages, one or more output stages configured so that each channel may function as an isolated multifunctional data acquisition system.","The platform may be implemented as a layer for LVDT\/RVDT type applications and may include a plurality of isolated channels with at least up to a +\/\u221240 volt input range, a plurality of high resolution analog to digital converters (ADCs) operating independently over a wide frequency range including up to at least 330 KHz, input processing logic that automatically calculates position at a rate equal to two times an excitation frequency, a FIFO for storing data such as rotor position and the like, and at least one analog output driven by a high precision digital to analog converter (DAC) operating over a wide frequency range including up to at least 250 KHz that is capable of outputting pre-loaded waveforms with various types of time and phase shift with dynamic offset and gain adjustment.

In embodiments, the digital position detection and simulation platform may provide a high degree of synchro\/resolver accuracy using commercial off the shelf components, such as standard commercial grade devices. In an example 2.6 arc-minutes of accuracy is readily achievable. In fact, accuracies that are ten times greater than this example are possible with the platform.

Each input  may include individual programmable input gain  that may be set individually through software  in a software accessible input configuration register. Input gain  may be programmed for a variety of signal gain values, such as unit gain, 2\u00d7 gain, 5\u00d7 gain, 10\u00d7 gain, other gain values based on the application specification , and the like. The input gain  may facilitate detecting LVDT\/RVDT input signals that otherwise may be too small in amplitude to be properly sampled. In an example, the input gain  may be set to 5\u00d7 for an input signal of amplitude 0.5 Vrms resulting in a gain adjusted input  of 2.5 Vrms. The gain adjusted input  may be sampled by an analog to digital converter , such as a successive approximation register (SAR) converter or other type of converter, which may be controlled through software. Software controls for the analog to digital converter  may include adjustments to calibration values for offset  and gain . In an example, gain  may range from a value of 0 to 2\u00d7 substantially linearly throughout the range based on the value written to a gain  register. Analog to digital converter  may receive a sample clock  that may be based on a reference clock, an internally generated clock, or an externally provided clock. Analog to digital converter  sends converted digital data to at least a zero-cross detection facility  and a moving sum facility .","Inputs may be sampled at a high rate relative to other rates present in a configuration. Inputs may be sampled at 150 KHz or higher, whereas excitation inputs and therefore position and motion sensing signals may be in the range of 4 KHz. The high sample rate may result in very precise sampling of the inputs which may facilitate accurate digital reproduction of the input waveform. In this way, the digitized data that represents the analog input can be analyzed to detect important features such as zero crossing, signal acceleration, phase differences between inputs, and the like. Unlike systems that are based on the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, there is no need for the sampling to have any specific relationship to the signal, therefore a wide variety of input frequencies can be supported by a common set of hardware components. Common mode noise and disturbances can readily be detected and eliminated in the digital data by comparing a plurality of inputs. By performing various digital waveform functions (addition, subtraction, time shifting, and the like), noise and disturbances that affect at least some of the plurality of inputs can be detected and removed. Additionally, due to the very high sample rate, filtering the signal well above its cycle rate (e.g. 4 KHz) results in a sampled signal that eliminates high frequency components from the sampled digital data. Therefore signal noise near the sample rate (e.g. 150 KHz) is filtered out before the signal is sampled. Using these and other well known techniques, signals received from rotors, stators, excitation sources, and other signals related to LVDT\/RVDT applications and simulations are digitally stored and processed by the platform resulting in very high accuracy position detection and simulation reproduction.","A digital sample of the gain adjusted input signal  is evaluated by the zero-cross detection facility . The zero-cross detection facility  may include several software programmable configuration options, such as zero level, enable zero-cross detection, number of samples to average for the purposes of detecting the input signal  had crossed the programmed zero level, direction of zero-cross detection, zero-cross source (input or output signal), enable auto-zero functionality, input signal to detect zero-crossing, and other options associated with detecting a zero crossing. Zero-cross facility  may provide a zero signal  indicative of a when the evaluated signal crosses the programmed zero level. The zero signal  may facilitate notifying other elements of the platform  of a zero crossing event. A zero-cross count facility  may determine information related to one or more zero crossing events. In an example the zero-cross count facility  may track an interval between zero crossing events. The interval between zero crossing events may be based on a reference clock, such as a 33 MHz base clock, and the interval may be a count of the reference clocks between zero crossings.","The digital sample provided by the analog to digital converter facility  may be simultaneously or contemporaneously applied to moving sum facility , wherein a running average of samples may be calculated. The running average of samples may be provided to an ALU  for computing various mathematical functions related to the inputs.","ALU  may receive sampled input data from ALU A and ALU B as well as a separate running average for input A and B from the moving sum facility . The ALU  may perform computations of at least one of the inputs, and the computations may be based on a software programmable option or command that controls at least a portion of the ALU . In an example, the ALU  may perform functions such as (Sa\u2212Sb)\/(Sa+Sb), Sa\/Sb, Sa\/Se, and the like, wherein Sa is a value related to input A, Sb is a value related to input B, and Se is a programmed value. The resultant of the ALU operation may be passed to a user offset function  where a software programmed offset value may be added to the resultant. The offset resultant may then be passed to a user gain function  where the offset resultant can be adjusted by a software programmed user gain value. In an example the software programmed offset value may be a twos-compliment 24 bit value and the software programmed gain value may be a 24 bit binary multiplier. Other values, other types of values and gain and offset functions may alternatively be provided to implement functions associated with position detection. Also the offset function  and gain function  may be optional. One optional embodiment may include programming the offset function  for no offset and\/or the gain function  for no gain thereby making the gain function  and\/or the offset function  optionally applied during position detection or simulation.","Input processing associated with the digital position detection and simulation platform  may include passing the offset and gain adjusted resultant to a position detection function , an averaging function , or both. Additionally, because user offset  and user gain  are optional, ALU  resultant may be provided to the position detection function , the averaging function , or both.","The averaging function  may facilitate averaging\/decimating samples by adding them together and then shifting the added samples to perform a decimating function. The averaging function  may generate resultant data that may be stored, at least temporarily, in a FIFO memory . The FIFO memory  may include sample time stamp data, raw sample value data, calibrated value data, averaged position, Sa and or Sb, raw ADC  output data, and the like. The FIFO memory  may be accessed by a host computer or controller over the bus  through the base layer  if needed.","Position detection function  may process data received from one or more of the ALU , user offset , user gain , average function , and FIFO  to determine status of the position of the LVDT\/RVDT. Determining status may include comparing received data to one or more thresholds such as a maximum position, a minimum position, and the like. Each of the thresholds or comparison values may be software programmable. Additionally, the position detection function  may be software programmed to select the inputs to process, the data types being provided in the inputs, and the like. In an example, software programmability of the position detection function  may be beneficial in that detecting a position for raw ALU  data values may involve different processing than detecting a position of user calibrated (offset and\/or gain adjusted) data.","Position detection function  may signal input interrupt function  to generate an interrupt signal that may be detectable through the bus  by software running on the controller and\/or a host computer. Software processing of the interrupt signal may include reading data from the FIFO memory , adjusting values of one or more software programmable options, features, and registers of the digital position detection and simulation platform, and the like. Interrupts may also be generated based on status, such as calibrated data being ready in the FIFO , the FIFO  being empty, above a threshold, FIFO full, position above a maximum or other reference position value, position below a minimum or other low reference value, within a range, and the like.","Referring to , an input data flow chart for an embodiment of the input functionality described above and depicted in , LVDT\/RVDT data flow  may include receiving an LVDT\/RVDT output signal and in step  applying an input gain to the received signal. Following step , step  may result in the gain adjusted received input signal being digitally sampled. In step  a moving average of the digitally sampled input signal may be calculated. Step , which may be performed in parallel with step , may result in detecting a zero-crossing of the LVDT\/RVDT output signal. After steps  and , step  may perform various ALU functions and optionally may apply a user offset and gain function to the ALU resultant. The resultant is further processed at step  where it may be averaged and\/or decimated based on requirements. In step , the data processed in step  may be stored in a FIFO or similar memory from which hit may be accessed and processed as in step  to detect the position of the LVDT\/RVDT system relative to one or more thresholds. Also in step , one or more interrupts may be generated based on computations related to the position, the FIFO status, zero crossing, and the like. The LVDT\/RVDT input data flow may conclude with a variety of data associated with the data flow being retrieved from the FIFO at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":"102"},"The digital position detection and simulation platform  may receive signals from a synchro or resolver, such as through input A, B, C, and D.

In an example, the input gain  may be set to 5\u00d7 for an input signal of amplitude 0.5 Vrms resulting in a gain adjusted input  of 2.5 Vrms. The gain adjusted input  may be sampled by an analog to digital converter , such as a successive approximation register (SAR) converter or other type of converter, which may be controlled through software. Software controls for the analog to digital converter  may include adjustments to calibration values for offset  and gain . In an example, gain  may range from a value of 0 to 2\u00d7 substantially linearly throughout the range based on the value written to a gain  register. Analog to digital converter  may receive a sample clock  that may be based on a reference clock, an internally generated clock, or an externally provided clock. Analog to digital converters  for each of the inputs send converted digital samples to at least a zero-cross detection facility  and a moving sum facility .","Synchro and resolver inputs may be sampled at a high rate relative to other rates present in a configuration. Inputs may be sampled at 150 KHz or higher, whereas excitation inputs and therefore position and motion sensing signals may be in the range of 4 KHz. The high sample rate may result in very precise sampling of the inputs which may facilitate accurate digital reproduction of the input waveform. In this way, the digitized data that represents the analog input can be analyzed to detect important features such as zero crossing, signal acceleration, phase differences between inputs, and the like. Unlike systems that are based on the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, there is no need for the sampling to have any specific relationship to the signal, therefore a wide variety of input frequencies can be supported by a common set of hardware components. Common mode noise and disturbances can readily be detected and eliminated in the digital data by comparing a plurality of inputs. By performing various digital waveform functions (addition, subtraction, time shifting, and the like), noise and disturbances that affect at least some of the plurality of inputs can be detected and removed. Additionally, due to the very high sample rate, filtering the signal well above its cycle rate (e.g. 4 KHz) results in a sampled signal that eliminates high frequency components from the sampled digital data. Therefore signal noise near the sample rate (e.g. 150 KHz) is filtered out before the signal is sampled. Using these and other well known techniques, signals received from rotors, stators, excitation sources, and other signals related to synchro\/resolver applications and simulations are digitally stored and processed by the platform resulting in very high accuracy position detection and simulation reproduction.","A digital sample of the gain adjusted input signal  is evaluated by the zero-cross detection facility . The zero-cross detection facility  may include several software programmable configuration options, such as zero level, enable zero-cross detection, number of samples to average for the purposes of detecting the input signal  had crossed the programmed zero level, direction of zero-cross detection, zero-cross source (input or output signal), enable auto-zero functionality, input signal (A, B, C, D) to detect zero-crossing, and other options associated with detecting a zero crossing. Zero-cross facility  may provide a zero signal  indicative of a when the evaluated signal crosses the programmed zero level. The zero signal  may facilitate notifying other elements of the platform  of a zero crossing event. A zero-cross count facility  may determine information related to one or more zero crossing events. In an example the zero-cross count facility  may track an interval between zero crossing events. The interval between zero crossing events may be based on a reference clock, such as a 33 MHz base clock, and the interval may be a count of the reference clocks between zero crossings.","The digital samples from each of the analog to digital converter facilities  may also be applied to a moving sum facility , wherein a running average of the digital samples may be calculated. Each sample from each of the inputs may be included in the running average. A phase delay function  may provide control input to the moving sum facility  to account for phase differences among the inputs. In an example, a phase difference between an excitation signal and stator output signals may be measured by differences in the digital samples of each signal. The resulting difference may be used to determine a control or adjustment to align the samples that are summed by the moving sum facility . The running average of samples may be provided to a tangent function  for computing various angular functions related to the inputs.","Tangent function  may receive sampled input data from each of the analog to digital converters  as well as the running average from the moving sum facility . The tangent function  may perform computations of at least the inputs and the computations may be based on a software programmable option or command that controls at least a portion of the tangent function . In an example, the tangent function  may calculate a tangent depending on the current angle determined from the input A, B, C, and D. The resultant of the tangent function  may be passed to an angle restore function  where programmed logic may restore the angle and calculate synchro\/resolver acceleration.","Synchro angle restore function  may include an angle computation that may begin with a cosine computation, such as for 240 degrees phase and 0 degrees phase conditions. After cosine conversion, additional angle related calculations may be performed. Computations may be executed using an all-integer arctangent algorithm that allows accurate angle position detection based on integer only arithmetic. In an embodiment, calculations may include the following polynomial conversion that represents the basic function ATAN(ABS(SIN\/COS)):\n\n0.03181599289720.950551425796+3.86835495723\/(8.054755229 51+39.4241153441\/(2.08140771798\u22120.277672591210\/(8.27402153865+95.3157060344\/(10.5910515515))))\n","where y=2*x\u22121 and x is tangent of the target angle and x in [0,1].","Although the selected polynomial may only directly recover angles in the range of 0 degrees to 45 degrees, it can be used as a base for very efficient and fast computations of other angles. An arctangent recovery method that uses the selected polynomial method may provide unique benefits in that it facilitates direct calculation of any angle by extending the use of the base polynomial to a full 360 degrees without requiring lookup tables that require greater processing speed and\/or much more data storage. The following chart shows how the base polynomial is applied to calculate different angles by applying an appropriate recovery factor to the polynomial. The recovery factor applied to the polynomial is based at least on conditions associated with the angle. In the chart below, the conditions include only the sign of the sine (Sin) and cosine (Cos) and their relative absolute values. By evaluating these simple conditions, the arctangent recovery algorithm (that comprises the base polynomial and a recovery factor) can be quickly computed. In embodiments, the base polynomial can be calculated independently of the recovery factor conditions and the resultant of the base polynomial calculated can be adjusted by the recovery factor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Angle (degrees)","Conditions","Arctangent recovery"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20020 . . . 45","Sin > 0","Cos > 0","|Sin| <= |Cos|","ATAN(ABS(SIN\/COS))"]},{"entry":["45 . . . 90","Sin > 0","Cos > 0","|Sin| > |Cos|","PI( )\/2 \u2212 ATAN(ABS(COS\/SIN))"]},{"entry":["\u200290 . . . 135","Sin > 0","Cos < 0","|Sin| > |Cos|","PI( )\/2 + ATAN(ABS(COS\/SIN))"]},{"entry":["135 . . . 180","Sin >= 0","Cos =< 0","|Sin| <= |Cos|","PI( ) \u2212 ATAN(ABS(SIN\/COS))"]},{"entry":["180 . . . 225","Sin < 0","Cos < 0","|Sin| <= |Cos|","PI( ) + ATAN(ABS(SIN\/COS))"]},{"entry":["225 . . . 270","Sin < 0","Cos < 0","|Sin| > |Cos|","3*PI( )\/2 \u2212 ATAN(ABS(COS\/SIN))"]},{"entry":["270 . . . 315","Sin < 0","Cos > 0","|Sin| > |Cos|","3*PI( )\/2 + ATAN(ABS(COS\/SIN))"]},{"entry":["315-360","Sin < 0","Cos > 0","|Sin| <= |Cos|","2*PI( ) \u2212 ATAN(ABS(SIN\/COS))"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In embodiments, the computations to recover the angle using angle restore function  may provide a low error angle. In an example maximum error of the recovered angle is approximately 4 arcsec when computed using a 16-bit scaling coefficient and 32-bit arithmetic. In another example, maximum error may be approximately 1 arcmin using a 13-bit scaling coefficient and 24-bit arithmetic.","The tangent function  may generate resultant data that may be stored, at least temporarily, in a FIFO memory . The FIFO memory  may include sample time stamp data, raw sample value data, calibrated value data, averaged position, Sa\/Sb\/Sc\/Sd, raw ADC  output data, and the like. The FIFO memory  may be accessed by a host computer or controller over the bus  through the base layer  if needed.","Interrupt function  may process data received from one or more of the tangent facility , restore angle function , and FIFO  to determine status of the angular position of the synchro and\/or resolver. Determining status may include comparing received data to one or more thresholds such as a maximum position, a minimum position, maximum acceleration, loss of traction, and the like. Each of the thresholds or comparison values may be software programmable. Additionally, the interrupt function  may be software programmed to select the inputs to process, the data types being provided in the inputs, and the like. In an example, software programmability of the interrupt function  may be beneficial in that detecting a position for raw tangent function  data values may involve different processing than detecting acceleration. Because acceleration is continuously being measured, not only can it be a condition for status related actions, but the measurement may facilitate anticipating loss of friction and thereby provide feedback to a control system that may take action to prevent loss of traction.","Input interrupt function  to generate an interrupt signal that may be detectable through the bus  by software running on the controller and\/or a host computer. Software processing of the interrupt signal may include reading data from the FIFO memory , adjusting values of one or more software programmable options, features, and registers of the digital position detection and simulation platform, and the like. Interrupts may also be generated based on status, such as for example; calibrated data being ready in the FIFO , the FIFO  being empty, above a threshold, FIFO full, position above a maximum or other reference position value, acceleration above a maximum, position below a minimum or other low reference value, within a range, and the like.","Referring to , an input data flow chart for an embodiment of the input functionality described above and depicted in , synchro\/resolver data flow  may include receiving synchro\/resolver output signals in step  and applying an input gain to each received signal. Following step , step  may result in the gain adjusted received input signals being digitally sampled. In step  a moving average of all of the digitally sampled input signals may be calculated. The moving average calculation in step  may include a phase delay component to facilitate adjusting for phase differences among the digitally sampled inputs. Step , which may be performed in parallel with step , may result in detecting a zero-crossing of the synchro\/resolver signals. After steps  and , step  may generate a tangent resultant based on a determined angle or angular position of the inputs. The resultant is further processed at step  where the determined angle may be restored and an acceleration of the inputs may be determined. In step , the data processed in step  may be stored in a FIFO or similar memory from which it may be accessed and processed as in step  to detect a position or acceleration of the synchro\/resolver relative to one or more thresholds. Also in step , one or more interrupts may be generated based on computations related to the position, the FIFO status, zero crossing, acceleration, and the like. The synchro\/resolver input data flow may conclude with a variety of data associated with the data flow being retrieved from the FIFO at step .","The platform may include various input configurations as described in  for receiving signals associated with synchros, resolvers, LVDTs, and RVDTs, in operational, test, simulation, or combination modes. The platform  may also include one or more output configurations for driving a plurality of output signals including driving simulation signals based on the application objectives.  depicts an exemplary output stage  of the platform. The output stage  may support programmability to adjust the operation, functions, features, performance, and logical configuration of elements in and outputs provided by the output stage . The output stage  may be programmed and\/or configured using software, such as software .","Output stage  may provide data to one or more of outputs  based on one or more clock sources. The output stage  may also process the one or more clock sources, such as to generate clocks that have configurable relative phase relationships for two or more of the outputs . Each output  generated by the output stage  may be independently clocked, groups of outputs  may be commonly clocked, each output  may be clocked based off of a common clock source that may be processed differently for each output , and other combinations of clock sources, processed clocks, externally clocked sources, and the like may be applied to one or more outputs. Output clock sources may include a reference sources, such as a locally generated 24 MHz or 33 MHz clock, an externally provided clock, a clock derived from one or more input stage signals from  or , including Zero (, ) and\/or Count (, ), and the like. A derived clock may be an automatically detected and processed to divide the 24 or 33 MHz reference clock based on the period measurement represented by the Zero and\/or Count signals that are provided by the analog input subsystem. The derived clock may be produced by a clock derivative facility , such as a phase lock loop type circuit. An output clock may also be software generated. Software executing on a processor or controller may cause the output clock to change state directly under software control. In this way output signals may be clocked based on a variety of clock sources, relationships, and the like to meet application specifications and needs.","A signal for each output  may be generated by a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) . In an exemplary embodiment, quad DAC AD5664 from Analog Devices Corporation may provide analog signals for up to four outputs . Each output  may include dedicated software configurable offset and gain registers, depicted by element  \u201cCALIBRATE\u201d in . In an example, an offset register associated with an output  may be programmed and used as a 16-bit twos-compliment integer. In the example, a gain register may be programmed and used as a 16-bit integer that facilitates adjusting output gain from approximately 0 to approximately 2. In this example, when the gain register is programmed with a value of 0, the gain is approximately 0 and the output signal will be approximately 0. Further in this example, when the gain register is programmed with 0x7FFF (or optionally 0x8000), the gain is approximately 1 or unity gain. When the gain register is programmed to 0xFFFF, the gain is approximately 2 or twice what it is when the gain register is programmed with 0x7FFF or 0x8000.","Continuing to refer to , DAC engine  provides output configuration and control features such as a state machine that may check for an over\/under condition against a valid range for value programmed into the calibration offset and gain registers . When an over condition is detected, the gain or offset registers provide 0xFFFF to the DAC and when an under condition is detected, the gain or offset registers provide a 0x0000 value. This may ensure that the DAC is not improperly operated which may cause damage to the device, damage to a connected device, distorted output signals, and other undesired defects and\/or errors such as phase reversion. This results in a more stable and reliably operating system under unexpected conditions. Additionally, the platform  may include DAC power consumption circuits that provide a signal when a DAC power consumption exceeds a threshold. In embodiments, a circuit that may provide monitoring and threshold signaling includes a series resistor in the DAC power line that is paralleled with an LED or optocoupler that transmits light when the current draw of the DAC generates a voltage across the series resistor that exceeds the turn on voltage for the LED\/optocoupler. The LED output can be monitored by an optical sensor to generate a logic signal that can be used to generate an interrupt.","The output stage  may be configured so that two of the outputs  may be linked to provide an output signal that has a maximum voltage range that is twice that of a single output  (e.g. a double-span differential output). In this way, the output stage  offers performance flexibility and features that may be needed to comply with any of a synchro, resolver, LVDT, RVDT, or simulation application. By connecting two outputs  in series, the resulting linked output can generate voltages twice that of either of the two linked outputs if operated individually. In an example the output stage  may include four outputs: 0, 1, 2, 3. In the example, outputs 0-1 and 2-3 may be linked. In addition to providing features to facilitate linking outputs , the output stage  may include alternate gain registers that may provide gain control to two or more outputs . In an embodiment that includes one or more of the alternate gain registers, programming the alternate gain registers to 0x8000 will result in the alternate gain register effectively being disabled by providing unity gain to the two associated outputs .","Output DACs  may receive digital data to be converted from a variety of sources associated with the output stage  including, without limitation: a direct write register, a direct output register, an output FIFO , a waveform generation facility , and various combinations of these sources. There may be one or more than one of each of the aforementioned digital data sources for each of the outputs . Any of the digital data sources may be shared among two or more of the DACs . The direct write register(s) may facilitate providing a digital value to each of the DACs . The direct write register may facilitate providing the data simultaneously to each DAC . In an example, the direct write registers may be 32 bit registers. Bits  through  of the register may be configured to be provided to each of the DACs  for conversion to an analog output. Bits  through  may be transferred to each DAC simultaneously when bit  is written to a logical value of 1. In this way bit  may be used as a signal to update all of the DACs . The direct output register may allow software programming of a digital value that is provided directly to the DAC  for conversion to an analog signal. In an embodiment, the direct output register is a 22 bit register.","Output FIFO  may temporarily store data that may affect the output . The data temporarily stored in the FIFO  may include digital data for conversion to an analog signal, simulation commands, and the like. Data in the FIFO  may be sequenced out to the DAC  based on a FIFO clock that is provided by a FIFO Clock facility . The FIFO clock facility  may provide a clock to the FIFO  that is derived from one or more inputs that may include an internal reference clock, an externally supplied clock, the signals Zero (, ) and Count (, ). The FIFO clock facility  may be configured by software that may be used to select the clock source, the mode of generating the FIFO clock, and the like. The FIFO  may alternatively be clocked by using software to access a FIFO clock register. In an example, the internal reference clock may be a derivative of a 24 MHz or a 33 MHz clock reference available to various elements of the platform . The externally supplied clock that is input to the FIFO clock facility  may be received by the platform  through a different interface connection than the externally supplied clock that is input to the clock derivative facility . The FIFO  may operate as a first-in-first-out memory. In an example, the FIFO  may include 256 memory locations. The FIFO clock and the DAC clock may be synchronized so that data stored in the FIFO is delivered to the direct output register in proper phase with the DAC clock so that the DAC  converts a new FIFO data value with each DAC clock event.","In embodiments, the FIFO  may include a plurality of separate channels that may be separately clocked. The separate channels may include a channel for waveform data and a channel for conversion control data. Conversion control data may include gain control, phase control, offset control, and the like. While the waveform data channel may be clocked at a rate that provides an accurate representation of a simulation or excitation waveform, the control data channel may be clocked at a different rate, such as a rate equal to a single cycle of the desired signal. In this way control of the conversion by the conversion data can be adjusted as desired independently of or synchronized with the waveform data FIFO. In an example, offset control data in a conversion control data FIFO channel may be changed at the start of an output waveform cycle. The offset change may be synchronized with the output waveform cycle so that the offset change occurs when the output waveform is at a zero voltage output, thereby allowing the offset to be changed without inappropriately disrupting the generated waveform. Alternatively, a plurality of FIFOs  may be used to provide waveform data and control. Waveform data may be accessed in one of the plurality of FIFOs  and control data may be accessed in another of the plurality of FIFOs . Each FIFO may be separately clocked as described above for separately clocking channels of a FIFO.","The waveform generation facility  may facilitate providing pre-loaded waveforms for digitization and output. The pre-loaded waveforms may be used to generate outputs for linked outputs as herein described. Any two sets of linked outputs (e.g. linked outputs 0-1 and 2-3) may have a relative phase offset. The relative phase offset may be derived from a phase adjust facility  and may be represented as an index in the pre-loaded waveform. Additionally, certain configurations can begin sequencing the pre-loaded waveform from the index based on an event, such as an input signal zero crossing event. Software may facilitate configuring the waveform generation facility  to support indexing, time delay, combinations of indexing and time delay, and the like. In an example of combining indexing and time delay, a pre-loaded waveform may hold 256 samples and time delay may be configurable in 1 uS increments. The phase adjust facility  may apply a received or specified index offset of 6 samples and a time delay of 14 us so that the waveform cycle may begin a total of 6 sample clocks plus 14 us after an excitation input zero crossing is detected. The waveform generation facility  may be clocked by the clock derivative facility  as herein described. Clock sources that may be used to provide a clock to the waveform generation facility  may include software access, 24 MHz or 33 MHz, a derivation of 24 MHz or 33 MHz, an externally provides clock, an auto-detected clock, and the like. In an example of auto-detected clock operation, each zero-crossing event on an input to the platform  may cause the waveform to be restarted at its index.","The waveform generation facility  and the FIFO  may be operated in a coordinated manner, such as during simulation operation. When operated in a coordinated manner, waveform generation facility  output data may be directed to the DAC direct output register, whereas the FIFO  outputs may be directed to the offset and gain calibration  registers. As a result, a change in phase or gain of an affected output may take place in an automated and coordinated manner so that each new data from the waveform generation facility  may be associated with a new gain and\/or offset to be converted by the DAC . Optionally, the data in the FIFO that is directed to the offset and gain calibration  registers, may be held so that any change associated with the data is delayed until the index of the output waveform is equal to zero.","The phase-adjust facility  may also facilitate determining and maintaining a desired phase relationship between: two sets of linked outputs, an output or linked output pair and an input to the platform , and other combinations of inputs and outputs The phase-adjust facility  may also help with maintaining a preconfigured phase delay based on a count of microseconds. In an embodiment, phase-adjust facility  may provide a time based phase delay up to 250 ms).","The output stage  may also include an interrupt capability that may be provided by an interrupt facility  that provides an interrupt to a system component such as a controller or other device associated with the platform .

An LVDT\/RVDT product may support four secondary pairs through software configurable inputs, four excitation output pairs, four simulation output pairs, digital filtering, armature control support, and the like.

The platform provides multi-channel interface sensing and control and may facilitate multi-speed applications by performing coarse detection on one channel and fine detection on another.","The methods and systems of the platform  may be beneficially and productively employed in a variety of markets including avionics, flight simulation, airborne control, shipboard control and sensing, navigation (e.g. inertial reference, gyro, compass, automatic direction finders), radar, robotics, oil field exploration, motor control and commutation, machine tool control, process control, antenna positioning, data acquisition, fire control, aero space programs, production test, calibration, and the like. Avionics may further include avionics test, jet engine control, cockpit indicators, landing gear positioning & control, flap actuators, and simulation which may benefit from a significant reduction in wiring related costs for high value areas such as design, materials, installation, maintenance, and the like.","The platform  may facilitate flight simulation, test, and measurement. Flight and flight simulation applications typically include one or more common excitation sources for position sensing devices and indicators. Simulation, test, and measurement in such applications may be required to support the common external excitation while conforming to the specific performance criteria of devices that are being simulated, tested, and or measured. In an example of flight simulation, the platform  may receive external excitation on an input . The platform  samples the excitation as herein described and determines, among other attributes, a count of reference clocks for each complete cycle of the excitation input. Using the facilities and functions of the position detection and simulation facility  of the platform  at least a simulation output clock is derived from the excitation input. The platform  may factor in measured drift, and the like present in the excitation input to be included in or at least influence the simulated output. In the example, the simulation output clock may be adjusted according to the measured drift of the excitation signal from one cycle to another so that the simulated output signals reflect real-world responses to the changes present in the excitation signal. Coordinated with the excitation signal, an output waveform simulating a real-world device such as an LVDT\/RVDT, synchro, resolver, and the like may be generated.","The simulated output may include at least a phase offset relative to the excitation signal to reflect real-world delays associated with signal transmission through an aircraft, device delays, and the like. A simulator for an older model aircraft that uses synchros and resolvers designed and produced decades earlier, may require substantially different phase shift response and performance than a simulator for a current production aircraft. The programmability and flexibility of configuration of the platform  makes possible support for these potentially very different real-world situations without changing, tailoring, or reconfiguring hardware on the platform. Similarly, devices within a single aircraft simulator may need to be simulated with very different performance characteristics. A single embodiment of the platform  may be produced and used for these different applications because of the high degree of configuration and operational flexibility inherent in the platform .","The signals that are output from a position and angle digital detection and simulation system as described herein may benefit from dynamic signal-based power delivery. In particular the signals being output are generated or controlled by the system and therefore can be efficiently and effectively used to control supply voltage being provided to each individual output driver. In some embodiments of the system, the system drives a plurality of sinusoidal signals that are synchronized so each is always driving in phase or is one-hundred-eighty degrees out of phase. In these embodiments, the synchronous signals zero crossing is consistent so active control of the power rails for the output buffers could be applied simultaneously across a plurality of outputs. Therefore, whether dynamic signal-based supply voltage delivery is conducted for a positive power rail, each of a positive and negative power rail, for a single output driver, for several output drivers, or individually for a plurality of output drivers, each supply voltage delivery may be based on a signal that is being provided to an output driver.","In one embodiment, we take advantage of features of commonly available DC\/DC converters that generate the supply voltage (DC\/DC converter output) based on a signal presented to the converter. This signal is generally known as an output feedback signal to help in stabilizing the output as a result of load changes, and the like. Most common off-the-shelf (COTS) DC\/DC converters are active devices that operate internally at greater than a megahertz to convert an input DC voltage to an output DC voltage. Therefore, by actively controlling the \u2018feedback\u2019 signal provided to the DC\/DC converter, the DC signal output from the converter (which can be provided as a DC supply voltage to one or more high current output drivers) should be able to be dynamically and rapidly changed. To provide active control of the DC\/DC converter feedback signal that ensures that the DC output that is delivered to one more of voltage supply inputs of a high current signal driver maintains sufficient head room above the resulting signal being output from the signal driver, some information about the signal being output may be required, such as frequency, slew rate, peak output voltage (positive and\/or negative), DC offset, and the like.","In an embodiment, a 1.2 MHz operating frequency DC\/DC converter provides an output adjustment response rate that can readily match at least a 1 KHZ sinusoidal signal based on a DC\/DC feedback signal with a frequency of change of approximately 250 KHz. Providing feedback to the DC\/DC converter at a rate that is much higher than the signal being delivered to the power driver\/amplifier facilitates requesting small, incremental changes in the supply voltage out of the DC\/DC converter while enabling a slew rate that is much greater than the signal primary 1 KHz frequency. Generally an embodiment as described herein facilitates signal-based amplifier\/driver supply voltage control based on any signal that is substantially sinusoidal.","If the signal that is provided to the amplifier\/driver is well known and therefore highly predictable, and\/or if it can be sampled prior to being fed into the amplifier\/driver, then a DC\/DC converter feedback control function may be generated by circuitry or software that predicts, samples, or generates the signal to be amplified.","In the position and angle digital detection and simulation system described herein, because the signal(s) to be amplified\/driven that are provided to the output buffer are generated by logic that is under the control of the system (e.g. a state machine in an FPGA), a circuit that generates a feedback control function for conversion (e.g. D\/A) to an active feedback signal for the DC\/DC controller can be built into the logic (e.g. as a function of the FPGA). A separate control signal may be generated for each individual output based on frequency and slew rate characteristics being generated in the FPGA.","An example of FPGA-based information that may facilitate generating a DC\/DC converter feedback control signal may be found in one or more portions of the output logic  as described herein with respect to at least . In an example, waveform generation facility  may provide essential information about the shape of a waveform that may be delivered to one of the DAC  circuits to further be driven\/amplified by one of the outputs . The output system described in respect to  may include outputs  which may be software controllable outputs. These outputs  may include one or more high current driver\/amplifiers as described herein that, when controlled through the signal-based supply voltage control methods and systems described herein, may benefit from the power consumption reduction of such supply voltage control methods. Further in an example of using the waveform generation facility , which may provide digital waveform data to the FIFO , the FIFO  may be adapted to provide a DC\/DC feedback control output signal from an earlier tap than the tap that provides the digital waveform to the DAC engine  for the output signal(s). Other potential sources of data or information that may be used to generate a DC\/DC converter feedback control signal in  clude channel conversion control data such as the current gain value, phase value, offset value, and the like for each software programmable output . These and other software programmable output capabilities are described herein.","Referring to  which depicts an embodiment of generating a DC\/DC converter feedback control signal, an output sub-system that is similar to that depicted in  incorporates dynamic power control features that also leverage the output subsystem features of the  that are described herein. Therefore, the differences between  are presented here. DC control output driver  may provide a signal that is suitable for connecting to the feedback input of COTS DC\/DC converters such as LT1935 by Linear Technology and others. A digital to analog converter DAC  may receive a digital signal from DAC engine  and convert it to an analog signal that meets the requirements for providing feedback to a COTS DC\/DC converter. DAC Engine  may operate similarly to DAC engine  as described herein but may further integrate output signal digital waveform data from waveform facility  to generate a control signal that takes into account response time of a COTS DC\/DC converter for providing power to one or more outputs . The waveform data provided from waveform facility  may be identified (e.g. addressed) by DC Phase adjust facility . Phase adjust facility  may provide a phase adjust of the waveform data provided to DAC engine  relative to the waveform data that is delivered to DAC engine . This may allow the DC control facility  to present a feedback signal to a COTS DC\/DC converter so that the feedback signal precedes the output signal  with sufficient time offset to ensure that the DC\/DC converter adjusts the DC power to the output driver (e.g. output ) to maintain the necessary headroom above the amplitude of the signal being output from the driver.","A basic objective to achieve low power consumption is to ensure that the DC\/DC converter output (which is input to the amplifier\/driver supply voltage power rails) tracks the signal that is input to the amplifier\/driver with a small phase offset\/shift that ensures the supply voltage available to the amplifier\/driver is sufficient for it to provide the power needed based on the output signal amplitude and load. Because this offset is based on the DC\/DC converter response rate to changes in the feedback signal, there might be a calibration or at least characterization process that is executed during production, during setup of the position and angle digital detection and simulation system, at power up of the system, or through a dynamic calibration capability that may be built into a DC\/DC converter feedback signal circuit. Such a calibration function may be needed to set the proper offset\/phase shift between the control signal and the signal being amplified\/driven. This offset may be implemented in the phase adjust facility  to enable software based control of the phase shift between the DC\/DC converter feedback control signal and the signal being amplified\/driven.","In one embodiment a single DC\/DC converter can be controlled to provide both positive and negative supply voltage to a plurality of outputs. This may be sufficient for a system in which the plurality of output signals are synchronized with common zero-crossing events. Two DC\/DC converters for each output amplifier\/driver can facilitate independent control of positive and negative supply voltages. This may facilitate having the DC\/DC output that provides the positive supply voltage to the amplifier\/driver tracking the positive voltage excursions of the output signal and the DC\/DC output that provides the negative supply voltage to the amplifier\/driver tracking the negative voltage excursions of the output signal. Requirements for the power supply voltage provided out of each DC\/DC converter may be represented as an equation:\n\nDC\/DC Out+=Max(lim+,out+headroom)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nDC\/DC Out\u2212=Min(lim\u2212,out\u2212headroom)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","By operating the signal amplifier\/driver just above the minimum supply voltage needed to ensure low signal distortion and noise injection during signal amplification (e.g. to achieve high quality amplifier performance) such a dynamic supply voltage control method and system may facilitate achieving amplifier class B, C or D efficiency with nearly amplifier class A linearity response and output drive quality.","Another embodiment of the dynamic supply voltage control capability may include integrating such functionality into an output driver component so that the power consumption saving benefits may be provided to any implementation that requires high current signal amplification\/driving. The result may be an integrated device which is an intelligent power saving amplifier\/driver.","Referring to , an integrated power saving output driver device is depicted that embodies aspects of the dynamic supply voltage control capability described herein. Power saving output driver  includes a supply control circuit  that senses the signal in  and signal out  feedback signal provided by feedback facility . The supply control facility  generates control signal(s) for a positive rail voltage control facility  and for a negative rail voltage control facility . Each of the voltage control facilities ( and ) independently provide sufficient supply voltage to output driver  to enable outputting a signal out  with a desired peak signal amplitude while conserving power drawn by the device .","Supply control facility  may detect an amplitude change on the signal in  that correlates to a change in amplitude of the signal out  (a typical output amplifier\/driver function). The supply control facility  may further detect the amplitude of the signal out  through feedback facility  that may sense the signal out  and provide a representation of the signal out . The signal out  representative signal may include adjustments in amplitude, phase, or other parameters. These adjustments may be based on factors related to controlling the power that is supplied to the positive and\/or negative power rail of the output driver . An exemplary factor may be related to the response time of the voltage control facilities ( and ), and the like. Supply control facility  may determine an adjustment factor independently for each of the positive supply voltage and the negative supply voltage that is to be provided to the output driver  so that the supply voltage provided thereto exceeds the signal out  amplitude by a margin that is sufficient to ensure proper drive capability and operation of the output driver  and of the device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0201","num":"0200"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1402","1404","1408","1410","1410","1404","1412","1408","1410","1408","1404"]},"The elements depicted in flow charts and block diagrams throughout the figures imply logical boundaries between the elements.
