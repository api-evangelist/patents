{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This patent claims priority as a divisional patent to U.S. Non-provisional patent application Ser. No. 09\/555,840 (filed Jul. 24, 2000), now U.S. Pat. No. 6,604,980 which, in turn, claims priority as a national-phase application of PCT Patent Application No. PCT\/US98\/25776 (Int'l Filing Date Dec. 4, 1998; WIPO Int'l Publ. No. WO 99\/29384; Int'l Publ. Date Jun. 17, 1999 (in English)), which, in turn, claims priority to U.S. Non-provisional patent application Ser. No. 08\/986,835 (filed Dec. 8, 1997) which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,428,321.","This invention broadly relates to the field of simulated parenting. More specifically, the invention relates to infant simulators used in educational programs for educating prospective parents about the realities of parenthood and assisting in the education and training of personnel in the child-care field.","Teen-age pregnancy is an ever increasing problem. Teen-age parents, surveyed as to why they elected to have a baby, gave such reasons as \u201cbabies are so cute,\u201d \u201cI wanted attention,\u201d and \u201cI needed someone to love and love me back.\u201d Such romantic feelings toward having a baby almost never include an understanding of the responsibilities imposed by a baby, including loss of sleep, loss of freedom, the need for constant attention, etc. Attempts to educate teen-agers about the trials and tribulations of caring for an infant and raising a child, using the traditional educational methods of lectures and readings, are rarely successful.","Some resourceful educators, realizing that traditional educational methods are inadequate, have attempted to demonstrate the care requirements of an infant by requiring students to carry a sack of flour, an egg or a plant for several days. While somewhat exemplary of the care requirements of an infant, such programs do not fairly represent the care requirements of an actual infant and have proven to be of limited success.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,190,038 issued to Kardon, U.S. Pat. No. 3,490,170 issued to Wolf, U.S. Pat. No. 3,514,899 issued to Bonanno et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,115,948 issued to Burks and U.S. Pat. No. 5,094,644 issued to Kelley describe dolls that will wet a diaper after being fed from a bottle. The dolls described in Kardon and Wolf each include electrical circuitry capable of initiating crying when a diaper on the doll is sufficiently wetted after being fed from a bottle, and terminating such crying upon removal of the wetted diaper. Similarly, the doll described in Bonanno et al. further includes electrical circuitry capable of initiating crying when the doll is diapered and a bottle is removed from the mouth of the doll, and terminating such crying by removing the diaper from the doll. Such dolls are not useful for educating students about the trials and tribulations of caring for an infant as the feeding and wetting cycle, with or without crying, is under control of the user. The student, unless under constant supervision by an educator, can feed and change the doll on a schedule selected by the student.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,249,338 issued to Wexler discloses a doll which emits a crying sound when a manually operated switch is actuated. The user must then determine which of several switches, labeled with such actions as feeding, diaper changing or back patting, will turn off the crying sound. While interesting as a plaything, this doll suffers from the same drawback as the \u201cfeed and wet\u201d dolls in that activation of crying is under control of the user. The student, unless under constant supervision by an educator, can activate crying on a schedule selected by the student.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,451,911 issued to Klose et al. discloses a doll which can operate in two different modes. In a first mode, the doll emits different sounds based upon which of several switches, located at various positions on the body of the doll, is actuated (e.g., actuation of the mouth switch produces \u201cyum-yum,\u201d while actuation of the back switch produces \u201caahh\u201d). In a second mode the doll emits a sound and the user must then determine which of the switches will turn off the crying sound and produce a satisfaction signal, such as \u201cmommy.\u201d The user can deactivate the doll by pressing a specified switch on the doll or simply failing to activate the proper switch within a given time period. Again, while interesting as a plaything, this doll suffers from the same drawback as the \u201cfeed and wet\u201d dolls in that activation and deactivation of the doll is under control of the user. The student, unless under constant supervision by an educator, can activate and deactivate the doll on a schedule selected by the student.","A particularly useful infant simulator system for use in educating students about the care requirements of an infant is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,388 issued to Jurmain et al. and assigned to the assignee of this application. The patent discloses an infant simulator capable of crying at intervals, with the crying continuing until a care key is inserted into the infant simulator and continuously held in position against a biasing means for a defined time period. The crying schedule may be changed to simulate a healthy, sick or ideal infant. A tremblor may be included to cause the infant to shake at intervals for purposes of simulating a drug-affected infant. The infant simulator can also include indicators showing rough handling, improper positioning and the detection of a loud sound. The care key may include a means for securing the key to an assigned individual.","While the infant simulator described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,388 and sold under the trademark BTIO\u00ae has proven extremely useful as an educational tool, a continuing need exists for an improved infant simulator capable of realistically demonstrating the variety of needs and care requirements of an infant, as well as the positive aspects of caring for and loving an infant.","The infant simulator includes a variety of features designed to emulate the care requirements of an infant. The infant simulator can be designed and programmed with any combination of the described features, including the ability to selectively activate and deactivate individual features for each assignment period. The infant simulator is equipped to record and report the quality of care and responsiveness of a person caring for the infant simulator and\/or signal the person caring for the infant simulator when care is required.","The features can be conveniently grouped into the categories of (i) environmental events, (ii) demand events, and (iii) ancillary features.","Environmental Events","Indirectly Induced","Temperature Sensor","Infants should not be exposed to temperature extremes. The infant simulator can be equipped with a temperature sensor capable of sensing the environmental temperatures to which the infant simulator is exposed.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is further equipped with a system for recording and reporting the sensed temperature. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is further equipped with a system for generating a perceptible thermal exposure signal when the sensed temperature falls above or below a defined acceptable temperature range. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the person caring for the infant simulator is advised when the environmental temperature has reached an unacceptable level, and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Smoke Detector","Infants should not be exposed to smoke. The infant simulator can be equipped with a smoke detector capable of sensing environmental smoke from such sources as a bonfire, fireplace, cigarette, cigar, or pipe.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for recording and reporting instances of detected exposures to smoke. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for generating a perceptible smoke exposure signal when smoke is detected. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is advised when smoke is detected and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Sunlight Sensor","Infants should not be exposed to direct sunlight. The eyes of an infant cannot accommodate the intensity of direct sunlight, nor can the skin of an infant withstand any significant exposure to the sun without irritating the skin. The infant simulator can be equipped with a light sensor capable of sensing direct exposure to sunlight.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for recording and reporting instances when the simulator is exposed to direct sunlight (i.e., light having an illuminance exceeding a defined threshold value such as 2,000 foot-candles.). In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for generating a perceptible sunlight exposure signal when the simulator is exposed to direct sunlight. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is advised when the infant is being exposed to direct sunlight and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Loud Noise Sensor","Infants should not be exposed to loud noises. The ears of an infant cannot accommodate loud noises such as experienced when proximately exposed to airplane engines during takeoff, firecrackers, firetruck sirens, loud rock music, shouting, screaming, etc. The infant simulator can be equipped with a sound sensor capable of sensing loud noises.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for recording and reporting instances when the simulator is exposed to loud noises (i.e., noise exceeding a defined threshold value such as about 80 decibels.). In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for generating a perceptible loud sound exposure signal when the simulator is exposed to an excessively loud sound. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is advised when the infant is being exposed to excessive levels of noise and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Overstimulation","Infants can be overstimulated by prolonged periods of auditory and\/or visual stimulation and\/or movement. The infant simulator can be equipped with a sound and\/or motion detector for sensing prolonged exposure to noise and\/or prolonged periods of movement.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for recording and reporting instances of overstimulation. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for generating a perceptible overstimulation signal when overstimulation is sensed. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is advised when overstimulation has occurred and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Directly Induced","Infants must be handled with care at all times and should never be intentionally or unintentionally dropped, shaken, squeezed, struck or otherwise physically harmed. Two of the more prevalent abuses are the result of a frustrated care provider shaking and\/or squeezing the infant; usually shaking the body while allowing the appendages to flop back-and-forth, and\/or squeezing the infant's arm, leg or head. The infant simulator can be equipped with (i) an impact sensor capable of sensing a potentially injurious impact upon the infant simulator indicative of being dropped, shaken or struck, and\/or (ii) a compression sensor capable of sensing potentially injurious compression of the infant simulator.","Impact Sensor","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for recording and reporting an abusive impact. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for generating a perceptible impact distress signal when abusive impact is sensed. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is immediately notified that they have injured the infant simulator, and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","The infant simulator is preferably equipped with multiple impact sensors and\/or provided with appropriate programming so as to allow the infant simulator to differentiate between (i) a single impact indicative of a single intentional or unintentional strike or fall, and (ii) rapid multiple impacts indicative of intentional striking or shaking of the infant simulator.","Compression Sensor","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a compression sensor and a system for recording and reporting the sensed compression. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is further equipped with a system for generating a perceptible distress signal when compression is sensed. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is immediately notified that they have injured the infant simulator, and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Position Sensor","An infant should sleep and rest while lying on its back or side. An infant should rarely lie face down or be hung upside down. The infant simulator can be equipped with a position sensor capable of sensing the vertical and horizontal positioning of the infant simulator.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is further equipped with a system for recording and reporting the sensed positioning. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is further equipped with a system for generating a perceptible positioning distress signal when the infant simulator is improperly positioned. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is advised when the infant is improperly positioned, and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","Diaper Sensor","Infants should usually be diapered during most of the day, with the exception of certain limited activities such as bathing. Hence, a realistic simulation should require that the infant simulator remain diapered throughout the assignment period.","In a first embodiment, the infant simulator is equipped with a system for recording and reporting the sensed absence of a diaper on the infant simulator. In a second embodiment, the infant simulator is further equipped with a system for generating a perceptible missing-diaper signal when the infant simulator is not diapered. A preferred embodiment combines both the recording\/reporting and signaling systems so that the student caring for the infant simulator is advised when the infant is not diapered, and the recorded information can be reviewed by a program administrator upon completion of the assignment.","More specifically, the infant simulator can be equipped with (i) a sensor for detecting the presence and absence of a diaper on the infant simulator, (ii) a system in communication with the diaper sensor for generating a perceptible missing diaper signal when the diaper sensor detects a prolonged (e.g., greater than twenty minutes) absence of a diaper on the infant simulator, (iii) a system in communication with the missing diaper signal generating system for arresting the diaper-missing signal in response to receipt of a diaper-present satisfaction signal, and (iv) a diaper configured and arranged to be fitted over the lower torso of the infant simulator as a diaper, with the diaper having a means effective for being detected by the diaper sensor and transmitting the diaper-present satisfaction signal to the diaper-missing signal arresting system when the diaper is fitted on the infant simulator.","Demand Events","Diaper Change","Infants require periodic diaper changes. A realistic simulation of a diaper change should include the actual changing of a diaper. By requiring a first \u201csoiled\u201d diaper to be removed and a new \u201cclean\u201d diaper placed upon the infant simulator, the person caring for the infant simulator learns that you must carry an extra diaper at all times, and gains a more complete understanding of the requirements of an actual diaper change (e.g., a person carrying the infant simulator into a restaurant would, assuming some level of modesty and etiquette, take the infant simulator to the rest room to change the diaper).","The infant simulator can be equipped with (i) a system for generating a perceptible diaper-change signal, (ii) a system in communication with the diaper-change signal generating system for arresting the diaper-change signal in response to receipt of a diaper-change satisfaction signal, and (iii) a diaper configured and arranged to be fitted over the lower torso of the infant simulator as a diaper, with the diaper having a means effective for transmitting the diaper-change satisfaction signal to the diaper-change signal arresting system when the diaper is fitted on the infant simulator.","The infant simulator can further be equipped with a system for measuring, recording and reporting the number and duration of each diaper-change episode (i.e., the number of times the perceptible diaper-change signal is generated and the time periods between initiation of the perceptible diaper-change signal and completion of a diaper change effective for transmitting the diaper-change satisfaction signal.)","Rocking","Infants often like to be gently rocked. Parents and other care providers will often rock an infant when the infant is fidgety or fussy, or when the person simply wants to comfort the infant. A realistic simulation of rocking should require actual rocking of the infant simulator.","The infant simulator can be equipped with (i) a system for generating a perceptible rocking-request signal, and (ii) a system in communication with the rocking-request signal generating system for detecting rocking of the infant simulator and arresting the rocking-request signal when rocking is detected.","The infant simulator can further be equipped with a system for measuring, recording and reporting the number and\/or duration of rocking-request episodes (i.e., the number of times the perceptible rocking-request signal is generated and the time periods between initiation of the perceptible rocking-request signal and the commencement of rocking.)","Feeding with Burp","Infants must be regularly fed. A realistic simulation of a feeding should require both feeding and burping of the infant simulator. In order to accurately emulate a feeding, the infant simulator can be equipped with both a feeding-request module and a burping-request module, with the burping-request module requiring actual patting of the infant simulator.","The feeding module can include (i) a system for generating a perceptible feeding-request signal, (ii) a system in communication with the feeding-request signal generating system for arresting the feeding-request signal in response to receipt of a feeding signal, and (iii) a device for transmitting the feeding signal to the feeding-request signal arresting system when placed in communicative proximity to the infant simulator whereby the feeding-request signal is arrested.","The burping module can include (i) a system for generating a perceptible burping-request signal, (ii) a system for initiating generation of the burping-request signal in communication with both the feeding-request module and the burping-request signal generating system for initiating generation of the burping-request signal after the feeding signal is received by the feeding-request module, and (iii) a system in communication with the burping-request signal generating system for detecting patting of the infant simulator and arresting the burping-request signal when patting is detected.","The infant simulator can further be equipped with a means for individually or separately measuring, recording and reporting the number and\/or duration of each feeding-request episode (i.e., the number of times the perceptible feeding-request signal is generated and the time periods between initiation of the perceptible feeding-request signal and the commencement of feeding) and each burping-request episode (i.e., the number of times the perceptible burping-request signal is generated and the time periods between initiation of the perceptible burping-request signal and the commencement of patting.)","Fussy and Demand Events","Infants will occasionally fuss for one reason or another and, despite every effort by the parent or other care-provider, cannot be comforted. In such situations, the infant tends to continue fussing until the unknown cause of the fussing dissipates of its own accord. In order to accurately emulate the frustration encountered by parents and other care-providers in such situations, the infant simulator can be equipped with a demand event module (e.g., a diaper-change module, a rocking module, a feeding module, etc.) and a fussing module, wherein only the demand event module is capable of being satisfied.","The demand event module can include (i) a system for generating a perceptible demand signal, (ii) a system in communication with the demand signal generating system for arresting the demand signal in response to receipt of a satisfaction signal, and (iii) a device for transmitting the satisfaction signal to the demand signal arresting system when placed in communicative proximity to the infant simulator whereby the demand signal is arrested.","The fussing module can include (i) a system for generating a perceptible fussing signal, (ii) a fussing interval timer in communication with the fussing signal generating system for initiating generation of the fussing signal at intervals; and (iii) a fussing duration timer in communication with the fussing signal generating system for terminating generation of the fussing signal at the end of a fussing period.","Since the fussing module does not include a system capable of arresting the fussing signal, the fussing signal will necessarily continue until the end of the fussing period regardless of the actions of the student.","Rest","Infants need frequent rest periods and naps during which the infant should not be stimulated (e.g., limited movement of the infant and limited noise levels reaching the infant). A realistic simulation of caring for an infant should include rest periods during which interaction with the infant simulator must be minimized (e.g., no movement above a threshold force and no sounds above a threshold decibel level).","The infant simulator can be equipped with (i) a system for generating a perceptible rest-request signal, and (ii) a system in communication with the rest-request signal generating system for detecting resting of the infant simulator (i.e., limited movement and sounds) and arresting the rest-request signal when resting is detected.","The infant simulator can further be equipped with a system for measuring, recording and reporting the number and\/or duration of each rest-request episode (i.e., the number of times the perceptible rest-request signal is generated and the time periods between initiation of the perceptible rest-request signal and the commencement of resting.)","Ancillary Features","The features described below are labeled as ancillary features because they function to enhance performance of an infant simulator exhibiting at least one type of an environmental or demand event. For practical purposes, the disclosed ancillary features are operable in combination with the modules disclosed herein as well as any other modules requiring the student to interact with the infant simulator (i.e., remove the infant simulator from the unacceptable environment or provide the infant simulator with the appropriate satisfaction signal.)","Multiple Behavior Modes Feature","Infants have different care requirements, dependent upon several factors such as the age of the infant, the disposition of the infant, the level of care historically provided the infant, whether it is daytime or night time, whether the child is sick or healthy, etc. For example, some infants will sleep continuously for several hours at night, while others will wake almost every hour and require some type of attention. In order to emulate the different care requirements of infants, the infant simulator can be equipped to (i) permit a program administrator to select between several programming options which require different types and\/or levels of care, and\/or (ii) change the behavior of the infant simulator during the course of an assignment period due to such factors as time of day, sickness, or level of care provided by the student.","Selected at the Beginning of an Assignment Period","Age","The care requirements of an infant change as they age. For example, newborn infants generally require more frequent care than a six month old infant. In order to emulate the different care requirements of infants as they age, the infant simulator can be equipped to permit a program administrator to select between several programs which require different age appropriate types of care. In a preferred embodiment, the types of care can be set to represent the care requirements of a newborn infant, a three month old infant and a six month old infant, thereby allowing the program administrator to change the simulation for each student.","This feature can also enhance a student's sense of participation and involvement in the program by allowing the student to select the age of the infant.","Feeding Method","The care requirements of a breast fed infant are generally different than those of a bottle fed infant. For example, breast fed infants tend to require more frequent feedings and diaper changes, while bottle feeding requires preparation time before and clean-up time after each feeding. In order to emulate the different care requirements of breast fed and bottle fed infants, the infant simulator can be equipped to permit a program administrator to select between a breast fed program and a bottle fed program. In a preferred embodiment, the breast fed program would provide a greater frequency of feeding and diaper change periods, while the bottle fed program would provide for longer feeding and diaper change periods. In addition, the breast fed program could require that feeding occur in a private location (e.g., feeding can only be provided with limited noise levels), while the bottle fed program could require morning and\/or evening attendance periods, designed to simulate the time required to prepare the bottles, and\/or the insertion of an actual bottle in order to feed the infant.","This feature can also enhance a student's sense of participation and involvement in the program by allowing the student to select whether to breast feed or bottle feed the infant.","Disposition","Different infants have different care requirements due to the disposition of the infant. These different levels of care can be produced by altering the time interval between demand events (i.e., increase or decrease the number of events occurring within an assignment period) and\/or altering the duration of each demand period (i.e., increase or decrease the length of each period). The different levels of care can be set to represent the care requirements of an easy, an average and a difficult infant, thereby allowing the program administrator to change the simulation for each student.","Occurring During an Assignment Period","Daytime\/Night Time Feature","Infants tend to have different care requirements during the daytime (e.g., between the hours of about 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., more preferably between the core hours of about 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.) and the night time (e.g., between the hours of about 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., more preferably between the core hours of about 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.). As a general matter, night time care requirements are less than daytime requirements, with longer intervals between demand events and shorter demand periods during the night time hours.","In order to emulate the different care requirements of an infant during night time hours, the infant simulator can be equipped with an internal clock, set to the actual time of day, and the microcontroller unit programmed to decrease the duration of demand periods and\/or increase the time intervals between demand events occurring during night time hours.","Historical Level of Care","The infant simulator can be programmed to increase or decrease the level of care required by the infant simulator based upon the level of care provided by the student during an assignment period. For example, failure to provide a satisfaction signal within a defined time limit (e.g., two minutes) for a defined number of consecutive demand events (e.g., three demand events), failure to respond to a single demand event within a demand period, or subjecting the infant simulator to physical abuse, can cause the infant simulator to increase the level of care required from easy to average (e.g., decreasing the time interval between events and\/or increasing the duration of each period).","Sick Period Feature","Infants tend to require additional care when they are sick. In order to emulate the increased care requirements of a sick infant, the infant simulator can be programmed to initiate a sick period, during which the duration of demand periods occurring within the sick period are increased and\/or the time interval between demand periods occurring within the sick period are decreased.","The infant simulator can further be equipped with (i) a system for generating a perceptible sick signal, and (ii) a system for recording and reporting the occurrence of a sick period.","Comatose Feature","The infant simulator can include a sensor and\/or programming to detect severe abuse or neglect rising to the level of a pernicious event (e.g., extreme thermal exposure, abusive compression, an abusive impact, or prolonged failure to feed), measured in terms of the duration and\/or force of the abuse and\/or neglect, and causing the infant simulator to enter into a coma (e.g., recording and reporting of severe abuse\/neglect and cessation of all program functions). The infant simulator can also optionally (i) signal the student to seek immediate medical attention for the comatose infant (e.g., a password or medical care key possessed by a \u201cmedical representative\u201d such as the program administrator) to prevent the infant from dying, and\/or (ii) measure, record and report the occurrence and\/or duration of the medical request episode (i.e., the occurrence of such an incident and the time period between initiation of the perceptible medical attention-request signal and receipt of the medical attention-received signal.)","Contented Signal Feature","The responsibility of caring for an infant can engender the contrasting emotions of fulfillment and frustration. A realistic simulation of caring for an infant should include environmental events, demand events and ancillary features emulating both the positive and negative aspects of caring for an infant.","The infant simulator can be equipped with a contented condition submodule for providing positive feedback to the student when proper care is provided. The contented submodule can include (i) a system for generating a perceptible contented signal, and (ii) a system in communication with a demand event module and the perceptible contented signal generating system for initiating generation of the contented signal after a satisfaction signal has been timely received by the demand event module.","Grace Period Feature","Those caring for an infant cannot be expected to remain within arms reach of the infant at all times, but are expected to remain close enough to promptly respond to the infant. Hence, in order to provide meaningful and realistic information to the program administrator as to the level of care provided by a student caring for the infant simulator, the simulator can be programmed to provide a grace period (e.g., about 1 to 3 minutes, preferably 2 minutes) after the initiation of a demand signal, within which the student can provide the appropriate satisfaction signal and the duration of the demand episode is recorded as zero. The recorded and reported duration of those demand episodes having a duration longer than the grace period can include or exclude the grace period as desired, with the program administrator advised as to the option selected so that they may accurately interpret the recorded and reported data and provide appropriate feedback to the student.","A grace period can also be usefully implemented in connection with certain environmental events (e.g., exposure to unacceptable environmental conditions of temperature, smoke, sunlight or position) where a limited period of exposure (e.g., exposure to cool conditions of between 05-15\u00b0 C. for less than 30 seconds) is generally not harmful to the infant. However, a grace period should not be implemented for those unacceptable environmental conditions capable of immediately resulting in injury to an infant, such as an abusive impact or abusive compression.","In a preferred embodiment, the infant simulator provides the student with a positive signal whenever the student has responded to the demand signal within the grace period, thereby immediately advising the student that they have provided prompt care and the report provided to the program administrator at the end of the assignment period will reflect that the duration of the demand episode was zero.","Identification System Feature","In order for a student to fully appreciate the responsibility of caring for an infant, and for a teacher to provide meaningful feedback to the student, it is important that the student to whom the infant simulator is assigned tend to the comfort, safety and demands of the infant simulator. In other words, it is important that the infant simulator be equipped with some type of system which requires the assigned student to care for the infant simulator, or at least be present when the duties are discharged.","For purposes of ensuring that the assigned student is at least present when the demands of the infant simulator are being satisfied as required by the demand event module, the infant simulator can be equipped with an identification feature including at least, (i) a system for receiving an identification signal personal to the assigned student, and (ii) a system in communication with the identification-signal receiving system and the demand event module effective for preventing arresting of the demand signal until the identification signal is received by the identification-signal receiving system.","Escalating Distress\/Demand Signal Feature","Infants can provide a variety of perceptible signals to parents and other care-providers indicating that an environmental condition is making the infant uncomfortable, or requesting that a need be satisfied. While the most common signal is crying, other signals include fidgeting, fussing, gasping, repeated side-to-side shaking of the head, rubbing of the eyes and face, and whining. In addition, infants will usually escalate the signal over time when the condition continues or the need remains unsatisfied. Hence, a realistic simulation of caring for an infant should provide for an escalation in the strength, intensity and\/or severity of a discomfort, distress or demand signal as the condition\/need remains unsatisfied over time.","An infant simulator having an environmental event module or a demand event module can be further equipped with a system in communication with the module for escalating the perceptible discomfort, distress or demand signal generated by the discomfort, distress or demand signal generating system as the duration of the environmental discomfort period or demand period increases.","In addition, an infant simulator having an environmental event module or a demand event module can also be equipped with a system in communication with the module for de-escalating an escalated perceptible discomfort, distress or demand signal generated by the discomfort, distress or demand signal generating system once the appropriate satisfaction signal has been transmitted to the infant simulator.","Self-Directed Expression","Infants will occasionally generate a sound and\/or action on their own initiative even though they are not seeking any type of interaction with a parent or other care-provider. A myriad of different self-directed expressions are possible, including specifically, but not exclusively, babbling, blinking of the eyes, flailing of the arms and\/or legs, giggling, gurgling, hiccuping, laughing, screaming with joy, sighing, smiling, sneezing, spitting, squinting, sucking fingers and\/or toes, wrinkling-up of the nose, etc.","In order to emulate these self-directed expressions, and enhance the reality of the simulation, the infant simulator can be equipped with a module (hereinafter \u201cexpression module\u201d) capable of periodically generating a self-directed expression without regard to any effort on the part of the student to elicit such an expression.","The expression module comprises a system for periodically generating a perceptible self-directed expression. Since the self-directed expressions will generally be of the type which occurs briefly and is not typically perceived by a parent as requiring satisfaction, the self-directed expression module need not include a system capable of arresting the sound and\/or action.

The mannequin  can be sculpted to depict the skin color and facial features of various ethnic groups including specifically, but not exclusively, African American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and American Indian.","The infant simulator  can include a variety of modules designed to emulate the care requirements of an infant. These modules include (i) a position sensing module , (ii) a temperature sensing module , (iii) a compression sensing module , (iv) a diaper-change module , (v) a rocking module , (vi) a feeding module  with or without an associated burping module , (vii) a fussy module , (viii) an expression module , (ix) a smoke detector module , (x) an impact sensing module , (xi) an overstimulation module , (xii) a rest module , (xiii) a sickness module , and (xiv) a sunlight exposure module .

In addition, the specifics of each event can be adjusted by the use of one or more ancillary features which can be programmed into the central microcontroller unit .","Environmental Events","The environmental conditions of physical abuse (i.e., compression and impact), verbal abuse, improper positioning, overstimulation, exposure to smoke, exposure to direct sunlight, and exposure to temperature extremes can be sensed, signaled, recorded and reported.","Physical Abuse Sensing Systems","Compression","The infant simulator  can be equipped with a compression sensing system  capable of sensing compression of the mannequin , such as squeezing of the mannequin's head , arms  and\/or legs , and communicating any sensed compression to the central microcontroller unit .","Referring to , a compression sensing system  is provided in the head  of the mannequin  for sensing squeezing or striking of the head . The head  is constructed of a pliant material, such as a soft vinyl material, with a normally open electrical circuit  provided within the head . The first contact of the electrical circuit  is a thin layer of conductive material laminated to the inside surface (unnumbered) of the head  such that the conductive material moves in concert with the head  when the head  is deformed The second contact of the electrical circuit  is a cage of conductive material inwardly spaced from the first contact of the electrical circuit . The spacing between the first and second contacts of the normally open electrical circuit  is selected so that the contacts and will engage one another and close the electrical circuit  when the head  is subjected to a compressive force or an impact force reflective of abusive squeezing or striking of the head . Spacing between the first and second contacts should be selected so that the compression sensing system  will consistently sense compressive and impact forces reflective of physical abuse without sensing compressive and impact forces reflective of normal handling. The spacing necessary to achieve these desired sensing parameters is dependent upon a number of factors, including the type of material used to construct the head , the thickness of the material forming the head , the size and shape of the head , the flexibility of the material laminated to the inside surface of the head  to form the first contact , etc. By way of illustration, when the head  is molded from approximately \u00bc inch thick plasticized polyvinyl chloride, and the first contact is a 3 to 4 mil thick aluminum foil, a spacing of approximately \u00bd to 1 inch should generally provide the desired sensing parameters (i.e., consistently sensing compressive and impact forces reflective of abuse without sensing compressive and impact forces reflective of normal handling).","Optionally, a flexible second cage (not shown) comprising a third contact (not shown) could be positioned intermediate the first and second contacts to form a secondary electrical circuit (not shown) with the first contact in electrical communication with the central microcontroller unit . The third contact (not shown) would be constructed of a material sufficiently flexible to permit the first and third (not shown) contacts to engage the second contact when the head  experienced an abusive level of compressive or impact force. When such a secondary electrical circuit (not shown) is employed, the compression sensing system  is capable of sensing different levels of compressive or impact force (e.g., the secondary circuit is closed when a \u201cmild\u201d or \u201clow\u201d compressive or impact force is experienced, while the primary circuit  is closed when an \u201cabusive\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d compressive or impact force is experienced).","In a first embodiment, a recording function within the central microcontroller unit  records sensed compression events for later review by the program administrator. The specific information recorded and reported by the central microcontroller unit  can range from the relatively simple to the complex. For example, the central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to simply record and report the occurrence of at least one sensed abusive compression event during the assignment period.

Such an abuse sensing system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,388 issued to Jurmain et al.","A number of different types and styles of motion sensors  may be effectively used to sense and report physical abuse. One such sensor, capable of providing variable output dependent upon the force of the motion to which the infant simulator  is subjected, is a magnetic field induced shock sensor manufactured by Directed Electronics, Inc. under Part No. 5041C, wherein movement of a magnet, resulting from a corresponding movement of the mannequin , generates an electrical current in an induction coil, with the strength of the electrical current proportional to the speed and distance traveled by the magnet.","An alternative motion sensor \u2032, effective for sensing gentle motions (e.g., rocking and patting), rough handling (e.g., accidental abuse and intentional abuse), as well as position (e.g., right side up or down) is shown in . Briefly, the alternative motion sensor \u2032 comprises a plastic housing  defining a generally spherical chamber  and containing a metal sphere  which is free to move within the chamber  at the slightest accelerative movement of the housing . The housing  is constructed from a material transparent to infrared (IR) light. An element combining an IR light source  and IR phototransistor , such as a QRD1113 element available from QT Optoelectronics or an EE-SY124 element available from Omron, are mounted directly under the housing . The IR light source  shines IR light into the chamber  through the transparent plastic housing , where the light is reflected by the metal sphere  and the reflected IR light received by the phototransistor . Movement of the sphere  within the chamber  changes the amount of IR light reflected to the phototransistor , causing the electrical current flowing through the phototransistor  to fluctuate. If the sphere  is motionless, the reflected light is constant, and the current through the phototransistor  remains constant. Furthermore, when the sphere  is stationary, the sphere  will reflect more light towards the phototransistor  the closer the sphere  is to the IR light source , thereby causing a higher current to flow through the phototransistor . Hence, motion can be sensed by measuring and evaluating fluctuations in the electrical current flowing through the phototransistor , and position can be sensed by measuring and evaluating the amount of current flowing through the phototransistor  when the current is not fluctuating.","The central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to look for five characteristic patterns of current flow through the phototransistor  and equate such patterns with a particular condition as set forth below in Table Three.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0202","num":"0201"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE THREE"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"(CONDITIONS EQUATED WITH CURRENT PATTERN)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CURRENT PATTERN","CONDITION"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Constant Current","Infant Simulator is Motionless."]},{"entry":["Slow and Small Changes","Rocking or Patting of Infant Simulator"]},{"entry":"in Current"},{"entry":["Rapid and Large Changes","Rough Handling of Infant"]},{"entry":"in Current"},{"entry":["High Current Levels","Infant simulator Resting in First Position"]},{"entry":[{},"(e.g., Face Up)"]},{"entry":["Low Current Levels","Infant simulator Resting in Second Position"]},{"entry":[{},"(e.g., Face Down)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Referring generally to , the microcontroller unit  can generally receive and evaluate current changes and high current levels directly from the EE-SY 124 element.

This permits a single motion sensor  to differentiate between a modest force, such as produced by normal handling, rocking and burping of the infant simulator , and excessive force, such as experienced when the infant simulator  is thrown, shaken or otherwise abused. This allows use of the same motion sensor  to sense rocking, patting and abuse. When motion exceeding a defined amplitude is sensed, an electrical physical injury signal is sent to the central microcontroller unit  and an injury event reported.","As a general matter, intentional abuse can, with certain exception, be differentiated from accidental or unintentional abuse based upon the duration of the motion. A singular brief impact (e.g., lasting less than about 2 seconds) is usually indicative of an accidentally or unintentionally imposed injury. Exemplary of such accidental brief abuses are dropping an infant onto the floor or banging an infant's head when entering an automobile. In contrast, multiple impacts over a prolonged period (e.g., more than about 3 seconds) are usually the result of intentional abuse. Exemplary of such intentional prolonged abuses are striking and\/or shaking an infant. While certain exceptions apply to these general statements, as exemplified by throwing an infant against a wall (a brief but intentional abuse) and falling down a flight of stairs while holding an infant (a prolonged but accidental event), separately reporting each of these types of abuse would assist program administrators in providing meaningful feedback to the student and appropriate follow-up training and\/or counseling. An exemplary dual abuse detection and reporting system is shown in connection with the impact sensing module  shown in ","As generally represented in , when a single impact of sufficient force is detected by the motion sensor , the impact sensing module  is activated and, after a short delay of a second or two, the module  checks for any subsequent abusive impacts.

Preferred types of rest-request signals Sinclude sighing, whimpering, fidgeting, blinking and closing of the eyes and combinations thereof.","The time interval between rest periods can be a bounded random variable (e.g., occurring every 20 to 360 minutes) or a predetermined variable (e.g., sequentially occurring at intervals of 20, 120, 360, 180, 90, 30, 120 and 300 minutes). In order to more accurately emulate the care requirements of an actual infant, and prevent students from memorizing the schedule of demand events, it is generally preferred to control the time interval between demand events as a bounded random variable. Alternatively, multiple predefined programs, each providing a different fixed schedule of demand events, can also be realistically employed so long as the students do not know which program has been selected (i.e., the schedule of demand events is random from the perspective of the student) and the number of programs is sufficient to prevent the students from memorizing one or two different schedules and thereafter being able to partially defeat the purpose of the program by ignoring the infant simulator  between scheduled demand events.","Resting can be detected by an absence of motion and\/or sound above a defined threshold value. The motion sensor  described in connection with the rocking module  can be used for sensing motion in connection with the rest module . Similarly, the sound sensor  described in connection with the overstimulation module  can be used for sensing sounds reaching the infant simulator  in connection with the rest module . The motion sensor  and sound sensor  are electrically connected to the central microcontroller unit  wherein the strength of the electrical signal generated by the motion sensor  and sound sensor  can be checked against predefined threshold limitations for ignoring those which are insufficient to disturb a resting infant (e.g., rocking of a moving car or the sound of a television playing in the other room). However, when motion and\/or sound exceeding the threshold value (hereinafter \u201crest disturbing event\u201d) is experienced by the infant simulator  during a rest period, an electrical signal is sent to the central microcontroller unit  and the rest-request signal Sis initiated. Timing of the rest-request episode is also commenced.","The central microcontroller unit  initiates a rest-request event by initiating generation of a perceptible rest-request signal S. In order to arrest the rest-request signal S, the student must place the infant simulator  within an environment where the infant simulator  will not be subjected to a rest disturbing event (e.g., a school counselor's office would generally be acceptable, while a school hallway between classes would generally be unacceptable).","The central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to either terminate or inhibit generation of the rest-request signal Sonce resting (i.e., absence of rest disturbing events) is sensed. When the termination option is selected, the student need only prevent the infant simulator  from being exposed to a rest disturbing event for some minimum time period (e.g., two to ten seconds) sufficient to ensure that resting has been sensed, after which the student may ignore the need for rest since the rest-request signal Swill not begin again.

These different levels of care can be produced by altering (i) the time interval between demand events (i.e., increase or decrease the number of demand events occurring within an assignment period), (ii) altering the duration of each demand period (i.e., increase or decrease the length of each period), and\/or (iii) the threshold values beyond which an environmental event is commenced (e.g., decreasing the acceptable temperature range). The levels of care can be increased and\/or decreased through any number of continuous or stepped levels as desired. A convenient program permits the care level to be selected from amongst an easy level (i.e., long intervals, short demand periods and high threshold values), an average level (i.e., modestly long intervals, alternating long and short demand periods and modest threshold values), and a difficult level (e.g., short intervals, long demand periods and low threshold values).","The disposition of the infant simulator OS set by the program administrator can be recorded and reported.","Automatic Changes","Daytime\/Night Time Feature","Infants tend to have different care requirements during the daytime (e.g., between the hours of about 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., more preferably between the hours of about 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.). and the night time (e.g., between the hours of about 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., more preferably between the hours of about 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.). As a general matter, night time care requirements are less than daytime requirements, with longer intervals between demand events and shorter demand periods during the night time hours, but an increased sensitivity to environmental conditions such as sound and light.","In order to emulate the different care requirements of an infant during daytime and night time hours, the infant simulator  can be equipped with an internal clock (not shown) set to the actual time of day, and programmed to decrease the care requirements of the infant simulator  during the night time hours (stated alternatively, programmed to increase the care requirements of the infant simulator  during the daytime hours) by decreasing the duration of demand periods, increasing the time intervals between demand events and\/or lowering the threshold value for commencement of a loud sound exposure event, during the night time hours. (alternatively, increasing the duration of demand periods, decreasing the time intervals between demand events and\/or expanding the threshold value for commencement of a loud sound exposure event, during the daytime hours).","A perceptible daytime and\/or night time period signal Sis optionally generated at the appropriate time so as to notify the student that the infant simulator  is on a daytime or night time schedule. The central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to generate the perceptible daytime and\/or night time period signal Sonly at the beginning of the appropriate period (i.e., generate a ten second sucking sound when the infant simulator is beginning a daytime schedule and\/or generate a ten second yawning sound when the infant simulator is beginning a night time schedule), or continuously throughout the corresponding daytime and\/or night time period (e.g., an image of a crib is illuminated for the duration of the night time period).","The extent to which the duration of the demand periods are decreased, the time interval between demand events is increased and\/or the sensitivity to sounds is increased during the night time hours can individually be a bounded random variable (e.g., 50% to 200%) or a predetermined variable (e.g., 100%).","Daytime hours should include at least the core hours of 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Night time hours should include at least the core hours of 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. The specific time at which the infant simulator transitions from one schedule to the other is not critical, so long as the core hours fall within the appropriate period. The transition from a daytime to a night time schedule preferably occurs between hours of 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., while the transition from a night time to a daytime schedule preferably occurs between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.","Activation of this feature can be recorded and reported.","Disposition Based Upon","Level of Care Provided by Student","The central microcontroller unit  may be programmed to increase the level of care required by the infant simulator  (i.e., change the disposition of the infant) for a defined time period (e.g., about 1 to 12 hours) based upon the level of care provided by the student during an assignment period. For example, failure to provide a satisfaction signal within two minutes for three consecutive demand events, failure to respond to a single demand signal within a demand period, or subjecting the simulator to physical abuse, causes the infant simulator to increase the level of care required from easy to average for four hours.","Any increases in the level of care initiated by this feature can be recorded and reported.","Sick Period","The central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to effect a sick period, wherein the care requirements of the infant simulator  are increased by (i) increasing the duration of the demand periods occurring within the sick period, (ii) decreasing the time interval between demand events occurring within the sick period, and\/or (iii) adjusting the threshold values beyond which an environmental event is commenced (e.g., decreasing the acceptable temperature range).","The commencement of a sick period can be signaled by the infant simulator  by generation of a perceptible sick signal S, such as the lighting of an image representative of illness (e.g., an Rx symbol), whimpering, fidgeting, etc.","The time interval between sick periods can be a bounded random variable (e.g., occurring every 8 to 72 hours) or a predetermined variable (e.g., sequentially occurring at intervals of 10, 36, 24, 48 and 72 hours). In order to more accurately emulate the care requirements of an actual infant, and prevent students from memorizing the schedule of demand events, it is generally preferred to control the time interval between sick periods as a bounded random variable. Alternatively, multiple predefined programs, each providing a different fixed schedule of sick periods, can also be realistically employed so long as the students do not know which program has been selected (i.e., the schedule of sick periods is random from the perspective of the student) and the number of programs is sufficient to prevent the students from memorizing one or two different schedules and thereafter being able to partially defeat the purpose of the program.","A perceptible sick period signal Sis optionally generated upon commencement of a sick period so as to notify the student that the infant simulator  is ill and will require increased care. The central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to generate the perceptible sick period signal Sonly at the beginning of a sick period (i.e., generate a ten second coughing fit when a sick period is initiated by the central microcontroller unit ), periodically throughout a sick period (e.g., generate a two second cough every ten minutes once a sick period is initiated by the central microcontroller unit ), or continuously throughout a sick period (e.g., an Rx image is illuminated for the duration of the sick period). The end of a sick period can optionally be indicated by the generation of a wellness signal such as prolonged giggling.","The central microcontroller unit  can include a recording function for recording the occurrence of a sick period for informing the program administrator that the student was required to care for a sick infant during the assignment period. The specific information recorded and reported by the central microcontroller unit  can range from simply recording and reporting that at least one sick period occurred during the assignment period, to recording and reporting the total duration of all sick periods occurring during the assignment period.

A comatose state can be simulated in a variety of ways. A preferred method of simulating entry into a comatose state is for the central microcontroller unit  to cease all other interactive functions (e.g., thermal exposure events are no longer recorded, diaper-change signals Sare no longer generated, etc.), and generate a comatose signal Scapable of being satisfied by entry of a password or insertion of a medical care key possessed only by a designated medical representative such as the program administrator), with a failure to obtain the necessary medical care within a defined time (e.g., a medical attention-request period of 30 minutes) resulting in death of the infant simulator  (i.e., recording and reporting death of the infant simulator  and ending the program).","Entry into a comatose state can be recorded and reported.","Contented Signal","The microcontroller unit  may be programmed to provide a positive response + when the student has appropriately responded to a demand signal, (e.g., timely changing a diaper  in response to a diaper-change signal S). The positive response + can be substantially any perceptible signal recognizable as signaling a happy or contented infant, including specifically, but not exclusively audible signals (e.g., cooing or giggling), olfactory signals (e.g., emission of pleasant scent), visual signals (e.g., smiling, or wiggling of the feet), and multimedia signals (e.g., cooing and smiling).","The positive response + can be scheduled to occur immediately upon providing the requested care (e.g., after changing a diaper  in response to a diaper-change signal Sor at the end of a satisfied burping period) or after a defined time delay (e.g., two minutes after changing a diaper  in response to a diaper-change signal Sor between 20 seconds and 2 minutes after a satisfied burping period has ended).","The microcontroller unit  may be programmed to provide the positive response + upon the satisfaction of each and every demand event, only upon the satisfaction of selected demand events, or on some other schedule (e.g., only after every other satisfied demand event, only after satisfied burping and diaper-change events, or a 20% chance of occurring after each satisfied demand event). The microcontroller unit  may also be programmed to provide the positive response +only upon the prompt satisfaction of a demand event (e.g., satisfaction signal provided within two minutes of initiation of demand signal).","A positive response + should not be provided in connection with an environmental event (i.e., thermal exposure signal Sor distress signal S) since satisfaction of such signals is based upon removal of an unpleasant stimuli rather than the comforting satisfaction of a need.","The number of contented signals generated by the infant simulator  can be recorded and reported.","Perceptibly Different Signals","The infant simulator  can provide a perceptible signal for each of a number of different things, selected from (i) an unacceptable environmental condition of abusive compression, impact, improper position, loud sounds, overstimulation, smoke, direct sunlight and temperature extremes, and (ii) the demand events of diaper-change, feeding, burping, fussing, resting and rocking. The perceptible signal generated for each of these things can be the same or different. For example, the perceptible signal generated when the infant simulator  is unacceptably positioned can be a loud cry, while the perceptible signal generated for requesting to be fed can be a whimper. The differences can be significant (e.g., whimpering versus screaming), or subtle (e.g., loud whimpering versus soft crying).","The use of different perceptible signals for different environmental and demand events serves the desired effect of awarding attentive students by informing such students of the specific satisfaction signal required (e.g., a soft cry signals a need to be rocked while whimpering signals a need to change the diaper ). In order to prevent the students from memorizing and sharing such information, the infant simulator  can optionally be equipped with an ability for the program administrator to change the specific perceptible signal to be generated for each event at the beginning of each assignment period.","Grace Period","The infant simulator  can be programmed to provide a grace period (e.g., about 1 to 3 minutes, preferably 2 minutes) after the initiation of a demand signal, within which the student can provide the appropriate satisfaction signal and the duration of the demand episode is recorded as zero. The recorded and reported duration of those demand episodes having a duration longer than the grace period can include or exclude the grace period as desired, with the program administrator advised as to the option selected so that they may accurately interpret the recorded and reported data and provide appropriate feedback to the student.","In a preferred embodiment, the infant simulator  provides the student with a positive signal + whenever the student has responded to the demand signal within the grace period, thereby immediately advising the student that they have provided prompt care and the report provided to the program administrator at the end of the assignment period will reflect that the duration of the demand episode was zero.","Identification System","In order to ensure that the student assigned to care for the infant simulator  is at least present when the demands of the infant simulator  are being satisfied (i.e., either providing the necessary care themselves or securing the necessary care from someone else at the time the demand event is commenced), the infant simulator  can be equipped with an identification system (not shown). The identification system (not shown) would prevent a satisfaction signal (e.g., rocking of the infant simulator ) from arresting the demand signal (e.g., rocking-request signal S) until an identification signal Sis received by the identification system (not shown).","An exemplary identification system (not shown) includes at least, (i) a means for receiving an identification signal Spersonal to the assigned student, and (ii) a means in communication with the identification-signal receiving means (not shown) and the central microcontroller unit  effective for preventing arresting of a demand signal until the identification signal Sis received by the identification-signal receiving means (not shown).","The means for receiving an identification signal Spersonal to the assigned student can be any of a number of systems or devices capable of identifying and responding only to a unique item or characteristic possessed by the assigned student. A nonexhaustive list of such devices includes (i) a fingerprint recognition device (not shown), (ii) a voice recognition device (not shown), and (iii) a keyhole (not shown) accepting a uniquely shaped identification key  attachable to the wrist of the assigned student by a tamper indicating wristband .","Escalating Demand Signal ","The microcontroller unit  may be programmed to escalate the strength, intensity and\/or severity of the perceptible demand signal and distress signals generated by the infant simulator  as the severity of an unacceptable environmental condition increases (e.g., the temperature of the infant simulator  is more than 5\u00b0 C. greater than a maximum allowable temperature) and\/or the duration of a demand episode increases (e.g., the demand episode lasts longer than 10 minutes). The escalation can be effected in a variety of ways dependent upon the specific type of signal. For example, an audible cry can be escalated from a soft cry to a loud cry, or from a cry to a scream. Similarly, a light can be changed from a white to red.","The perceptible demand signal can be escalated through any number of continuous or stepped levels as desired. A simple single stepped escalation\u2014normal to increased\u2014is relatively simple to implement and generally effective for providing the student with appropriate notice that an unacceptable environmental condition or demand event is not being timely satisfied.","In a similar fashion, the microcontroller unit  may be programmed to deescalate the strength, intensity and\/or severity of an escalated perceptible demand signal or distress signal generated by the infant simulator  once the appropriate satisfaction signal has been transmitted to the infant simulator  for purposes of increasing the reality of the simulation (e.g., the infant simulator  immediately decreases an escalated perceptible demand signal from a shriek to a cry upon receipt of the appropriate satisfaction signal, and five minutes later terminates generation of the cry).","Self-Directed Expression Module ","For purposes of emulating the actions of an actual infant and enhancing the reality of the simulation, the central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to effect periodic self-directed expressions E, wherein the infant simulator  provides the student caring for the infant simulator  with interesting and often delightful expressions on a schedule unknown to the student. Self-directed expressions Ecan be interspersed throughout the assignment period as desired for purposes of emulating such occurrences in real life.","Preferred types of self-directed expressions Eare those of the type which are of limited duration (e.g., several seconds) and would typically be perceived by a student as not requiring any satisfaction. Such preferred expressions including specifically, but not exclusively, babbling, blinking of the eyes, giggling, gurgling, hiccuping, laughing, screaming with joy, smiling, squinting, sighing, wrinkling-up of the nose, etc.","The number of self-generated expressions generated during an assignment period can be recorded and reported.","Sound Recording","The environmental event and demand event modules can include a sound recorder  for recording verbal comments and statements made by a student within the proximity of the infant simulator .","In order to provide a recording of useful duration, the sound recorder  should record only when (i) a verbal reaction can be expected from the student (e.g., a three minute period after commencing generation of a demand signal, during a fussy period, or during a pernicious event), and\/or (ii) loud sounds are detected (e.g., yelling, screaming or shouting).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0424","num":"0423"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 21","FIGS. 2"],"i":["a","t ","n","o"],"b":["2","2","210","220","180","460","210","100","190","410"]},"The modules also include each of the ancillary features of comatose state , contented signal , identification system , escalating demand signal , and sound recording  as listed next to each module.

Based upon the program selected, the central microcontroller unit  signals each of the diaper-change , rocking , feeding  and fussing  and resting  modules at the appropriate times to start and stop a corresponding demand event. The central microcontroller unit  also signals the sick infant module  to start and stop a sick period at the appropriate time. The central microcontroller unit  also commences cycling through each of the modules.","Position Module ","The position sensor  detects the position of the infant simulator  as between an acceptable position (e.g., laying on its back or side) and an unacceptable position (e.g., laying face down or upside down) and signals the position module  when the infant simulator  is detected in an unacceptable position.","Referring to , the position module  is bypassed so long as the infant simulator  is in an acceptable position.

The repositioning-request signal Sis generated at the increased intensity thereafter until the infant simulator  is returned to an acceptable position.","Once the infant simulator  is returned to an acceptable position, generation of the repositioning-request signal Sis turned OFF, the occurrence of a repositioning-request event is counted, the duration of time during which the infant simulator  was in an unacceptable position (i.e., the length of time the repositioning-request signal Swas generated) recorded by the recording feature , the repositioning-request period timer is stopped and reset, the intensity of the repositioning-request signal Sis checked and returned to normal if intensified, the bypass signal  is turned back ON, and the position module  is exited.","In order to allow the microcontroller unit  to cycle through the other modules even though the infant simulator  is improperly positioned for a prolonged period of time, the central microcontroller unit  can be programmed to terminate generation of the repositioning-request signal Sand exit the position module  after a defined time period (e.g., 10-60 minutes) even though the infant simulator  remains improperly positioned (not shown in ). Timing of the duration of the improper positioning occurrence can also be terminated, or continued until the infant simulator  is returned to an acceptable positioning.","Temperature Module ","The temperature sensor  measures the temperature of the infant simulator  and signals the temperature module  when the temperature fails outside an acceptable temperature range (i.e., less than 15\u00b0 C. or greater than 35\u00b0 C.).","Referring to , the temperature module  is bypassed so long as the infant simulator  is kept at a temperature within the acceptable temperature range.

When only a single abusive impact is detected by the impact sensor  (i.e., the abuse is a single brief impact) the impact sensor module  enters the dropped infant submodule . In the event that subsequent abusive impacts are detected (i.e., the abuse is prolonged) the impact abuse module  enters the shaken infant submodule .","Dropped Infant Submodule","Upon entering the dropped infant submodule  an impact distress signal Sis generated by means of the demand signal generating feature  embedded within the dropped infant submodule  for some period of time (e.g., 15 minutes) in order to simulate injury to the infant simulator , the occurrence of a \u201cdropped\u201d abuse event is counted by the recording feature , the sound recorder  is stopped, and the impact abuse module  is exited.","Shaken Infant Submodule","Upon entering the shaken infant submodule  the submodule initiates generation of the impact distress signal Sby means of the demand signal generating feature  embedded within the dropped infant submodule , starts timing the duration of the abuse, counts the occurrence of a \u201cshaken\u201d abuse event by means of the recording feature , and continues to monitor the infant simulator  for continued impacts.","If further impacts are not sensed then the impact distress signal Sis generated for some period of time (e.g., 30 minutes) in order to simulate injury to the infant simulator , the abuse event timer is stopped and reset, the sound recorder  is stopped, and the impact abuse module  is exited.","If further impacts are sensed and the duration of the abusive impacts exceeds a predetermined time value x (e.g., 5 seconds), the impact abuse module  increases the intensity of the impact distress signal Sby means of the escalating demand feature  embedded within the impact abuse module .

The microcontroller unit  then calculates the percentage (n\/x) of sample periods s in which motion has been detected (n) for the most recent subset x (e.g., 60) of sample periods s. When this percentage (n\/x) exceeds a predetermined activation threshold value (e.g., 95%) an overstimulation indicator is turned ON and communicated to the overstimulation module .

In those cases where the feeding-request satisfaction signal Stwas not being received by the feeding module  at the end of the feeding period, including those cases where the feeding-request satisfaction signal Stwas never received by the feeding module , the feeding-request signal Sis turned OFF, the length of the feeding-request or supplemental feeding-request episode is recorded by the recording feature , the timer for timing the duration of the feeding-request episode is stopped and reset, the intensity of the feeding-request signal Sis checked and returned to normal if intensified, the identification switch Swis turned back OFF, and the feeding module  is exited. The contented signal + is not generated when the feeding module  is exited in the latter manner.","Burping Module ","During each feeding-request period, a burp switch Swis turned ON when the identification signal Sand feeding-request satisfaction Stsignals are received. The burp switch Swremains ON so long as the feeding-request satisfaction signal Stis continuously received by the feeding module  during the feeding-request period. In the event that the identification signal Sand feeding-request satisfaction Stsignals are never received by the feeding module , or the feeding-request satisfaction signal Stis interrupted and is not being received by the feeding module  when the feeding-request period ends, the burp switch Swis turned OFF.","Burping-request periods can be initiated immediately after the end of a satisfied feeding-request period or after a defined delay timed from the end of a satisfied feeding-request period. When a delay is provided between the end of a satisfied feeding-request period and the initiation of a burping-request period, the length of the delay is preferably selected so as to emulate the burping needs of an actual infant. By way of example, when the delays are a predetermined value, the delays are preferably between about 0 to 30 minutes, and when the delays are bounded random variables, the delays are preferably between about 0 to 30 minutes, with a statistical preference for delays of between approximately 2 and 10 minutes.","Similarly, the duration of each burping-request period is preferably selected so as to emulate the length of time an actual infant would need to be burped. By way of example, when the duration of a burping-request period is a predetermined value, the duration of each burping-request period is preferably between about 2 to 60 minutes, and when the duration of a burping-request period is a bounded random variable, the duration of each burping-request period is preferably between about 2 to 60 minutes with a statistical preference for a duration of between approximately 5 and 20 minutes.","Referring to , the burping module  is bypassed when the burping switch Swis OFF (i.e., the infant simulator  does not want to be burped when the infant simulator  was not properly fed). However, when the burping switch Swis ON, a burping-request event is commenced, a burping-request episode is counted by the recording feature , and the burping switch Swswitched OFF. The burping module  then initiates generation of the burping-request signal Sby means of the demand signal generating feature  embedded within the burping module , starts timing the duration of the burping-request episode by timing the length of time the burping-request signal Sis generated, starts sound recorder  for a defined period of time (e.g., 3 to 5 minutes) in order to record any verbal reaction by the student, and turns the positive signal switch Sw OFF unless the switch is already OFF.","As with the rocking-request period and the feeding-request period, the central microcontroller unit  controls the duration of each burping-request period by transmitting a termination signal to the burping module  after the desired time period y has lapsed.","In order to end a burping-request episode before the entire burping-request period has elapsed, the burping module  must receive both an identification signal S(e.g., insertion of an identification key  attached to the wrist of the assigned student by a tamper indicating wristband ) and a burping-request satisfaction signal St(e.g., patting of the infant simulator ). For the embodiment depicted in , the identification Sand burping-request satisfaction Stsignals may be received in any sequence and do not need to be transmitted simultaneously. However, the burping-request satisfaction signal Stmust be continuously received throughout the burping-request period to prevent initiation of a secondary burping-request episode in which the burping-request signal Sis turned back ON, the duration of the supplemental burping-request episode timed, and the positive signal switch Sw turned back OFF. Upon initiation of a secondary burping-request episode, the duration of the burping-request period may optionally be restarted (i.e., T7 reset to 0 minutes).","As shown in , the identification requirement is controlled by the identification system feature  embedded within the burping module . The identification system feature  prevents access to the episode termination operations (i.e., turning OFF the burping-request signal Sand terminating timing of the burping-request episode) by bypassing the satisfaction option until the identification signal Shas been received and the identification switch Swhas been turned ON.","If the identification signal Sand the burping-request satisfaction signal Stare not received within a given time limit x, as measured by the length of time the burping-request signal Shas been generated, the burping module  increases the intensity of the burping-request signal Sby means of the escalating demand feature  embedded within the burping module . The burping-request signal Sis generated at the increased intensity for the remainder of the burping-request episode (i.e., until the identification signal Sand the burping-request satisfaction signal Stare received or the end of the burping-request period is reached).","Upon receiving the identification Sand the burping-request satisfaction Stsignals, the burping-request signal Sis turned OFF, the length of the burping-request episode recorded by the recording feature , the timer for timing the duration of the burping-request episode stopped and reset, the intensity of the burping-request signal Schecked and returned to normal if intensified, and the positive signal switch Sw turned ON unless already turned on.","As with the rocking module  and the feeding module , the burping module  requires that the burping-request satisfaction signal Stcontinue to be transmitted to the burping module  for the entire duration of the burping-request period. Failure to continuously provide the burping-request satisfaction signal Stthroughout the entire burping-request period causes the burping module  to reinitiate generation of the burping-request signal S, start timing the duration of the secondary burping-request episode, turn the sound recorder  back on for a second defined period of time, and turn the positive signal switch Sw OFF.","The duration of a secondary burping-request episode can be recorded and reported in a number of different ways, including, by way of example (i) recording and reporting a secondary burping-request episode as just another burping-request episode, (ii) separately recording and reporting primary and secondary burping-request episodes according to type of episode, (iii) adding the duration of a secondary burping-request episode to the recorded duration of the corresponding primary burping-request episode, etc.","In order to end a secondary burping-request episode before the end of the burping-request period, the burping-request satisfaction signal Stmust once again be received by the burping module . It is not necessary to retransmit the identification signal Sas the identification switch Swremains ON until the burping period has ended, regardless of the status of the burping-request satisfaction signal St.","When the end of the burping-request period is reached, the burping module  performs one of two different sets of operations depending upon the final status of the burping-request satisfaction signal St. In those cases where the burping-request satisfaction signal Stwas being received by the burping module  at the end of the burping-request period, a contented signal + is generated (e.g., a soft \u201ccooing\u201d sound), the identification switch SWis turned back OFF, and the burping module  is exited. In those cases where the burping-request satisfaction signal Stwas not being received by the burping module  at the end of the burping period, including those cases where the burping-request satisfaction signal Stwas never received by the burping module , the burping-request signal Sis turned OFF, the length of the burping-request or supplemental burping-request episode is recorded by the recording feature , the timer for timing the duration of the burping-request episode is stopped and reset, the intensity of the burping-request signal Sis checked and returned to normal if intensified, the identification switch Swis turned back OFF, and the burping module  is exited. The contented signal + is not generated when the burping module  is exited in the latter manner.","Fussy Module ","The central microcontroller unit  periodically commences a fussy period and communicates the commencement of a fussy period to the fussy module . The program also controls the duration of each fussy period by transmitting a termination signal to the fussy module  after the desired time period y has lapsed.","The duration of each fussy period is preferably selected so as to emulate the length of time an actual infant would tend to fuss. By way of example, when the duration of a fussy period is a predetermined value, the duration of fussy period is preferably between about 5 to 20 minutes, and when the duration of a fussy period is a bounded random variable, the duration of each fussy period is preferably between about 2 to 60 minutes with a statistical preference for a duration of about 5 to 20 minutes.","Referring to , the fussy module  is simply bypassed until the central microcontroller unit  commences a fussy period. When the central microcontroller unit  commences a fussy period, the central microcontroller unit  transmits a fussy start signal to the fussy module , and a fussy event is commenced. The fussy module  then initiates generation of the fussy signal Sby means of the demand signal generating feature  embedded within the fussy module .","In contrast to the other demand event modules (i.e., the diaper-change module , the rocking module , the feeding module , the burping module , and the rest module ) a fussy event cannot be ended until the entire fussy period has run. Hence, the fussy signal Swill be generated throughout a fussy period regardless of the actions taken by the student. The fussy module  emulates those times when, despite every effort by a care provider, an infant cannot be satisfied and continues to fuss. Since the fussy event cannot be satisfied, the fussy module  does not include the recording , contented signal , escalating demand  or identification  features embedded within the other modules. The fussy module  does however include the sound recording feature in which the sound recorder  is activated for the duration of the fussy period in order to record any verbal reaction by the student.","When the end of the fussy period is reached, the fussy signal Sis turned OFF, the sound recorder  is shut off, and the fussy module  is exited. A contented signal + is not generated.","Self-Directed Expression Module ","The central microcontroller unit  periodically commences a self-directed expression and communicates the commencement of a self-directed expression to the self-directed expression module . The self-directed expression can last for a few seconds (e.g., a giggle) or several minutes (e.g., hiccuping).","Referring to , the self-directed expression module  is simply bypassed until the central microcontroller unit  commences a self-directed expression. When the central microcontroller unit  commences a self-directed expression, the central microcontroller unit  transmits a self-directed expression signal to the self-directed expression module, and a self-directed expression is commenced.","In contrast to the other demand event modules (i.e., the diaper-change module , the rocking module , the feeding module , the burping module , the fussy module , and the resting module ) a self-directed expression is preferably of the type which occurs quickly and spontaneously and a care-provider does not typically perceive as requiring satisfaction. Hence, the self-directed expression Ewill generally be communicated without any action taken by the student other than observing the expression. Since the self-directed expression need not be satisfied, the self-directed expression module  does not include the recording , contented signal , escalating demand  or identification  features embedded within other modules.","When the end of the self-directed expression is reached, the self-directed expression module  is exited.","Rest Module ","The central microcontroller unit  periodically commences a rest-request period and communicates the commencement of a rest-request period to the rest module . The central microcontroller unit  also controls the duration of each rest-request period by transmitting a termination signal to the rest module  after the desired time period y has lapsed.","The time intervals between sequential rest-request events is preferably selected so as to emulate the frequency of requests for sleep by an actual infant. By way of example, when the intervals are a predetermined value, the intervals are preferably between about 1 to 6 hours, and when the intervals are bounded random variables, the intervals are preferably between a minimum of 1 to 2 hours and a maximum of 4 to 6 hours, with a statistical preference for a time interval between approximately 3 and approximately 5 hours.","Similarly, the duration of each rest-request period is preferably selected so as to emulate the length of time an actual infant would require rest (i.e., the length of a typical daytime nap or night time sleeping period). By way of example, when the duration of a rest-request period is a predetermined value, the duration of each rest-request period is preferably between about 10 minutes to 6 hours, and when the duration of a rest-request period is a bounded random variable, the duration of each rest-request period is preferably between a minimum of about 10 minutes and a maximum of about 6 hours, with a statistical preference for a duration between approximately 5 and 40 minutes for a daytime nap and 2 to 5 hours for a night time sleeping period.","Referring to , the rest module  is simply bypassed until the central microcontroller unit  starts a rest-request period. When the central microcontroller unit  starts a rest-request period, the central microcontroller unit  transmits a rest-request start signal to the rest module , a rest-request event is counted by the recording feature , and the rest-request event commenced. In the event that the infant simulator  is already resting (i.e., is not being subjected to sound or movement exceeding defined \u201cdisturbing\u201d threshold values) the rest module  simply turns the positive signal switch Sw ON without generating the rest-request signal Sand continues to monitor for any \u201cdisturbing\u201d sounds or movement of the infant simulator .","Should the infant simulator  is being subjected to movement and\/or sound of sufficient intensity to be detected as a \u201cdisturbing\u201d action during the rest-request period, the rest module  initiates generation of the rest-request signal Sby means of the demand signal generating feature , starts timing the duration of the rest-request episode by timing the length of time the rest-request signal Sis generated, starts sound recorder  for a defined period of time (e.g., 3 to 5 minutes) in order to record any verbal reaction by the student, and turns the positive signal switch Sw OFF unless the switch is already OFF.","In order to end a rest-request episode before the entire rest-request period has elapsed, the rest module  must receive an identification signal S(e.g., insertion of an identification key  attached to the wrist of the assigned student by a tamper indicating wristband ) and must NOT receive a \u201cdisturbing\u201d signal from the motion sensor  or the sound sensor  (i.e., lack of both sound and movement exceeding \u201cdisturbing\u201d threshold values hereinafter referenced as a \u201cresting\u201d). The motion sensor  and sound sensor  must not detect a sound or movement exceeding threshold value throughout the entire rest-request period to prevent initiation of a secondary rest-request episode in which the rest-request signal Sis turned back ON, the duration of the supplemental rest-request episode timed, the sound recorder  started for a second defined period of time, and the positive signal switch Sw turned OFF again. Upon initiation of a secondary rest-request episode, the duration of the rest-request period may optionally be restarted (i.e., T12 reset to 0 minutes).","As shown in , the identification requirement is controlled by the identification system feature  embedded within the rest module . The identification system feature  prevents access to the episode termination operations (i.e., turning OFF the rest-request signal Sand terminating timing of the rest-request episode) by bypassing the \u201csatisfaction\u201d option until the identification signal Shas been received and the identification switch Swhas been turned ON.","If the identification signal Sis not received and\/or the infant simulator  continues to be subjected to movement and\/or sound within a given time limit x, as measured by the length of time the rest-request signal Shas been generated, the rest module  increases the intensity of the rest-request signal Sby means of the escalating demand feature  embedded within the rest module . The rest-request signal Sis generated at the increased intensity for the remainder of the rest-request episode (i.e., until the identification signal Sis received and the infant simulator  is resting, or the end of the rest-request period is reached).","Upon receiving the identification Sand detection of resting, the rest-request signal Sis turned OFF, the length of the rest-request episode recorded by the recording feature , the timer for timing the duration of the rest-request episode stopped and reset, the intensity of the rest-request signal Schecked and returned to normal if intensified, and the positive signal switch Sw turned ON.","The infant simulator  must continue to rest (i.e., detect no sounds or be subjected to any movement exceeding the threshold values) for the entire duration of the rest-request period. Failure to continuously rest the infant simulator  throughout the entire rest-request period causes the rest module  to reinitiate generation of the rest-request signal S, start timing the duration of the secondary rest-request episode, turn the sound recorder  back on for a second defined period of time, and turn the positive signal switch Sw OFF.","The duration of a secondary rest-request episode can be recorded and reported in a number of different ways, including, by way of example (i) recording and reporting a secondary rest-request episode as just another rest-request episode, (ii) separately recording and reporting primary and secondary rest-request episodes according to type of episode, (iii) adding the duration of a secondary rest-request episode to the recorded duration of the corresponding primary rest-request episode, etc.","In order to end a secondary rest-request episode before the end of the rest-request period, the infant simulator  must once again be rested. It is not necessary to retransmit the identification signal Sas the identification switch Swremains ON until the rest period has ended, regardless of the resting status of the infant simulator .","When the end of the rest period is reached, the rest module  performs one of two different sets of operations depending upon the final resting status of the infant simulator .

The central microcontroller unit  also controls the duration of each sick period by transmitting a termination signal to the sick module  once the desired time period y has lapsed.","The time interval between sequential sick periods is preferably selected so as to emulate the frequency of illness of an actual infant. Generally, a single sick period of between 30 minutes and 24 hours per assignment period is appropriate. Multiple sick periods can be commenced within a single assignment period, but such multiple illnesses within the span of a typical assignment period of 8 to 72 hours is relatively uncommon.","Referring to , the sick module  is simply bypassed until the central microcontroller unit  starts a sick period. When the central microcontroller unit  starts a sick period, the central microcontroller unit  transmits a sick period initiation signal to the sick module , a sick period is counted by the recording feature , and the sick period commenced. The sick module  then initiates generation of the perceptible sick signal Sby means of the demand signal generating feature , starts timing the duration of the sick period, increases the duration of demand periods occurring during the sick period, and decreases the time interval between sequential demand events during the sick period (i.e., demand periods last longer and demand events occur more frequently during a sick period).","Upon reaching the end of the sick period y, the sick signal Sis turned OFF, the duration of demand periods and the time intervals between sequential demand events are returned to normal, the timer for timing the duration of the sick period is stopped and reset, and the sick module  exited.","Assignment Period Module ","The infant simulator  initiates timing of the assignment period upon activation. The duration of the assignment period can either be continuous (i.e., continuing until a teacher or other program administrator takes custody of the infant simulator  and stops the assignment period), or predetermined (i.e., a preset duration of 6, 8, 24, 36, 48 or 72 hours selected by the teacher or other program administrator at the beginning of the assignment period.","When the assignment period is a predetermined time period, the central microcontroller unit  is preprogrammed with a defined assignment period. The assignment period module  compares the length of time the infant simulator  has been activated against the duration of the defined assignment period, and causes the program to continue cycling through the various modules until the length of time the infant simulator  has been activated equals or exceeds the duration of the defined assignment period. Once the activation period equals or exceeds the assignment period, the program is ended."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING A BEST MODE","Definitions","Example"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["a","t "],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
