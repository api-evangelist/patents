(Wolf, C. (Ed.) Dynamic Stereochemistry of Chiral Compounds, RSC, Cambridge, 2008.) Undoubtedly, the exceptional diversity and the unique stereochemical, electronic, and photochemical properties of both conformationally stable and rapidly racemizing axially chiral biaryls and polyaryls have led to a wide variety of applications. (See e.g., Qiao, X.; Padula, M. A.; Ho, D. M.; Vogelaar, N. J.; Schutt, C. E.; Pascal Jr., R. A. 1996, 118, 741-745.) It is therefore not surprising that structural analysis along with the study of enantiomerization and diastereomerization processes of mono- and disubstituted naphthalenes have received significant attention. (See e.g., Casarini, D.; Lunazzi, L.; Macciantelli, D. 1984, 25, 3641-3642). Alkyl, (See, e.g., Fields, D. L.; Regan, T. H. 1971, 36, 2986-2990.) aryl (See, e.g. House, H. O.; Magin, R. W.; Thompson, H. W. 1963, 28, 2403-2406.) and heteroaryl (See, e.g. Zoltewicz, J. A.; Maier, N. M.; Fabian, W. M. F. 1996, 52, 8703-8706.) groups have been introduced into the naphthalene framework to study the energy barrier to rotation about the naphthyl-alkyl or naphthyl-aryl bond and intramolecular interactions between proximate alkyl and aryl groups.","In particular, the incorporation of two phenol rings into a rigid C-symmetric scaffold that is reminiscent of the successful BINOL motif has been of general interest due to potential applications in asymmetric catalysis and enantioselective sensing for a long time. (See e.g., Pritchard, R. G.; Steele, M.; Watkinson, M.; Whiting, A. 2000, 41, 6915-6918.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"34.29mm","wi":"34.04mm","file":"US09085511-20150721-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Although the synthesis of BINOL was first reported in 1873 it took another 100 years until this prime example of a C-symmetric bidentate atropisomer gained considerable attention. (See von Richter, V. 1873, 6, 1249-1260.) Since the mid 1970s, BINOL and its derivatives have found extensive use in asymmetric reactions, molecular recognition studies and other applications. (See e.g., Pu, L. 1998, 98, 2405-2494.) The intriguing structure of BINOL and its success as chiral ligand and reagent in asymmetric synthesis has propelled the development of countless analogues that vary in stereoelectronic properties and bite angle. For many years, the synthesis of axially chiral 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalenes has been pursued due to the apparent structural analogy to BINOL and the associated promise in asymmetric catalysis and other areas.","Other attempts to synthesize derivatives of BINOL include the applicants previous work described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,888,509 which included general references to aryl and heteroaryl derivatives of naphthalene and specific examples directed to diacridine derivatives of naphthalene (core structure of diacridine derivative shown below).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"31.50mm","wi":"64.94mm","file":"US09085511-20150721-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"However, the incorporation of sufficient steric bulk into the chiral 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalene framework to halt rotation about the aryl-aryl axes and concomitant racemization has proven difficult. (See e.g., Pritchard, R. G.; Steele, M.; Watkinson, M.; Whiting, A. 2000.) Accordingly, few stereodynamic 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalenes such as 1,8-bis(3\u2032-formyl-4\u2032-hydroxyphenyl)naphthalene, 1 have been reported to date and used in racemic form. (See e.g., Watkinson, M.; Whiting, A.; McAuliffe, C.

Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (October 2006).","For the compound of formula (I) and all subsequent formulae, terms for chemical radicals are used are defined as follows.","A hydrocarbon radical is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic monocyclic or, in the case of an optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical, also a bicyclic or polycyclic organic radical based on the elements carbon and hydrogen, including, for example, the radicals alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, phenyl, naphthyl, indanyl, indenyl, etc.; this applies correspondingly to hydrocarbon radicals in composite meanings, such as hydrocarbonoxy radicals or other hydrocarbon radicals attached via heteroatom groups.","The hydrocarbon radicals, also in the special radicals alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkylamino and alkylthio, and also the corresponding unsaturated and\/or substituted radicals may in each case be straight-chain or branched in the carbon skeleton.","By way of example, the expression \u201c(C-C)-alkyl\u201d is a brief notation for alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. encompasses the methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methylpropyl or tert-butyl radicals. General alkyl radicals with a larger specified range of carbon atoms, for example \u201c(C-C)-alkyl\u201d correspondingly also include straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals having a larger number of carbon atoms, i.e., according to the example, also the alkyl radicals having 5 and 6 carbon atoms.","Alkyl radicals, including in the combined definitions such as alkoxy, haloalkyl, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, t- or 2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls such as n-hexyl, i-hexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl; alkenyl and alkynyl radicals are defined as the possible unsaturated radicals corresponding to the alkyl radicals; alkenyl is, for example, vinyl, allyl, 1-methyl-2-propenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, 2-butenyl, pentenyl, 2-methylpentenyl or hexenyl group, preferably allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methylbut-3-en-1-yl or 1-methylbut-2-en-1-yl.","Alkenyl also includes in particular straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon radicals having more than one double bond, such as 1,3-butadienyl and 1,4-pentadienyl, but also allenyl or cumulenyl radicals having one or more cumulated double bonds, for example allenyl (1,2-propadienyl), 1,2-butadienyl and 1,2,3-pentatrienyl.","Alkynyl is, for example, propargyl, but-2-yn-1-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl, 1-methylbut-3-yn-1-yl.","Alkynyl also includes, in particular, straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon radicals having more than one triple bond or else having one or more triple bonds and one or more double bonds, for example 1,3-butatrienyl or 3-penten-1-yn-1-yl (pent-3-en-1-yn-1-yl).","A carbocyclic ring is any form of a closed ring of carbon atoms and can include alicyclic or aromatic structures. Examples of such structures include, but are not limited to (C-C)-cycloalkyl which is a carbocyclic saturated ring system having 3-9 ring carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl or cyclononyl. In the case of substituted cycloalkyl, cyclic systems with substituents are included, where the substituents may also be bonded by a double bond on the cycloalkyl radical, for example an alkylidene group such as methylidene. Further examples include, but are not limited to (C-C)-cycloalkenyl which is a carbocyclic, nonaromatic, partially unsaturated ring system having 5-9 ring carbon atoms, for example 1-cyclobutenyl, 2-cyclobutenyl, 1-cyclopentenyl, 2-cyclopentenyl, 3-cyclopentenyl, or 1-cyclohexenyl, 2-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, 1,3-cyclohexadienyl or 1,4-cyclohexadienyl. In the case of substituted cycloalkenyl, the explanations for substituted cycloalkyl apply correspondingly.","Alkylidene, for example also in the form of (C-C)-alkylidene, is the radical of a straight-chain or branched alkane which is bonded via a double bond, the position of the binding site not being fixed. In the case of a branched alkane, of course, only positions at which two hydrogen atoms may be replaced by the double bond are possible; radicals are, for example, \u2550CH, \u2550CH\u2014CH, \u2550C(CH)\u2014CH, \u2550C(CH)\u2014CHor \u2550C(CH)\u2014CH.","Halogen is, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Haloalkyl, -alkenyl and -alkynyl are, respectively, alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl substituted partly or fully by identical or different halogen atoms, preferably from the group of fluorine, chlorine and bromine, in particular from the group of fluorine and chlorine, for example monohaloalkyl, perhaloalkyl, CF, CHF, CHF, CFCF, CHFCHCl, CCl, CHCl, CHCHCl; haloalkoxy is, for example, OCF, OCHF, OCHF, CFCFO, OCHCFand OCHCHCl; the same applies to haloalkenyl and other halogen-substituted radicals.","Aryl is a mono-, bi- or polycyclic carbocyclic aromatic system, for example phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indenyl, indanyl, pentalenyl, fluorenyl and the like, preferably phenyl.","Optionally substituted aryl also includes polycyclic systems, such as tetrahydronaphthyl, indenyl, indanyl, fluorenyl, biphenylyl, where the point of attachment is at the aromatic system.","A heterocyclic radical (heterocyclyl) comprises at least one heterocyclic ring (=carbocyclic ring in which at least one carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom, e.g. by a heteroatom from the group consisting of N, O, S, P, B, Si, Se), which is saturated, unsaturated or heteroaromatic and may be unsubstituted or substituted, where the point of attachment is located at a ring atom.","If the heterocyclyl radical or the heterocyclic ring is optionally substituted, it can be fused to other carbocyclic or heterocyclic rings.","Optionally substituted heterocyclyl also includes polycyclic systems, such as, for example, 8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octanyl or 1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl.","Optionally substituted heterocyclyl also includes spirocyclic systems, such as, for example, 1-oxa-5-aza-spiro[2.3]hexyl.","Heteroaryl means, from among the systems defined above under \u201cheterocyclyl\u201d, in each case a heteroaromatic compound, i.e. a fully unsaturated aromatic heterocyclic compound.","Substituted radicals, such as a substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, phenyl, benzyl, heterocyclyl and heteroaryl radical, are, for example, a substituted radical derived from the unsubstituted base structure, where the substituents are, for example, one or more, preferably 1, 2 or 3, radicals selected from the group of halogen, alkoxy, alkylthio, SF, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, carboxyl, cyano, azido, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, formyl, carbamoyl, mono- and dialkylaminocarbonyl, substituted amino such as acylamino, mono- and dialkylamino, and alkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl and, in the case of cyclic radicals, also alkyl, haloalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, optionally substituted mono- and dialkylaminoalkyl and hydroxyalkyl; in the term \u201csubstituted radicals\u201d, such as the substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, phenyl, benzyl, heterocyclyl and heteroaryl radicals mentioned, substituents include, in addition to the saturated hydrocarbon radicals mentioned such as alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkoxycarbonyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkyloxy, corresponding unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic radicals, such as optionally substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, phenyl and phenoxy. In the case of substituted cyclic radicals having aliphatic moieties in the ring, cyclic systems with those substituents which are bonded on the ring by a double bond are also included, for example substituted by an alkylidene group such as methylidene or ethylidene.","Acyl is a radical of an organic acid which arises in a formal sense by removal of a hydroxyl group on the acid function, and the organic radical in the acid may also be bonded to the acid function via a heteroatom. Examples of acyl are the \u2014CO\u2014R radical of a carboxylic acid HO\u2014CO\u2014R and radicals of acids derived therefrom, such as those of thiocarboxylic acid, optionally N-substituted iminocarboxylic acids or the radical of carbonic monoesters, N-substituted carbamic acid, sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, N-substituted sulfonamide acids, phosphonic acids or phosphinic acids.","The \u201cyl position\u201d of a radical denotes the carbon atom having the free bond. Compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention and compounds of the formula (I) used according to the invention (and, if appropriate, salts thereof) are in short also referred to as \u201ccompounds (I)\u201d.","In addition, for the purposes of this application compounds of the invention also include all stereoisomers and racemic mixtures thereof. The possible stereoisomers defined by their specific three-dimensional shape, such as enantiomers, diastereomers, Z- and E-isomers, are all encompassed by the formula (I) and can, in the preferred enantioselective procedure, be prepared selectively when optically active materials are used. The application also includes all tautomeric forms, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and crystalline forms including polymorphic forms.","One aspect of the invention relates to atropisomeric 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalene compounds of formula (I).","One embodiment of this aspect of the invention is the atropisomeric 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalene compounds of formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0080"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"47.33mm","wi":"75.27mm","file":"US09085511-20150721-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Rand Rindependently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, benzyl, heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, chloro, bromo, iodo, acyl, amino, amido, azido, cyano, formyl, carbamoyl, \u2014SF, nitro, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014SR\u2033\u2033, P(O)(OR), \u2014P(OR), and P(RB),","wherein\n\n","wherein\n\n","Another embodiment of this aspect of the invention is the atropisomeric 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalene compounds of formula (I), wherein","Rand Rare independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C-C) alkyl, (C-C) alkenyl, (C-C) alkynyl, (C-C) cycloalkyl, aryl, benzyl, heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, chloro, bromo, iodo, (C-C) acyl, amino, amido, azido, cyano, formyl, carbamoyl, \u2014SF, nitro, OR\u2032, NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, SR\u2033\u2033, P(O)(OR), \u2014P(OR), and P(RB),","wherein",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["R\u2032 is H, (C-C) alkyl, (C-C) alkenyl, (C-C) alkynyl, (C-C) cycloalkyl or (C-C) cycloalkenyl, an (acyclic or cyclic) hydrocarbon radical or hydrocarbonoxy radical having in each case 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a heterocyclyl radical, heterocyclyloxy radical, heterocyclylthio radical or heterocyclylamino radical having in each case 3 to 9 ring atoms and 1 to 3 hetero ring atoms from the group consisting of N, O and S, where each of the six last-mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted, or an acyl radical of an organic acid having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 12 carbon atoms, in particular 1 to 8 carbon atoms, P(O)(OR), \u2014P(OR), and P(R);

Such an asymmetric transformation of the first kind would generate the thermodynamically favored diimine isomer and thus facilitate the formation of enantiopure 5 with a theoretical yield of 100% and without the need for an elaborate chromatographic separation of the equimolar mixture of (M,M,R,R)- and (P,P,R,R)-9. Several cases in which asymmetric transformation of the first kind was used to manipulate the diastereomeric ratio of axially chiral compounds have been reported. For example, Meyers et al. found that the stereochemical outcome of the diastereoselective oxazoline-mediated asymmetric Ullmann coupling of aryl bromides is significantly improved upon heating of the product mixture. (E.g., Nelson, T. D.; Meyers, A. I. 1993, 34, 3061-3062.) This transformation favors the formation of the desired (P)-atropisomer, a key intermediate for the total synthesis of permethylated tellimagrandin. (Nelson, T. D.; Meyers, A. I. 1994, 59, 2577-2580.) The same principle has been used for the deracemization of ortho-dihydroxylated biaryl ligands VANOL and VAPOL (E.g., Zhang, Y.; Yeung. S.-M.; Wu, H.; Heller, D. P.; Wu, C.; Wulff, W. D. 2003, 5, 1813-1816.) and for the preparation of the aglycon of vancomycin. (E.g., Evans, D. A.; Wood, M. R.; Trotter, B. W.; Richardson, T. I.; Barrow, J. C.; Katz, J. L. 1998, 37, 2700-2704.)","We realized that (M,M,R,R)- and (P,P,R,R)-9, formed from racemic 5 and (R)-2-amino-1-propanol at 25\u00b0 C., showed distinct NMR spectra, for example two doublets at 1.26 and 1.40 ppm corresponding to the imino alcohol methyl groups (). We therefore used NMR analysis to monitor the atropisomerization process. Upon heating to 60.0\u00b0 C., the signals of the thermodynamically less favored diastereomer decreased in intensity and (P,P,R,R)-9 with >98% de was obtained after 14 hours (see ).","We previously reported that condensation of stereolabile 1 and (R)-2-amino-1-propanol exclusively generates the (M,M,R,R)-stereoisomer which is the thermodynamically favored conformer due to stabilization by intramolecular hydrogen bonding and concomitant minimization of steric repulsion. Accordingly, diimine formation with (S)-2-amino-1-propanol gave the (P,P,S,S)-enantiomer, Scheme 2. These results are in perfect agreement with the asymmetric transformation of a mixture of (M,M,R,R)- and (P,P,R,R)-9 towards the latter diastereomer. In analogy to the amplification of asymmetric induction observed with 1, the central chirality of the imino alcohol moiety in 9 controls the chiral amplification and induces the same sense of axial chirality. (Note that the (M,M)-scaffold in 1 corresponds to the (P,P)-conformation in 5 and 9 because the presence of the ortho-methyl groups in the latter results in a change in the CIP priorities.) Since the atropisomerization occurs with more than 99% de, it provides quantitative access to stereochemically pure 9 on the gram scale, which can then be hydrolyzed without concomitant isomerization to enantiopure 5. Having developed a convenient procedure producing (P,P)-5, we were able to prepare (P,P,R,R)-9 and (P,P,S,S)-9, the thermodynamically less stable diastereomer, via condensation with either enantiomer of 2-amino-1-propanol. Analyzing the CD spectra of the enantiomeric (M,M,R,R)- and (P,P,S,S)-diimines of 1, we previously speculated that the Cotton effects are predominantly controlled by the sense of axial chirality while the chiral centers in the imino alcohol units were expected to have little or no effect on the chiroptical properties. Comparison of the CD spectra of (P,P)-5, (P,P,R,R)-9 and (P,P,S,S)-9, all exhibiting the same sense of axial chirality, now clearly shows that this assumption is correct (). The three atropisomers exhibit a pronounced positive Cotton effect, and the incorporation of the diimino alcohol units results in a significant red shift. Importantly, the diastereomeric (P,P)-diimines of 9 show almost perfectly superimposable CD spectra, which underscores the overwhelming or possibly exclusive contribution of the relative orientation of the two cofacial salicylidenimine rings to the observed CD activity. (It is noteworthy that the CD amplitudes of the less stable (P,P,S,S)-9 diastereomer are slightly diminished compared to (P,P,R,R)-9. This is probably due to noticeable atropisomerization of (P,P,S,S)-9 to its (M,M,S,S)-diastereomer, i.e. it is likely that the CD spectra obtained with (P,P,S,S)-9 and (P,P,R,R)-9 only differ because the former was not perfectly diastereomerically pure.)","Slow evaporation of a solution of enantiopure (P,P)-5 in chloroform gave single crystals suitable for X-ray studies (). As expected, crystallographic analysis shows that the two salicylaldehyde rings reside in almost perfectly perpendicular orientation relative to the naphthalene backbone, exhibiting a C-symmetric structure with a torsion angle of 5.32\u00b0. The splaying between the two phenyl rings was determined as 20.51\u00b0 which results in a centroidal phenyl-to-phenyl separation of 3.47 \u212b. Based on the enforced \u03c0-stacking of the proximate salicylaldehyde rings, the positive Cotton effect and the large CD amplitudes of (P,P)-5 can be attributed to strong exciton coupling of the cofacial chromophores.","We then turned our attention to the kinetic analysis of 5 (Scheme 6). Interconversion of the stereoisomers of 5 requires one salicylaldehyde ring to rotate about the chiral naphthyl-phenyl axis. Accordingly, the edge of the rotating ring points towards the adjacent phenyl moiety in the transition state. In general, this process can proceed via two T-shaped transition states having the methyl group of the rotating phenyl ring either directed towards or away from the other phenyl ring. (Wolf, C. (Ed.) Dynamic Stereochemistry of Chiral Compounds, RSC, Cambridge, 2008, pp. 89.)

Equilibrium was reached after 2 days, and the atropisomeric ratio was determined as 94.4:3.9:1.7 [(M,M,S,S):(P,P,S,S):(M,P,S,S)] (). Accordingly, the thermodynamically favored (M,M,S,S)-atropisomer is more stable than the syn-intermediate by 11.2 kJ\/mol while conversion of the latter to (P,P,S,S)-9 is driven by only 2.4 kJ\/mol. Comparison of the relative amounts of the two anti-isomers of 9 reveals a difference in Gibbs free energy of 8.8 kJ\/mol. Crystallographic analysis of syn-9 and (P,P,R,R)-10 shows that these results can be explained by selective intramolecular hydrogen bonding and concomitant optimization of steric repulsion in (M,M,S,S)-9, vide infra. Following Vriens' mathematical treatment for two consecutive reversible reactions and curve fitting we then determined the individual rotational energy barriers (see SI for details). The interconversion of (P,P,S,S)-9 to the syn-diastereomer has a Gibbs activation energy, \u0394G, of 108.7 kJ\/mol. The intermediate syn-isomer undergoes diastereomerization to the two anti-conformers and the corresponding activation energies were calculated as 106.3 kJ\/mol (\u0394G) and 104.5 kJ\/mol (\u0394G). As expected from the asymmetric transformation experiments discussed above, the energy barrier for the conversion of (M,M,S,S)-9 to the syn-isomer \u0394G, is significantly higher and was determined as 115.7 kJ\/mol. To confirm these data, we analyzed the initial decay of (P,P,S,S)-9 at low conversion (less than 2% completion), which can be approximately treated as an irreversible first-order reaction (see Experimental Section). We thus obtained a rotational energy barrier, \u0394G, of 109.2 kJ\/mol, which is in very good agreement with the value determined by curve fitting.","Attempts to grow a single crystal of (P,P,R,R)- or (M,M,S,S)-9 for crystallographic analysis were unsuccessful. But we were able to obtain a crystal structure of the syn-isomer (). This atropisomer has a torsion angle of 18.33\u00b0 and the splaying between the two phenyl rings is 21.09\u00b0 corresponding to a centroidal phenyl-to-phenyl separation of 3.52 \u212b. The steric repulsion between the two salicylidenimine rings explains the low relative stability compared to the (P,P,R,R)- or the (M,M,S,S)-isomer.","To better understand the overwhelming thermodynamic stability of the (P,P,R,R)- and the (M,M,S,S)-configuration, we decided to prepare the corresponding diimine using (R)-2-amino-3-methyl-1-butanol (see SI for details on the synthesis, CD analysis etc). Fortunately, a crystal of (P,P,R,R)-10 was obtained by crystallization from a hexane solution (). Crystallographic analysis revealed a torsion angle of 18.17\u00b0 and splaying between the two phenyl rings was calculated as only 13.46\u00b0 resulting in a centroidal phenyl-to-phenyl separation of 3.33 \u212b. The significantly reduced splaying compared to syn-9 is quite remarkable and results from reduced steric repulsion between the imino alcohol units and additional hydrogen bonding between the alcohol groups and the phenol units in the opposite salicylidenimine ring. The arrangement of the two salicylidenimines in (P,P,R,R)-10 allows formation of a total of four intramolecular hydrogen bonds (the phenol groups also undergo hydrogen bonding with the adjacent imines) while the steric bulk of the imino alcohol moieties is placed outside of this ring structure in the least crowded positions. The C\u2550N \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HOCand the COH \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 OChydrogen bond lengths are 1.861 and 2.178 \u212b, respectively.","In analogy to the results obtained with 9, we observed quantitative asymmetric transformation of the first kind with 10, which can be used to either prepare pure (M,M,S,S)- or (P,P,R,R)-atropisomers of these diimines. The kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of the unidirectional atropisomerization process of 9 and 10 discussed above and in the SI are in perfect agreement with the crystallographic data showing distinct stabilization of the (P,P,R,R)-isomer due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding and minimized steric repulsion between the imine moieties.","We also found that (P,P)-5 can be used for the kinetic resolution of the enantiomers of 2-amino-1-propanol. Diimine formation of the enantiopure dialdehyde 5 and 4 equivalents of the racemic substrate at room temperature followed by extraction after 5 hours allowed recovery of the remaining amino alcohol in 47% yield. Chiral HPLC analysis showed that the (S)-amino alcohol was enriched to 54% cc, which proves the expected favored formation of (P,P,R,R)-9 (see Experimental Section).","In conclusion, we have synthesized the first examples of axially chiral 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalenes that are stable to racemization at room temperature. The incorporation of two ortho-substituted phenol moieties into a rigid C-symmetric scaffold that is reminiscent of the successful BINOL motif has been of general interest due to potential applications in asymmetric catalysis and enantioselective sensing for a long time. Stereochemical analysis showed that the anti-stereoisomers of 1,8-bis(2\u2032-methyl-4\u2032-hydroxy-5\u2032-formylphenyl)naphthalene, 5, and its diimine analogues 9 and 10 are significantly more stable than the corresponding syn-isomer. Slow syn\/anti-interconversion, obeying reversible first-order kinetics, of 5, 9 and 10 occurs at elevated temperatures and this provides a convenient entry towards enantiopure bisphenols that can be prepared on the gram scale via asymmetric transformation of the first kind. Spectroscopic NMR and CD analyses supported by crystallography of syn- and anti-1,8-bisphenolnaphthalenes showed that the incorporation of two imino alcohol units into the triaryl scaffold controls the outcome of the unidirectional atropisomerization with literally perfect stereocontrol, resulting from a unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding motif and concomitant reduction of steric repulsion. While the stereochemical bias of the atropisomers studied originates from the central chirality of the incorporated amino alcohol units, the chiroptical properties are solely determined by the sense of axial chirality. Chiral recognition studies using 1,8-bisphenolnaphthalenes as UV, CD and fluorescence sensors are currently underway in our laboratories.","The invention will now be further described by way of the following non-limiting examples.","All reagents and solvents were used without further purification.
