{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of and claims the priority from co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/493,950, filed Jul. 27, 2006, entitled BUSINESS INTELLIGENT ARCHITECTURE SYSTEM AND METHOD, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,580,944.","The present disclosure relates to business intelligent systems, and more particularly to a logical model architecture and a system and method of building business intelligent systems using the logical model architecture.","A conventional approach to a business intelligent (BI) system, which is also referred to as a business intelligence system, typically consists of populating a data repository which is managed using a database management system, such as a relational database management system (RDBMS), and then defining reports and other output using reporting and analysis tools, such as an online analytical processing (\u201cOLAP\u201d) tool, to report or provide analysis using the data stored in the data repository.","In such a conventional approach, a reporting tool is typically used to define the data items to be reported, and the level of detail that is to be reported for each data item in a report. In order to accommodate potential reporting and analysis requirements, the data repository is designed to include data items at a lowest level of detail. For example, assume that the data repository includes a data item that reflects detailed purchase data. In this example, for the data repository, the RDBMS includes a table, e.g., a purchase table, which includes a row for each purchase and has column for the purchase amount, together with columns that provide information for use in aggregating the purchase amount, e.g., date of purchase, store in which purchase was made, product identifier, product line, etc.","While a report can be defined that outputs detailed information for each purchase, this type of report is typically not as useful as a report that aggregates the purchase information, such as revenue by store, daily revenue, revenue by product, revenue by product line, quarterly revenue, revenue by geographic region, for example. Unless an entity's BI requirements are known before a data repository is populated, the data repository must be designed to include a low level of detail in order to anticipate the entity's BI requirements. Methodologies such as the Kimball methodology provide general guidelines which define the type of data that should be stored in a data repository for a given application (e.g., finance, sales, human resources, etc.). However, use of such a methodology can lead to inefficiencies, since the methodology does not take into account the actual BI requirements of a specific entity. A practice of building a data repository without determining the actual data needs of an entity based on the entity's BI requirements can lead to an unnecessary expenditure of resources to design, store and maintain the data repository.","Building a conventional business intelligent (BI) system can involve sifting through large amounts of data to identify information to be stored in the data repository, extracting the identified information, and collecting the extracted information into the data repository (e.g., a data mart). Data might need to be collected from multiple sources into a data warehouse or data mart.","In practice, the process of building a BI system is an art. This practice is especially inefficient in view of the fact that the design and development of a BI system can involve a number of steps. The present inventors have determined that it can take a four-person team approximately three to six months to design and development a first version of a data mart. New teams are formed to build new data marts and systems independent of other development efforts. Examples of some of the steps involved in designing and developing a BI system include: 1) identifying data to be stored in the data repository (e.g., using the Kimball methodology), 2) tagging data for collection, 3) loading the data into a data warehouse and aggregating multiple data sources, 4) aggregating and extracting data from the data warehouse to flat files, for importation into a data mart, 5) loading the data from the flat files into the data mart, 6) designing a base-line schema for aggregation files, 7) designing a schema and the objects for reporting, 8) designing reporting and presentation layout, and 9) data validation and error checking.","Implementation typically involves either writing code manually, and\/or using commercial tools to load data. Different data marts are often built for different departments in the same company, or for different reporting\/analysis tools. Since each system is designed and developed independently, such that there is no uniformity across systems, efforts in the design, development, implementation and maintenance of multiple data warehouses\/marts are duplicated, which can negatively impact a business. In addition, it is difficult to determine the capabilities (e.g., for reporting and analysis) of each system, thereby making it difficult to build from the current capabilities of an existing system when designing a new system. Further, efforts to maintain and enhance each of the independently-developed data marts and systems are performed independently, thereby adding to costs associated with a BI system.","The present disclosure seeks to address failings in the art and to provide a systematic approach to building a BI system. Embodiments of the present disclosure use a logical model architecture, which can be used to build a structure for a data repository and populate the data repository. The data repository providing data which can be operated on by one or more reporting and\/or analysis tools of a BI system so as to satisfy such needs as the reporting and data analysis of a business enterprise or other entity.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a method is provided which defines a first, second and third interfaces, and first and second sets of transformations of a logical model architecture. The first interface comprises one or more dimensions and\/or measures. The second interface of the logical model architecture comprises metrics, and associations between the metrics and the one or more dimensions and\/or measures. The third interface of the logical model architecture comprises a plurality of user data requirements, each of which identifies at least one of the metrics and at least one of the dimensions and\/or measures. The first set of transformations of the logical model architecture comprise one or more transformations to map source data items to the one or more dimensions and\/or measures of the first interface. Each transformation in the second set of transformations of the logical model architecture corresponds to at least one of the user data requirements, and is for use in populating a data repository with data to satisfy the corresponding user data requirement.","In accordance with one or more embodiments disclosed herein, a dimension represents a data item, such as a source data item, by which at least one other data item, such as a source data item or a derived data item, can be grouped, and a measure represents a source data item other than those data items represented by a dimension.","In accordance with one or more embodiments disclosed herein, a metric identified in a user data requirement in the third interface of the logical model architecture corresponds to one or more output data items of a BI system, which BI system comprises reporting and analysis tools to operate on the data repository.","In accordance with one or more embodiments disclosed herein, the second set of transformations of the logical model architecture are defined by defining at least one star graph having nodes, each node corresponding to a star identifying at least one of the dimensions, each of the dimensions identified in the star belonging to a dimension hierarchy, an edge between two nodes representing one or more aggregation operations such that each node corresponds to a level of aggregation for each of the dimensions identified by the star, and traversing the star graph so as to determine the level of aggregation level for a metric corresponding to star. In accordance with at least one embodiment, an aggregation operation comprises a roll-up operation to roll a child dimension into its parent dimension, and the roll-up operation operates the define a level of aggregation for a metric associated with the child and parent dimensions, such that the associated metric is grouped by the parent dimension.","In accordance with another embodiment, a set of dimensions and a set of dimension hierarchies are defined. Each dimension hierarchy identifies a plurality of dimensions from the set of dimensions and hierarchical relationships between the dimensions in the plurality. A set of metrics and a set of aggregation operations are defined, and a set of BI data requirement specifications are identified. Each of data requirement specification in the defined set of BI data requirement specifications comprises a metric from the set of metrics, at least one dimension hierarchy corresponding to the metric the set of dimension hierarchies, at least one dimension of the at least one dimension hierarchy and at least one aggregation operation. A data structure of a data repository is determined based on the set of BI data requirement specifications, and a data repository is populated in accordance with the determined data structure.","In general, embodiments of the present disclosure comprises a logical model architecture and a system and method of building business intelligent systems using the logical model architecture.","Certain embodiments of the present disclosure will now be discussed with reference to the aforementioned figures, wherein like reference numerals refer to like components.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a logical model is used as an underlying model of a BI system, and defines basic elements of a BI system. Each element can be defined using a mathematical, or other, expression, for example. The logical model further comprises a two-tier architecture which uses the defined elements and standard interfaces between the tiers, with entry and exit points of the tiers.","The logical model used in embodiments of the present disclosure facilitates representation of the data and processing, as well as facilitates the allocation of data and processing. In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, the logical model is platform independent and data source independent. Standard relational database management system (RDBMS) technologies such as relational data models and aggregations can be used. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a mechanism for building a logical model for use with a BI system, or systems, from a generic point of view, using abstractions to describe components of a BI system (e.g., data structures\/requirements, relationships and aggregation operations, data sources and intermediate structures).","Logical Model Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":"100"},"Referring to , the logical model  comprises four sets of data: detailed, or source, data , metrics with most granular dimensions , selected aggregated data  and dimensions and hierarchies , each of which is discussed in more detail below. A dimension represents a data item of detailed data , which can be used in grouping or aggregating another data item. Detailed data  can further comprise a measure, which represents a data item other than a dimension. As is discussed in more detail below, dimensions can be related as parent-child dimensions. In such a hierarchy, the most granular dimension is the dimension which has no child dimension. In addition and as is further discussed below, a dimension can be part of more than one dimension hierarchy, and a given dimension can be the most granular dimension in one dimension hierarchy but not in another dimension hierarchy. A dimension and dimension hierarchy can be grouped with other dimensions and\/or dimensions hierarchies in a dimension group. A dimension group can be used to represent a category of information.","Referring to , the logical model  comprises a source interface , bridge interface , and target interface . In one or more embodiments, first tier  transformations can relate \u201cbusiness logic\u201d components or metrics, e.g., logical data items used by a business entity for reporting and analysis. First tier  transformations can be used to define a metric, and any associated dimensions and\/or measures. A metric comprises a quantifiable piece of information usable by an entity\/enterprise. A metric can correspond to one or more source data items. In a business enterprise, a metric can provide a measure of some aspect of the business, such as sales revenue, cost of inventory, etc. As is discussed below, dimensions can be defined to be an aggregation of one or more other dimensions. For example, a month dimension can be defined as an aggregation of a day dimension.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, dimensions can have associated key attributes, which correspond to relational keys of corresponding dimension tables in a relational database. In addition, dimensions can have display attributes, which can be displayed together with a value associated with the dimension. A display attribute can be used to display dimension details and in reports, for example. To illustrate, a department dimension can have a name attribute. In embodiments of the invention, display attributes are not used for grouping, and need not appear in the logical model . As with a dimension and in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, a measure element can be used to correspond with a data object. A measure refers to numerical data captured in the detailed data. Examples of a measure include, without limitation, timestamp and dollar amount. As shown in this example, data can include a data value corresponding to a timestamp measure.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a dimension can be related to one or more other dimensions. Relationships between dimensions can be represented as a directed graph, in which one dimension can be an ancestor or descendent of another dimension. An ancestor, or parent, dimension has one or more descendent, or child, dimensions, and a descendent dimension has one or more ancestor dimensions. A dimension that has no descendents, or children, is referred to as a \u201cmost granular\u201d dimension. In accordance with at least one embodiment, in first tier  transformations, a metric can be associated with one or more most granular dimensions. Second tier  transformations can be used to derive a metric corresponding to data that is to be included in a data mart or data warehouse. For example, a metric can be derived using associated dimensions and one or more data aggregation operations.","The logical model  is further described in connection with a discussion of the terminology and definitions used in accordance with one more embodiments of the present disclosure.","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, the logical model  is used to define one or more metrics. A metric can be associated with an item of data retrieved from a data source. Alternatively, a metric can correspond to an aggregation of data items. For purposes of illustration only, and without limitation, examples of metrics include page views, unique users, and revenue. In accordance with at least one embodiment, a derived metric can be defined in the logical model . For example, a derived metric such as revenue per click can be defined to be the result of a revenue metric divided by a number of clicks metric.","Dimension, Dimension Hierarchy and Dimension Group","In accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, the logical model  includes a dimension element, which can correspond to a data item or object. The data object can be considered to be a data item (e.g., user, day, etc.) or an attribute (e.g., gender) of a data item (e.g., user), for example. Dimensions can be grouped to form a dimension group. In addition, and as discussed above, dimensions can be related in a dimension hierarchy, which relationships can be represented using a directed graph. As is described in more detail below, a dimension can be used to define a level of detail of a reportable item. For example, an output item (also referred to herein as a metric) such as revenue can be provided by day and\/or by month.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 2A to 2C","FIG. 2A"]},"Dimensions can be related in a dimension hierarchy, as shown in . A hierarchy is a linear list of dimensions related as parent and child, such that a parent dimension can have one or more children, such as in a \u201cone-to-many\u201d relationship. In the example time hierarchy T , the relationship between day and month comprises a one-to-many relationship, such that a day belongs to a month, while a month can have many days. Also shown in  is a user hierarchy U , with nodes  and  corresponding to user and gender dimensions.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a dimension can be included in more than one hierarchy. In the example shown in , the month dimension is a part of time hierarchies T  and T , as represented by nodes  and , respectively.","Nodes ,  and  correspond to a lowest level dimension which has no child dimensions, e.g., user, day and month, in a dimension hierarchy, each of which can be referred to as the most granular dimension in their respective dimension hierarchy. For example, the day dimension (i.e., node  in hierarchy ) is the most granular dimension in time hierarchy T .","As is discussed below, a parent-child relationship between two dimensions can have an associated aggregation operation. For example, the aggregation operation can comprise a \u201croll-up\u201d operation, such that a child can be rolled-up, or aggregated, into its parent. For example, a time hierarchy, T,  comprises nodes  to  representing day, month and year dimensions. The time hierarchy T  can be expressed as time T:=(day\u2192month\u2192year). If a \u201croll-up\u201d operation is applied such that day is aggregated (e.g., summed) into month, time hierarchy , T, results. Node  of time hierarchy Trepresents a month dimension and node  represents a year dimension. In time hierarchy T , node  represents the month dimension as a parent of the day dimension, represented by node , and the day dimension is the child of the month dimension. Another example of an aggregation operation discussed below is a \u201cdrop-down\u201d operation.","Dimensions can be defined as being part of a dimension group. A dimension group is comprised of a set of related dimension objects. A dimension group definition can comprise the hierarchical relationships defined by a dimension hierarchy. A dimension group can be defined using a direct graph with each node of the direct graph corresponding to a dimension. The arrows, or edges, between the nodes represent a relationship between dimensions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["260","263","261","262","261","262"]},"Dimension groups  and  are also shown in . Dimension group  includes hierarchy , which is also shown in , of a user dimension as the child of a gender dimension. Dimension group  further comprises hierarchy . Hierarchy  comprises the user dimension as a child of a user interest subtype dimension, which is in turn a child of a user interest type dimension. Similarly, dimension group , which represents a location dimension group, includes a hierarchy  and two sub-hierarchies  and . Sub-hierarchy  includes zip and state dimensions and sub-hierarchy  includes a DMA (direct marketing area) dimension.","Star and Metric-Star","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a dimension group, such as the example dimension groups shown in , can be represented as a star. As is described in more detail below, by associating a star with a metric, a metric can be defined as capable of being grouped by, or computed on, a dimension identified by a star. For example, if a metric is associated with the star representing dimension group  of , the metric can be grouped by one or more of the dimensions in dimension group , i.e., user, gender, user interest subtype and user interest type dimensions. In addition and in accordance with embodiments presently disclosed, the granularity associated with a dimension identified by a star can identify the granularity of a metric associated with the star.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","330","310","2","310","310"]},"In accordance with embodiments of the disclosed invention, all possible combinations of dimensions can be used to define a star. In the example shown in , star  and star  are equivalent from a granularity point of view, because the month can be inferred from a day using the time hierarchy T. e.g., hierarchy  of . That is, the month dimension in star  does not add new information to star , since data associated with the month dimension can be computed using the day dimension.","However, star  is not necessarily equivalent to star . More particularly and with reference to , the zip and DMA dimensions belong to different dimension hierarchies, as illustrated by sub-hierarchies  and . Although they belong to the same dimension group, a zip code is not derivable from a DMA code, or vice versa.","In accordance with at least one embodiment, a metric can be related to a star, such that the metric is associated with a set of dimensions represented by the star. A metric-star can be represented as (METRIC, STAR). Examples of such an expression are be provided with reference to , which provides example of metrics and associated stars in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","410","420","400","410","401","300","400","310","410","400","420","421","310","400","1","401","410","2","401","420","3","421"]},"Logical Model Interface","Referring again to  and in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the logical model  includes three interfaces: a source interface , a bridge interface , and a target interface , each of which are discussed below.","In accordance with at least one embodiment, data is represented as a set of records, with each record containing fields. Each of the fields corresponds to a dimension or a measure. Each record can include a virtual measure, occurrence (occr), for each source data record, with the value of the measure being one for each record.","In accordance with embodiments of the disclosure, source interface  of the logical model  represents the data, and maps each field to a dimension or a measure. For example, a schema can be expressed as [DIM, DIM, . . . , DIMn, MS, MS, . . . , MSm, occr], where DIMx corresponds to a dimension and MSx corresponds to a measure. For example, a schema such as the following:\n\n[page_id, user, day, timestamp, dollar, occr]\n","can represent the following data:\n\n(111000, joe123, 01\/01\/05, Jan. 1, 2005 5:00 pst, $10, 1)\n\n(111001, jan123, 01\/02\/05, Jan. 2, 2005 1:23 pst, $20, 1)\n\n(111004, joe123, 01\/01\/05, Jan. 1, 2005 5:01 pst, $2, 1)\n","Each of the first five fields corresponds to a dimension and the last field corresponds to a measure. One or more layers of pre-processing (e.g., a view or other processing) can be used to transform the data into a set of records with each record having a set of fields. In addition or as an alternative to pre-processing the data, a unique identifier can be added to the data such that the combination of the unique identifier and the dimension identifier can be used as a key for use with the source data.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, the bridge interface  relates a metric and a star. In accordance with at least one embodiment, the bridge interface  contains a set of metric-stars, one for each metric. Since a star comprises a set of dimensions in one or more embodiments, each metric-star relates a metric to the set of dimensions. In at least one embodiment, each related dimension is a most granular, or the most detailed, dimension, so as to define the most detailed dimension(s) on which the metric can be computed. To illustrate, assume that applicable dimension hierarchies of metric M are H, H, . . . Hn and that a most granular dimension of each hierarchy is D, D, . . . Dn, a metric-star (M, (D, D, . . . , Dn)) can be defined by bridge interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["112","410","420","112","500","501","502","210","2","220","2","220","200"]},"Using the tuple expression syntax described above, the metric-star  shown in  can be expressed as metric-star =((refund, (user, month)). Metric-stars  and  correspond to metric-star  and metric-star  discussed herein.","In one or more embodiments, the bridge interface  can be virtual, such that some or all of the data represented in bridge interface  need not be stored in a data warehouse\/mart. In so doing, it is possible to limit, or reduce, the volume of data that is stored, which volume would otherwise be quite large. Accordingly, the data identified in the bridge interface  can be stored on an as needed basis in order to reduce the data storage needed, and can be further refined using another interface, a target interface .","Referring again to , target interface  is generated using second tier  transformations on bridge interface . The target interface  contains a set of metric-stars derived from bridge interface , which can be used to represent the selected data models for reporting and\/or analysis tools, e.g., an OLAP analysis tool. The target interface  can define the data that is to be stored in a data repository, e.g., an RDBMS. In target interface , there can be more than one metric-star for each metric.  provides an example of target interface  comprising a collection of metric-stars in accordance with embodiments of the invention.","In the target interface , a metric-star need not involve the most granular dimensions. In addition, metric-stars , ,  and  represent the data to be stored in the data repository for use by reporting and analysis tools. More particularly and in accordance with the metric-stars defined in the example of a target interface  shown in , a data repository can be used to store data to output refunds grouped by user, month and year, page views grouped by user, day and zip, and unique users grouped by day.","Logical Model Transformation","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, at least first and second tier  transformations are used by the logical model . A first tier  can comprise mapping transformations to map components of the source interface , e.g., dimensions and measures, to other components of the source interface , as well as metric-stars identified by the bridge interface .","To illustrate, a metric can be mapped to a measure or a dimension, and a dimension can be mapped to another dimension identified by the source interface . The following provides examples of expression formats that can be used to express these mappings in accordance with one or more embodiments:","Metric=map Measure","Metric=map Dimension","Dimension=map Dimension","The following provides examples which use the above expression formats:","page views=map occurrence","dollar amount=map dollar","unique users=map user_id","In one or more embodiments, in the first tier , a metric is computed from a single data field defined by the source interface . A metric computed using more than one field can be computed as a derived metric in the data flow.","As an optimization, in accordance with embodiments of the invention, a filter can be defined as part of the mapping. Filters can be used to reduce data volume. The following provide examples of a mapping using a filter, assuming that in the data, there is a record_type with values p (for page) and l (for link):","page views=map occurrence if record_type=p","link view=map occurrence if record_type=l","In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the first tier  can comprise a transformation used to define a business concept, or information item identified for analysis. The business concept need not exist in the data. For example, a session, funnel or segment represents business concepts, which do not exist in the data. In the logical model architecture, these concepts can be represented as a derived dimension in bridge interface .","For example, a session can be defined as a user visit event to one or more web pages, where each interval between two consecutive events is less than ten minutes. This concept can be captured using a data processing module. In bridge interface , session is defined to be a derived dimension, such that metrics such as the total page views and total time spent for a session can be computed using the derived dimension.","In accordance with embodiments of the invention, in the bridge interface , like other dimensions, derived dimensions can be associated with one or more metrics. For example, a timespent metric can be computed on session, location and day, or (timespent, (session, location, day)), such that the timespent metric is available by session, location and day. Thus, derived dimensions can be used much the same as other dimensions.","A second tier  transformations are used to determine the contents of a data repository, which contents can include measures, metrics and dimensions, for example. The metrics and dimensions can be determined from metric-stars defined in bridge interface , as well as other metric-stars (some newly created as discussed herein). The second tier  transformation can be used to generate data models to host data. In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, a star graph can be used to represent\/determine second tier  transformations.","Star Graph and Aggregation","In at least one embodiment, a star graph defines a collection of stars. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a star graph can be created, e.g., algorithmically, for any combination of hierarchies. Each node in the star graph corresponds to a star, which is associated with one or more dimension hierarchies. Lines, or edges, and arrows between the star nodes represent a derivable relationship between the star nodes. Thus, a star graph can be used to represent relationships between stars. One example of a relationship is a parent-child relationship.","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a complete star graph refers to a star graph that comprises all possible star nodes for a collection of hierarchies, together with all possible relationships. A base star of the complete star graph for hierarchies (H, H, . . . , Hn) is (h,h, . . . , hn) where h, h, . . . , hn are the most granular dimensions of H to Hn.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["1","2","3","801","808","801","801","802","804","802","804","808","801","807"]},"As is illustrated in , a star can be a parent of another star. In accordance with one or more embodiments, a star is the parent of another star if the parent star can be \u201cobtained from\u201d the child star via a \u201cdrop\u201d or \u201croll-up\u201d operation. A drop operation drops the hierarchy, which is similar to a \u201cgroup by all\u201d for a given hierarchy. In other words, for example, all of the dimensions in a hierarchy are used to \u201cgroup by\u201d rather than using each individual dimension to \u201cgroup by\u201d. A roll-up operation results in a child dimension being grouped with its parent dimension, as defined in a dimension hierarchy.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a roll-up operation can be defined for a given metric along a star hierarchy from a child star to its parent star. Roll-ups can be considered to be sub-graphs of star graphs. A roll-up operation can be used to identify the data that is needed for the target interface . For example and in a case that a roll-up operation can be performed for a metric, such that the data corresponding to the metric and\/or data used to compute the metric can be stored at the level of aggregation associated with a parent dimension can be stored rather than the data associated with a child dimension.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 7A and 7B"],"b":["300","310","300","310","700","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"b":["300","310","710","720"]},"To further illustrate, hierarchy H=(day\u2192month) becomes H\u2032=(day\u2192month\u2192*) where \u201c*\u201d means all (e.g., as is used in the structure query language, SQL, notation). This notation, star (user, link, *), can be used to designate a \u201cgroup by\u201d operation, i.e., to mean group by user and link. In addition and by changing the definition of the hierarchy, the \u201cdrop of a hierarchy\u201d can be modeled as a roll-up action to the dimension \u201call\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["901","904","901","801","902","903","904","803","804","806"]},"In accordance with one or more embodiments, there are at least four scenarios for applying a roll-up operation to a given metric along a hierarchy.  provides examples of a roll-up operation by metric and hierarchy in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.","In one scenario, all of the dimensions in a hierarchy can be \u201crolled-up\u201d using the same function. In other words, a roll-up operation is allowed along all dimensions in a hierarchy, using the same aggregation function(s), to yield a given metric. Referring to metric-star hierarchy , a page view metric is associated with a star identifying the user, time and location dimension hierarchies. In the example shown in  using star hierarchy , a page view metric can be aggregated using a sum function to roll-up along the time dimension hierarchy. A roll-up operation can be expressed as (Metric, Hierarchy, Function), or (page view, time, sum). In this example, the sum function is used to roll-up the time dimension hierarchy (i.e., day\u2192month\u2192year\u2192all), such that page views can be grouped by day, month (i.e., by summing the daily page view totals), year (i.e., by summing the monthly page view totals), and all (i.e., by summing the yearly page view totals).","Star hierarchy  illustrates a roll-up along the user and location dimension hierarchies. More particularly, the page views metric is summed along stars  to  and the location dimension, and the page views metric is summed along stars  to  and the user and location dimensions. Star  represents a roll-up of the user and location dimensions, such that star  corresponds to a page views metric that represents a daily page view total for all users and locations.","Alternatively and while a roll-up operation can be applied to all of the hierarchies, a different function can be used to perform the operation. In other words, a first function can be used to roll-up from the most granular dimension to its parent, and then a different function is used to roll-up from the parent to the most granular dimension's grandparent. In accordance with one or more embodiments, an order of the dimensions in a hierarchy can be used to identify how the metric is to be computed.","Under an alternate approach, no roll-up is allowed along any hierarchy using any function. In this case, the roll-up function is assumed to be none. In such a case, for example, a detailed data item identified in the source interface  cannot be aggregated, and the target interface  can indicate that the detailed data is to be stored in a data repository.","Under yet another approach, a partial roll-up can be allowed, e.g. a roll-up is allowed along some hierarchies but not others. However, there is at least one hierarchy with which a metric cannot be rolled-up. For a hierarchy with which a metric cannot be rolled-up, the aggregation function can be designated as none, and the data is preserved along this hierarchy in order to compute the metric.","Event","In accordance with embodiments of the disclosure, a star graph can be \u201ctrimmed\u201d (or optimized) so as to comprise less than a complete star graph. For example, dimensions can be grouped by \u201cevents\u201d, as a mechanism to trim the star graph. An event can be an activity, the occurrence of which can be measured, for example. Examples of an event include, a user viewing a web page, a user clicking a link within a page, a person making a purchase, etc. An event can be represented in logical model  as a metric.","An event can defined by a metric, which has associated dimensions. By specifying certain event metrics to be used to generate a star graph, it is possible to limit the star graph to include those dimensions associated with a specified metric. For example, assume there are two events in which an entity is interested, e.g., purchases and web page views. The first event is represented by a purchases metric, which is associated with dimension hierarchies H=(user), H=(zip), H=(day), and the second event is represented by a page views metric, which is associated with dimension hierarchies H=(day), H=(page), H=(IP). The two events share dimension hierarchy H.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["801","808","1001","1006","801","808","1001","1006"]},"Requirement","In one or more embodiments, a requirement can be a reporting and\/or analysis requirement, e.g., a requirement can be used to identify the data needed to satisfy a reporting and\/or analysis need.
