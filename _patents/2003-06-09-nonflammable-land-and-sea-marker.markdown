{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to location markers. More particularly, this invention is a long-lasting, effective marker that does not emit flame or smoke and may be activated during designated intervals to aid searchers find a specific location on land or at sea.","Markers have been used to designate or draw attention to a particular object or location on land and open water. Most, if not all emit relatively large flames and volumes of smoke to attract attention.","For example, one marker in inventory by some navies of the world has been designated the Mk 58 Mod 1 marine location marker which is designed for day or night use in any condition calling for long-burning smoke and flame reference point marking on the ocean's surface. It usually is used for antisubmarine warfare, but can be used for search-and-rescue operations, man-overboard markings, and as a target for practice bombing at sea. The marker produces a yellow flame and white smoke for a minimum of forty minutes and a maximum of sixty minutes. It is visible for at least three miles under normal operating conditions.","The Mk 58 Mod 1 marine location marker consists of a cylindrical tin can approximately 21.78 inches long and 5.03 inches in diameter. The can contains two pyrotechnic candles of a red phosphorus composition. The ignition end of the marker has three holes-two for smoke and flame emission and one for water to enter the Mk 72 Mod 1 seawater-activated battery. Adhesive foil disks hermetically seal the two emission holes. A reinforced adhesive foil strip with a rectangular pull ring hermetically seals the battery cavity hole. The adhesive foil seals are protected during handling and shipping by a replaceable polyethylene protective cover.","Other examples of contemporary markers are the Mk 25 Mod 2 and 3 marine location markers that are launched from aircraft or surface craft. They are launched from aircraft to provide day or night reference points for marking the course of enemy submarines in antisubmarine warfare operations. They are suitable for any type of sea-surface reference-point marking that calls for both smoke and flame for a period of 10 to 20 minutes. Mk 25 Mod 2 and 3 function identically. The only significant difference is that Mk 25 Mod 2 contains two seawater-activated batteries and two related squibs, while Mod 3 contains a single battery and a single squib.","The Mk 25 marker consists of a cylindrical outer tube about 18.5 inches long and 2.9 inches in diameter. A valve assembly is fitted into the projecting chimney at the marker's nose end. The smoke and flame are emitted from this opening. At the opposite end is a heavier aluminum base assembly to which the outer tube is crimped. The heavy base end causes the marker to float in the water with the chimney out of the water and the base in the water. Within the base assembly is a Mk 72 Mod 0 seawater-activated battery (two batteries in the Mod 2). The battery is shielded from water contact by two plugs fitted into \u00bd-inch holes on two opposite sides of the base assembly. A rigid cover, or arming plate held in place by a retainer ring, is recessed into the base end. An arrow in the center of the arming plate indicates its safe or armed position. The words SAFE and ARMED are stamped into the base rim. Also, a machined notch in the rim at the armed position helps during night use. When the arming plate is in the safe position, it physically blocks the base plugs internally to prevent them from being accidentally pushed in. When in the armed position, the arming plate no longer blocks the base plugs, allowing them to be pushed in at the appropriate time. A black rubber O-ring circles the base assembly approximately \u00bc inch from the crimp, which holds the outer case. To activate the seawater battery, the base plugs are pushed in before the marker is actually launched. An electric squib ignites the marker, and the seawater-activated battery (two batteries and two squibs in Mod 2) supplies power. When the marker enters the water, seawater enters the battery cavity and serves as an electrolyte, causing the battery to produce a current that activates the squib. The squib ignites the starter mix, which, in turn, ignites the red phosphorous pyrotechnic composition.","Gas buildup forces the valve assembly from the chimney in the nose, and yellow flame and white smoke are emitted. Burning time averages 13.5 to 18.5 minutes. Although this marker is normally used in seawater, it can be used in inland bodies of fresh water by using table salt.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a long-lasting, effective marker that does not emit flame or smoke and may be activated at designated times to aid searchers find a specific location on land or at sea.","An object of the invention is to provide a marker for use on land or at sea to attract attention without generating flame or smoke.","Another object of the invention is to provide a cost-effective marker to that does not rely on volumes of flame or smoke to attract attention.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker not generating a large flame to enable its use on shipwrecks containing floating flammable liquids or on land sites near flammables or near planes, helicopters, or landing crafts.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker having an extended operational capability in excess of sixty minutes.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker that does not create a large smoke plume that would otherwise generate oxygen-depriving noxious compounds and obscure visibility at a place where operational visual awareness is a critical commodity.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker that can be activated at designated times to be compatible with a network-centric electronic battlefield that requires precise operational timing of lane marking events with remote command & control capabilities to effect full reprogramming of a mission.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker that solves the problem of the blooming effect associated with the use of cholesteric light-panel technology to allow the use of night vision goggles (NVGs) without blooming caused by a light source.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker using reflective displays set in a flexible polyester substrate to allow the packaging of a large inflatable light source structure in a small container.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker having a capability for providing short and long-range detection of an infrared signal\/beacon by using NVGs and under adverse weather conditions by using arrays of pulsed infrared laser diodes.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker using NVGs and arrays of pulsed infrared laser diodes operating in the portion of the infrared spectrum that does not cause NVG blooming.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker using infrared laser diodes in conjunction with cholesteric displays to provide a balanced approach to trade-off short versus long-range visibility (detectability) versus power consumption.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker having at least one array of pulsed infrared laser diodes that uses a photocell device to turn itself on\/off at dusk\/dawn.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker using a self-contained clear lens covering a visual\/daytime light-beacon strobe light that uses a photocell device to turn itself on\/off at dawn\/dusk.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker using a radar-beam reflecting inflatable-structure that is covered in a sectional\/segmented manner with reflective flexible cholesteric light-panels.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker providing a self-scuttling capability with user selected operational time and using a simple electronic circuit clock to delay the opening of a scuttling valve.","Another object of the invention is to provide a marker providing a self-scuttling capability after deployment and sensing removal of a safety pin and a safety lanyard to assure opening of a scuttling valve by an electronic circuit clock in accordance with the user selected operational time and delays.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to a marker for attracting attention to a designated site or location. A battery and electronics section has a battery module and electronics module having a computer. The battery module connects power to the electronics module for creating responsive power-activation signals. An inflatable bag section is connected to the battery and electronics section and has an inflator and flexible bag. The flexible bag is at least partially metalized to reflect radar signals and has cholesteric liquid crystal display strips. The strips are connected to receive the power-activation signals from the battery and electronics section and are made visible to radiation from a remotely located search beacon. A beacon section is connected to the battery and electronics section and the inflatable bag section. The beacon section has IR laser diode arrays arranged in a circular pattern and a strobe light. The IR laser diode arrays and strobe light are coupled to receive the power-activation signals from the battery and electronics section to emit IR radiation and to emit visible radiation, respectively. A sealed, dome-shaped transparent cap of the beacon section covers the circular IR laser diode arrays and strobe light and supports the circular IR laser diode arrays. An RF antenna is embedded in the transparent cap and is connected to the battery and electronics section to receive and pass remotely originating RF control signals to the electronics module. A user control panel assembly is connected to the battery and electronics section and has controls for presetting the operation of the cholesteric liquid crystal display strips, the IR laser diode arrays, and the strobe light prior to deployment. A safety lanyard is connected to the electronics module for inhibiting generation of the power-activation signals and a ball-lock safety pin is connected to the inflator for inhibiting inflation of the flexible bag. A scuttling device is connected to the electronics module to create an opening for flooding in water.","Referring to  of the drawings, non-flammable land and sea marker  of the invention is schematically depicted prior to deployment. Marker  can be used more universally and reliably as compared to many contemporary markers since marker  of the invention does not emit hazardous flames or plumes of dense smoke to attract attention. Marker  can be used to locate a particular site be it on water , land  or above in air .","Marker  has three interconnected sections: a battery and electronics section , an inflatable structure section  and a beacon section . These three sections ,  and  are packaged together in a compact cylindrical shape measuring about fifteen inches in diameter that can be safely stowed for long periods of time in depots or onboard marine vessels or aircraft until marker  is needed to mark a designated site (location). Battery and electronics section  weighs more than inflatable structure section  and beacon section  This weight distribution holds beacon section  in air  above inflatable structure section  and water  when marker  is deployed and floats on water  as shown in FIG. .","Leads (to be described) for coupling power-activation signals and other signals (to be described) are schematically shown as being straight leads extending the shortest distance between associated components to avoid confusion in the drawings. It is understood that the leads would most likely be coiled arrangements having sufficient lengths to maintain electrical interconnections as marker  is inflated and deflated during deployment as explained below.","Battery and electronics section  has a water proof enclosure  that assures protection from environmental abuses and seals a battery module  from ambient water  and air . Battery module  couples power (shown as arrow A) over a lead B extending to an electronics module . Electronics module  may include a computer  that has appropriate software and operating instructions to transform the data of different inputted control signals to be described into selective power-activation signals to be described. The power-activation signals are coupled from electronics module  of battery and electronics section  to activate other components (to be described) that are mostly located in sections  and  to draw attention to the location of marker . Battery and electronics section  can additionally have a scuttling device  for creating an opening for some of water  to flood marker . Scuttling device  can be a valve mechanism or explosive controlled by power-activation signal. (shown as arrow ) over lead  from electronics module  to flood or rupture marker  or otherwise make it non-retrievable (e.g. shattered or sunk) after its period of usefulness has ended.","A sealed user control panel assembly  is mounted on one side of enclosure  and is connected to battery and electronics section . Prior to deployment of marker  on water  or land , user control panel assembly  allows a deploying operator to preset an activation sequence of components of marker  or permit a desired activation sequence to be initiated by remotely originating RF control signals  from a remote command station . User control panel assembly  has an anchor point  (or loop) for an anchor line A for securing marker  in water  or on land .","User control panel assembly  has a safety lanyard port  that receives a safety lanyard A extending into electronics module . A ball-lock safety pin A extends through enclosure  of battery and electronics section  and is coupled to an electro-mechanical inflator  of inflatable structure section  that includes a pressurized gas cylinder . Inflator  can be activated (either inflating or deflating a flexible bag  of inflatable structure section ) from electronics module  by power-activation signals (shown as arrow A) over an interconnecting lead B after safety pin A has been withdrawn.","When safety lanyard A is in place in safety lanyard port , generation of power-activation signals in electronics module  is inhibited (prevented) to prevent activation of inflator  and other components (to be described) of sections  and . When ball-lock safety pin A engages inflator , inflation of flexible bag  and consequent mechanical displacements of sections  and  of marker  are inhibited (prevented).","Referring to , in addition to anchor point  and safety lanyard port , user control panel assembly  has a current date\/time set-control  with associated display A and control buttons B and C, remote-control yes button A and remote-control no button B, a delay firing-control  with associated display A and control button B, a date\/time start-operation control  with associated display A and control buttons B, C, and a date\/time, end-operation control  with associated display A and control buttons B, C.","Current date\/time set control  is connected to computer  of electronics module  and is set by an operator to provide a starting or reference basis for future activation sequences, and remote-control-yes button A or remote-control-no buttons B can be selectively switched by an operator to control interconnected electronics module  and computer  to enable or disable a capability for activating some or all components of sections  and  of marker  by RF control signals  from remote source . Delay firing-control  can be preset by an operator to delay the activation of some or all components of marker . Start-operation control  and end-operation control  are connected to computer  and can be set by appropriately pushing buttons B, C and B, C to turn on and\/or turn off some or all components of marker  at one or more intervals some time after deployment of marker . Displays A, A, A, and A can provide a visual indication for reference of current date\/time and date\/time of activations scheduled in user control panel assembly .","Inflatable structure section  has a frangible wall  containing a large and strong folded flexible thin-walled plastic bag  connected to inflator . Frangible wall  has sufficient strength and toughness to remain intact when marker  is deployed, but wall  shatters into many small pieces when bag  is rapidly inflated by pressurized gas (that may be lighter than air) vented from pressurized gas cylinder  of inflator . Flexible bag  can be made from a wide variety of flexible polyester substrate materials that are strong and air-tight to contain the pressurized gas. One typical flexible polyester material, for example, is the strong flexible thin film material marketed by Dupont Inc. under its trademark MYLAR. When marker  is deployed, folded bag  is inflated by pressurized gas from pressurized gas cylinder  of inflator . The force exerted by expanding bag  shatters frangible wall , and bag  is free to expand to its fully inflated size. The fully inflated size of inflated flexible bag  may be several times the diameter of inflatable structure section  of cylinder-shaped marker  prior to deployment and as schematically depicted in FIG. .","Flexible bag  can have its outer surface metalized entirely or in metalized strips  that can extend vertically from top to bottom around flexible bag  or extend in concentric ring-like configurations or any other patterns of disposition on flexible bag . This coverage of the outer surface assures reflection of impinging radar signals A to assure location of marker  from an airborne or land based radar (not shown).","Strips  (or panels) of cholesteric liquid crystal displays (ChLCDs) are disposed on flexible bag  to be held above water  when marker  is deployed to float on water . ChLCD strips  can be arranged to be interspersed or alternate with metalized strips  around bag . ChLCDS, such as those described in about thirty patents issued to Kent State University and\/or Kent Displays Inc. of Kent Ohio, are well known. ChLCD strips  can exhibit high contrast due to the reflective nature of the cholesteric fluid. A display cell of ChLCD strip  can act as a collection of tiny mirrors, each reflecting 50% of incident light, or radiation. The total amount of light reflected by each cell is affected by the limited bandwidth, angular distribution of the mirrors, and depolarization of the light within the cell. This value can approach the reflectivity of ink on paper, with up to 70% peak reflectivity and a 20:1 contrast ratio.","Cholesteric materials can be formulated in ChLCDs strips  to be visible at night (or by day) by an observer remotely located from marker  that is using an infrared (IR) light source detector of radiation A such as an IR signal\/beacon. One typical IR light source detector is known as night vision goggles (NVGs) that are worn over a wearer's eyes to detect radiated or reflected portions of IR light. ChLCD strips  give a reliable, relatively short range detection capability of marker  that is limited in range by the radiated power of radiation A of an IR search beacon. Radiation A of the IR search beacon is emitted from an air-born or water-born search platform B that can also have the remotely located observer wearing NGVs on board. ChLCDs strips  on marker  solves a problem known as the blooming effect.","The term blooming effect refers to a problem that has persisted over the years and degraded performance of night vision systems when a lighted object enters system's field of view. The lighted objects could be vehicles having headlights on, lighted flashlights or lasers entering an area, brightly lit buildings in an urban setting, and any type of directional or high intensity lighting that illuminates a night vision system. Image blooming occurs immediately which obscures the system's view of objects in the nighttime scene. As a result of the automatic gain control of the imaging tube of the system, the imaging tube saturates from the increased intensity of the bright lights to mask objects in the scene that is trying to be observed. This effect (image blooming) limits night vision system performance for surveillance, targeting, and piloting at night. The reflective cholesteric technology of ChLCD strips  allows the use of NVGs without being susceptible to the blooming effect described above that might otherwise be caused by a radiating light source such as a strobe light  on maker , for example. Thus, ChLCDs strips  can preserve the covertness of stealth missions or augment vision capability of observers using NVGs to enhance the range\/detectability of a signal\/beacon of marker . Within the illuminating range of the IR search beacon, ChLCDs strips  can provide brightest reflective displays with the lowest power consumption.","ChLCD strips  are connected to electronics module  of section  by an activation lead . Activation lead  transmits power-activation signals (shown as arrow ) for activation of ChLCD strips  to enable detection by a remote observer using NVGs for example from selective IR beacon radiation A that impinges on inflated bag  of section .","Beacon and RF antenna section  has a base member  supporting a strobe light  and a sealed, dome-shaped transparent cap . Cap  that covers and supports three circular arrays  of IR laser diodes, and an RF antenna  is embedded in cap . Leads  and  extend from strobe light  and IR laser diode arrays  to respectively couple power-activation signals (shown as arrows A, and A) from electronics module . Lead  extends from embedded RF antenna  to receiver circuitry A in electronics module  to receive and couple remotely originating RF control signals (shown as arrow A on lead  in ) transmitted from a remote craft or command station  to electronics module .","The information of remotely originating RF control signals  is coupled to receiver circuitry A of electronics module  to generate and couple responsive power-activation signals A, A, A, and  over leads B, , , , and  respectively, and remote control of inflator  for inflation and\/or deflation of bag , and activation of ChLCD strips , strobe light , IR diode arrays , and scuttling device . This actuation capability augments the selective actuation of inflator , ChLCD strips , strobe light , IR laser diode arrays  and scuttling device  by user control panel assembly  and electronics module  with computer . In addition, photodiodes A and B can be respectively connected to electronics module  and strobe light  and\/or IR laser diode arrays  via leads  and  to automatically switch or turn strobe light  and\/or IR laser diode arrays  on or off at dawn or dusk.","IR laser diode arrays  of marker  provide a capability for long-range detection by operators wearing NVGs. Pulsing IR laser diode arrays  emit an infrared signal\/beacon that can be effective under adverse weather conditions. The IR laser diodes of arrays  operate or emit IR energy in a portion of the IR spectrum that does not cause blooming in the NVGs. IR laser diode arrays  provide a longer range detectability of marker  as compared to the detectability of ChLCD strips  to give a capability for both long rang and short range detection and provide a balanced approach to tradeoff short-versus-long-range visibility versus power consumption.","In operation, marker  has options to accommodate a wide variety of contingencies and tactical scenarios. When marker  is to be manually deployed at its intended site of operation, an operator can press yes-remote-control button A or no-remote-control button B of user control panel assembly  as desired to use or not use the option for actuation of marker  by remotely originating RF control signals  that are received by embedded RF antenna . The operator can also appropriately set date\/time set control , firing delay control , operation start date\/time control  and operation end date\/time control  of user control panel assembly  for appropriate control signals for a desired activation of constituents of marker . The operator then pulls ball-lock safety pin A from inflator  to allow venting of pressurized gas from pressurized gas container  into flexible bag . so that flexible bag  can expand and break frangible wall  as it mechanically displaces sections  and  of marker . Nearly simultaneously, the operator pulls safety lanyard A from lanyard port , and electronics module  with computer  generates appropriate power-activation signals to initiate an activation sequence of some or all of ChLCD strips , strobe light  and\/or IR laser diode arrays  of marker . ChLCD strips  reduce power drain since the y do not require continuous power. In other words, Once ChLCD strips  are energized, or activated, (i.e., once the desired information is displayed) ChLCD strips  stay that way indefinitely (i.e., the displayed information continuous to be displayed without the need for a power source or subsequent input like a chalkboard that keeps information written on it). The activated components and activation sequence can be predetermined in computer  of electronics module  or in accordance with the settings as just initiated by the deploying operator.","When marker  is to be remotely operated, controls , , , , and  of user control panel assembly  can be preset as described, and marker  is manually loaded into its can-shaped external marker dispenser  that can be remotely operated, see FIG. . Safety lanyard A is manually connected to a spur  inside of marker dispenser . The operator manually removes ball-lock safety pin and manually secures marker  to marker dispenser  by fitting marker  within it. (Marker  is shown in  as being only partially within dispenser .) Marker  can be remotely ejected from dispenser  by a variety of means, such as by receiving RF control signals  at a receiver  that initiates an ejection mechanism . Ejection mechanism  can cause release of a compressed spring (not shown) or detonation of an explosive charge (not shown) etc. to eject marker  out of dispenser . This remote ejection of marker  leaves safety lanyard A attached to dispenser  and pulled from electronics module .","Pulling or extraction of safety lanyard A from electronics module  causes electronics module  of section  to electrically disable by circuit-disconnection date\/time set control , remote control yes button A and remote control no button B, and delay firing-control  of user control panel assembly . Safety lanyard A is pulled from electronics module  to preclude water impact or unauthorized users from changing the mode of operation of marker . After safety lanyard A has been extracted, full command & control of marker  can be done using the remote control option by pressing remote-control-yes button A before ejection of marker .","When the set remote control option was set as \u201cremote control: yes\u201d by switching remote-control-yes button A, electronics module  couples power to remote control circuit associated with control button A. This provides an RF link to RF signal receiver circuitry A in electronics module  via lead  and embedded RF antenna . Remote control of marker  via RF control signals  can now be done as if the remote operator were actually present in marker . Selective ones of inflator , ChLCD strips , and strobe light , and IR laser diode arrays  can be turned on and off by appropriate power-activation signals created as directed by appropriate RF control signals . Scuttling device  could be actuated by RF control signals  as well.","When the set firing delay-time option is used to delay activation of some or all of the constituents of marker  until a future time, delay firing-control  is set by appropriately pressing set delay button B to indicate the desired delay on display A. Electronics module  now can electrically enable delay firing control  by circuit-connection of power from battery module  to delay firing control . Control  and electronics module  count down the selected firing delay-time, and electronics module  sends power-activation signal A over lead B to inflator  that causes inflation (or in some actuation sequences deflation) of flexible bag . Electronics module  can also activate ChLCD strips  by sending circuit-connection power to them as power-activation signals  in response to control signals from control , enable strobe light  by circuit-connection of power-activation signals A to it (with built-in photo cell A), and enable IR laser diode arrays  by circuit-connection of power-activation signals A to them (with built-in photo cell B).","When the set operation start date\/time option is used to start activation of some or all of the constituents of marker  at a future time, then date\/time start-operation control  is set by appropriately pushing set date and set time buttons B, Cs to the desired date and time that is shown on display A. Electronic module  now can electrically enable date\/time start-operation control  by circuit-connection of power from battery module  to date\/time start-operation control . Control  and electronics module  begin to count down to the selected time and date to create and send power-activation signals in response to control signals from control  for activation of selected constituents of marker . These constituents can include inflator , ChLCD strips , strobe light , and IR laser diode arrays  as described above.","When the set operation end date\/time option is used to end activation of some or all the constituents of marker  at a future time, then date\/time end-operation control  is set by appropriately pushing set date and set time buttons B, Cs to the desired date and time that is shown on display A. Electronic module  now can electrically enable date\/time end-operation control  by circuit-connection of power from battery module  to date\/time end-operation control . Control  and electronics module  begin to count down to the selected time and date, and in response to control signals from control , electronics module  can send power-activation signal A over lead B to inflator  that causes deflation of flexible bag  or a power-activation signal  over lead  to scuttling device  to scuttle marker . Optionally, control  and electronics module  can also deactivate ChLCD strips  by interrupting power to them, disable strobe light  by interrupting power to it, and disable IR laser diode arrays  by interrupting power to them.","Marker  of the invention has an extended operational capability as compared to contemporary systems that are limited to no more than about sixty minutes. Marker  does not generate a flame or smoke plume whereas many contemporary markers create large smoke plumes of oxygen depriving noxious compounds that may affect victims and rescue personnel or obscure observation at a place where operational visual awareness is a critical commodity. The design of other state-of-the art marker systems generates a large flame plume, and consequently requires complicated features to ensure safe use, resulting in increased cost and decreased operational capabilities. In addition, contrary to state-of-the-art marker systems, marker  can be made compatible with a network-centric electronic battlefield that requires precise operational timing of lane marking events and has remote command & control capabilities to effect full reprogramming of a mission.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of marker  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Marker  could have different combinations of attention-getting displays without resorting to flame and smoke of contemporary marker systems. Marker  has long shelf life and is in a compact package for accompanying rapidly moving forces until needed.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Marker  provides for location of a designated site without relying on the flames and smoke of contemporary markers that might otherwise compromise its effectiveness and a possibly covert marking of a designated site for successful completion of tasks. Therefore, marker , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
