No. 11\/540,574 filed Oct. 02, 2006, now issued as U.S Pat. No. 7,357,497 which is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/336,773 filed Jan. 23, 2006, now issued as U.S Pat. No. 7,156,512, which is a Continuation of U.S application Ser. No. 11\/144,805 filed Jun. 6, 2005, now issued as U.S Pat. No. 7,086,724, which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 10\/831,236 filed Apr. 26, 2004, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,077,515, which is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/1 12,743 filed on Jul. 10, 1998, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,727,951, all of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to digital cameras and in particular, the onboard processing of image data captured by the camera.","Recently, digital cameras have become increasingly popular. These cameras normally operate by means of imaging a desired image utilising a charge coupled device (CCD) array and storing the imaged scene on an electronic storage medium for later down loading onto a computer system for subsequent manipulation and printing out. Normally, when utilising a computer system to print out an image, sophisticated software may available to manipulate the image in accordance with requirements.","Unfortunately such systems require significant post processing of a captured image and normally present the image in an orientation to which it was taken, relying on the post processing process to perform any necessary or required modifications of the captured image. Also, much of the environmental information available when the picture was taken is lost. Furthermore, the type or size of the media substrate and the types of ink used to print the image can also affect the image quality. Accounting for these factors during post processing of the captured image data can be complex and time consuming.","The present Applicant addresses these issues with a digital camera having an image processor takes account of the lighting conditions at the time of image capture, and confirms the type of ink and media, in order to enhance the quality of the printed image. This camera is described below and in many of the cross referenced documents incorporated herein by reference.","One particular feature of this camera is the instant production of personalised postcards using an inbuilt printhead. This requires a media cartridge that holds a reasonable amount of print media while remaining compact enough to keep the overall dimensions of the camera and cartridge acceptable to users.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a media cartridge for supplying print media to a printhead, the cartridge comprising:","a roll of print media;","a casing with a rotatable core for supporting the media roll;","an ink supply within the core;","at least one ink outlet at one end of the core for establishing fluid communication between the ink supply and the printhead;","a drive roller assembly for engaging an external drive to feed the print media to the printhead; wherein,","the longitudinal axes of the core, and rollers of the drive roller assembly are parallel.","A media cartridge adopting this design is particularly compact, has a high media and ink capacity and relatively cost effective to manufacture. The majority of the components can be made from injection molded plastics and snap fitted together.","In some embodiments, the core is segmented with different coloured inks stored in each of the segments, wherein each of the segments has a respective ink outlet in the end of the core.","Preferably, the drive roller assembly comprises at least one media de-curling roller; such that, as the media is fed to the printhead, it wraps around a portion of the at least one de-curling roller to remove residual curl caused by storage as a roll.","Providing the media in a roll allows the cartridge to be small and compact. However, the curl imparted to the media from being stored as a roll can interfere with printing when the media substrate passes the printhead. Using a de-curling roller within the drive rollers can straighten the media enough for flat engagement with the platen opposite the printhead.","The invention will be described with respect to its use with a digital camera with an inbuilt printhead. However, it will be appreciated that this is merely illustrative and the invention has clear application in many other fields.","Preferably, the cartridge has one de-curling roller and two pinch rollers, wherein the pinch rollers maintain the media substrate wrapped around the required portion of the de-curling roller. In a further preferred form, one of the pinch rollers is driven. In some forms, the driven pinch roller has a geared axle that extends beyond the casing for engagement with an external drive source via a corresponding gear.","Preferably, and an outer cover enclosing the roll and the drive roller assembly, the outer cover comprising two interengaging side moldings that snap lock together to form a media outlet slot adjacent the drive roller assembly. Preferably, one side of the slot has a resilient guide extending away from the slot for resilient engagement with a paper path leading to the printhead upon installation of the cartridge. In particular embodiments, the printhead is controlled by an image processor and the cartridge further comprises an authentication chip for confirming the suitability of the ink and the media to the image processor.","In a particularly preferred form, the cartridge is configured for engagement with a cartridge interface such that the ink outlets establish fluid communication with the printhead, the image processor accesses the authentication chip, the geared axle of the drive roller engages the external drive and the resilient guide extending from the outlet slot engages the paper feed path, in a single installation action.","According to a related aspect, there is provided a digital camera for use with a media cartridge comprising a supply of media substrate on which images can be printed, and an information store with information relating to the media substrate, the camera comprising:","an image sensor for capturing an image;","an image processor for processing image data from the image sensor and transmitting processed data to a printhead; and,","a cartridge interface for accessing the information such that the image processor can utilise the information relating to the media substrate.","The camera accesses information about the media substrate so that the image processor can utilise the information to enhance the quality of the printed image.","Preferably, the media substrate has postcard formatting printed on its reverse surface so that the camera can produce personalised postcards, and the information store has the dimensions of the postcard formatting to allow the image processor to align printed images with the postcard formatting.","In a further preferred form the cartridge further comprises an ink supply for the printhead and the information store is an authentication chip that allows the image processor to confirm that the media substrate and the ink supply is suitable for use with the camera.\n\n","an image processor for processing image data from the CCD and storing the processed data; wherein,","the image processor is adapted to use information from the auto exposure setting relating to the lighting conditions at image capture when processing the image data from the CCD.","Utilising the auto exposure setting to determine an advantageous re-mapping of colours within the image allows the processor to produce an amended image having colours within an image transformed to account of the auto exposure setting. The processing can comprise re-mapping image colours so they appear deeper and richer when the exposure setting indicates low light conditions and re-mapping image colours to be brighter and more saturated when the auto exposure setting indicates bright light conditions.","The preferred embodiment is preferable implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in the present applicant's application entitled \u201cA Digital Image Printing Camera with Image Processing Capability\u201d, the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference and the details of which, and other related applications are set out in the tables below.","The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an \u201cArtcam\u201d type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit. Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.","In the preferred embodiment, the Artcam has an auto exposure sensor for determining the light level associated with the captured image. This auto exposure sensor is utilised to process the image in accordance with the set light value so as to enhance portions of the image.","Preferably, the area image sensor includes a means for determining the light conditions when capturing an image. The area image sensor adjusts the dynamic range of values captured by the CCD in accordance with the detected level sensor. The captured image is transferred to the Artcam central processor and stored in the memory store. Intensity information, as determined by the area image sensor, is also forwarded to the ACP. This information is utilised by the Artcam central processor to manipulate the stored image to enhance certain effects.","Turning now to , the auto exposure setting information  is utilised in conjunction with the stored image  to process the image by utilising the ACP. The processed image is returned to the memory store for later printing out  on the output printer.","A number of processing steps can be undertaken in accordance with the determined light conditions. Where the auto exposure setting  indicates that the image was taken in a low light condition, the image pixel colours are selectively re-mapped so as to make the image colours stronger, deeper and richer.","Where the auto exposure information indicates that highlight conditions were present when the image was taken, the image colours can be processed to make them brighter and more saturated. The re-colouring of the image can be undertaken by conversion of the image to a hue-saturation-value (HSV) format and an alteration of pixel values in accordance with requirements. The pixel values can then be output converted to the required output colour format of printing.","Of course, many different re-colouring techniques may be utilised. Preferably, the techniques are clearly illustrated on the pre-requisite Artcard inserted into the reader. Alternatively, the image processing algorithms can be automatically applied and hard-wired into the camera for utilization in certain conditions.","Alternatively, the Artcard inserted could have a number of manipulations applied to the image which are specific to the auto-exposure setting. For example, clip arts containing candles etc could be inserted in a dark image and large suns inserted in bright images.","Referring now to , the Artcam prints the images onto media stored in a replaceable print roll . In some preferred embodiments, the operation of the camera device is such that when a series of images is printed on a first surface of the print roll, the corresponding backing surface has a ready made postcard which can be immediately dispatched at the nearest post office box within the jurisdiction. In this way, personalized postcards can be created.","It would be evident that when utilising the postcard system as illustrated  only predetermined image sizes are possible as the synchronization between the backing postcard portion and the front image must be maintained. This can be achieved by utilising the memory portions of the authentication chip stored within the print roll  to store details of the length of each postcard backing format sheet. This can be achieved by either having each postcard the same size or by storing each size within the print rolls on-board print chip memory.","In an alternative embodiment, there is provided a modified form of print roll which can be constructed mostly from injection moulded plastic pieces suitably snapped fitted together. The modified form of print roll has a high ink storage capacity in addition to a somewhat simplified construction. The print media onto which the image is to be printed is wrapped around a plastic sleeve former for simplified construction. The ink media reservoir has a series of air vents which are constructed so as to minimise the opportunities for the ink flow out of the air vents. Further, a rubber seal is provided for the ink outlet holes with the rubber seal being pierced on insertion of the print roll into a camera system. Further, the print roll includes a print media ejection slot and the ejection slot includes a surrounding moulded surface which provides and assists in the accurate positioning of the print media ejection slot relative to the printhead within the printing or camera system.","Turning to  there is illustrated a single point roll unit  in an assembled form with a partial cutaway showing internal portions of the print roll.  and  illustrate left and right side exploded perspective views respectively. The print roll  is constructed around the internal core portion  which contains an internal ink supply. Outside of the core portion  is provided a former  around which is wrapped a paper or film supply . Around the paper supply it is constructed two cover pieces ,  which snap together around the print roll so as to form a covering unit as illustrated in . The bottom cover piece  includes a slot  through which the output of the print media  for interconnection with the camera system.","Two pinch rollers ,  are provided to pinch the paper against a drive pinch roller  so they together provide for a decurling of the paper around the roller . The decurling acts to negate the strong curl that may be imparted to the paper from being stored in the form of print roll for an extended period of time. The rollers ,  are provided to form a snap fit with end portions of the cover base portion  and the roller  which includes a cogged end  for driving, snap fits into the upper cover piece  so as to pinch the paper  firmly between.","The cover pieces ,  includes an end protuberance or lip . The end lip  is provided for accurate alignment of the exit hole of the paper with a corresponding printing heat platen structure within the camera system. In this way, accurate alignment or positioning of the exiting paper relative to an adjacent printhead is provided for full guidance of the paper to the printhead.","It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and\/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","The present invention is best utilized in the Artcam device, the details of which are set out in the following paragraphs.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric inkjet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewide print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the inkjet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:\n\n","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. 45 different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below.","The inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the inkjet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","The following table is a guide to cross-referenced patent applications filed concurrently herewith and discussed
