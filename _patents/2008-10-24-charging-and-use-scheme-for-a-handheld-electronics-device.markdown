No. 60\/983,121, filed Oct. 26, 2007, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to hand-held electronics devices and, more specifically, to a charging and use scheme for a hand-held electronics device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Digital video camera (DVC) technology has developed rapidly over the past decade. A broad variety of DVCs are now available to meet the diverse needs of a wide spectrum of consumers. DVCs enable users to record video and audio clips and enable users to transfer the recorded video and audio data to a computer-readable medium through some form of connector that couples the DVC to a computer. The computer-readable medium may be, for example, a Digital Video Disc (DVD) or a computer memory. Once video and audio data is transferred to the computer memory, the user can modify or edit the video and audio data using conventional editing software.","One problem often encountered by DVC users involves maintaining the charge level of the DVC battery. As is known, most conventional DVCs operate using battery power, which is supplied by a non-removable rechargeable battery or by one or more removable, replaceable, and\/or rechargeable batteries. Battery-powered DVCs may operate normally for several hours, but eventually the battery power drains, and the DVC powers off. With some designs, to recharge the DVC, a user typically has to plug the DVC into an external power source, such as an AC outlet. However, if an AC outlet is not readily available, or if the user does not have a power cord that can couple the DVC to the AC outlet, then the DVC battery cannot be recharged, and the user cannot record video or audio clips or otherwise use the DVC.","Other designs allow the DVC to be recharged through the data port of a computer system, such as a USB port of a laptop computer. However, these designs typically do not allow the user to interact with the data files stored on the DVC in any type of sophisticated fashion while the DVC is charging. As used herein, \u201cinteracting\u201d includes accessing the data files when requested by the user and performing operations other than simple playing back or copy operations. Interacting with data files, includes, without limitation, editing the data files, merging the data files, uploading the data files to a server machine and\/or deleting data files. For example, prior art DVC designs, and similar prior art mp3 player designs, only offer the options of playing back a video file or song stored on the device or streaming the video file or song on the computer system to which the device is connected. No other more sophisticated types of interactions are permitted. Thus, when a conventional DVC or other hand-held electronic device is connected a USB port and charging, the user is quite limited in the types of operations he\/she can perform on the data stored on the DVC or other hand-held electronics device.","Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for more flexible, user-oriented charging scheme for DVCs.","One embodiment sets forth a method for modifying video content stored on a hand-held digital video camera (DVC). The method includes transmitting video data to a computer system to which the hand-held DVC is coupled via a data connector, receiving a request for a set of instructions related to a processing operation being performed on the computer system and involving the video data, transmitting the set of instructions to the computer system via the data connector. The method also includes drawing power from the computer system via the data connector and charging at least in part a battery associated with the hand-held DVC with the power drawn from the computer system, where the hand-held DVC remains coupled to the computer system via the data connector for the steps of transmitting, receiving, drawing and charging.","Other embodiments of the invention include a computer-readable medium that stores instructions that can configure a processing unit to implement one or more variations of the above method as well as a hand-held digital video camera having a memory that stores instructions for implementing one or more variations of the above method.","Advantageously, embodiments of the invention enables the battery or batteries of a digital video camera to be charged while a user has the digital video camera connected to a computer system to access and manipulate video content stored in the memory included within the digital video camera.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without one or more of these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in order to avoid obscuring the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","160","164","166","102","166","164","160","102","102","102","160","102","160","162"]},"The HHD  includes, without limitation, a data connector , a speaker , a microphone , a power supply , a battery , optical components , a digital video image sensor , a central processing unit (CPU) , a digital viewfinder , interface buttons , an internal memory , a secondary processor , and a gas gauge . In one embodiment, the HHD  is a digital video camera.","The data connector  is an integrated mechanism that allows the HHD  to be coupled to the computer system  or to a separate TV, and to transfer data to and from the computer system  and\/or output video and audio to the TV. The data connector  may be a universal serial bus (USB) connector, a firewire connector, a HDMI connector, a serial connector, or another type of connector that is capable of connecting the HHD  with the computer system  or the TV. In alternative embodiments, the data connector  is not an integrated mechanism and may include a cable connector.","When in record mode, the HHD  is configured to capture video and audio of a particular scene through the optical components  and the microphone , respectively. The optical components , which may include one or more lenses, capture the scene and direct light associated with the scene onto the digital video image sensor . The digital video image sensor  converts the captured image into digital video data and then transmits the digital video data to the CPU  for further processing. The digital viewfinder  displays an image of the scene being captured while the corresponding video and audio data is being recorded. When in playback mode, the HHD  is configured to \u201cplay\u201d digital videos (comprised of captured video and audio data) that are stored in the internal memory . The video data is displayed on the digital viewfinder , and the audio data is output through the speaker . In alternative embodiments, the digital video and audio data may be output to the TV or to a computer system for playback.","The interface buttons  may include mechanical buttons, such as a power button  and a record button . In a preferred embodiment, the other interface buttons, including a left button , a right button , a increase button , a decrease button , a play\/pause button , and a delete button  are implemented as capacitive-touch buttons. In alternative embodiments, these other interface buttons may be implemented as induction buttons, analog-resistive buttons, or any other technically feasible button type that can be engaged by the user in an electrically conductive manner.","The power supply  provides power stored in the battery  to the other components of the HHD , such as the CPU , the secondary processor , and the gas gauge . Although not explicitly shown, the power supply  also provides power to the other components included within the HHD , including the speaker , the microphone , the digital viewfinder , the optical components , the digital video image sensor , the interface buttons , and the internal memory . Additionally, the power supply  is configured to convert power received from the computer system  or the AC adapter  to charge the battery  and\/or to provide power to the components included within the HHD . In one embodiment, the battery  is a non-removable rechargeable battery. In alternative embodiments, the battery  may include one or more removable and\/or replaceable batteries. The battery  may be a lithium ion battery or any other technically feasible type of battery.","The CPU  communicates with the various components within the HHD  to control the operations of the HHD . The CPU  may be implemented as a single chip or as a combination of multiple chips. The CPU  also processes inputs from the interface buttons . For example, when the HHD  is in record mode, the CPU  transmits the digital video data received from the digital video image sensor  to the digital viewfinder  for display. Similarly, the CPU  may transmit the recorded audio and video data to the internal memory  for storage. The recorded audio and video data may be stored as separately or together as part of a composite video file.","The secondary processor  is a microcontroller that includes a processor core, a memory, and an input\/output interface (none shown). The memory of the microcontroller stores instructions that, when executed by the processor core of the microcontroller, cause the various features and functions associated with the secondary processor  described herein to be implemented.","The secondary processor  assists the CPU  in managing the interaction of the various components of the HHD . For example, the secondary processor  is configured to determine the type of external power source to which the data connector  is coupled (e.g., to the computer system  via the USB port or to the AC adapter ). The secondary processor  may also manage input signals received from the various interface buttons.","In addition, the secondary processor  is configured to verify, when the HHD  is powered off, whether the battery  has enough charge to enable the CPU  to boot without causing damage to the CPU . As is well-known, a certain threshold level of charge should be received by the CPU  or order to boot properly. If the battery  has the requisite level of charge, then the secondary processor  allows the CPU  to boot normally. However, if the battery  does not have the requisite level of charge, then the secondary processor  prevents the CPU  from booting until the battery  is recharged to attain the requisite level of charge. In this manner, the secondary processor provides a \u201cfail-safe\u201d mechanism that ensures that the CPU  is not damaged when a user attempts to power on the HHD . Further, such a fail-safe mechanism also protects the battery , which may sometimes be damaged if allowed to fully discharge. For example, if the battery  is implemented as a lithium ion battery, maintaining some minimum amount of charge in the battery  lengthens the lifespan and charging ability of the battery .","The secondary processor  is configured to determine the level of charge in the battery  by querying the gas gauge . The gas gauge  is a microcontroller configured to provide accurate battery power level gauging, including generating low-battery interrupt warnings. The gas gauge  receives status signals from the battery  and, based on those signals, generates predictions for battery capacity and other operational characteristics of the battery . When queried by the secondary processor , the gas gauge  may be configured to provide charge status information to the secondary processor , including state-of-charge (i.e., USB or AC power), time-to-empty, time-to-full (when charging), time remaining at a specified current, time remaining at an average current, percentage of capacity remaining, and power (mWh) remaining, among others. In one embodiment, the gas gauge  is coupled to the secondary processor  via an inter-integrated circuit (IC) interface. In alternative embodiments, the CPU , the secondary processor  and gas gauge  may be combined on a single chip or may reside on combinations of different chips.","The internal memory  comprises either volatile memory, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), non-volatile memory, such as a hard disk or a flash memory module, or a combination of both volatile and non-volatile memory. The internal memory  stores the composite video files as well as firmware that is executed by the CPU  and the secondary processor  to control the operations of the HHD . The internal memory  also stores one or more software drivers  implemented as a set of program instructions configured to coordinate operations between the interface buttons  and the other components of the HHD , including the CPU , the secondary processor , and the gas gauge , as described in greater detail herein. For example, the program instructions that constitute the one or more drivers  may be executed by the CPU , the secondary processor , and\/or the gas gauge  to cause the different battery charging modes described herein to be implemented.","A software application  also resides within the internal memory . In one embodiment, the software application  is an audio\/video editing application that is stored in a non-volatile memory portion within the internal memory . When a connection between the HHD  and the computer system  is detected, an operating system stored within the memory  and executing on the computer system  is configured to automatically execute the software application . For example, the operating system may be configured to check the contents of the non-volatile memory portion of the internal memory  for a file, such as an \u201cautoplay.inf\u201d file, that causes the software application  to be automatically executed. In alternative embodiments, the software application  may instead be executed by the operating system based on a request from the user to execute the software application .","In one embodiment, the software application , when executed by the operating system included in the computer system , is configured to produce a graphical user interface (GUI) on a display device associated with the computer system . The GUI may present a user with graphical controls to allow the user to perform various video processing operations. Such video processing operations may include copying composite video files from the internal memory  to the memory  accessible to the computer system , playing composite video files, deleting composite video files from the internal memory , editing composite video files stored in the internal memory , merging two composite video files stored in the internal memory , attaching a composite video file to an email message, or uploading a composite video file to an online server.","Upon execution, the software application  also checks the computer system  to determine whether other software elements that provide the infrastructure necessary for the software application  to function fully are installed on the computer system . Such elements are referred to herein as \u201csoftware infrastructure elements,\u201d and these elements also reside within the non-volatile memory portion of the internal memory  of the HHD . Examples of such software infrastructure elements include compression-decompression algorithms (codecs)  and video drivers . If one or more of the requisite software infrastructure elements are not installed on the computer system , then the software application  causes those software infrastructure elements to be copied from the HHD  and installed in the computer system . For example, the software application  may determine that certain codecs  and\/or video drivers  are not installed on the computer system . In such a case, the software application  would automatically copy and install the codecs  and\/or video drivers  to the computer system  without additional user intervention. In other embodiments, the software application  may wait for verification from a user before installing any missing software infrastructure elements on the computer system . To facilitate verifying the existence of requisite software infrastructure elements on the computer system , the software application  may add entries or keys to the registry of the computer system . Then, when the HHD  is subsequently connected to the same computer system , the software application  can simply check the registry entries or keys to determine which codecs , video drivers , and\/or other software infrastructure elements are already installed on the computer system .","When the HHD  is connected to the computer system , and a user requests that a video processing operation be performed, the software application  causes the CPU  to transmit only the composite video file(s) relevant to that video processing operation from the internal memory  to the memory  within the computer system . The video processing operations are then performed by the processor included in the computer system . Once the copy operations have completed and the composite video files are modified, the modified composite video files may be transmitted back to the internal memory  for storage and\/or stored locally on the computer system . Advantageously, as described in greater detail herein, while the HHD  is connected to the computer system  so that a user can perform processing operations on video content stored on the HHD , the battery  may be charging via the data connector  and the power supply . Offloading the video processing operations to the computer system  in this fashion leverages the processing infrastructure of the computer system , thereby reducing the processing cycles of the CPU , which enables the battery  to charge more quickly.","In addition, when the software application  is executing on the computer system , the software application  is configured to copy other supporting software components such as software libraries , application programming interfaces (APIs), and\/or other application files stored within the internal memory  of the HHD  to the computer system , as needed, to support the video processing operations being performed on the computer system . Since such supporting software components are transferred to the computer system  only when necessary to perform a requested video processing operation, less data is transferred between the HHD  and the computer system  when processing video content, thereby reducing the processing cycles of the CPU , which enables the battery  to charge more quickly.","As the foregoing conveys, when the HHD  is connected to the computer system  so that video processing operations can by performed on the video content stored on the HHD , the software application  accesses the relevant composite video files and any necessary software infrastructure elements from the internal memory  of the HHD  and also accesses other supporting software components stored in the internal memory  on an ongoing basis. Further, the modified composite video files may optionally be transmitted back to the internal memory  for storage. Thus, the HHD  remains coupled to the computer system  while the software application  is executing and video processing operations are being performed. Such a use scenario provides an opportunity to charge the battery  via the computer system , as described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["102","102","202","152","240","106","112","236","152","102","152","240","102","102","202","106","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["102","102","204","104","118","124","126","128","130","132","134","136","204","126","134","128","136","132","130"]},"In one embodiment, the record button , the play\/pause button , and the delete button , collectively, may be considered the \u201cprimary\u201d interface buttons ; whereas, the remaining interface buttons  may be considered \u201csecondary.\u201d The secondary interface buttons  are \u201cflat\u201d CT buttons that lie in the same plane as the back side  of the HHD .

As described below in , the secondary processor  allows the CPU  to boot only after confirming that the battery  has a pre-determined, requisite level of charge. At step , the secondary processor  causes the operating system executing on the computer system  to enumerate the HHD  as a USB storage device. Enumerating the HHD  allows the computer system  to access content stored in the internal memory  within the HHD , such as the software application , the codecs , the video drivers , the software libraries , the APIs , and any other software infrastructure elements or supporting software components needed for the application  to execute properly on the computer system .","At step , the CPU  causes the software application to be uploaded to the memory  in the computer system .

The method  then proceed to step . If, at step , all of the requisite software infrastructure elements, including all necessary codecs  and video drivers , are installed on the computer system , then the method  proceeds directly to step .","At step , the software application  receives a request from the user to perform one or more video processing operations on certain video content stored within the internal memory  of the HHD . The one or more video processing operations may include, without limitation, transferring composite video files from the internal memory  to the memory  within the computer system , playing composite video files, deleting composite video files from the internal memory , editing composite video files stored in the internal memory , merging two composite video files stored in the internal memory , attaching a composite video file to an email message, or uploading a composite video file to an online server.","At step , the CPU  within the HHD  causes any software libraries , APIs  or other supporting software components required to perform the one or more video processing operations to be uploaded from the internal memory  of the HHD  to the computer system . At step , the CPU  causes one or more composite video files on which the one or more video processing operations will be performed to be uploaded from the internal memory  of the HHD  to the computer system .

If the HHD  is coupled to the AC adapter , then the method  proceeds to step , where the battery  is charged via the AC adapter . In such cases, the data connector  provides a path to the power supply  for the power supplied by the AC adapter . The power supply  may include one or more buck regulators and a switch-mode charger to supply the main power rails of the HHD  and manage the battery charging circuit to provide power to the various components of the HHD . In one embodiment, the secondary processor  detects a different pin configuration to differentiate between the data connector  being coupled to the AC adapter  and being coupled to the computer system  via the USB port.","If, however, at step , the HHD  is coupled to the USB port of the computer system , instead of the AC adapter , then the method  proceeds to step . At step , the secondary processor  determines whether the computer system  to which the HHD  is coupled includes a valid USB host. If the computer system  does not include a valid USB host, then the method  proceeds to step , where the charging scheme is aborted. If the computer system  does include a valid USB host, then the method  proceeds to step .","At step , the secondary processor  determines whether the charge level of the battery  is above a predetermined threshold level. In one embodiment, the threshold level is approximately 10% of the charge capacity of the battery . If the charge level of the battery  is below the predetermined threshold level, then the secondary processor  may cause the CPU  to power off (when the CPU  is powered on) or prevent the CPU  from booting (when the CPU is powered off). Determining whether the battery charge level is above the predetermined threshold level ensures that the CPU  does not boot and\/or operate in a low power condition. As is well-known, booting and\/or operating the CPU  from a low power condition could damage the CPU . The secondary processor  is configured to monitor the gas gauge  for a LOW_BAT flag to determine whether the battery  contains an amount of charge above the threshold amount. A LOW_BAT flag that is set to ON indicates that the charge level of the battery  is below the threshold amount. In this situation, the secondary processor  prevents the CPU  from booting, and the method  proceeds to step .","At step , the secondary processor  charges the battery  via the data connector  and provides power to the power supply  with power drawn from the computer system . In one embodiment, the secondary processor  continues to charge the battery  until the battery charge level reaches some predetermined amount above the threshold amount.

The method then proceeds to step . If, at step , the secondary processor  determines that the charge of the battery  is above the threshold amount, then the method  proceeds directly to step .","At step , the secondary processor  determines a load of the components of the HHD . The load is a total amount of power consumed by the various components of the HHD  at a particular point in time. For example, the load may reflect the total amount of power consumed by the data connector , the speaker , the microphone , the power supply , the battery , the optical components , the digital video image sensor , the CPU , the digital viewfinder , the interface buttons , the internal memory , the secondary processor , and the gas gauge  at some particular point in time. As persons skilled in the art will recognize, at various points in time, performing one or more of the method steps of  generates all or a portion of the load of the components of the HHD .","At step , the secondary processor  determines an amount of power being drawn from the computer system  via the data connector . At step , the secondary processor  determines whether the amount of power being drawn from the computer system  is greater than the load determined at step . If the amount of power being drawn from the computer system  is less than the load, then the method  proceeds to step , wherein the secondary processor  causes a portion of the load to be serviced by the power drawn from the computer system . In step , all of the power drawn from the computer system  is used to service the load; however, since the amount of power being drawn from the computer system  is less than the load, the entire load cannot be serviced by the power drawn from the computer system .","At step , the secondary processor  services the remaining load from the battery . The charge stored within the battery  is converted by the power supply  to service this remaining load. In this fashion, the battery  is discharging at step . The method , then, returns to step , where the secondary processor  once again determines whether the battery charge level is above the threshold amount. If the method  continues to loop through steps -----, then the battery  will continue to discharge to satisfy the load requirements of the HHD . If at any time during this looping between steps ----- the battery charge level drops below the threshold amount, then the method  proceeds to step , where the HHD  is powered off while the battery  recharges to the predetermined amount that may be greater than the threshold amount, as described above. Determining whether the battery charge level is above the threshold level ensures that the battery  does not discharge fully. As is well-known, allowing the battery  to discharge fully could damage the battery  by shortening the lifespan and charging ability of the battery .","Referring back now to step , if the secondary processor  determines that the amount of power drawn from the computer system  is greater than the load, then the method  proceeds to step . At step , the secondary processor  fully services the load using the power drawn from the computer system . At step , the battery  is charged with the remaining power drawn from the computer system . Since not all of the power drawn from the computer system  is consumed to service the load, there is \u201cextra\u201d power that is used to charge the battery . In a situation where, at step , the power drawn from the computer system  is equal to the load, then the method  proceeds to step , where the load is fully serviced with the power drawn from the computer system  and step  is skipped. The method  then returns to step , described above.","In one embodiment, the method steps set forth in  are performed by the secondary processor  on an ongoing basis in the background relative to the other functions being performed by the HHD .","Certain embodiments of the invention set forth an \u201cactive system,\u201d where the power being drawn from the computer system  is monitored and actively directed around the HHD  via the secondary processor  and power supply  (see, for example, step ). Alternative embodiments of the invention may operate as a \u201cpassive system\u201d that does not actively monitor the power available from the computer system . In such embodiments, a power deficit from the computer system  acts as a power drain and draws power from the battery . Any excess power drawn from the computer system  is likewise automatically used to charge the battery .","One advantage of the systems and methods described herein is that they provide an opportunity for the battery  to charge while the HHD  is plugged into the computer system  to access and manipulate the video content stored in the internal memory  of the HHD . Since a user is required to plug the HHD  into the computer system  to access and manipulate the video content, as well as to optionally write the modified content back to the internal memory , charging the battery  is a natural and symbiotic function of using the HHD .","Another advantage is that the operations related to editing and manipulating the video content are performed by the processor included in the computer system  instead of the CPU  within the HHD . Leveraging the processing capabilities of the computer system  in this fashion reduces the processing workload placed on the CPU  while the battery  charging, thereby reducing the load of the HHD  and allowing the battery  to charge faster.","Yet another advantage is that storing the composite video files, the software application , the software infrastructure elements, and other supporting software components in the internal memory  increases the portability of the HHD  since the HHD  can be coupled to any computer system , not just a user's primary computer, to edit the composite video files. Further, since only the specific video files being edited or manipulated and the particular software components required to perform these video processing operations are actually transferred to the computer system , the user does not have to wait for all of the video files and\/or software components to be transferred to the computer system  before beginning the video editing process. Additionally, the systems and methods described herein enable the user to perform more advanced video processing operations, other than simply playing back and transferring video files, while simultaneously providing an opportunity to charge the HHD , thus presenting a significant improvement over prior art hand-held electronic device designs.","While the forgoing is directed to embodiments of the invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof. For example, aspects of the invention may be implemented in hardware or software or in a combination of hardware and software. One embodiment of the invention may be implemented as a program product for use with a computer system. The program(s) of the program product define functions of the embodiments (including the methods described herein) and can be contained on a variety of computer-readable storage media. Illustrative computer-readable storage media include, but are not limited to: (i) non-writable storage media (e.g., read-only memory devices within a computer such as CD-ROM disks readable by a CD-ROM drive, flash memory, ROM chips or any type of solid-state non-volatile semiconductor memory) on which information is permanently stored; and (ii) writable storage media (e.g., floppy disks within a diskette drive or hard-disk drive or any type of solid-state random-access semiconductor memory) on which alterable information is stored. Such computer-readable storage media, when carrying computer-readable instructions that direct the functions of the present invention, are embodiments of the present invention. Therefore, the scope of the invention is determined by the claims that follow."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["So that the manner in which the above recited features of the invention can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.
