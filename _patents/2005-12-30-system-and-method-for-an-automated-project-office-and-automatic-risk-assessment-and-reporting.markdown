{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/640,104, filed Dec. 30, 2004, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.","Related disclosure is found in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/618,231, filed Oct. 14, 2004, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/249,744, filed Oct. 14, 2005, whose disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties into the present disclosure.","The present invention is directed to a system and method for automation of project risk identification and in particular to such a system and method in which various qualitative and quantitative measures are combined to report a project's risk level, areas, and mitigation in an automatic and objective manner.","In \u201cProject Management Essentials\u201d from MetaGroup, a statistical survey was conducted for 23,000 application development projects. The following results were projected:","26% succeeded: Project delivered on time and on budget to the client\/customer.","46% challenged: Project completed over budget or past deadline.","28% failed: Project never completed.","The researchers found that the core issues with project success were mostly related to poor project management discipline. The root cause, or underlying problem, often is attributable to poor project estimating techniques, ineffective project team structure (team risks), a lack of client (end-user) participation, unmanaged scope changes, and taking on large-scale project risks without any contingencies.","Project management software was brought along to address these problems, but often fails to do so effectively.","It is therefore an object of the invention to overcome the above-noted deficiencies of the prior art. To that end, the present invention is directed to a system and method that, in various embodiments, can include the following functionalities.","Risk Assessment and Reporting","The Risk Assessment and Report Framework combines various project performance measurements as well as a comprehensive set of multifaceted questions to be processed by a risk engine to assess a project's level or risk, and the areas where risk exists. In addition to identifying risks, advice on mitigation of the identified risks, as well as tracking of mitigation actions is performed to enhance the system's ability to assess and provide future risk advice.","The framework collects data, either through Application Program Interfaces (APIs), or via direct data entry, on project performance measured by base Earned Value Analysis (EVA) data, quality data on defect rates, customer satisfaction ratings, manpower utilization, milestone progress. The risk engine uses the inputs to evaluate the performance against warning thresholds and limits to identify and report trouble. In the case of EVA, a set of performance indicators are calculated from the main performance input to determine schedule and cost performance, as well as the level of risk and recoverability of the schedule and cost.","In addition to the performance metrics and thresholds, the risk engine uses data from question sets that survey various aspects of the projects activities to assess risk in various areas. Each question set and possible answers are categorized, scored, and weighted in such a way as to identify potential risk areas, and these risks are then reported via a dashboard to the user.","Questions sets are formed from a large question pool that contains all possible questions, risk categories, answers, and scores. New question sets are built by selecting questions from the pool and storing the question set into a question set library. The risk identification is broken down into several levels of classification and increasing detail according to a risk structure of risk categories, that each category contains risk areas, and that each risk area contains risk attributes. Each question in the question pool is assigned to a particular risk attribute; thus, when incorporated into a question set, it becomes part of the risk engine's risk calculation.","The question sets are customizable and are assigned according to various classifications for a project. Classifications for the project include a portfolio and a project type. Projects are broken down into one or more portfolios or collections which have some common characteristic or interest (for example, a business unit or line of business, or a particular technology, etc.). Each portfolio has one or more question sets assigned to it that are used for assessment the elements of risk via the risk engine for all projects belonging to that portfolio. In addition to the portfolio assigned question sets, there are project type questions sets. Each project has a type classification assigned to it, and that type automatically incorporates risk question set appropriate for the particular project type. In addition to these two question set associations, each project can add any additional or supplemental question sets as needed to expand the risk assessment coverage.","In addition to the portfolio, project type, and supplemental question sets, the risk engine provides for a role association for the question sets at each of those levels. The roles allow users with different roles\/responsibilities to provide input to the risk engine and have those perspectives combined into an overall risk assessment, and to identify differences in views for establishing consensus within a project. The roles can include (but are in no way limited to) a Project Manager, a Quality Engineer, or a Project Sponsor.","The risk engine provides a facility for periodically \u201crunning\u201d or stepping through the question sets for each project. The risk engine assembles the question sets, eliminates any duplication or overlap between question sets (as different question sets can share any number of questions from the larger question pool), and present a user with an orderly, unique, questionnaire. Users are required to periodically go through the question sets to update the risk assessments and to provide risk trend analysis. Each user that has a particular role for a project creates an answer session for the questionnaire, and is presented with all questions appropriate for the role, portfolio, project type, and supplemental questions. Once all questions have be satisfactorily answered, the answers are submitted and the risk engine computes and updates the risk assessment for the project.","The risk engine combines the risk assessment scores, and metric scores from the EVA, quality, customer satisfaction, manpower, and progress, and reports those on a project or portfolio dashboard using a \u201cstop light\u201d kind of indicator (green, yellow\/amber, red), to indicate an overall level of risk. The overall risks can be \u201cdrilled\u201d down on via a web browser based interface to display increasing levels of detail of the risk status. This drill down continues to the level of the questions and answers or metrics that are driving the overall status. Where risks have been identified by the risk engine, mitigation advice is made available to the user to identify actions to take that are appropriate to mitigate each risk.","Along with the mitigation advice is a mechanism for recording and tracking the mitigation actions taken and the results of those actions for automatic incorporation into the mitigation advice to provide heuristics to the mitigation component of the risk engine, providing all projects with improved mitigation advice as the risk engine continues to collect data.","Portfolio Analysis","The Automated Project Office (APO) integrates a Portfolio Analysis function that allows an organization to track its projects according to a high-level classification system that allows for understanding a particular project footprint or balance of efforts relative to an overall goal. In particular, the preferred embodiment incorporates the MIT Model of portfolio classification, and uses it to perform a (classification) balance analysis, although those skilled in the art who have reviewed the present disclosure will appreciate that other models can be used instead of or in addition to the MIT model. For example, the MIT Model classifies projects as Infrastructure, Transactional, Informational, or Strategic, and uses the relative distributions of projects to those classifications to determine a position or balance for Cost Focused portfolio, Agility portfolio, or Balanced Cost and Agility portfolio. Through the APO, and organizations portfolio (of projects) can be tracked and measured according to the target position desired.","In addition to the MIT Model for portfolio classification, a user can create new models with any classifications desired, and use them in the same way as the MIT Model. A project can be assigned as many portfolio\/portfolio classifications as desired, and have all tracked and reported via a common dashboard via a web browser.","Project Plan Validator","The APO integrates a Project Plan Validator facility using project heuristics to measure proposed project plan efforts by phase against known plan performance statistics for general project phases to determine if the plan contains the right work breakdown and effort distribution. Using the validator, a project manager can quickly see if too much or too little time has been allocated to critical phases of the project, and make adjustments before the plan is baselined and commitments are made for delivery dates. The validator uses statistics from completed projects to set the distribution of effort for a particular kind of project and can then be given, for example, a single number covering a single element from a plan, and determine the efforts by phase and total effort necessary for the project to be completed.","Integrated Project Management Office Toolkit and Process Asset Library","The APO integrates a Project Management Office (PMO) Toolkit and Process Asset Library (PAL). The toolkit provides essential documents and templates that correspond to PMO best practices, and additionally is coupled with the risk engine's mitigation advise to ensure the tools for risk mitigation are given additional visibility and tracking in the APO. The integrated PAL allows documents and tools used by other APO projects to be shared and their usage automatically tracked by the APO to provide powerful means of identifying organizational best practices and tools. The tracking allows for locating high value, high usage items, and pruning of low value, unused items at appropriate time.","Integrated Skills Tracking, Locating, and Availability","The Skills Engine of the APO provides a facility for tracking an organization's, or sub-unit's of the organization's people resources. The Skills Engine provides first, and \u201cinventory\u201d of all skills within the organization or sub-organization using the APO. Beyond the skills inventory, the engine provides tracking of the resources and skills assigned to projects and with a view toward when the resources and associated skills will be available for further allocation as well as aiding in reallocation of skills and resources to other projects. The Skills Engine provides for a skills search facility to locate resources with the skills needed for a project. In addition to the location of resources with needed skills, the engine allows for those resources to have a \u201cclaim\u201d placed on them. The claim facility can either be hard or soft. A hard claim can be made for resources being placed on a project that has been contracted and has a start assigned. A soft claim is made for resources for a project that is not formally committed to, but allows for identification of intent to utilize particular resources in the future. This capability of the engine gives managers and project managers a facility to identify what resources are to be used, and to act early on allocation of resources, resolution of resource conflicts, and identification of new resources with particular skill that need to be obtained.","The skills engine also provides a tracking of overall availability of the resources and skills in the organization with notifications and warnings for resources who are under allocated (relative to their defined availability), or not allocated at all. As part of this engine's processing, and outlook for the utilization that looks into the future alerts managers of upcoming under utilization, which provide a means to avoid lost organizational productivity because the resource might otherwise be left idle.","A preferred embodiment will be disclosed in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements or operational steps throughout.","An overview of the functionality of the preferred embodiment is shown in the use case diagram of . The user  supplies project plan statistics  to a project plan validator , which returns effort distribution validation  to the user . The integrated project management office toolkit\/process asset library  supplies information to the user . The user  supplies information on the skills and availability of workers as well as searches and claims for such workers, collectively designated , to a skills engine , which returns information  on resource and skill availability, tracking, notification, and alerts to the user .","The user  interacts in the following manner with the risk engine . The user  forms custom questions, answers, and thresholds  into a question set , which becomes one of the user-defined and pre-packaged question sets  used by the risk engine . The user  supplies the following input to the risk engine : earned value analysis (EVA) , question responses , performance measurements , quality data , customer satisfaction information , staff power utilization information , and milestone progress . Also, an external data gathering application  can gather data from the user  and supply such data to the risk engine  through an application programming interface (API) .","The results of the operations performed by the risk engine  are output to the user  through one or more dashboards , which are user interfaces that provide such results in visual form. The risk engine  determines schedule and cost performance  and levels of risk and recoverability  and outputs them in the form of the EVA output  to the dashboards . The risk engine determines potential risk areas  and risk mitigation advice  and outputs them in the form of risk reporting  to the dashboards . The risk reporting  can also include input directly from the user . The risk engine can output an overall risk output  to the dashboards ; the overall risk output can include a \u201cstop light\u201d indication for display on the dashboards  if the level of risk warrants it. The risk engine  outputs information to a portfolio analysis , which can be standard or user-defined, which is output to the dashboards .","The functionality shown in  and described above is implemented on a Project Office Data System (PODS), shown in  as . The PODS  is centered on a Project Management Office (PMO) database  which stores, among other things, assessment questionnaires . The database receives information on projects  and skills  and allows reporting and querying by management  and subject matter experts (SME's) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Table Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Active_Project 302","Stores Active Project information "]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Prj_Id field"]},{"entry":["Answer_Type 304","Stores information for all"]},{"entry":[{},"Answer type available identified "]},{"entry":[{},"by the Ans_Typ_Id field"]},{"entry":["Assessment 306","Stores Project Initiation-"]},{"entry":[{},"Assessment information"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Prj_Id field"]},{"entry":["Assessment_Type 308","Stores information for all"]},{"entry":[{},"Assessment type available"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the"]},{"entry":[{},"Assess_Typ_Id field"]},{"entry":["Baseline 310","Stores Project Initiation-"]},{"entry":[{},"Baseline information identified"]},{"entry":[{},"by the Prj_Id field"]},{"entry":["Category 312","Stores Category information"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Cat_Id field"]},{"entry":["Code_Directory_Common_Code","Stores Code Directory Common "]},{"entry":["314","Code (list of scores for each "]},{"entry":[{},"question and answer combination)"]},{"entry":[{},"information identified by the "]},{"entry":[{},"Doc_Txt_Id and "]},{"entry":[{},"Common_Cd_Id field"]},{"entry":["Common_Code 316","Stores common code (list of "]},{"entry":[{},"answers) information identified "]},{"entry":[{},"by the Common_Cd_Id field"]},{"entry":["Customers 318","Stores Customers information "]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Cust_Id field"]},{"entry":["Document 320","Stores Document information"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Doc_Id field"]},{"entry":["Document_Text 322","Stores Document Text (list"]},{"entry":[{},"of questions for each category) "]},{"entry":[{},"information identified by the"]},{"entry":[{},"Doc_Txt_Id field"]},{"entry":["General 324","Stores Project Initiation-"]},{"entry":[{},"General information identified "]},{"entry":[{},"by the Prj_Id field"]},{"entry":["Project 326","Stores Project information"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Prj_Id field"]},{"entry":["Project_Answers 328","Stores Project Answers"]},{"entry":[{},"(answers for each question)"]},{"entry":[{},"information identified"]},{"entry":[{},"by the Prj_Id, Doc_Txt_Id, "]},{"entry":[{},"Cat_Id and Common_Cd_Id field"]},{"entry":["Project_Managers 330","Stores Project Managers"]},{"entry":[{},"information identified by the"]},{"entry":[{},"Prj_Mgr_Id field"]},{"entry":["Project_Phase 332","Stores information for all"]},{"entry":[{},"Project phase available"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Prj_Phse_Id field"]},{"entry":["Project_Status 334","Stores information for all"]},{"entry":[{},"Project status available"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the"]},{"entry":[{},"Prj_Stat_Id field"]},{"entry":["Project_Type 336","Stores information for all"]},{"entry":[{},"Project type available identified "]},{"entry":[{},"by the Proj_Typ_Id field"]},{"entry":["Technology_Platform 338","Stores information for all"]},{"entry":[{},"Technology Platform available "]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the "]},{"entry":[{},"Tech_Plat_Id field"]},{"entry":["Title_Logo 340","Stores Title and Logo information"]},{"entry":["User 342","Stores User information"]},{"entry":[{},"identified by the Login Id field"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The operations of the preferred embodiment will now be explained with reference to .  shows a flow chart of the operations of the preferred embodiment.  shows a main screen flow chart.  shows an administration screen flow chart.  shows a project initiation screen flow chart.  shows an active project screen flow chart.  shows a flow chart of the reports.","The PODS application Login page  protects the application and its resources from being accessed by unauthorized users.

Their payoff comes from shorter time-to-market, superior quality, and the ability to set premium prices. They are moderately risky because companies often have difficulty acting on information to generate business value.","Strategic systems are typically external-facing.

The tracking uses defined thresholds and indicators to identify when a performance area is showing signs of trouble, and coupled with the risk analysis, helps to determine not only when action is needed, but what kind of action as well. Performance tracking requires storing data attributes (measurements) and sets of measurements for each project.","The PMO must support integration: with Tracer\u2122 or integration with Microsoft Project as a means of automating appropriate data gathering and calculations, and it must also support manual, stand-alone data collection.","The Earned Value Management measures, tracked in the performance data are key indicators showing the performance of the project, as well as providing budget and schedule projections for the project.

For example, 3 month and 6 month averages are meaningful between 25% and 100% completion for a project of adequate size to allow such durations; shorter duration projects can use smaller periods of time like 1 and 3 month averages. The cumulative SPI is given the identifier SPI, while the averaged SPI is given identifiers SPI, SPI, SPIfor 1, 3, and 6 month averages respectively.","Cost Performance Index (CPI): (This is the inverse of the performance ratio (AC\/EV) used by CAI.

Each project in the portfolio is shown, and the ability to drill down to greater detail on each project allows managers and executives the ability to see the project at just the level they need to follow and manage the results.","The basis of the health and status analysis is a number of attributes for the execution of the project, along with attributes for calculated performance limits. The various thresholds and limits are used to calculate and assign a heath status for the relevant measure. The status is to be displayed in a \u201cstoplight\u201d fashion: green, yellow, and red; for ok\/on-track, drifting, and trouble respectively.","Financial data is tracked and displayed for each project, with the ability to control time periods, and organization units and roll-ups. The data includes general expenses, payroll, and project revenue\/income.","The financials are displayable by business (organizational) unit, with the ability to combine organizational units into a composite view. The organizational units to be combined are selectable by the user, and selections persist across application sessions.","All financials must have the ability to be displayed at resolutions of: weekly, monthly quarterly, and yearly, with an optional ability to show the previous year against the current year (with the same time resolution).","Key Goal Tracking allows an organization to list and conveniently report the current status of its key goals. A key goal is a quantifiable target of achievement that can be monitored and the status of meeting said goal can be displayed based upon data, e.g.: 25% Cost Reduction, 99.2% SLA Met.","Each key goal has an assignable owner, that is, the person who is responsible for tracking and updating the status of the key goal.","There is a Key Goal maintenance page where Key Goals can be created, edited and deleted. The Key Goal owner and administrators have the ability to update the health status of the goal, using a \u201cstop-light\u201d indicator (green, yellow, and red), as specified earlier for displaying of various health status indicators. From this maintenance page, the owner and administrators will be able to define checkpoints along the course to satisfying the Key Goal, which will include a deadline for each. Once created, these checkpoints will exist under the Key Goal and can be checked off once they are completed. If the deadline on a checkpoint has passed without being completed, the status of that Key Goal needs to be set to Red. Checkpoints can be added, edited and removed at any time.","Objective Tracking allows an organization to list and conveniently report the current status of its objectives. An objective is, unlike a Key Goal, a non-quantified target of achievement. While an objective may be monitored and tracked, a status decision for an objective is based more upon the reporting manager's thoughts on progress, than upon data, e.g.: SLA Improvements, Increase Level 1 Helpdesk Resolution.","As with the Key Goals, there is a maintenance page with a system to track tasks within each objective. Each objective has an assigned owner, who is able to update the tasks within the objective. Each task within the objectives will have a description, a deadline date, and a check box to be checked once the task has been completed. If the deadline on a task has passed without being completed, the status of that objective needs to be set to Red. Tasks can be added, edited and removed at any time by the Objective owner or an administrator.","Multi-level reporting allows varying details levels of the projects to be reported, from easy to read \u201cstop-light\u201d type charts, to line and bar graphs, to data sheets. These reports allow managers and executives to see appropriate detail levels for each project and area of interest.","Each user, when logging in to the PMO, will be presented with a view of the various analysis, risk, and data components that they have selected to see.","There is a standard view provided for users who have not customized their view. The standard view will show information about what would encompass the set of items that fall under that user's area of responsibility as defined by the authorizations given the particular user.","A project manager will see an overview of all projects he is responsible for.","An IT manager will see a higher level summary of the projects that are under his control, with the ability to drill down to the project level as desired.","Executive managers will see a summary of the entire portfolio, with the ability to drill down to the project level as desired.","In addition to the standard reports and views, the PMO must support ad hoc reporting (using tools like e.g., Crystal Reports).","Using the MIT model of portfolio asset classification, the balance of the portfolio across Infrastructure, Transactional, Informational, and Strategic classifications is determined for tracking and comparison against the company's strategic focus.","The analysis uses a portfolio pyramid that is described by the following descriptions. At the base are the infrastructure investments. Built on that base are the transactional systems (which need a reliable infrastructure). At the top are the information producing and strategic systems.","The PMO, using the data gathered, along with this model, will analyze the investment distribution. This distribution is used to evaluate the orientation of the IT portfolio and determine the level of alignment with the company's strategic focus.","There needs to be the ability to Custom Define a new Portfolio Balance scheme, as well as edit the Pre-Packaged solution in case the original system does not fit the user's business, or in case they already have a pre-existing method to handle this data.","There needs to be a second Portfolio Balance Analysis system that will allow the balance of all current projects to be displayed based off the Business Area field in the Project Profile. This will allow the user to see the distribution of the Portfolio based on the business areas the projects are operating beneath.","This is a dynamically generated display method, since the number of Business Areas varies between different users. Once viewing the distribution, the user can select any of the Business Areas and be directed to a list of all the projects within the Business Area, in the format described in the Portfolio Summary View, detailed later in this document.","The Effort Distribution Analysis provides a manager with the ability to place a general effort breakdown of the project in the system for analysis and project plan validation. The effort breakdown is based on a table of percentages of total effort for each major phase in the lifecycle, based on aggregate measures of completed projects. Such a table is tunable and verified by the application such that all roll-ups come to the correct percentages, and the total for the table rolls-up to 100%.","Using the percentages listed in the table, the system will determine if the projects breakdown is reasonable, within a defined threshold for each phase. The indicators are a \u201cstop-light\u201d view of each phase (green, yellow, red) to show where phases may be under or over estimated.","There is an updateable library of project templates, including instructions and samples. The library is browsable by the user and allow viewing and downloading of the templates. Completed templates is uploadable to the system and assigned to (associated with) the particular project to which they pertain. The projects documents are viewable or downloadable by any appropriately authorized user.","The templates include:\n\n","There is a PMO homepage, known as a Dashboard view, which is the initial screen that users will see when they move into the PMO software. It is meant to give a quick, informative overview of the data stored within the PMO. The Dashboard will need to display data, such as, but not limited to:\n\n","For any stop light indicator throughout the program that is determined via analysis of values, a method must be created to display in which direction these items are varying from the baseline.","On the Dashboard main page, if the mouse pointer hovers over one of the Projects, a pop-up appears to give an overview of the 6 project facet stop light indicators.","The \u201cProject Details\u201d screen is displayed when the user clicks on one of the links populating the Projects List.","All facets of the project are displayed with their corresponding stop light indicators. Each facet is listed as a link to its corresponding data display. Whichever graph or data form is being displayed at the current time is highlighted in this list in an obvious manner. Additionally, the same highlighting is applied to which view the user is currently accessing.","The limits for each facet needs to be manually changeable, and needs to be saved once changed.","The project information such as the sponsor, manager, location, and project type is displayed.","Throughout all of the graphs being shown for the project facets, coloring and format are uniform.","There are always two sets of data displayed for the graphs, the Actual, and the Baseline. The yellow and red thresholds will also be graphed, but these will be based upon a percentage or fixed value, enumerated separately by the user. The graph will have a line for both Actual and Baseline, as well as a variance line both above and below the baseline for the yellow and red thresholds.","The graph, by default, displays 26 weeks. This number is able to be changed within the program to show a user defined date range on a project by project basis. Weeks start on the Sunday of a given week.","The customer satisfaction and quality graphs do not utilize a baseline but rather definable target zones. The attributes associated with these graphs in addition to displaying the zones are the containment percent. The yellow and red lines will denote target zones.","The graph, by default, displays 26 weeks. This number can be changed within the program to show a user defined date range on a project by project basis. Weeks start on the Sunday of a given week.","Input screens for all data and limits (or thresholds) are required.","Graphing is dynamic; that is, it includes a functionality that allows for the user to either define custom graphs, or overlay existing graphs in order to analyze how changes in one graph influence others.","If data entry for the six project facets remains manual, place all data entry for the facets on one page for quick entry of weekly data.","Financial graphs can be displayed in three manners.\n\n","The data for the financial graph are input and stored in some fashion, either automatically by working with Tracer, or by manual input on the part of the project manager.","There is also a financial graph to display the cumulative totals over the period chosen by the administrator.","Database tables are created to hold required data for displaying the dashboard items. This will include the items being tracked, as well as the detailed data for determining the status.","The system has data supplied weekly, and be able to report on those data on a week-by-week basis. Each portfolio project will have an arbitrary number of weeks of baseline or planned data points, one set for each week for each area. All project\/reporting areas will record weekly data point each area (for use in comparing to the baseline, or indicate the current health\/status).","The system warns users before they can delete Projects, Key Goals, and Objectives.","This program is very graphic intensive, with at least 6 graphs per project. In order to keep users navigating steadily through the data via any connection, graphics size must be kept to a minimum.","\u201cPortfolio Summary View\u201d will be is a separate page that the user can access from the main page. Perhaps have the icon located at the top of the Portfolio list, next to the label \u2018Portfolio\u2019. That page will provide a general overview of basic facts regarding all of the projects inside the system. The projects will be sorted into one of two headings, Active and Completed.","All active projects are listed under the \u201cActive\u201d heading and contain the following:\n\n","All completed projects are listed under the \u201cCompleted\u201d heading and contain the following:\n\n","While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described in detail above, those skilled in the art who have reviewed the present disclosure will readily appreciate that other embodiments can be realized within the scope of the present invention.
