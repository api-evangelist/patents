{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. 2008-0911510-002. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Memristive devices, or memristors, are a new type of switching devices with an electrically switchable device resistance. Memristive devices are both scientifically and technically interesting, and hold promise for non-volatile memory (NVM) and other fields. As today's flash memory technology is reaching its scaling limit, there is an urgent need for new memory technologies that can meet the storage capacity and access speed demanded by future applications. Memories using resistive switching devices, such as memristors, are a promising candidate for meeting that need. For NVM applications, many memristive devices can be formed in a two-dimensional array to provide a very high storage capacity.","The following description provides a structure of a reconfigurable two-dimensional array of switching devices that uses lateral latches to provide regional isolation and re-routing capabilities, and a method of operation using such lateral latches.","In some embodiments, the switching devices may be memristive devices. As used herein, a memristive device is a switching device with its resistance representing its switching state, and the resistance depends on the history of the voltage and current applied to the device. The resistive state of the device may represent a digital value. For instance, a high resistance of the device may indicate that the device is in an \u201cOFF\u201d state, which may represent a digital \u201c0,\u201d while a low resistance may indicate that the device is in an \u201cON\u201d state, which may represent a digital \u201c1.\u201d The memristive device may be \u201cbipolar,\u201d meaning that the device can be switched from a low-resistance state (\u201cLRS\u201d) to a high-resistance state (\u201cHRS\u201d) by applying a switching voltage of one polarity, and from a high-resistance state to a low-resistance state by applying a switching voltage of the opposite polarity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","120","110","122","122","100","100"]},"Many different materials with their respective suitable dopants can be used as the switching material. Materials that exhibit suitable properties for switching include oxides, sulfides, selenides, nitrides, carbides, phosphides, arsenides, chlorides, and bromides of transition and rare earth metals. Suitable switching materials also include elemental semiconductors such as Si and Ge, and compound semiconductors such as III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors. The listing of possible switching materials is not exhaustive and do not restrict the scope of the present invention. The dopant species used to alter the electrical properties of the switching material depends on the particular type of switching material chosen, and may be cations, anions or vacancies, or impurities as electron donors or acceptors. For instance, in the case of transition metal oxides such as TiO, the dopant species may be oxygen vacancies. For GaN, the dopant species may be nitride vacancies or sulfide ions. For compound semiconductors, the dopants may be n-type or p-type impurities.","The memristive switching device  can be switched between ON and OFF states by controlling the concentration and distribution of the oxygen vacancies in the switching material in the active region . When a DC switching voltage is applied across the top and bottom electrodes  and , an electric field is created across the active region . The switching voltage and current may be supplied by a switching circuit . The electric field across the active region , if of a sufficient strength and proper polarity, may drive the oxygen vacancies to drift through the switching material towards the top electrode , thereby turning the device into an ON state.","By way of example, as shown in , in one embodiment the switching material may be TiOIn this case, the dopants that may be carried by and transported through the switching material are oxygen vacancies (V). The active region  of the switching device has two sub-regions or layers: a primary region  and a secondary region . The primary region  is the main place where the switching behavior occurs. In the originally formed state of the device, the primary region  has a relatively low dopant concentration, while the secondary region  has a relatively high dopant level. The secondary region  functions as a dopant source\/drain. During a switching operation, dopants may be driven from the secondary region  into the primary region , or from the primary region to the secondary region, to change the distribution of dopants in the primary region, thereby changing the conductivity across the primary region.","If the polarity of the electric field is reversed, the dopants may drift in an opposite direction across the switching material and away from the top electrode , thereby turning the device into an OFF state. In this way, the switching is reversible and may be repeated. Due to the relatively large electric field needed to cause dopant drifting, after the switching voltage is removed, the locations of the dopants remain stable in the switching material. The switching is bipolar in that voltages of opposite polarities are used to switch the device on and off. The state of the switching device  may be read by applying a read voltage to the bottom and top electrodes  and  to sense the resistance across these two electrodes. The read voltage is typically much lower than the threshold voltage required to induce drifting of the ionic dopants between the top and bottom electrodes, so that the read operation does not alter the resistance state of the switching device.","Memristive switching devices may be formed into an array for various applications that benefit from having a high density of switching devices.  shows an example of a two-dimensional array  of memristive switching devices. The array  has a first group  of generally parallel nanowires  running in a first direction, and a second group  of generally parallel nanowires  running in a second direction at an angle, such as 90 degrees, from the first direction. One group of the nanowires may be labeled as the row lines, and the other group may be labeled as the column lines. The two layers of nanowires  and  form a two-dimensional lattice which is commonly referred to as a crossbar structure, with each nanowire  in the first layer intersecting a plurality of the nanowires  of the second layer, and vice versa. A memristive switching device  may be formed at each intersection of the nanowires  and . The switching device  has a nanowire of the second group  as its top electrode and a nanowire of the first group  as the bottom electrode, and an active region  containing a switching material between the two nanowires. Each memristive device  in the two-dimensional array can be uniquely addressed by selecting the row line and column line that form the electrodes of the memristive device.","The crossbar structure in  provides an effective way to achieve a high density of switching devices in a two-dimensional array. The number of rows and columns of the crossbar can be made large to have a large number of switching devices formed in a plane. Nevertheless, if the two-dimensional array is large, it may be desirable to provide configurability of the array so that some portions of the array may be selectably connected to or disconnected from the other portions. For instance, as the number of switching devices on each row or column wire segment increases, the leakage current in a write or read operation due to the \u201chalf-select\u201d problem also increases and can make the write or read operation more difficult. In that case, it may be desirable to be able to partition the large two-dimensional array into smaller isolatable portions so that the number of half-selected devices within each portion is kept small. Also, in some applications, it may be useful to be able to do rerouting of connections to, for example, avoid a patch of defective switching devices in the two-dimensional array. As another example, it may desirable to have a portion of the two-dimensional array set aside as a backup segment, which is to be activated only when needed.","The description below provides an effective way to provide reconfigurability in a two-dimensional array of switching devices based on the crossbar structure. As illustrated in , the two-dimensional array  comprises a plurality of crossbar tiles -. Each crossbar tile has a crossbar structure similar to that shown in , with a plurality of row wire segments  intersecting a plurality of column wire segments , and a switching device may be formed at each intersection of the row and column wire segments. Thus, each crossbar tile is a crossbar in itself, but the word \u201ctile\u201d is used to indicated that such a cross bar structure is used as a building block to construct a larger two-dimensional array . In , for clarity of illustration, each of the crossbar tiles - has only four row wire segments and four column wire segments. It should be understood, however, that the size of each crossbar tile can be chosen to have the desired number of memristive devices on each row or wire segment, and that the crossbar tiles in the array  do not have to have the same size.","The crossbar tiles - are linked, or \u201cstitched\u201d together, by a plurality of lateral latches . The word \u201clateral\u201d as used herein means that the latches are used to provide horizontal connections within the plane of the two-dimensional array of switching devices. The latches  include row latches and column latches. Each row latch connects a row wire segment of one crossbar tile to a corresponding row wire segment of an adjacent crossbar tile. Similarly, each column latch connects a column wire segment of a crossbar tile to a corresponding column wire segment of an adjacent crossbar tile. Each lateral latch  can be operated to make or break the electric connection between the two wire segments connected thereto. For instance, when the row latch  and column latch  are closed, the row wire segment  is electrically connected to the row wire segment , and the Column wire segment  is electrically connected to the column wire segment . Such electric connections allow a read or write voltage to be applied to the switching device  formed at the intersection of the row wire segment  and the column wire segment  via the wire segments  and  and the row and column latches  and , respectively. Thus, the switching device  can be made operational when the latches  and  are closed. On the other hand, if either of the latches  and  is open, a read or write voltage cannot be effectively applied to the switching device . In other words, the switching device  can be made inactive by opening either lateral latch. In this regard, it should be noted that when a wire segment is disconnected, all the memory cells on that wire segment are inactivated. By opening the lateral latches connecting a crossbar tile (e.g., the crossbar tile ) to its neighbors, the crossbar tile can be isolated from the rest of the tow-dimensional array .","The lateral latches  linking the crossbar tiles in the two-dimensional array  may be implemented in different ways. One approach of forming a lateral latch is shown in . In this embodiment, the lateral latch  comprises two side-by-side switching devices  and . As shown in , the lateral latch  connects two row wire segments  and  in two adjacent crossbar tiles. The latch  has a top electrode , which extends in parallel (shown in  as extending into the page) with the column wire segments  in the two adjacent crossbar tiles, and uses terminals of the two row wire segments  and  as its bottom electrodes. A first switching device  is formed between the top electrode  and the first row wire segment , and a second switching device  is formed between the top electrode  and the other row wire segment . The construction of each of the switching devices  and  may be similar to that of the memristive device in  as described above. In other words, each switching device  or  may have an active region with mobile ion dopants disposed between the top and bottom electrodes, and the device may be switched ON or OFF by applying a switching voltage to change the dopant distribution. In this regard, to perform the latching function effectively, the switching characteristics of the switching devices  and  may be different from the memristive devices on the wire segments to be connected. For instance, the switching devices in the lateral latch may be made to have a relatively high resistance for the OFF state (R), as compared to the regular memristive devices in the array, to ensure good electric isolation between the wire segments when the latch is open. The switching devices in the latch may be made to have a very low resistance for the ON state (R), to reduce the voltage drop across the latch in a read or write operation. Also, the endurance requirement for the switching devices in the lateral latches may be relaxed, if the latches are not intended to be programmed frequently.","When both switching devices  and  are put in the ON state, a low-resistance path is formed that goes from the first row wire segment  through the first switching device , the top electrode , and the second switching device  to the second row wire segment . Similarly, a lateral latch may be formed to connect two column wire segments in two adjacent crossbar tiles. In that case, the latch has a bottom electrode that extends in parallel with the row wire segments of the crossbar tiles, and uses the column wire segments being linked as the top electrodes, to from the two switching devices.","To operate the latch , proper voltages should be applied to the top electrode  and the wire segments ,  that form the bottom electrodes of the latch. For a wire segment that has both ends connected by latches, a separate connection may be needed to apply the operation voltage. For instance, the wire segment  is connected on both ends by the latches  and . If both the latches  and  are open, the operation voltage from an external drive circuit will not reach the wire segment  via the latches. In that situation, a via  that connects the wire segment  to a different plane in the device stack may be used to provide the electric connection needed for applying the operation voltage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["300","306","302","304","302","310","304","312","320","302","322","304"]},"Turning now to , in another embodiment, a lateral latch may be in the form of a nonvolatile transistor , the conductivity of which is controlled by a gate voltage. A nonvolatile transistor is able to maintain its ON\/OFF conduction state even when the gate voltage is removed. The transistor  has a gate electrode  that overlaps the opposing ends of two row wire segments  and  being connected. The terminals of the two wire segments  and  form the source and drain electrodes  and  of the transistor , and the channel  of the transistor is disposed between the gate electrode  and the source and drain electrodes. The channel  may be made to be highly conductive or highly resistive, depending on the gate voltage applied to the gate electrode . When the channel  is highly conductive (i.e., the transistor  is ON), the two row wire segments  and  are electrically connected. When the channel  has a high resistance, the transistor  is OFF, and the two row wire segments  and  are electrically isolated. A transistor may also be used to link two column wire segments. In that case, the gate electrode of the transistor may be a bottom electrode that overlaps the two column wire segments, which form the source and drain electrodes of the transistor, respectively.","One type of nonvolatile transistors that is suitable for this application of lateral latching is the atomic transistor. In one form of an atomic transistor, the conduction between the source and drain electrodes can be turned on or off based on an electrochemical reduction-oxidation, or \u201credox,\u201d effect. The gate electrode  is formed of a suitable metal, and the channel region  between the gate electrode and the drain and source electrodes  and  is formed of a material that allows diffusion of metal cations from the gate electrode when a positive voltage is applied. The metal cations diffused into the channel region can be reduced back to metal atoms and form a conductive path between the source and drain electrodes  and . The concentration of the metal cations in the channel region can be controlled by changing the gate electric field. As a result, the conductivity of the channel region can be changed from that an insulator to a highly conductive state, and vice versa. The switching of the channel conductivity can be non-volatile, so that even when the gate voltage is removed, the channel maintains its conductivity state. In one example of an atomic transistor, the gate electrode may be formed of copper, and the channel region may be formed of TaO. Other combinations of metals for the gate electrode and oxides or other materials for the channel material may also be used to construct an atomic transistor.","The layout of conductors shown in  can also be used to implement the latching transistors of . For instance, the row latch electrode wires  may be used as the gate electrodes of the transistors for latching row wire segments, and the column latch electrode wires  may be the gate electrodes of the transistors for latching column wire segments.","The reconfigurability of the two-dimensional array provided by the use of lateral latches allows significant flexibility in the operation of the array. In some operations, the latches can be used to isolate the array into smaller segments, such as individual crossbar tiles, before writing to a selected switching device. By isolating the region of the selected device from the rest of the array, the number of half-selected devices is reduced, resulting in a lower leakage current during a write operation. Referring now to , to write to a selected switching device, the location of the switching device is first identified (step ), so that the electric connections to that switching device can be established. To that end, the later latches connecting the row and column wire segments of the selected switching device to the external drive circuit for the write operation are closed (step ). In this regard, it should be noted that there may be multiple row wire segments between the selected row wire segment and the external supply, and multiple column wire segments between the selected column wire segment and the external supply. All the lateral latches linking those wire segments are closed to establish the electric connections to the selected switching device. After the electric connections are formed, a switching voltage is applied to the electrodes of the switching device to cause the device to change its state from OFF to ON, or from ON to OFF (step ). To avoid accidental altering of the conduction states of the latches during the write operation, a proper biasing scheme may be applied. For instance, if a positive half of the switching voltage is applied to the row wire segment of the device being switched and a negative half is applied to its column wire segment, then the latch electrode wires may be connected to ground, so that the voltage drop across each latch is not sufficient to reverse the conduction state of the latch. After the write operation is carried out, the crossbar tile containing the switching device can again be isolated from the adjacent crossbar tiles by resetting the lateral latches to their open states (step ).","In other applications, the reconfiguration mechanism can be used to disconnect a segment in the two-dimensional array that contains malfunctioning devices. It can also be used to connect a backup section of the two-dimensional array to maintain the functionality and storage size of the entire memory array. There are other scenarios in which the reconfiguration capability of the two-dimensional array can be used to enhance the performance and reliability of the array.","In the foregoing description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details. While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom.
