{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","DEFINITIONS","Example Embodiments"],"p":["Priority of U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/471,042 filed on Apr. 1, 2011 is claimed, and is hereby incorporated by reference.","As the use of mobile wireless devices, such as smart phones and tablet devices, becomes more ubiquitous, the demands on the limited amount of radio frequency spectrum used by those devices also increases, resulting in wireless network congestion in the licensed spectrum. In addition, the increased use of high bandwidth applications such as audio and video streaming can increase demands beyond the capability of the available spectrum. This is especially true in high density and high use locations such as large cities and universities. One projection estimates a growth of 20 times in mobile internet traffic from 2010 to 2015.","One way of increasing bandwidth in wireless devices is through the use of carrier aggregation, in which multiple carriers having different frequencies are aggregated to form a virtual wideband connection for a wireless device. However, transmitting and receiving over different frequencies can create a number of challenges. For example, the different carriers may travel different paths between the wireless device and the base station or access point. The distinct propagation paths between different carriers can create timing differences in the reception of the signals. This can be disadvantageous in wireless systems that combine data for multiple devices in a single signal, such as in systems that use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA).","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.","As used herein, the term\u201csubstantially\u201d refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, an object that is \u201csubstantially\u201d enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of \u201csubstantially\u201d is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","An exponential increase in the amount of wireless data transmission has created congestion wireless networks using licensed spectrum to provide wireless communication services for wireless devices such as smart phones and tablet devices, to name a few. The congestion is especially apparent in high density and high use locations such as urban locations and universities.","One technique for providing additional bandwidth capacity to wireless devices is through the use carrier aggregation of multiple smaller bandwidths to form a virtual wideband channel at a wireless device. Carriers are signals in permitted frequency domains onto which information is placed. The amount of information that can be placed on a carrier is determined by the aggregated carrier's bandwidth in the frequency domain. The permitted frequency domains are often limited in bandwidth. The bandwidth limitations become more severe when a large number of users are simultaneously using the bandwidth in the permitted frequency domains. Carrier aggregation enables multiple carrier signals to be simultaneously communicated between a user's wireless device and a base station. Multiple different carriers can be used. In some instances, the carriers may be from different permitted frequency domains. This provides a broader choice to the wireless devices, enabling more bandwidth to be obtained. The greater bandwidth can be used to communicate bandwidth intensive operations, such as streaming video or communicating large data files.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"At a wireless device, such as a User Equipment (UE), the device can be configured to communicate with a base station (eNodeB) via a selected carrier. This selected carrier can be designated as a first component carrier. Each component carrier at the UE can appear as a serving cell at the UE, as defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 8 specification. The serving cell associated with the component carrier that is configured with the full control channels\/signals by the eNodeB to the UE can be referred to as a Primary Serving Cell (PCell). The primary cell is typically the first component carrier set up for a UE. However, any component carrier can be designated as the PCell. If additional component carriers are needed at the UE to provide a desired bandwidth, quality of service, or other desired feature, additional component carriers can be assigned to the UE by the eNodeB via the radio resource control (RRC) signaling. Each additional component carrier can be configured and associated with a Secondary Serving Cell (SCell) at the UE. In one embodiment, the secondary serving cell can have no physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) transmission to the UE based on the current LTE Rel-8\/9\/10 specifications.","When a UE is turned on, or activated, the distance between the UE and the eNodeB causes a propagation delay in the signal. To account for the propagation delay, the transmit timing at the UE can be adjusted. This is typically accomplished by transmitting a signal from the UE to the eNodeB and receiving a response from the eNodeB that instructs the UE how much the transmit timing at the UE needs to be adjusted (forwards or backwards) based on how closely the signal from the UE correlates with a timing advance signal at the eNodeB.","In the 3GPP LTE specification Releases 8, 9, and 10 designate that the signal transmitted from the BE includes a random access preamble. The random access preamble can be assigned at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer in the uplink and communicated on a Random Access Channel (RACH) such as the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). This signal transmitted by the BE is received at the eNode B and correlated with a timing reference signal. A determination is made by the eNodeB how much the timing advance of the transmission of the carrier signal at the UE will need to be adjusted. The timing advance may be adjusted in a positive or negative direction.","The eNodeB can then send a Random Access Response (RAR). The LTE specification indicates that the RAR should includes an initial 11-bit timing advance, as defined in Section 6.2.3 of TS 36.32.1 v. 10.2. The UE can then adjust the timing of its transmissions based on the number received (between 0 and 1024). The BE timing is to be adjusted with a relative accuracy better than or equal to +\/\u22124 Ts, where Ts=1\/(15,000*2048) seconds. The change in transmission timing at the UE is referred to as a timing advance (TA) adjustment. After the initial synchronization from the RACH, the eNodeB can use other uplink signals such as the cyclic prefix or the uplink reference signal for synchronization tracking and\/or updating.","Currently, in the 3GPP LTE Release 10 specification, only one timing advance value is supported with the following two restrictions for the BE configured with the carrier aggregations: (1) the timing advance is based on synchronization to the PCell; and (2) no RACH procedure is allowed on the SCell. The use of multiple carrier components of different frequency bands can add additional complications in setting up a downlink and uplink connection with an eNodeB. In 3GPP LTE Releases 8, 9, and 10, when a UE is turned on and configured with the carrier aggregations, the initial random access for uplink carrier aggregation is initiated from the uplink PCell only. Both the uplink PCell and SCell(s) share the same single timing advance (TA), which is maintained on the PCell. Therefore, only one single timing advance in the uplink is supported, even when multiple component carriers in the same band or different frequency bands are aggregated.","There are several scenarios where separate timing advance adjustments per component carrier may be used to significantly increase the efficiency of carrier aggregation using multiple component carriers. Three different scenarios are illustrated in  that may cause different component carriers to travel significantly different propagation paths and cause different propagation delays. The reception and decoding of information carried by the component carriers can be significantly enhanced with the use of a timing advance adjustment for one or more SCells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","206","210","214","218","222","218","222","214","206","210"],"sub":["1","2","s"]},"Similarly,  provides an example in which a UE  transmits a first component carrier signal  having a first frequency fand a second component carrier signal  having a second frequency f. The first component carrier may be received by a first frequency selective remote radio head (RRH)  for initial baseband processing and then communicated to a base band unit (BBU) or eNodeB  for additional processing and communication to a network. The second component carrier may be received by a second remote radio head  and communicated to the BBU\/eNodeB . As in , the position of the UE relative to each RRH, and the position of each RRH relative to the eNodeB  can change the path length of each component carrier signal and create a potential need for individual timing adjustment for each component carrier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["402","410","412","402","406","410","412","414"],"sub":["1 ","2"]},"In one embodiment, a new timing adjustment can be established for one or more SCells using the RACE procedure with the 11-bit timing advance command. Alternatively, in scenarios where a reasonable synchronization has been achieved, the timing advance adjustment can be accomplished without the need of an additional RACH procedure in one or more SCells. A determination as to what stands as a reasonable synchronization may depend on environmental conditions and system design. A reasonable synchronization may be deemed to have been achieved when the timing advance adjustment is a range of less than 5*Ts to less than 100*Ts. However, these values are only provided as examples and are not intended to be limiting. Multiple small timing advances can be performed in lieu of a single large timing advance, as can be appreciated. This will be discussed more fully below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":"1"},"In step (), the eNodeB will reply in response to the random access preamble with the Random Access Response. The RAR can be communicated on the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and addressed with a Random Access Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RA-RNTI), which can identify the time-frequency slot in which the preamble was detected. The RAR can convey the identity of the detected preamble, a timing alignment instruction to synchronize subsequent uplink transmissions from the UE, an initial resource grant for transmission of the next uplink message, and an assignment of a Cell-RNTI (C-RNTI). The RAR message can also include a backoff indicator which the eNodeB can set to instruct the UE to back off for a period of time before retrying, a random access attempt. The connection between the UE and the eNodeB can then be setup as detailed in the 3GPP LTE Release 8, 9, and\/or 10 specifications.","The eNodeB may instruct the UE to setup one or more SCells to provide additional bandwidth for transmitting and\/or receiving signals. The setup procedure for the one or more SCells is also detailed in the 3GPP LTE Release 8, 9, and\/or 10 specifications. An SCell may be setup and configured to allow communication between the UE and an eNodeB on a second component carrier. The second component carrier may travel a different distance than the component carrier associated with the PCell. The eNodeB may then determine that the timing of the received communications from the SCell at the UE is substantially off. For example, the communication from the component carrier assigned to the SCell may be received at the SCell with a timing that is off by 5 Tto several thousand times the value of T. In step (), the eNodeB can send a trigger to the HE instructing the UE to perform a RACH process. Alternatively, the trigger may be transmitted any time an additional component carrier is added, regardless of the timing of the SCell communication.","The trigger may be communicated by the eNodeB via a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) command, through an Activation MAC CE, or via another desired communication process. The trigger may be communicated by the eNodeB to the UE via a component carrier controlled by the PCell, or a component carrier controlled by the SCell for which the trigger is being sent. The trigger can include a cell identification or timing advance index that allows the UE to identify which SCell the trigger is for. This will be discussed more fully below.","Upon receiving the trigger, step () depicts that the UE can send a random access preamble that can be assigned at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer in the uplink and communicated on a Random Access Channel (RACH) such as the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). The random access preamble will be sent on the component carrier of the SCell for which a timing advance adjustment is to be performed. The random access preamble may be sent via a contention based communication scheme or a non-contention based communication scheme. The random access preamble is received at the eNodeB and correlated with a timing reference signal. The time of flight of this signal from the UE to the eNodeB is used to adjust the timing advance for communications from this SCell at the UE. In step (), the eNodeB will respond with an RAR that is transmitted to the UE. The RAR will contain the 11-bit timing advance command for the SCell. The value of the 11-bit timing advance command is set based on the correlation of the random access preamble that was previously sent in step (). Thus, the RAR can be communicated to the UE via the PCell or any SCell. Since the eNodeB assigns a dedicated preamble for the RACH procedure on the SCell, the RNTI transmitted with the RAR to the SCell may be ignored by the UE. Alternatively, the RNTI or C-RNTI may not be transmitted when an RAR is communicated to an SCell. In another alternative, (1) an additional RAR format may be defined without the RN\u2032TI or C-RNTI; or (2) the existing RAR format can be used with the RNTI fields used as reserved fields.","The example process described in steps (), (), and () can be repeated for each SCell that is created at the UE, such as SCell 2 shown in . Alternatively, the process may only be performed when the timing of a communication signal from an SCell is determined at the eNodeB to be off by more than a predetermined amount. Each time an SCell is torn down and then rebuilt, it may be desired to adjust the timing advance, as shown in steps (), (), and (). Only in step () is it necessary to transmit the communication on a selected path. The random access preamble should be communicated on the path for which the timing advance adjustment is to be performed.","Once a UE has already achieved synchronization with the eNodeB and established a timing advance for one or more SCells, the timing advance between the UE and the eNodeB can be maintained by periodically performing adjustments on the timing advance.  illustrates one example illustration for maintenance of the timing advance for an SCell. Steps () and () are the same as steps  and  that were described with respect to .","In one example, to support or maintain multiple timing advances, a single timing advance MAC CE can be transmitted from the UE to each SCell, as illustrated in step (). The MAC CE can include a 6-bit timing advance value that can be used to make smaller timing advance adjustments than the 11-bit timing advancement value used in the RACH process that was previously described.","The MAC CE can be communicated to each SCell using any desired carrier, such as using the component carrier for the PCell, the component carrier for the SCell for which the timing adjustment will be performed, or a component carrier for another SCell. The MAC CE for the timing advance can include the cell identity information for SCell(s) for which the timing advance is to be performed. When there are multiple timing advances for different SCells, the same MAC CE (with cell identity information) for timing advance maintenance and\/or adjustment can be used, which can be a so-called \u201cgrouping timing advance\u201d.","The timing advance MAC CE can be identified by a MAC Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sub-header which has a fixed size and consists of a single octet. In accordance with one example embodiment, two or more bits can be used to indicate which cell the timing advance adjustment should be applied to. For instance, two reserved bits in the MAC message can be used to indicate the cell index or a unique Timing Advance (IA) index value that is not directly related to the cell index value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["7","6"]},"b7b6=00, uplink primary cell (or TA #0);","b7b6=01, the first uplink secondary cell (or TA #1);","b7b6=10, the second uplink secondary cell (or TA #2);","b7b6=11, the third uplink secondary cell or all secondary cells (or TA #3 or reserved);","Timing Advance Command: this field indicates the index value T(0, 1, 2, . . . 63) used to control the amount of timing adjustment that the UE will apply to the specified SCell(s). The length of the field is 6 bits.","The example illustrated in  is not intended to be limiting. It is also possible to use other reserved bits to signal which cell the timing advance should be applied to. The use of the MAC CE to perform the 6-bit timing advance may not be limited to instances where a relatively small tuning advance adjustment is needed for a specific cell. In addition, the 6 bit MAC CE can be performed multiple times to achieve a larger timing advance adjustment without the need to perform the 11-bit timing advance adjustment using the RACH procedure.","In another example embodiment, a new timing advance command can be defined that contains a Cell identification (ID) field to signal which cell the current timing advance belongs to. The newly defined Cell ID field can be referred to as an extended timing advance command MAC control element. The extended timing advance command MAC CE can include a second Octet that is appended to the first Octet typically used to send the timing advance command.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["7","6"]},"A logical channel ID (LCID) is currently used to identify the timing advance command MAC CE.

Alternatively, the existing LCID 11101 for timing advance can be reused, but an additional reserved bit in the MAC CE can be used to indicate that the new extended TA command for the multiple timing advances is being used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"1"},"In step (), the eNodeB will reply in response to the random access preamble with the Random Access Response containing the 11-bit timing advance command. The value of the 11-bit timing advance command is based on the correlation of the initial random access preamble that is correlated with a reference timer at the eNodeB to determine the amount of timing advance adjustment needed for the PCell based on the propagation distance of the signal from the UE to the eNodeB.","The same RAR containing the 11-bit timing advance command set for the PCell can also be sent to each SCell. The propagation distance between the UE and the eNodeB for each SCell may be different from the propagation distance from the UI to the eNodeB for the PCell, as discussed with respect to .","The difference in propagation distance for the PCell and each SCell can then be compensated for in step (), wherein at least one 6-bit timing advance adjustment can be performed for each SCell to correct for any timing differences between the PCell and the SCell. The 6-bit timing advance adjustments may be performed as discussed with respect to , using a timing advance command. MAC CE or an extended timing advance command MAC CE. As previously discussed, the RAR and the TA MAC CE or extended TA MAC CE can be sent using the PCell or any of the SCells.","Using the same RAR to perform the timing advance adjustment, followed by performing smaller, individual 6-bit timing adjustments at one or more SCells can be useful in scenarios where the propagation distance between the PCell and the SCell(s) is minimal, such as in a system that uses multiple remote radio heads that are a relatively equal distance from the eNodeB. The 6-bit timing advance adjustment can then be used to correct for relatively small timing differences. As previously discussed, the size of the timing differences for which the 6-bit timing advance adjustment is used can depend on system design requirements, among other factors. The timing differences may be from 5*Ts to more than 100*Ts. In addition, multiple small timing differences can be performed to allow for larger timing differences to be made using the 6-bit timing adjustment.","In another example embodiment, the flow chart of  depicts a method  for adjusting a timing of a wireless communication in a wireless communication system configured for carrier aggregation. The method comprises communicating  a random access preamble in an uplink from a user equipment (HE) to an eNodeB via a Primary Cell (PCell) associated with a selected component carrier of the carrier aggregation. The selected component carrier may be the first component carrier, or another component carrier that is assigned as the PCell.","The method  further comprises receiving  a Random Access Response (RAR) at the UE from the eNodeB for the PCell.
