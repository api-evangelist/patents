{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/091,147, filed Aug. 22, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for implementing a media campaign for delivering a multi-part set of media programs to an audience. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for implementing an interactive media campaign, in which an interactive program or media content is delivered to an audience such that members of the audience may interact with the media content to provide input that is received and processed as part of the interactive media campaign, as well as systems and methods for implementing a dynamic media campaign, in which different dynamic programs or media contents may be delivered or addressed to particular segments of the audience, and in which the media contents delivered to the particular segments of the audience may be changed during the course of the dynamic media campaign. That is, a campaign may be dynamic in the sense that updates to dynamic programs or media contents of the campaign may be communicated and implemented during the execution of the campaign; and a campaign may be interactive in the sense that an audience member may interact or provide input to an interactive program while viewing or experiencing the program, such that the input is received and processed by the campaign owner and\/or another party responsible for providing the interactive program to the audience member. A dynamic program may also be an interactive program. In an aspect of the present invention, the execution of a campaign is comprehensively measured during the course of the campaign to obtain service measurement data, which may be used to optimize the current campaign or future campaigns. The service measurement data is collected and reported to the campaign's owner, for example, so that the data can be used to monetize the campaign by demonstrating its successful execution and its reach and response rates. The data also provides a means for forecasting the success of future campaigns, and serves as a basis for any number of analyses on viewership trends\/characteristics of campaigns.","2. Related Art","Presently, there are several known ways to provide media contents to an audience. For radio programs, analog AM and FM signal-transmission technologies are well known and in popular use, and digital signal-transmission technologies have advanced to the point that the popularity of digital radios has increased notably in the last decade. For television programs, analog signal-transmission technologies, cable transmission technologies, and satellite transmission technologies are well known and in popular use.","A common characteristic of the above-mentioned media technologies is that the media programs are intended to be experienced by a general audience and a passive audience. That is, a single program is broadcast for all members of the audience to experience (i.e., watch and\/or listen to). Therefore, the above-mentioned media technologies do not make accommodations for the diverse backgrounds, diverse tastes, and diverse interests of the general audience. Moreover, the above-mentioned media technologies do not allow for members of the audience to interact with the program while it is being broadcast.","Given the foregoing, what is needed are systems and methods for facilitating the implementation of an interactive broadcast campaign, in which audience members (also referred to herein as \u201cviewers\u201d or \u201csubscribers\u201d) can interact with media content contained in an interactive program of the campaign, and in which the interactive broadcast campaign can include different interactive programs broadcast to different segments of the audience members, respectively.","As used herein, the term \u201cbroadcast\u201d is used generally to describe delivery of media contents to an audience by any type of transport mechanism, including via cable technologies, via Web-based technologies, via satellite technologies, via video-on-demand (or VOD) technologies, via traditional radio-wave technologies, via digital video recorder (or DVR) type technologies, and the like. As such, broadcasting of media contents includes delivery of the media contents to individual viewers (e.g., in the case of VOD technologies) as well as broad delivery to a general audience (e.g., in the case of traditional radio-wave technologies).","The above-identified needs are met by providing a platform for facilitating the creation, execution, and monitoring of a dynamic broadcast campaign with dynamic programs or media contents, an interactive broadcast campaign with one or more interactive programs or media contents, or a dynamic and interactive broadcast campaign. An interactive program enables an audience member to send a message to the program, such that the message is received and processed by the program itself or received by the program and processed by the broadcasting service company (also referred to herein as \u201cbroadcaster\u201d or \u201cmedia seller\u201d) that aired the program. A dynamic media campaign includes media contents that can be changed or updated during the course of the campaign. For example, a dynamic media campaign may be scheduled to broadcast Program A of the campaign on a daily basis to a selected segment of the audience during the month of June, but on June 2the campaign may be revised or updated to broadcast Program B of the campaign to that segment of the audience.","The platform includes interfaces for transmitting information between a media-content creator, a coordinator, and a broadcaster. For example, the information may include any one or a combination of: media content, format data, control data, message-processing instructions, timing data, address information, status information, audience-response reports, content-creation tools, audience demographic information, information on geographical range, as well as other types of information.","For the sake of simplicity, the term \u201cinteractive\/dynamic\u201d is used to refer to objects that are interactive and\/or dynamic.","According to aspects of the present invention, the platform facilitates implementation of an interactive\/dynamic broadcast campaign. The platform enables media buyers (e.g., media-content creators, product manufacturers, advertising agencies, political organizations, and the like) to partner with media sellers (e.g., cable operators, broadcasters, networks, media-service providers, and the like) across the lifecycle of the campaign, and provides rules-based interfaces for transmitting information between media buyers, a media coordinator, and media sellers. The interfaces function in any one or a combination of the following capacities:\n\n","In one embodiment, the platform is utilized to implement an interactive advertising campaign, in which an audience member may interact with an advertisement (or ad) to obtain information regarding an advertised product, information regarding the manufacturer of the product, and\/or information regarding where the product may be purchased, for example. A benefit of this embodiment is that it allows a media buyer (e.g., advertising agency, product manufacturer, and the like) to obtain metrics on how audience members interact with the ad, such as metrics on the number of requests for information received for an advertised product, the geographical distribution of those requests for information, the number of requests for information received for various products in a family of products, the timing distribution of those requests, as well as other metrics that would provide insight into the interests of the audience members who experience the ad.","In another embodiment, the platform is utilized to implement an interactive broadcast campaign for a \u201creality-based\u201d television program, in which an audience member may interact with televised interaction prompts to, for example, vote for a favorite contestant, vote for a least favorite actor, vote for a plot development, etc. A benefit of this embodiment is that it allows a media buyer (e.g., media-content creator, television producer, and the like) to obtain metrics on how audience members interact with the reality program, such as metrics on the number of votes obtained for each of the contestants in a contest-based reality program, polling\/voting results on the likes and\/or dislikes of plot developments in a serialized television program, a geographical distribution of messages received in connection with a television program, as well as other metrics that would provide insight into the interests of audience members.","In yet another embodiment, the platform is utilized to implement an interactive broadcast campaign for educational purposes, in which an audience member may interact with an interactive prompt to obtain more detailed information on a selected topic. A benefit of this embodiment is that it enables the audience member to learn about the selected topic at his or her own pace. This, in turn, encourages the audience member to be loyal to the broadcaster.","In still another embodiment, the platform is utilized to implement a dynamic advertising campaign, in which a particular type of ad is delivered to an audience member during a broadcast. For example, the broadcast may be a VOD broadcast, a DVR broadcast, a Web-based broadcast, a satellite broadcast, an RF broadcast, and the like. The campaign may have rules setting a particular type of ad to be delivered according to a category the audience member belongs to (e.g., zip code, etc.) or according to a type of the broadcast (e.g., Yankees games, Seinfeld episodes, news shows, etc.). Additionally, the rules of the campaign may be re-set or changed during the course of the campaign such that a different type of ad is delivered to the audience member than originally set.","The present invention is directed to systems and methods for implementing an interactive\/dynamic broadcast campaign, in which an interactive\/dynamic program is broadcast to an audience. In an interactive broadcast campaign, members of the audience may interact with media content of an interactive program that is part of the campaign. Each interactive program of an interactive broadcast campaign enables audience members to interact or send messages to the program, such that the messages are received and processed by the program itself or received by the program and processed by the broadcaster that aired the program or another party associated with the interactive program (e.g., an owner of an interactive broadcast campaign corresponding to the interactive program). In a dynamic broadcast campaign, a predetermined program is delivered to a segment of the audience under predetermined conditions (e.g., time of day, type of broadcast being experienced, etc.), and the campaign may be revised to deliver a different predetermined program to the segment of the audience or to deliver the predetermined program to a different segment of the audience. A broadcast campaign may be both interactive and dynamic.","The systems and methods of the present invention utilize a platform that facilitates the creation, execution, and monitoring of an interactive\/dynamic broadcast campaign, as well as one or more interactive\/dynamic programs within the campaign. The following descriptions describe the platform in connection with an interactive broadcast campaign. However, as will be readily appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, the platform also may be used in connection with a dynamic broadcast campaign.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","106","102","104","108","106","110"]},"The communication network  may be the Internet, a dedicated or private communication network, a satellite communication network, or a combination thereof, or any other means of communication between the media buyers , the media sellers , and the media coordinator .","Each of the media buyers  and the media sellers  may include a personal computer, a workstation, or any other communication device that is able to transmit information to and receive information from the media coordinator  via the communication network .","The control program, when executed by the media coordinator , provides a platform for implementing an interactive broadcast campaign.

An interactive program of such a campaign enables a viewer to interact with a display screen to view a content item selected via the display screen, such that a selection made by the viewer causes the selected content item to be displayed on the display screen.","For example, the on-demand interactive broadcast campaign may an advertising campaign for a product\/service. The display screen may display an advertisement for the product\/service, with an interactive feature that enables the viewer to demand (i.e., request immediate delivery) of additional information regarding the product\/service via the display screen. When the viewer makes a demand using a selection device, such as a remote controller, to make a selection, the demanded additional information regarding the product\/service is promptly displayed on the display screen. The selected additional information may, in turn, be an interactive advertisement that enables the viewer to obtain further information or details regarding the product\/service. A beneficial aspect of this embodiment is that the media seller  is able to obtain statistics regarding the numbers and types of viewers who express an interest in a product\/service. Another beneficial aspect of this embodiment is that the viewer can be provided with selected information upon demand, i.e., immediately, and the viewer can make further selections to obtain information regarding the product\/service at the level of detail desired by the user.","For instance, a short-form interactive program may have an interactive function that enables a viewer to view a corresponding long-form program upon demand, in which the long-form program expands on information introduced in the short-form program.","In another instance, the on-demand interactive advertisement may be for an automobile manufacturer. The viewer may select (i.e., demand) additional information on pick-up trucks, SUVs, sedans, convertibles, sports cars, mini-vans, hybrid cars, etc., made by the manufacturer. When the viewer interacts with the advertisement to demand information on sedans, the sedan branch of the advertisement is displayed to the viewer. In turn, while viewing the sedan branch, when the viewer demands information on a particular type of sedan, the advertisement displays information from the selected sub-branch, and so on. This type of branching of information provided to the viewer may also be referred to herein as \u201ctelescoping.\u201d","In another example, the on-demand interactive broadcast campaign may be for an educational campaign, such as for educating television viewers regarding an upcoming change in broadcasting format to a digital format, for example. The display screen may display a promotional video on the upcoming change, with an interactive feature that enables the viewer to request additional information. The additional information may include, for example, information on how the change is to be implemented, how viewers may be affected, equipment requirements, etc. When the viewer interacts with the video to demand information on equipment requirements, the equipment branch of the video is displayed to the viewer. In turn, while viewing the equipment branch, when the viewer demands information on vendors for a particular type of equipment, the video displays information from the selected sub-branch, and so on.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, an interactive broadcast campaign may be a vote\/poll-based interactive program campaign. An interactive program of such a campaign enables a viewer to interact with a display screen to place a vote or take part in a poll regarding content displayed on the display screen.","For example, the vote\/poll-based interactive broadcast campaign may be for a reality-based television show, in which viewers may place votes that determine how the show will proceed. During broadcasting of the show, the display screen may display a prompt, indicating to the viewer to input a response to the prompt, such as by making a selection from a list of options. The show may be a live broadcast or a pre-recorded broadcast. The number of votes may be used to determine, for example, whether a participant on the show is permitted to return for another show, a song to be sung by a participant on the current or on a subsequent show, a prize to be awarded to a participant, etc.","For instance, the vote\/poll-based interactive program may be for a live game show. Viewers interact with prompts displayed during the program to select, for example, a category of questions to be answered by the contestants, a prize to be awarded for a correct answer, a penalty to be incurred for a wrong answer, etc. A beneficial aspect of this embodiment is that votes can be tallied or counted quickly so that the results can be used to affect a current outcome of a show as it is happening, thus providing a way to keep the viewers' attention for the entire show.","As indicated above, interactive broadcast campaigns provide a means for media buyers  to obtain information on the viewing habits, interests, and purchasing habits of the viewers. For example, media sellers  that broadcast a request-based interactive program can obtain information on any one or a combination of the following types of information: a total number of requests for information, a regional distribution of the requests for information, and a distribution of the requests for information based on a psychographic characteristic.","Similarly, media sellers  that broadcast an on-demand interactive program can obtain information on any one or a combination of the following types of information: a total number of requests to view a program, a distribution of durations that a program is viewed, a distribution of times when requests to view a program are made, a distribution of ad selections made by viewers with respect to a plurality of programs offered for selection, a distribution of telescoping selections made by viewers in response to a telescoping program, a regional distribution of a selected program, and a distribution of a selected program based on psychographic subscriber characteristics.","Also similarly, media sellers  that broadcast a vote\/poll-based interactive program can obtain information on any one or a combination of the following types of information: a distribution of votes or polls made by viewers with respect to a plurality of items offered for voting or polling, a regional distribution of votes or polls made by viewers with respect to a plurality of items offered for voting or polling, and a distribution votes or polls based on psychographic subscriber characteristics.","In turn, the media sellers  can provide summary reports on how viewers responded to the interactive programs, which media buyers  can use for market research purposes, for example.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, an interactive broadcast campaign may include different interactive programs directed to different segments of the audience covered by the media seller(s)  broadcasting the interactive programs. This enables media buyers  to target a product, for example, to audience members belonging to a particular consumer group or a particular demographic category.","For example, an interactive broadcast campaign may include a main program that is in English, with an interactive feature that enables viewers to select to view additional information in a particular language format. The additional information provided to the viewers need not only be in the chosen language format, it also may include a wholly different video with different characters and story lines than the additional information provided for a different chosen language format. That is, the additional information is produced by taking into account the ethnic background of the audience members corresponding to a particular language format, such that actors, music, story themes, etc., are compatible with that ethnic background. For instance, when a viewer selects to view additional information in a Spanish format, the additional information may include actors, music, and story themes, etc., of interest to Hispanic or Latino audience members.","In another example, an interactive broadcast campaign may include several different interactive programs encoded so that media sellers  can broadcast a specific program to a specific segment of the viewing audience. For instance, if the interactive broadcast campaign is for a type of soda, the interactive broadcast campaign may include coding that enables a media seller  to broadcast a child-friendly interactive soda advertisement to a kids-oriented cable channel (e.g., Nickelodeon\u2122, Disney\u2122), a feminine-themed interactive soda advertisement to a cable channel directed to women (e.g., We\u2122, Oxygen\u2122, Lifetime\u2122), a sports-themed interactive soda advertisement to a sports channel (e.g., YES\u2122, ESPN\u2122 MSG\u2122), and a masculine-themed interactive soda advertisement to a cable channel directed to men (e.g., Spike TV\u2122, TNT\u2122).","In another example, an interactive broadcast campaign may include several different interactive programs encoded so that media sellers  can broadcast a specific program to a specific segment of the viewing audience. For instance, if the interactive broadcast campaign is for a car manufacturer, the interactive broadcast campaign may include coding that enables a media seller  to broadcast an advertisement for an economy car to households of a particular zip code and to broadcast an advertisement for a luxury car to households of another zip code. For this example, a decision on the type of advertisement shown for any particular zip code may be based on market data on the average disposable income for residents within that zip code.","In yet another example, an interactive broadcast campaign may include an interactive program that is encoded so that multiple media sellers  can broadcast the program nationwide, and so that viewer responses or interactive messages received by the multiple media sellers  may be easily summarized into a single report. For instance, the interactive program may be an interactive advertisement for a new type of mobile telephone, for which the media buyer  responsible for producing the interactive program has arranged via the media coordinator  to have the interactive program broadcast nationwide during a pre-selected week. The encoding enables the multiple media sellers , which may serve different geographical regions or different populations with the same geographical region, to have a consistent way to receive and interpret the messages from the STBs, for example, thus enabling easy aggregation of the messages for statistical purposes.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a dynamic broadcast campaign may include a program to be broadcast to a selected category of viewers. For example, the program may be a Ford\u2122 pick-up truck advertisement, which is to be broadcast to viewers of a boxing match as part of a Ford\u2122 campaign. The broadcast can be live or recorded. For example, the truck advertisement may be aired during a live broadcast of the boxing match, a VOD broadcast of the boxing match, a DVR-recorded playback of the boxing match, a Web-based broadcast of the boxing match, a satellite transmission of the boxing match, etc. The truck advertisement may be an interactive advertisement. After the Ford\u2122 campaign has begun, a decision can be made to change the program from the truck advertisement to an advertisement for a Ford\u2122 sedan, such that the sedan advertisement is aired during a broadcast of the boxing match.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a dynamic broadcast campaign may include different programs to be broadcast to different categories of viewers. For example, the campaign may be an advertising campaign for a national restaurant franchise, such that different advertisements are aired during news programs in different geographical locations of the country. For instance, a restaurant advertisement with country music may be aired in regions known to favor country music, an advertisement with hip-hop music may be aired in urban locations, etc.","In an embodiment of the present invention, information transmitted between a media seller  and the media coordinator  is in accordance with a transmission protocol. For example, the transmission protocol may include a Web services protocol that utilizes a SOAP messaging interface and an HTTP or an HTTPS messaging protocol. Data transmitted between the media seller  and the media coordinator  conform with a set of pre-defined XML schema.","For example, service measurement information transmitted between the service measurement submodule  of the media seller  and the media coordinator  may include a service measurement header portion and a measurement data portion. The service measurement header portion may include, for example, any one or a combination of: a version identifier for identifying a protocol version to be used for a message received from a viewer, a timestamp for indicating a reference time of the received message, and a geographic identifier for indicating a zip code or a system code for identifying a geographical location of the received message. The measurement data portion may include, for example, any one or a combination of: a programming event identifier (or PEID), which identifies a scheduled program corresponding to the received message (e.g., Yankees\/Red Sox game broadcast at 1 pm ET on Jun. 1, 2008); an enhanced program sequence identifier (or EPSID), which identifies a sequence within the PEID (e.g., a sequence of interactive prompts associated with a voting\/polling event); and an event identifier (or EventID), which identifies a reportable event (e.g., a poll question, an interactive prompt, etc.) within the EPSID.","Similarly, in another example, viewer response information (e.g., application fulfillment information) transmitted between the viewer response submodule  of the media seller  and the media coordinator  may include a fulfillment header portion and an event data portion. The fulfillment header portion may include, for example, any one or a combination of: a version identifier, a timestamp, and a geographic identifier. The event data portion may include, for example, any one or a combination of an event type identifier, a PEID, an EPSID, and an EventID. The EventID identifies a discreet event that occurred during an EPSID, such as a channel change by the viewer, or an exit from a telescoping or branching sequence.","The event type identifier identifies the type of the interactive program corresponding to a message received from a viewer. For example, the event type identifier may identify that the interactive program is a vote\/poll-based interactive program, or a request-based interactive program, or an on-demand interactive program. In the case of a request-based interactive program, the event type identifier may include subscriber information, such as the street address or the telephone number corresponding to the STB from where the received message originated, for example. In the case of a vote\/poll-based interactive program, the event type identifier may be used to carry an aggregated voting\/polling result.","In another embodiment of the present invention, information transmitted between a viewer, via a STB , and a media seller  takes place via an interactive platform  in accordance with a transmission protocol, as schematically shown in . The transmission protocol utilizes a set of pre-defined XML schema to transfer messages from the STB  to an interface provided by the interactive platform . The application formats that conform with the transmission protocol include, for example, ETV and OCAP, both of which support an HTTP messaging protocol.","For example, an application message transmitted between the STB  and the interface provided by the interactive platform  may include an application message header portion and an application message block portion. The application message header portion may include, for example, any one or a combination of a version identifier, a timestamp, a geographic identifier, a unit identifier (or UnitID), and a PEID. The UnitID may be used to identify a unique device of the interactive platform  to which the application message from the STB  is to be directed. The message block portion may include, for example, an EPSID and\/or an application report block, which includes data relating to a specific event. For example, the application report block may include any one or a combination of: an EventID, a user message or input corresponding to the EventID, and a time duration corresponding to the EventID.","In a further embodiment of the present invention, business rules regarding a broadcast campaign (dynamic and\/or interactive) may be incorporated as identifiers in an interactive\/dynamic program of the campaign, such that the program is aired according to the rules. For example, the rules may be XML schema that specify that the interactive\/dynamic program is to be aired whenever a particular show is broadcast, and also may specify one or more airing times during the show. Thus, when a broadcaster (e.g., media provider, media seller, cable system, satellite system, etc.) receives an indication that a viewer is viewing that particular show (e.g., by a VOD request, by a Web access, by a DVR request, by a cable station selection, by a satellite station selection, etc.), the interactive\/dynamic program is automatically inserted or integrated with the airing of the show.","The systems and methods of the present invention (or any part(s) or function(s) thereof) may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination thereof and may be implemented in one or more computer systems or other processing systems. Although some of the features or aspects of the present invention are described in terms that may be associated with mental operations performed by a human operator, no such capability of a human operator is necessary or is even desirable.
