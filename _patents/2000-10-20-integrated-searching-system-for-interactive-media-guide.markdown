{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09\/590,904, filed on Jun. 9, 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 8,079,047, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates in general to television systems, and more particularly, to the field of interactive guides.","With recent advances in digital transmission technology, cable television systems are now capable of providing much more than the traditional analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the settop box, has become an important computing device for accessing media services and navigating a user through a maze of available services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of two-way digital services such as video-on-demand.","Typically, a DHCT is connected to a cable or satellite television network and includes hardware and software necessary to provide the functionality of the digital television system at the client's site. Preferably, some of the software executed by a DHCT is downloaded and\/or updated via the cable television network. Each DHCT also typically includes a processor, communication components and memory, and is connected to a television or other display device, such as a personal computer. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, a DHCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","As more and more services and applications are provided, cable television systems are providing media information to the DHCT so that the user can view the media information on the DHCT display such as the television. This media information has traditionally been organized for presentation purposes into a media guide format that presents the media information by time and channel only. The media guide can, for instance, automatically scroll the available television channels to present the media information such as name and title, by time.","Many cable system operators include one or more dedicated channels that scroll through the channel list displaying the programs that not only are currently on, but also are scheduled to be on in the future. These types of passive displays do not rely on a terminal for presentation of the programming data and also lack the interactive functionality of permitting a user to scroll to a desired channel for a desired time. For example, the user typically must view the programming information as it scrolls on the display and wait for either the desired channel and\/or the desired time to search for the media that may be available for viewing.","With the advent of program guide \u201cbrowsers\u201d for use in cable television systems, viewers (also referred to as \u201csubscribers\u201d or \u201cusers\u201d) can scan television program information by time and channel while watching the tuned channel. In analog systems that offer a limited number of cable television channels, these browsers enable the viewer to easily scan available programs one-by-one in order of channel number. However, many digital systems can provide hundreds of channels as well as thousands of video-on-demand (VOD) movies. In such systems, scanning program information by channel numbers sequentially or by video titles alphabetically can require many keystrokes by the viewer and can consume tremendous amounts of time. Additionally, locating a particular program can be quite tedious if the viewer does not already know the name or number of the channel on which the program will be showing or whether the program is available as a video-on-demand option. As a result, there is a need for an interactive media guide that enables viewers to easily and efficiently locate media information that they are seeking.","The invention may be viewed as a system for providing media services to a user via an interactive media services client device coupled to a programmable media services server device. A method of the preferred embodiment of the invention includes receiving user input, searching media information stored in memory, and providing the user with a search result that is related to user input.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.","The present invention is generally implemented as part of a cable television system (CTS). Hence, an illustrative CTS  and its operation will be described initially.  shows a block diagram view of a CTS , which is generally a high quality, reliable and integrated network system that features video, audio, voice and data services to DHCT users. Although  depicts a high level view of a CTS , it should be appreciated that a plurality of cable television systems can tie together a plurality of regional networks into an integrated global network so that DHCT users can receive content provided from anywhere in the world.","The CTS  delivers broadcast video signals as digitally formatted signals in addition to delivering traditional broadcast analog video signals. Furthermore, the system can support one way broadcast services as well as both one-way data services and two-way media and data services. The two-way operation of the network allows for user interactivity with services, such as Pay-Per-View programming, Near Video-On-Demand (NVOD) programming according to any of several known NVOD implementation methods, View-on-Demand (VOD) programming (according to any of several known VOD implementation methods), and interactive applications, such as Internet connections and interactive media Guide (IMG) applications.","The CTS  also provides the interfaces, network control, transport control, session control, and servers to access content and services, and distributes content and services to DHCT users. As shown in , a typical CTS  comprises a headend , hubs , an HFC access network , and users' digital home communication terminals (DHCTs) . It should be appreciated that although a single component (e.g. a headend) is illustrated in , a CTS  can feature a plurality of any one of the illustrated components or may be configured with alternative embodiments for any one of the individual components or with yet other additional components not enumerated above. A content provider (not shown) transmits media content to a headend for further transmission to users downstream in the network.","Content provided by a content provider is communicated by the content provider to one or more headends . From those headends the content is then communicated over a communications network  that includes a plurality of HFC access networks  (only one HFC access network  is illustrated). The HFC access network  typically comprises a plurality of HFC nodes , each of which may serve a local geographical area. The hub  connects to the HFC node  through a fiber portion of the HFC access network . The HFC node  is connected to a tap  which is connected to a network interface unit (NIU)  which is connected to a DHCT . The NIU  is normally located at a user's property and provides a transparent interface between the HFC node  and the users' internal wiring. Coaxial cables are typically used to couple nodes , taps  and NIUs  because the electrical signals can be easily repeated with radio frequency (RF) amplifiers.","As the high-level operations of many of the functions of CTSs  are well known to those of skill in the art, further description of the overall CTS  of  will not be contained herein. It will be appreciated, however, that the CTS  shown in  is merely illustrative and should not be construed as implying any limitations upon the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["16","11","73","41","16","16","42","11","18","11","18"]},"The DHCT  further includes a processor  for controlling operations of the DHCT , an RF output system  for driving the television display , and a tuner system  for tuning into a particular television channel to be displayed and for sending and receiving various types of data from the headend . The tuner system  includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner for bi-directional quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) data communication and a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) tuner for receiving television signals.","The DHCT  is coupled to a personal video recorder (PVR)  via a communications port  and possibly via video and audio output ports of DHCT  connected to video and audio input ports of PVR  and\/or video and audio output ports of PVR  connected to video and audio input ports of DHCT , as shown by the bi-directional horizontal arrow in . A personal video recorder (PVR) is a video recorder for recording media presentations, preferably via a digital recording mechanism. In an alternative embodiment, PVR functionality is integrated into the DHCT  or vice versa. In another alternate embodiment, multiple PVR units are connected to DHCT , one or more housed internal to DHCT  and one or more connected externally to DHCT  via one or more communication ports such as communication port .","PVR  comprises a local storage device (not shown) in which media can be written to and stored and later read from and retrieved for viewing or playing. The storage device can be a device such as a hard drive storage device based on magnetism principles or a compact disc readable and writeable device based on optical or laser technology principles.","The interactive media guide (IMG) client application  stores information in the IMG database  regarding media presentations that are currently available via the DHCT  or the personal video recorder . A receiver  receives externally-generated information, such as user inputs or commands from other devices. The user inputs may, for example, be provided via a remote control device , an infrared (IR) or wired keyboard (not shown), keys in the front panel of DHCT , or some other input device (not shown).","In one implementation, the DHCT  includes system memory , which includes flash memory  and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) , for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor  of the DHCT . Both the flash memory  and the DRAM memory  are coupled to the processor  for storing configuration data and operational parameters, such as commands that are recognized by the processor . Basic functionality of the DHCT  is provided by an operating system  that is contained in flash memory . Among other things, the operating system  includes at least one resource manager  that provides an interface to resources of the DHCT  such as, for example, computing resources.","One or more programmed software applications, herein referred to as applications, are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT . The application executable program stored in flash memory  or DRAM memory  is executed by processor  (e.g., a central processing unit or digital signal processor) under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by the application program is stored in DRAM memory  or flash memory  and read by processor  as need be during the course of application program execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM memory  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application program at the time it was generated as a software application program, in which case it is stored in flash memory . Data may be received via any of the communication ports of the DHCT , from the headend  via the DHCT's network communication interface  (i.e., the QAM or out-of-band tuners) or as user input via receiver . A type of input data fulfills and serves the purpose of parameters. Data generated by application program is stored in DRAM memory  by processor  during the course of application program execution.","An application referred to as navigator  is also resident in flash memory  for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment\/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The applications may be resident in flash memory  or downloaded into DRAM . The navigator  also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT functions such as, for example, setting a program record operation to be effected with a personal video recorder (), enabling a special access program (SAP), setting a sleep timer, adding a channel to a favorites list, providing an interactive media guide, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a browse-by menu, activating parental control, and displaying a video-on-demand titles list etc. Some of the functionality performed by applications executed in the DHCT  (such as the VOD application ) may instead be performed at the headend  and vice versa.","The flash memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a client service application manager (SAM) .","The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  on the DHCT  is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and de-allocation of the limited DHCT  screen resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager  also maintains, among other things, a user input registry  in DRAM  so that when a user enters a key or a command via the remote control device  or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry  is accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT  should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device , the command is received by the receiver  and relayed to the processor . The processor  dispatches the event to the operating system  where it is forwarded to the window manager  which ultimately accesses the user input registry  and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application.","The Client SAM  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend . A SAM database  in DRAM  includes a data structure of media services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend . Many media services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Examples of media services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, presenting television programs (via a WATCHTV application ), pay-per-view (PPV) events (via a PPV application ), video-on-demand (via a VOD application ), and media information gathering and display (via an IMG application ). The term \u201cmedia\u201d is herein defined to include television programs, PPV events, VOD programs, graphical and textual based programs, and any other video and\/or audio presentation or combinations thereof. In general, the identification of a media service includes the identification of an executable application that effects the media service and also includes a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the specific media service to be provided. As a non-limiting example, a service of presenting a television program could be executed with the WATCHTV  application with a set of parameters to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D. The Client SAM  also interfaces with the resource manager , as discussed below, to control resources of the DHCT .","Application clients can also be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the Client SAM , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend. In this non-limiting example DRAM  contains a VOD application , an e-mail application , an IMG application , and a web browser application . It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for this present embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in flash memory  or vice versa. These applications, and others provided by the cable system operator, are top level software entities on the network for providing media services to the user.","In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT  work with the navigator  by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the Client SAM  for the provision, activation, and suspension of services. Second, an application shares DHCT  resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the Client SAM , the operating system , and the DHCT . Third, an application handles situations where resources are unavailable without navigator  intervention. Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM (the navigator  will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application client is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator (i.e., power, channel +\/\u2212, volume +\/\u2212, etc.). DRAM  also includes application memory  that various applications may use for storing and retrieving data.","The IMG client application  provides the user with a displayed presentation of media information that the IMG client application  retrieves from an IMG database  and\/or from a remote application server via communication with such remote application server via communication interface . The media information includes the titles of media presentations, information identifying their respective service type (VOD, NVOD PPV, PVR, cable channel, or broadcast channel), the times that the media presentations will be available (if applicable) or the time a media program was recorded in PVR  with an expiration time for when the recorded program will be erased from PVR device. The media information also includes the channel numbers on which the respective media presentations will be available (if applicable) or PVR instead of channel with the channel in which it was received into DHCT  and recorded in parentheses next after PVR. Alternatively, a representative icon can be displayed to the user that signifies a recorded program.","The media information can further include duration of media programs, quality of media programs such as digital standard format, digital high-definition format, or analog format, the level of random access featured in the respective media programs, the levels of program copy or record entitlement, the cost associated with the respective media programs, and requirements to receive the respective media programs.","Any specific media information field can be visually communicated to the user with the employment of icons that denote corresponding meaning. For instance, the quality of media program can be displayed with an HD icon, SD icon, or an A icon. The level of random access can be denoted also with icons such as a \u201c<<\u2225>>\u201d to denote full random access as available in most VOD services and from recorded media, by \u201c\u2225>\u201d for pause and resume as available in Near Video-on-Demand (NVOD)service, or by a circle with a diameter bar or NA icon for no random access level as in the case of PPV or regular broadcast media. Likewise, other media information types such as the level of copying or recording entitlement, cost, and requirements can be communicated with icons to the user.","Levels of random access in the media information include the right to pause, stop, resume play, rewind and fast-forward the media program on a real-time basis. Levels of program copying or recording entitlement include whether the media program can be recorded at all, whether the media program is a previously recorded media program, and the quality at which the media program can be recorded as reflected by maximum bit rate and video and audio compression format.","Requirement information for receiving a media program includes TV type information such as an HDTV set or merely an NTSC analog TV, type of audio playback system, and\/or subscription service requirement. As an example of a subscription service, a media program may be broadcast by a premium channel such as HBO and requires subscription to receive the HBO channel.","In one embodiment the IMG client application  stores relevant media information in the IMG database . The IMG database  may be a prepared database received via communication interface  of DHCT  from an IMG server counterpart at the headend  or some other remote location. In an alternative embodiment, other media applications (such as VOD application , PPV application , PVR application , and WATCHTV application ) are responsible for storing relevant media information in the IMG database . In yet another embodiment, relevant media information is stored and retrieved from application memory  by the IMG application  by conducting search operations in the respective databases of the aforementioned applications. Furthermore, if an electronic program guide (EPG) application and respective database exist, the EPG database application stores relevant information in IMG database , otherwise IMG client application  would conduct search operations in the EPG database as well. The present invention is not limited by where or how the media information is stored or retrieved.","The IMG database  is structured with records, each record comprising multiple fields, each field containing data for a respective attribute of the record. A field may comprise a subrecord of multiple field entities. For example, the record for media information for a movie entitled \u201cElection,\u201d may contain a title field, and multiple subrecords, each subrecord comprises each instance of Election that the user can view. Hence, each subrecord may comprise fields for: service type attribute, channel number, quality attribute, a field to store level of random access attribute, a field to store level of copy\/record attribute, etc. In one alternate embodiment, the IMG database  or parts thereof may reside in the storage device in PVR . Consequently, IMG client application  writes data to PVR  to store media information and reads data from PVR  to retrieve media information as necessary.","An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM  and\/or flash memory . Likewise, data inputted into or outputted from any executable program can reside in DRAM  or flash memory . Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an OS component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in flash memory , or in a local storage device connected to DHCT  and can be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in flash memory  or a storage device and can be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data outputted by an executable program can be written into DRAM  by an executable program or algorithm and can be transferred into flash memory  or into a storage device for storage purposes. The present invention is not limited by where or how data and\/or applications are stored or retrieved.","Each of the above mentioned applications comprises executable instructions for implementing logical functions and can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a nonexhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection (electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM) (electronic), a read-only memory (ROM) (electronic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (electronic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM) (optical). Note that the computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, and then stored in a computer memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["90","16","90","96","95","90"]},"With continued reference to  throughout the remaining figures,  depicts an example interactive media guide screen  that illustrates an initial guide arrangement in a time format. As with other window examples discussed below, processor  executes program instructions of MOD client application  that cause it to direct the window manager  to create window  via display data that is formatted for television . Processor  stores the display data or parts thereof in DRAM  (as necessary) and transfers the display data to a display output system such as RF output system  wherein display data is converted to respective television signals and transmitted to television . Of course, the scope of the invention also includes any other method of causing the described windows to appear to the user.","The top left portion of the example screen  is a detailed focus area  that includes detailed channel information (channel number, channel name (HBO), media name, media description, duration, any episode information or rating, etc.) for an \u201cin-focus\u201d media corresponding to highlighted title area  in a main media title display area . The media presentation showing on the channel to which the DHCT  is currently tuned (for which audio is also playing, and which is typically the media occupying the full screen before the IMG client application  is activated) is displayed in a reduced screen area  in example screen . Immediately below the reduced screen area  is an information banner  showing the channel to which the DHCT  is currently tuned, the current day and date, and the current time. The middle left portion of example screen  includes a channel area  that is related to the selected ordering format and is described in more detail below. Heading portion  contains headings related to the information displayed in the channel area  and the main media title display area . The main media title display area  contains media titles corresponding to media presentations that are or will be available for viewing during the time periods listed under the heading portion . The highlighted title area  is centered in the main media title display area  enabling the user to scroll up and down to the various media titles listed in the main media title display area .","The main media title display area  includes media names organized in a grid of rows of channels and columns of time. The channel area  includes a vertical list of channels organized sequentially by channel number. The main media title display area  can be scrolled in both time and channel number dimensions. The time dimensions are a horizontal array of media names categorized in columns of times in which they are broadcast.","In this non-limiting example, the lowest channel in this channel list displayed in the channel area  is HBO which is shown as channel . Continuing with this non-limiting example, the left-most time column in the main media title display area  is set to include titles of media presentations scheduled to be broadcast about two hours into the future with the middle title being \u201cin-focus\u201d and corresponding to a media presentation on the lowest channel. Therefore, in this example, the movie \u201cElection\u201d which is on channel , is centered in the highlighted title area . It should be noted that the current media presentation shown in reduced screen area  and referenced in information banner , corresponds to a different channel (which in this example is channel ) and not to the in-focus media on channel . The bottom area  of example screen  indicates options for the \u201cA\u201d , \u201cB\u201d , and \u201cC\u201d  buttons on the remote control device . The \u201cA\u201d button  is shown assigned to invoke a \u201cBrowse-by\u201d menu which would function as discussed below. The \u201cB\u201d button  enables the user to select a different date for viewing or searching media data via example screen . Operation of the \u201cC\u201d button  results in the display of media titles in the main media title display area  which correspond to media presentations that are or will be playing during a time period that includes the current time, with the media title currently on the channel to which the DHCT is tuned highlighted and displayed in the \u201cin focus\u201d area  The times listed the heading portion  are updated accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["93","90","100","111","110","90","111","111","72","71","71","72","72","41","48","100","110","94","90","72"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["120","92","90","72","122","121","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["130","122","120","131","132","130","90","72","131","90","131","131"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["140","141","130","141","16","141","90","71","72","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"],"b":["150","151","141","153","151","152","151","151","152","101","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["160","130","160","91","90","130","164","90","163","165","97","90"]},"In one embodiment the search system described herein comprises capabilities for filtering-out and filtering-in attributes or fields of on-demand titles whereby search operations effect a search result compliant to one or more set filters activated by a user.
