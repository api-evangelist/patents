Namely, the WWW service is established by transmitting information written by a language such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language) using a client\/server type protocol (communication agreement) referred to as HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) between a client usually using a personal computer (PC), that is, a Web browser, and a server.","The Web browser carried in the client PC has as its main role to access a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) designated by a user and display the information. As Web browsers, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Communications' Netscape Navigator are famous.","When obtaining information from a server using a Web browser, text files having file extensions such as \u201c.html\u201d or \u201c.htm\u201d are sent from the server to the Web browser. These files are written in the HTML language and are document files of a type referred to as HyperText documents.","\u201cHyperText\u201d means a mechanism burying link information to another document in a certain character string in a document freely prepared by the user and enabling other information to be referred to by selecting that character string.","In WWW, by utilizing this HyperText mechanism, the information can be freely comprised by freely extending the link from a local resource of the server to a resource on the network.","Extensions are continuously being added to the specifications of HTML at present. Image, audio, and other data are also now being handled.","CGI, ISAPI","CGI (Common Gateway Interface) means the specification (interface) for extending a function by an API (Application Programming Interface) connecting a Web server and another program operating on the server.","An application using CGI is prepared by a C language, Perl language (type of script language), etc. and operates to return some sort of answer with respect to a value transferred from the browser in cooperation with an application operating on the server.","On the other hand, ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) operates to return some sort of answer with respect to information transferred from the browser in the same way as a DLL (Dynamic Link Library). ISAPI takes the form of a DLL operating in a process space of a server.","Both CGI and ISAPI are applications appearing to operate on a server. By using CGI and ISAPI, a Web server having only the function of displaying HTML pages prepared in advance can be given more diverse functions.","Communication Between Web Browser and Web Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , when the browser sends a request to the Web server, the Web server reads the requested file and sends back a response to the browser of the client PC. In this case, it is also possible for the browser to inquire about an IP address of a target Web server corresponding to the URL designated with respect to the DNS server via the Internet and send the request to the Web server by using the found IP address.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"When information from the client PC is necessary, it is also possible to explicitly send the information to the server from an area described by a tag referred to as a \u201cform\u201d programmed by HTML. The Web server starts up the application of ISAPI or CGI and performs the processing by the server application according to the data transferred from the client browser (client PC).","The Web server sends back the processed result again to the client browser as a response.","Recent Use of Method of Using Browser","Recently, a Web server does not only extract information existing in the server. It is also possible to send information of a client PC to the Web server, process that information by ISAPI or CGI, and return it to the client PC. Due to this, the relationship between browsers and Web servers, which has been utilized as an information network called the Internet hitherto, is now being applied to other areas too.","As an example of this, there may be mentioned a remote control system and method for remote control of an apparatus such as a household electrical appliance.","A Web server function explained by illustration in  and  is incorporated in an apparatus to be remote controlled and connected to a network, for example, the Internet.","As opposed to this, the browser on the client side corresponding to a remote controller such as a TV receiver remote controller and air conditioner remote controller sends a command corresponding to a command of the remote controller to the apparatus (Web server) via the network.","Then, according to the content of the arrived command, the Web server can perform an operation just like if it were operated by a remote controller in place of a command which can be understood for the inside of the apparatus by a server application (ISAPI, CGI).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","1","1"]},"Recent projectors have personal computers built in the projectors per se and have liquid crystal display devices, polarizing means, etc. built in. They can directly receive video information from the personal computers, process that information, project images in colors. Therefore, it is easy to install servers in personal computers mounted in such projectors.","When controlling the projector proper by the remote controller RC in such a remote controlled system, the remote controller RC is operated within a range where infrared rays of the remote controller RC can reach and facing the projector proper. Then, the projector having the function of a server performs processing for control according to the instructions of the remote controller. The projector performs processing in accordance with the results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["12","11","15"]},"The client PC  carries the browser function, while the projector  carries the Web server function.","The projector  also has built into it, other than the personal computer having the function of a Web server, a liquid crystal display, polarizing means, etc. It is configured to be able to project images in color by using the personal computer of the server or using a built-in second personal computer for video display or image processing apparatus to directly receive and process video information from a personal computer outside of the projector .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":"12"},"Step , : A screen of a remote controller RC showing a list of commands is first formed on the Web in advance. The URL of that screen is designated from the browser (client PC)  by using a network line .","Step : The server carried in the projector  returns the screen information showing the list of commands to the browser (client PC) . Thereafter, by selecting a command corresponding to the desired remote control operation from the list at the browser , the command information is transferred to the server.","Step : The server in the projector  controls the apparatus in place of commands inside the apparatus by the server application (CGI, ADAPI) based on that information.","Step : The server in the projector  sends back a response of the end of operation to the browser (client PC)  which sent the request.","Step : The client browser  receives that response and replies in accordance with that content. The method of reply is to make another request, terminate the operation, etc.","Step : So long as there is a request from the client browser , the above processing is repeated.","However, the following problem is encountered when a client browser is used as a controller in the configuration and method explained above. Namely, when controlling an apparatus by using the browser of the client, the server installed in the apparatus to be controlled, and the application thereof, the problem arises that the screen is instantaneously switched for redrawing when the same operation is repeated or the like and the screen becomes hard to view. Details will be explained below.","In general, when employing a usage method like a remote control operation, a usage method continuing the same command is frequently used.","If it is desired to realize this by the method of issuing a request to the server installed in the apparatus under the control of the browser, in the HTTP protocol, one response is always returned for one command (request). The browser to which the response is returned re-draws the browser screen in accordance with the content of the response. This being so, when the same command is continuously sent, the screen will be continuously re-drawn. At this time, a phenomenon of the screen switching many times in a short time arises, so a situation like a blinking (flashing) screen is exhibited. Such a phenomenon becomes a visually obstacle and results in poor response of the control operation and poor operability overall.","In the above example, the explanation was given taking as an example a projector as the apparatus, but a problem similar to the above is encountered in the case of remote control of various other types of apparatuses as well. That is, the apparatus to be controlled is not limited to a projector. All apparatuses connected to for example a network can be covered as the network. That is, a similar problem to the above is also encountered in the case where a home server or the like is installed in the apparatus.","An object of the present invention is to provide a method and system for control of an apparatus which is free from visual obstruction due to a response being returned from the server even when performing the above operation, free from a reduction in the response of the control operability, and enabling the operation to be accurately executed.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for control of an

application, it was learned that the problem to be solved by the invention of the present application may be roughly classified to two situations.","The first classification is the case where the redrawn screen at the time of re-drawing is completely the same as the image before the re-drawing, while the second classification is the case where the re-drawn screen is different from the previous one conversely to the first classification. According to these classifications, the situation and the processing thereof (correspondence processing) are different, so the description will be given separating them.","In the first classification, that is, the case where the image in the case of re-drawing is no different from that before the re-drawing, usually the re-drawing can be prevented by setting an HTTP status code of the response to  \u201cNo Content\u201d at the server side.","The \u201cstatus code\u201d means the status described in the first row of a response message which the Web server sends back and describes how the server processed the request message therein.","When \u201cOK\u201d of the status code  indicating the case of success by the normal processing is returned and the browser receives this, the screen is re-drawn.","In order to employ this technique, it is necessary to change the settings at the server side and the CGI or ISAPI program and sets the status code of the response message to  for only screens not to be re-drawn. Accordingly, the inventors of the present application devised a method for dealing with such cases just by changing the HTML programming without changing the settings.","The second classification, that is, the case where the image to be displayed is different before and after the re-drawing, cannot be handled by just changing the settings of the HTTP status code etc. In this case as well, the inventors of the present application devised a method for reducing the visual obstacle by just changing the method of HTML programming according to the present invention.","Below, a method for the case where the screen does not change before and after the re-drawing due to a request message from the browser will be explained in detail at first, then a method of a case where the screen changes will be explained in detail.","As a first embodiment of the present invention, the configuration illustrated in  and the browser screen illustrated in  will be given as examples. The case of no change in the screen will be explained.","As the first embodiment of the present invention, the case of remote control of the operation of a projector from a browser in the case of using the network system explained by referring to , that is, using a client personal computer (PC) as a browser and a projector having a built-in personal computer as an apparatus, where the browser and the projector are connected by a network line.","Namely, the system for control of an apparatus and the method for control of an apparatus of a first embodiment of the present invention use for example the projector  explained illustrated in  as the apparatus. As explained above,  is a view of the configuration wherein the projector  and the client PC (browser)  are connected via a network .","The client PC  carries the browser function, while the projector  carries the Web server function.","The projector  has built into it, other than the personal computer having the Web server function, a liquid crystal display (liquid crystal panel), polarizing means, etc. Further, the projector  uses its personal computer for the server or uses a built-in second personal computer for video display or video processing apparatus to directly receive and process the video information from a personal computer outside of the projector  and thereby enable an image to be projected by color.

Here, the response message returning from the server corresponds to the link destination information.","By the above setting, the response returning from the ISAPI application through the Web server (, step ) re-draws only the target frame. At this time, the target frame \u201cDUMMY\u201d is the setting in the HTML preparation routine 2 and prepared so that there is no space, so it appears that no re-drawing is carried out.","In the conventional method, when there is no change in the screen due to the response, when transmitting a request to a server installed in the apparatus to be controlled (projector of ) using the browser at the client side (, browser of client PC), there was the problem that the re-drawing of the screen due to the response covered the entire browser screen and made the screen appear to flash and thereby create a visual obstacle, but the first embodiment of the present invention solves this problem. That is, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, when there is no need to update the screen of the browser at all, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of the problem of flashing etc. without changing the settings of the server and just changing the method of programming of the HTML.","The portion generally expressed by one HTML file is realized by preparing a plurality of files using the frame structure in the present invention.","As a second embodiment of the present invention, the case where there is a change in the screen will be explained taking as an example the browser screen illustrated in .","As the second embodiment of the present invention, similar to the first embodiment, the case of remote control of the operation of a projector from a browser in the case of the network system explained by referring to  and , that is, using a client PC as a browser, using a projector having a built-in personal computer as the apparatus, and connecting the browser and projector by a network line, will be exemplified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 4","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"First, in the state before the browser (, client PC) issues a request for a command, the browser screen shows the value of brightness of the setting information of the apparatus (, projector) as 99.","Next, by the operation of clicking the icon of the browser (, step ), a command for raising the brightness value is requested to the server in the projector (, step ).","A status value 100 of brightness is returned by the response after the server in the projector performs that command processing. Below, the explanation will be made taking the example where 100 is displayed as the value of brightness on the browser screen after the re-drawing.","Processing 1: First, the user selects the region changing before and after the response for the desired browser screen. In this case, the portion of \u201cBrightness: 100\u201d, at the center of the screen illustrated in  is selected considering also a case where also the displayed word \u201cBrightness\u201d changes.","Processing 2: The HTML file is described by dividing one browser screen to five parts so as to cut out the portion divided by operation  and surround the same by a peripheral portion. That is, as shown in , originally one Web page is divided into five Web pages so as to surround the changing portion. At this time, the page of the uppermost portion of each is defined as \u201ctop.htm\u201d, the lowermost portion is defined as \u201cbottom.htm\u201d, the right portion is defined as \u201cright.htm\u201d, the left portion is defined as \u201cleft.htm\u201d, and the portion where the change occurs is defined as \u201ccenter.htm\u201d.","Processing 3: The page forming the higher page among the five Web pages divided in processing 2 is prepared. As illustrated in , the five pages are combined to form the frame structure to give the original single page. That is, if defining the page indicating the higher frame as \u201cparent.htm\u201d, the \u201cparent.htm\u201d is programmed for division of the frame into five pages. The five pages are linked so as to correspond to the divided frames and make the five pages appear to be a single page. At this time, the frame corresponding to the portion where there is a change on the screen is named as \u201cCENTER\u201d. Note that it is desirable to set the system so that the border lines of the five frames are not displayed.","Processing 4: Here, only for the page of \u201ccenter.htm\u201d of the changing portion on the screen, the color of the background (background color) is designated as the same color as the color of the front side of the page. That is, in this case, the color of the front side is white, so the color of the background is also designated to white. (In the other pages, i.e., the four pages at the top, bottom, left, and right thereof, the color of the background becomes gray and the color of the front side becomes white in this example).","Processing 5: Finally, when the portion for generating the request, that is, the icon portion existing in \u201ctop.htm\u201d in this example, is clicked (, step ), the request of the command is generated (, step ) and the target frame is set as \u201cCENTER\u201d by the portion calling up the ISAPI application (, steps , ).","Processing 6: The server in the projector returns the response to the browser (client PC (, step ).","Processing 7: The browser receives the response and draws the result thereof (, step ). From the above processing, the only re-drawing due to the response from the server in the browser becomes the \u201cCENTER\u201d portion having motion.","Processing 8: The above processing is repeated according to need (, step ).","When a change of the screen is necessary due to a response, applying the second embodiment of the present invention can similarly reduce the visual obstacle of the flashing. In this case, the visual obstacle can also be reduced by the amount of the smaller re-drawing region in comparison with the case where the whole screen is redrawn. Also, originally the flashing is a problem where the time difference of the drawing order of the background color and the surface color is sensed and appears like flashing, but in the present embodiment, the colors of the background color and the surface color are standardized for the portion to be re-drawn as well. This is very effective so long as the displayed object (color and size of the text etc.) does not change much.","In the second embodiment, when the content of the display of the browser screen changes due to a response, one location was changed in the example, but if increasing the number of divisions, it is possible to handle cases of changes in a plurality of locations. In this case, it is possible to similarly handle such a case by arranging non-changing frames so as to surround the changing frame.","Other Modifications","In the above embodiment of the present invention, the explanation was given of the case of using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) as an example of the communication protocol and using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) as an example of the programming language, but the transmission protocol and text language are not limited to the above illustration.","In the first embodiment and second embodiment of the present invention, the example where the server function was provided inside the apparatus (projector of ) was explained, but in such a case, it is possible to control a plurality of apparatuses, for example, a plurality of projectors of  by one server. In such a case, a plurality of apparatuses can be controlled by one server and, in addition, an improvement of the response with respect to these requests can be achieved.","In the above embodiments of the present invention, the projector illustrated in  was exemplified as the apparatus to be controlled, but the apparatus to be controlled in the present invention is not limited to a projector. For example, as the apparatus to be controlled, air-conditioners, television receivers, and various other apparatuses including built-in computers can be mentioned.","Further, in the present embodiments, HTML was used as the language for programming the Web page, but the language is not limited to the HTML and can be any programming language of a Web page such as XML (Extensible Markup Language) expanding the functions of HTML by making the structure of the document a document type definition file called a DTD (Document Type Definition). Further, the communication protocol is not limited to HTTP. The present invention can be widely applied to any communication protocol used on the Internet.","In the present invention, the apparatus to be controlled can cover all apparatuses connected to a network. That is, if there is a home server or the like, the present invention can be applied to the case where all household electrical appliances to be controlled by the home server are controlled.","Note that, in the broadband network era, even under an Internet environment where an instantaneous reaction of a response is not that much of a concern at present, if the time for obtaining the information after the request becomes instantaneous, there is a possibility that these visual obstacles will become a problem. The present invention can be applied to such a case as well.","According to the present invention, the problem that, when there is no change in the screen due to a response and when transmitting a request to a server installed in an apparatus to be controlled by using a browser at the client side, if the screen is comprised by the prior art, the re-drawing of the screen by the response covers the entire browser screen and the screen appears to flash creating a visual obstacle is overcome. When it is not necessary to update the screen, the problem of flashing can be eliminated without changing the setting of the server and just changing the method of programming of the HTML.","Further, according to the present invention, when there is a change in the screen due to a response, the visual obstacle of flashing can be reduced. Particularly, according to the present invention, the visual obstacle can be reduced by the amount of the smaller re-drawing region in comparison with when the screen as a whole in the browser is re-drawn.","Preferably, the colors of the background color and the surface color for the portion to be re-drawn as well are standardized. This is very effective so far as the displayed object (color and size of text etc.) does not change much.","Further, according to the present invention, if the obstacle due to flashing is reduced, the response becomes faster at the portion where re-drawing is not necessary and the operability in control of the apparatus is improved. Further, by eliminating or reducing the update range, since the non-cached portion or information changes each time, the amount of the received information in the case of a setting not enabling caching can be reduced and in turn the response can be improved and the operability improved.","The present invention enables remote control of various types of apparatuses having server functions through a network (communication network)."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above features and object of the present invention and other features and objects will become clearer from the following explanation given with reference to the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 15"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
