{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Network planning and design may be an iterative process including topological design, network-synthesis, and network realization. Network planning and design may be necessary to ensure that the network infrastructure may be able to support additional subscribers and services. During the network planning and design process, a network planner may estimate services and traffic loads (e.g., a number of subscribers) that a network infrastructure may support. Often, a network planner may forecast a growth in services and traffic loads of the network. The growth information associated with the services and traffic loads may be used to determine a size (e.g., amount of network resources) of the network. The determination of the size of the network may involve various factors and thus making the determination difficult and inaccurate.","An exemplary embodiment provides a system and process for analyzing domino impact of network growth. In an exemplary embodiment, the system and process may allow user (e.g., a network administrator or a network planner) to calculate the domino impact analysis of the growth of a communication network. Also, the system and process may allow user to determine a number of network resources needed to support various services and traffic loads of the communication network. Further, the system and process may allow user to determine a number of network resources needed in order to satisfy the demand of an increase in various services and traffic loads of the communication network.","A communication network may include a plurality of network elements (NEs) coupled together by a plurality of links (e.g., physical links or logical links). The system and process may determine a quantity of network elements and a capacity of links coupled to the network elements that may be required in order to support an increase in services and traffic loads of a network. For example, a network may be partitioned into one or more domains or regions based on size, complexity, services provided, or traffic load of a network. Each domain of the network may be further partitioned into various networks, such as, an edge or access network (\u201cNnetwork\u201d), an aggregation network (\u201cNnetwork\u201d), a core network (\u201cNnetwork\u201d), and an application network (\u201cNnetwork\u201d). In an exemplary embodiment, an edge or access network may be a network within a domain associated with one or more customers. For example, the edge or access network may receive traffic from one or more customers and transmit traffic to the customers in the domain. The aggregation network may collect one or more incoming lower bandwidth traffic (e.g., from the edge or access network) into higher bandwidth traffic. Also, the aggregation network may perform various traffic engineering functions, such as, quality of service (\u201cQoS\u201d), service level agreement (\u201cSLA\u201d), or other traffic engineering functions. The core network may be a backbone network which may perform high speed switching across various domains of the network. The application network may include various network elements and protocols for providing various services (e.g., semantic conversion between associated application processes). For example, the application network may provide services including virtual file, virtual terminal, job transfer, and manipulation of protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","106","104","106","108","1","2","3","4","108","110","110","106","112","114","116","118","120","106","122","124","106","122","126","106","128","102","104","106","104","108","106","106","104","106"],"sub":["1","2","3","4"]},"The required quantity of network resources in the communication network  may be calculated via a plurality of methods. For example, the number of network resources in the communication network  may be calculated based on a number of provisioned connections (e.g., a number of network resources located at the edge or access network coupled to the customer premises equipments (\u201cCPE\u201d)). Also, the number of network resources in the communication network  may be calculated by monitoring traffic flow in one or more provisioned connections. By monitoring the traffic flow in one or more provisioned connections of the network resources, a network operator may determine whether the monitored provisioned connections are being used, and if the monitored provisioned connections are being used how much capacity (e.g., bandwidth) may be unused. In an exemplary embodiment, the number of network resources in the communication network  may be calculated based on a number of provisioned connections method or monitoring traffic flow method.","The one or more user devices  may be a computer, a personal computer, a laptop, a cellular communication device, a workstation, a mobile device, a phone, a handheld PC, a personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), a thin system, a fat system, a network appliance, an Internet browser, or other any other device that may allow a user to communicate with the analysis system  via one or more networks (not shown) as known in the art.

The repository module  may store and manage the network information transferred from the collector module . An analytical module  may access the repository module  to obtain the network information needed to perform one or more processes and analyze the domino impact of the growth of the communication network .

For example, the lower level network and the higher level networks may be dependent on a location in the transmission path to and from the customer premises. In an exemplary embodiment, a network located closer to the edge or access network on a transmission path may be a lower level network when compared to a network (e.g., higher level network) located further from the edge or access network on the transmission path. Also, a network may be a lower level network and a higher level network. For example, an aggregation network may be coupled to an edge or access network and a core network. The aggregation network may be a lower lever network compared to the core network and a higher level network compared to the edge or access network. In an exemplary embodiment, the edge or access network may be a lower level network compared to the aggregation network, the core network, and the application network. Also, the application network may be a higher level network compared to the core network, aggregation network, and edge or access network.","In an exemplary embodiment, the one or more attributes of a network resource may include one or more lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) and one or more higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d). For example, the lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) and the higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may be located in a single type of network (e.g., edge or access network), the lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may be located closer to customer premises (e.g., directly coupled to the customer-premises equipments) or another domain  and the higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may be located further from the customer premises (e.g., coupled to the customer-premises equipments via the lower network resources). In an exemplary embodiment, the lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may be coupled to another domain  and\/or customer-premises equipments. The higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d) in the edge or access network may be coupled to one or more lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) of one or more higher level networks (\u201cHLN\u201d) (e.g., aggregation network, core network, and\/or application network). Also, the lower network resource (\u201cR\u201d) of the aggregation network may be coupled to the higher network resource (\u201cR\u201d) of the edge or access network. The higher network resource (\u201cR\u201d) of the aggregation network may be coupled to one or more lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) of one or more higher level network (\u201cHLN\u201d) (e.g., core network, and\/or application network). For example, the lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may support lower bandwidth services and the higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may support higher bandwidth services. The higher network resource (\u201cR\u201d) may support higher bandwidth services in order to provide multiplexing of services and aggregation of traffic loads from lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d). In an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d) (e.g., OC-3 ports) may be coupled to a single higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d) (e.g., OC-48 port). In other exemplary embodiments, the bandwidth of the higher network resources (\u201cR\u201d) may be less than the bandwidth of the lower network resources (\u201cR\u201d).","The network resources in an area of the domain  may provide one or more services (e.g., video services, voice services, and data services). Also, the one or more attributes of the network resources may include a service type that the network resources may support. A plurality of network resources may form a logical group to provide one or more services (e.g., video services, voice services, and data services). For example, one or more network resources may be data ports (e.g., 32 number of gigabit Ethernet (\u201cGig-E\u201d) ports). Also, one or more network resources may be voice-over-Internet protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) ports (e.g., 48 VoIP ports). Also, the one or more network resources may be data ports that may support voice-over-Internet service. In other embodiments, the one or more network resources that provide a service may have various bandwidth capacities. For example, the one or more network resources may provide a data service having transmission speed of 155.52 Mbits\/s (OC-3 with payload: 148.608 Mbits\/s; overhead: 6.912 Mbits\/s, including path overhead). Also, the one or more network resources may provide a data service having transmission speed of 622.08 Mbits\/s (OC-12 with payload: 601.344 Mbits\/s; overhead: 20.736 Mbits\/s).","The network resources may symmetrically transmission of traffic loads, wherein the upstream transmission (e.g., transmission from customer premises) and downstream transmission (e.g., transmission to customer premises) may have the same bandwidth. For example, a network resource may assign an OC-3 standard bandwidth to the upstream transmission and downstream transmission. In other embodiments, the network resources may have disparate bandwidth for upstream transmission and downstream transmission. For example, a network resource may assign an OC-3 standard bandwidth for upstream transmission while assign an OC-12 standard bandwidth for downstream transmission. In such event, the analytical system  may select a transmission direction that may be more utilized in order to determine the quantity of network resources necessary to support an increase in services or traffic loads of communication network . For example, a ratio of traffic (or provisioned connections) over the bandwidth for the upstream transmission may be compared to a ratio of traffic (or provisioned connections) over the bandwidth for the downstream transmission and the analytical system  may select a transmission direction having a higher value for the determination of a quantity of network resources required to support an increase in services and traffic loads of the communication network .","For example, one or more network resources may be configured to provide a number of services for a plurality of customers. Also, the one or more network resources may have a predetermined bandwidth configured to provide a variety of services to customers based on a first come first served basis. In other embodiments, the bandwidth of the network resources may be apportioned among different services provided by the network resources. In an exemplary embodiment, apportioning of bandwidth of the network resources may be achieved by one or more predetermined rules (e.g., permanent virtual circuit (\u201cPVC\u201d)\/virtual local area network (\u201cVLAN\u201d) rules or connection admission control (\u201cCAC\u201d) rules).","The one or more attributes of the network resources may further include a bandwidth capacity associated with the network resources. In addition, the one or more attributes of the network resources may include threshold limits (T, T, or T). For example, the network resources may have one or more threshold limits. The one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on one or more variables. For example, the one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on bandwidth capacity (e.g., setting threshold limit to be 80% bandwidth capacity of the network resources). Also, the one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on a number of permanent virtual circuits or virtual local area networks provided by the network resources. The one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on a number of customers, sessions, or applications assigned to the network resources. The one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on different customer profiles (e.g., Quality of Service, assigned customer bandwidth). In other embodiments, the one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on a plurality of variables. For example, the one or more threshold limits of the network resources may be based on customer profiles (e.g., assigned customer bandwidth) and a number of permanent virtual circuits. In the event that one of the network resources reaches a threshold limit, the network resources may reach maximum capacity of services and traffic loads and additional network resources may be necessary to accommodate additional services or traffic load.","In order to analyze a domino impact of a growth of the communication network , the analysis may start at incoming services or traffic loads coupled to the edge or access network. The domino impact analysis of a growth of the communication network  may progress from the edge or access network to the application network. Also, the domino impact analysis of a growth of the communication network  may progress from edge or access network to a point between the edge or access network and the application network (e.g., at the aggregation network). For example, the domino impact analysis of a growth of the communication network  may progress from the edge or access network to a congregation point (e.g., located in the core network) of one or more of links  coupled to the edge or access network. In an exemplary embodiment, each of the one or more links  may have a plurality of incoming traffic loads from the edge or access network. In an exemplary embodiment, a start location and an end location within in a virtual private network or other special circuit of the domain  may be treated as a plurality of incoming services and traffic loads to their meeting point in one or more network resources. In other exemplary embodiments, the communication network  may have one or more black-box areas, where there is no visibility (e.g., detection or measurement) of network resources within the black-box areas. In order to analyze the domino impact of a growth of communication network  for the one or more black-box areas, the analysis may track each individual traffic stream at one or more entry and exit points. For example, the one or more black-box areas may be an intervening SONET or DWDM optical network connecting IP Routers\/ATM Switches at the edge or access network.","In an exemplary embodiment, the communication network  may have more lower network resources (R) than higher network resources (R). For example, the higher network resources may be of a higher bandwidth granularity than the lower network resources. The higher network resources (R) may aggregate services and traffic loads from a plurality of lower network resources. A quantity of higher network resources (R) in the communication network  may be based at least in part on an over-subscription factor. For example, in an instant time within the communication network , only a percentage of the total customers may utilize one or more services or the customers may utilize a portion of allotted capacity (e.g., bandwidth). Therefore, the communication network  may over-subscribe a number of customers in order to fully utilize the network resources within the communication network .","In an exemplary embodiment, the network resources may be coupled via intra-network coupling and\/or inter-network coupling. For example, intra-network coupling may be coupling of a plurality of network resource located within a single network (e.g., edge or access network (N), aggregation network (N), core network (N), or application network (N)). For example, the lower network resources (R) of a network may be coupled to one or more higher network resources (R) of the network. Also, inter-network coupling may be coupling of one or more network resource located in disparate networks. For example, the higher network resources (R) of a lower level network (LLN) may be coupled to the lower network resources (R) of a higher level network (HLN). In an exemplary embodiment, the lower network resource (R) of an aggregation network (N) may be coupled to the higher network resource (R) of an edge or access network (N) and the higher network resource (R) of the aggregation network (N) may be coupled to one or more lower network resources (R) of a core network (N). Also, one or more lower network resources (R) located in a network may be coupled to a plurality of higher network resources (R) of another network and vice-versa, in order to balance services and traffic loads, geographical routing, and\/or network survivability. For example, a lower network resource (R) located in the aggregation network (N) may be coupled to a plurality of higher network resources (R) located in the edge or access network (N). Also, a higher network resource (R) located in the edge or access network (N) may be coupled to a plurality of lower network resources (R) located in the aggregation network (N).","For intra-network coupling, the higher network resources (R) may provide multiplexing or demultiplexing of the different services from the lower network resources (R). Also, the lower network resources (R) may provide a plurality of services (e.g., video services and data services). For example, a higher network resource (R) may multiplex services from a plurality of lower network resources (R) (e.g., first lower network resource (R) providing video services and a second lower network resource (R) providing data services). Also, a higher network resource (R) may demultiplex a plurality of services (e.g., video services, voice services, data services).","In an exemplary embodiment, the network resources may be a passive network element. The passive network element may not monitor the services and traffic loads transmitted through the passive network element and may not have one or more threshold limits. The passive network element may have a predetermined multiplexing factor (e.g., upstream transmission) or de-multiplexing factor (e.g., downstream transmission). For example, the passive network element may be a dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (\u201cDWDM\u201d) combiner or splitter. The dense wavelength-division-multiplexing combiner or splitter may optically combine traffic loads from a plurality of network resources or optically split traffic load to the plurality of network resources.","The lower network resources located in a higher level network (e.g., aggregation network as shown in ) may be coupled to the higher network resources located in a lower level network (e.g., edge or access network as shown in ) via one or more links  (e.g., physical links). In the event that network resources are located in disparate networks, the lower network resources located in a higher level network may support all the services supported by the higher network resources located in a lower level network. In the event that a higher network resources located in a lower level network is coupled to a plurality of lower network resources located in a higher level network, the incoming traffic loads from the higher network resources may be divided and transmitted to the plurality of lower network resources located in a higher level network. The traffic loads from the higher network resources located at the lower network level may be divided based on one or more predetermined rules (e.g., type of services, load balancing, and network survivability etc). Also, a plurality of higher network resources located in disparate lower level networks may be coupled to a single lower network resource located in a higher level network. The lower network resources located in the higher level network may aggregate various services and incoming traffic loads from the plurality of higher network resources located in different lower level networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","600","600"]},"The passive optical network  may include one or more domains having a plurality of areas. For example, area  may be a first optical network terminal (\u201cONT\u201d), area  may be a first optical line terminal (\u201cOLT\u201d), area  may be a second optical network terminal (\u201cONT\u201d), and area  may be a second optical line terminal (\u201cOLT\u201d). In an exemplary embodiment, the first optical network terminal may be extended to or located near one or more customer premises. The first optical network terminal may be coupled to the first optical line terminal (e.g., Area ) and the second optical line terminal (e.g., Area ). The first optical network terminal may have three lower network resources. For example, the three lower network resources may include a voice network resource, a data network resource, and a video network resource. The three lower network resources of the first optical network terminal may be connected to a higher network resource of the first optical network terminal. The higher network resource may aggregate the services and traffic loads from the plurality of lower network resources. The second optical network terminals (e.g., Area ) may provide similar services and traffic loads as the first optical network terminals. Also, the second optical network terminal may be coupled to the second optical line terminal and the first optical line terminal.","The aggregated services and traffic loads (e.g., voice service traffic, data service traffic, and video service traffic) at the higher network resource of the first optical network terminal (e.g., a lower level network) may be transmitted to the lower network resource of the first optical line terminal (e.g., a higher level network). In an exemplary embodiment, the first optical line terminal may be connected to a plurality of optical network terminal. The domino impact analysis of the growth of the passive optical network  may be described below in detail.","For example, the first optical network terminal may have 1000 voice lower network resources (e.g., voice service ports), 300 data lower network resources (e.g., data service ports), and 200 video lower network resources (e.g., video service ports). The bandwidth of the voice lower network resources may be 1 Mbits\/s, the bandwidth of the data lower network resources may be 10 Mbits\/s, and the bandwidth of the video lower network resources may be 15 Mbits\/s. Also under a traffic monitoring domino impact analysis, the voice lower network resources may have a fill ratio (e.g., a fraction of the bandwidth used by the network resources) of 0.3, the data lower network resources may have a fill ratio of 0.15, and the video lower network resources may have a fill ratio of 0.2. The total bandwidth used by each service network resources may be calculated by multiplying a number of lower network resources associated with the service, a bandwidth of the lower network resources, and a fill ratio (e.g., a fraction of the bandwidth used by the network resources). For example, the total bandwidth used by voice service network resources may be equal to 300 Mbits\/s (e.g., 1000 network resources*1 Mbits\/s*0.3 fill ratio), the total bandwidth used by data service network resources may be equal to 450 Mbits\/s (e.g., 300 network resources*10 Mbits\/s*0.15 fill ratio), and the total bandwidth used by video service network resources may be equal to 600 Mbits\/s (e.g., 200 network resources*15 Mbits\/s*0.2 fill ratio). The total bandwidth required to support the three services (e.g., voice service, data service, and video service) may be 1350 Mbits\/s (e.g., 300 Mbits\/s bandwidth for voice services+450 Mbits\/s bandwidth for data services+600 Mbits\/s bandwidth for video services). In the event that the three services from the plurality of lower network resources are aggregated\/multiplexed at a single higher network resource, the bandwidth required for the higher network resources may be equal to 1350 Mbits\/s, for example, the total bandwidth of the three services.","The proportion of bandwidth used for each service at the higher network resources may be calculated by dividing the total bandwidth of the higher network resources (e.g., all three services) by the total bandwidth of each service. For example, the proportion of bandwidth used for each service may be 0.22 for voice service (e.g., 300 Mbits\/s\/1350 Mbits\/s), 0.33 for data service (e.g., 450 Mbits\/s\/1350 Mbits\/s), and 0.45 for video service (e.g., 600 Mbits\/s\/1350 Mbits\/s). In the event that the bandwidth for the higher network resources may be 20 Mbits\/s, a number of higher network resources may be calculated by dividing the total bandwidth needed for three services by the bandwidth of the higher network resources. In this exemplary embodiment, the number of higher network resources (R) may be 68 (e.g., by dividing 1350\/20=67.5).","The domino impact analysis may be determined at the optical line terminal (e.g., higher level network). For example, the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal (e.g., higher level network) may have a bandwidth similar to the higher network resources located at the first optical network terminal (e.g., lower level network), for example 20 Mbits\/s or higher. Also, assuming only 60% of the services and traffic loads from the first optical network terminal may be transmitted to the first optical line terminal. The number of lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be calculated by multiplying a number of higher network resources located at the first optical network terminal (e.g., since the higher network resources located at the first optical terminal may have the same bandwidth as the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal) by the percentage of the services and traffic loads received from the first optical network terminal (e.g., 60% transmission rate). In an exemplary embodiment, the number of lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be calculated as 68*0.60=40.8 or 41 lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal.","For example, the total number of lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be determined as 41, total bandwidth required for the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be calculated. Continuing this example, the total bandwidth of the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be calculated by multiplying the bandwidth of each of the lower network resources by the total number of lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal (e.g., 20 Mbits\/s*41=820 Mbits\/s).","In an exemplary embodiment, the higher level resources located at the first optical line terminal may have a higher bandwidth than the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal. Also, the optical line terminal (OLT) may demultiplex a plurality of services (e.g., voice services, video services, or data services) via one or more lower network resources (R) and transmit the plurality of services to one or more higher network resources (R). The higher level resources located at the first optical line terminal may assign different bandwidth for each of the three services. For example, the higher level resources located at the first optical line terminal may assign 5 Mbits\/s for voice services, 20 Mbits\/s for data services, and 50 Mbits\/s for video services. The bandwidth of the lower network resources may be allocated among disparate services (e.g., voice services, data services, and video services) provided by the first optical line terminal. For example, the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may assign 0.22 of the bandwidth to voice services, 0.33 of the bandwidth to data services, and 0.45 of the bandwidth to video services. The allocation of the bandwidth for each of the lower network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be stored in a database. The number of higher network resources needed for each service may be calculated by the total bandwidth for the lower network resources multiplied by a proportion of the bandwidth assigned to each service and divided by the bandwidth of one or more higher network resources (R) of the service. For example, the number of higher network resources may be calculated by 820 Mbits\/s*0.22\/5=37 higher network resources for voice services, 820*0.33\/20=14 higher network resources for data services, and 820*0.45\/50=8 higher network resources for video services. The higher network resources located at the first optical line terminal may be coupled to lower network resources located at a higher level network and the domino impact analysis for the higher level network may be determined by a similar process described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-6","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","700","700","700","700","702"]},"At block , the method  for analyzing the domino impact of the communication network growth may begin.","At block , a number of lower network resources at an edge or access network for a domain  of the communication network  may be determined.
