title: Closed brayton cycle direct contact reactor/storage tank with chemical scrubber
abstract: A closed cycle Brayton direct contact reactor/storage tank uses a chemical scrubber to assist in removing metal vapors from the working fluid. The direct contact reactor/storage tank operates by bubbling an inert gas through liquid metal fuel. The inert gas picks up metal vapors from the fuel. The chemical scrubber is comprised of a reducible material contained within a filter at the top of the reactor/storage tank. The reducible material on reacting with the metal vapor forms components that are solids at the operating temperature and pressure, thereby preventing metal vapor from circulating throughout the system as part of the working fluid and causing damage to system components.

No. 07\/926,116, filed 7 Aug. 1992, Closed Brayton Cycle Direct Contact Reactor\/Storage Tank with OAfterburner, Ser. No. 07\/926,200, filed 7 Aug. 1992, Semiclosed Brayton Cycle Power System with Direct Heat Transfer, Ser.

No. 07\/926,115, filed Aug. 7, 1992.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to metal vapor control of the liquid metal fuel in a direct contact Brayton cycle power system. More particularly the invention relates to a system for eliminating metal vapor at the working gas outlet of a closed Brayton cycle direct contact reactor\/storage tank by use of a filter material that functions as a chemical scrubber.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","My invention titled Closed Cycle Brayton Propulsion System with Direct Heat Transfer with which this application is copending discloses the use of the more efficient Brayton cycle instead the Rankine cycle in a closed cycle underwater propulsion system. The size and weight penalty of the Brayton cycle's hot side heat exchanger is eliminated by use of direct contact heat transfer between the working fluid which is an inert gas such as helium, argon, xenon, or a mixture of inert gases, and a liquid metal bath of a material such as lithium, sodium, potassium, aluminum, magnesium, or an alloy thereof.","The closed cycle Brayton power system with direct heat transfer invention as disclosed in the copending application has the problem that some of the liquid metal fuel vapor will be carried from the reactor\/fuel exchanger into the working fluid stream. The volume fraction of metal vapor is relatively low; however, during a long run of the power cycle the metal accumulation can damage the regenerator, cooler, turbine, or compressor. The volume fraction of the vapor present is equal to the ratio of the partial pressure of the liquid metal to the system operating pressure, i.e. for aluminum @ 2343\u00b0 F., 1 mm Hg\/\u2212800 psi=1.6\u00d710, for lithium @ 2323\u00b0 F., 400 mm Hg\/\u2212800 psi=6.5\u00d710.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide an improved reactor\/storage tank for use in a direct contact closed Brayton cycle power system. It is a further object to provide metal vapor control within the reactor\/storage tank to remove contaminants from the working fluid stream. Another object is to provide longer life in the power system components that come in contact with the working fluid.","These and other objects are accomplished with the present invention by providing a system in which a chemical scrubber is used. The chemical scrubber comprises a reducible material such as FeOas part of a filter media. Metal vapors which come into contact with the filter media oxidize. The metal fuel oxide, iron oxides, and iron particulate formed are all solids at closed Brayton direct contact operating temperatures and pressures, and, thus, can be easily filtered out of the working gas stream.","Referring now to  there is shown a reactor\/storage tank  for transferring heat from a liquid metal fuel  to a working gas in a closed Brayton cycle power system. Although the terminology reactor\/storage tank and direct contact reactor\/storage tank are used to describe component , names such as heater\/reactor and direct contact heater could be used.","In the preferred embodiment, a direct contact reactor\/storage tank is partially filled with a liquid metal fuel . Reactor\/storage tank  has a working gas inlet  disposed in reactor\/storage tank  below the surface of liquid metal fuel  for the injection of the working gas directly into liquid metal fuel . Working gas inlet  is a tube extending into reactor\/storage tank  with a plurality of apertures therein, disposed along the length thereof. Similarly, a working gas outlet  is disposed in reactor\/storage tank  above surface of liquid metal fuel  for the ejection of the working gas from reactor\/storage tank . The flow of the working gas is designated generally by flow arrows . Also disposed within reactor\/storage tank  is an oxidant injector . An oxidant is introduced through injector  into liquid metal fuel  where it reacts with fuel  to produce heat.","The oxidizing agent or oxidant in the preferred embodiment is oxygen, O. The reaction between oxygen and an aluminum-magnesium alloy liquid metal fuel provides the preferred means of generating heat within reactor\/storage tank . The working gas is normally argon or a mixture of helium and xenon. Helium, argon and xenon are inert gases and therefore do not react with a metal fuel. Other possible choices for metal fuels include alkali metals, such as lithium, sodium or potassium.","Disposed within the reactor\/storage tank  between the liquid metal fuel  and the working gas outlet  is a screen assembly  for preventing the liquid metal fuel  from splattering into working gas outlet . A filter , which further prevents contaminants within the working gas from entering working gas outlet , is disposed between screen assembly  and working gas outlet .","In operation, after the metal fuel is heated to the liquid state, the working gas is injected through working gas inlet  into reactor\/storage tank . The working gas then bubbles through liquid metal fuel . Representative working gas bubbles  are shown leaving aperture and expanding toward surface of liquid metal fuel . Heat is transferred directly from liquid metal fuel  to the working gas. During this process metal vapors are formed.","Filter  functions as a chemical scrubber. It comprises a reducible material such as FeO. Various designs are available for filter .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1","FIG. 1A"],"sub":["2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1"],"b":["24","24","24","24"],"i":["a ","b ","a "],"sub":["2","3 "]},"The metal oxide powder in filter  oxidizes the metal vapors, reducing the FeOpowder to FeO, then to FeO, and finally to Fe. The products of the reducing action, the metal fuel oxide, the other oxides of iron and iron, are all solids at the Brayton cycle operating temperature and are readily trapped by filter .","The combination of screen assembly  and filter  clean the working gas before it passes through outlet .","In alternative embodiments, the liquid fuel can be one of the alkali metals such as lithium, sodium, or potassium, and the oxidant can be a chlorofluorocarbon, such as CFClknown in the art as Freon-13. Chlorofluorocarbon oxidants cannot be used with aluminum-magnesium fuel, however, because the products of the oxidation reaction are gaseous at the operating temperature.","There has therefore been described a reactor\/storage tank  that is used in a closed Brayton cycle power system. The reactor\/storage tank  has a filter  functioning as a chemical scrubber that is placed in the path of the working fluid to eliminate metal vapor from the working fluid. In the absence of such a filter, any metal vapor present in the circulating working fluid plates out and eventually freezes at a point in the cycle where either the partial or total pressure of the gas stream is reduced, or the gas is cooled below the melting point of the vapor. These conditions occur in the turbine, regenerator, and cooler of the direct contact Brayton power cycle. The metal deposits can reduce heat transfer in the regenerator, damage the turbine, or cause a pressure drop in any of the components.","It will be understood that various changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
