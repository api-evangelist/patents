Field of the Invention","This invention relates in general to wireless communications systems, and more specifically, to a BREW\u2122 client application enabling Advanced Voice Services (AVS) including Push-to-Talk (P2T), Push-to-Conference (P2C) and Push-to-Message (P2M) on wireless handsets and networks.","2. Description of Related Art","Group-based voice services, such as two-way half-duplex voice calls within a group or between individuals, also known as \u201cPush-to-Talk,\u201d \u201cPress-to-Talk,\u201d PTT or P2T, have enormous revenue earnings potential for wireless networks, such as cellular phone networks and personal communications systems (PCS) networks, which are mobile phone networks.","Moreover, the Assignee has introduced Advanced Voice Services (AVS) including improved implementations for P2T, as well as novel group-based voice services such as Push-to-Conference (P2C), Upgrade to Conference (upgrade from P2T to P2C), Push-to-Message (P2M) and group SMS (Short Message Service), for wireless handsets and networks. More information on these advanced voice services can be found in the cross-referenced applications identified above.","To support these advanced voice services, improved handsets are required. Previously, the Assignee has introduced an architecture, client specification and application programming interface (API) for supporting AVS, as well as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) for supporting AVS. More information on these concepts can be found in the cross-referenced applications identified above.","However, there is also a need for handsets that support AVS that are based on the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW\u2122) solution offered by Qualcomm, Inc., which is an open architecture that serves as a common platform for wireless applications. More specifically, there is a need in the art for BREW-enabled handsets that support advanced voice services, such as Push-to-Talk (P2T), Push-to-Conference (P2C), Upgrade to Conference (upgrade from P2T to P2C), Push-to-Message (P2M) and other advanced voice services. The present invention aims to satisfy this need.","To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a BREW\u2122 AVS client application that provides AVS, such as Push-to-Talk (P2T), Push-to-Conference (P2C), Upgrade to Conference (upgrade from P2T to P2C), Push-to-Message (P2M) and group SMS (Short Message Service), on wireless handsets and networks. The functionality provided by the BREW\u2122 AVS client application includes menu displays for the handset, as well as user interaction with the menu displays. Specifically, the functionality includes 1:1 Conference Calls, 1:Many Conference Calls, Dynamic Conference Calls, 1:1 Messaging, or 1:Many Messaging.","In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration the specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized as structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Overview","The present invention describes a BREW\u2122 enabled handset for providing advanced voice services (AVS), and more specifically, a BREW\u2122 AVS client application that provides AVS functionality, such as Push-to-Talk (P2T), Push-to-Conference (P2C), Upgrade to Conference (upgrade from P2T to P2C), Push-to-Message (P2M) and group SMS (Short Message Service), on wireless handsets and networks. This AVS functionality includes menu displays for the handset, as well as user interaction with the menu displays. The BREW\u2122 AVS client application also provides presence and availability functions on the handset. In addition, the BREW\u2122 AVS client application provides contact and group management on the handset.","Network Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Within the network , an RTX (Real-Time Exchange) , previously known as a Dispatch Gateway (DG), communicates with a MSC (Mobile Switching Center)  and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)  using SS7\u2014ISUP\/WIN\/CAMEL (Signaling System 7\u2014Integrated Services Digital Network User Part\/Wireless Intelligent Network\/Customized Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic) messages at a signaling plane . A bearer path  implements a TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) interface carrying PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) or TFO (Tandem Free Operation) voice frames. Support for TFO in this path  is negotiated between a BSC (Base Station Controller)  and the RTX  for each originating and terminating leg of an AVS call. The use of TFO ensures high voice quality (as voice vocoder conversion is avoided) between mobile-to-mobile calls.","When a subscriber originates an AVS call, the MSC  routes the call to the RTX . The MSC  also requests the BSC  via  to establish a radio traffic path  with a mobile station (MS)  (also known as a handset or mobile unit) via the BTS (Base Transceiver Station)  (as it does for a normal cellular call). At this time, the BSC  tries to negotiate TFO (if it is supported) on a TDM link with the far end (in this case, the RTX ).","At the same time (after the MSC  terminates the group call request to the RTX ), the RTX  identifies the terminating group users and their MS-ISDN (Mobile Station\u2014Integrated Services Digital Network) numbers. It sends an ISUP call origination request for each terminating MS . It may send requests directly to the MSC , PSTN  or IP network  via a PDSN (Public Data Switched Network) , Router , and\/or Internet\/Intranet , depending on the routing table configuration for terminating MS-ISDN numbers. Once the bearer path  is established, the RTX  begins a negotiation with the far end (in this case, the terminating BSC ) for each terminating leg to a MS .","Once bearer paths  are established for originating and terminating legs for an AVS call, the RTX  switches (or duplicates) voice frames from the originating MS  to all terminating MS's .","The RTX  may use an IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  for two different purposes. The IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  can be used in a toll bypass mode where two RTXs  can exchange voice traffic bypassing the PSTN . However, each RTX  is responsible for terminating traffic to its closest MSC . In this case, the IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  is used as a backbone transport of voice traffic between two RTXs .","The IP network  or the Internet\/Intranet  can also be used for a registration and presence application. Since the MSC  will not direct a registration request from a MS  to the RTX  (because it would require changes in the MSC ), the latter does not have any information of the registered MS . To circumvent this issue, a registration and presence application runs over an IP stack in the MS . After the MS  registers for a data interface (i.e., obtaining an IP address) with the PDSN  (or Serving GSM Service Nodes (SGSN) in the case of GSM networks), the registration and presence application in the MS  registers with the RTX  using its IP address. The RTX  also uses this IP interface to update the presence information of other group members to a MS .","An alternative embodiment would use the SMS (Short Message Service) transport to carry presence messages over a data channel. The RTX  interacts with the MS  using predefined presence application related messages that are transported as SMS messages. The same messages can be transported via the PDSN  interface, if group users have data service.","Real Time Exchange",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"102"},"The architecture includes a Call Processing system , Presence Server , Real-Time Event Processing system , one or more Media Managers , and an SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) Transport , as well as modules for various SS7 protocols, such as MTP-1 (Message Transfer Part Level 1) , MTP-2 (Message Transfer Part Level 2) , MTP-3 (Message Transfer Part Level 3) , ISUP (Integrated Services Digital Network User Part) , SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part) , and TCAP (Transactions Capabilities Application Part)  protocols.","The Call Processing system , Presence Server , Media Managers , SMPP Transport , and other modules communicate across an IP network . The Real-Time Event Processing system  communicates directly with the Call Processing system , Presence Server , and the modules for various SS7 protocols. The modules for various SS7 protocols communicate with other entities via a SS7 Signaling Link . The SMPP Transport  communicates with a SMSC (Short Message Service Center) gateway using the SMPP protocol . The Media Managers  communicate among themselves using the H.110 protocol  (or some other protocol, such TCP\/IP).","The operation of these various components are described in more detail below, as well as in the co-pending and commonly-assigned patent applications cross-referenced above and incorporated by reference herein.","The originating MS  signals the RTX  via the wireless network , e.g., by transmitting one or more configured DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) digits to the RTX . The Media Manager systems  receive the DTMF digits and pass the DTMF digits to the Call Processing system . The Call Processing (CP) system  determines whether the originating MS  has subscribed to the AVS feature before originating the AVS call. Upon confirmation, the Call Processing system  initiates a new AVS call. The Call Processing system  interacts with the Presence Server  and Real-Time Event Processing system  to cause the wireless network  to perform call setup with the terminating MS's  for the AVS call, and thereafter to manage the AVS call.","During the AVS call, the Call Processing system  interacts with the Media Manager systems  to maintain the H.110 channels  and assign any additional H.110 channels  required for the AVS call, which may span across multiple Media Manager systems . During the AVS call, the Media Manager systems  of the RTX  are used to mix audio streams between the originating MS  and the terminating MS , and then deliver these mixed audio streams to the originating MS  and the terminating MS . The H.110 channels  are used for passing mixed and unmixed audio streams voice between the Media Manager systems  as required.","Mobile Station Components",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"120"},"The high-level functional components of the MS  includes an operating system (OS)  stored in memory, encoder\/decoder , processing logic  and user interface , wherein the encoder\/decoder , processing logic  and user interface  interface to the OS  of the MS  in order to perform their functions. In addition, the MS  provides an address book database  and an AVS contacts\/groups database . Under the control of the OS , a BREW\u2122 AVS client application  is executed by the MS  that provides AVS functionality for the MS .","At power-on, the MS  loads the OS  as well as the BREW\u2122 AVS client application  necessary to support the AVS features. This functionality provided includes the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the menu displays on the MS , as well as user interaction with the menu displays.","During operation, the encoder\/decoder  decodes and encodes messages, and populates specific data structures in the MS . The encoder\/decoder  checks the validity of the incoming messages by verifying mandatory parameters for each of the incoming messages. A message will not be processed further if the encoder\/decoder  fails to decode the message.","The processing logic  handles all the AVS related functionalities, such as Group\/Private\/Dynamic Group calls. The processing logic  implementation is device-specific and vendor-specific, and it interacts with the other components, including the encoder\/decoder , user interface , address book database  or AVS contacts\/group database .","The processing logic  provides an auto-answer mechanism for AVS calls. Specifically, when a call is received, the processing logic  automatically answers the call. The processing logic  makes use of call notification for incoming call detection and, based on various parameters received within the call notification, determines whether the call is an AVS call. If the call is an AVS call, then the processing logic  uses \u201cAT\u201d commands to answer the AVS call and turn on the speaker of the MS . (All of this takes place within a certain time period.) On the other hand, if the call is not an AVS call, then normal call processing is performed by the MS .","The processing logic  also provides \u201cfloor control\u201d using DTMF tone control. In P2T calls, which are half-duplex, a determination of who may talk is based on who has the \u201cfloor.\u201d Using the processing logic  provided in the MS , appropriate DTMF tones are sent to the RTX  in accordance with specific key sequences (i.e., pressing and\/or releasing a P2T key) that indicate whether the \u201cfloor\u201d has been requested and\/or released by the user.","In addition, the processing logic  provides SMS destination control based on the type of subscriber. At the time of subscriber data provisioning, if it is determined that the MS  will use AVS based logic, then appropriate logic is invoked in the RTX  to send presence messages over SMS to the MS . Similarly, the MS  is configured at the time of provisioning to receive\/accept such SMS and respond to the RTX  appropriately.","Finally, the processing logic  also enables subscribers to track the presence of fellow members of the group in the network  on their MS , and provides a mechanism and API to carry-out contacts and group management operations on the MS , such as add member, delete member, etc.","Since most of the presence information is stored in the database , the database  is tightly integrated with the processing logic . The database  stores groups, contacts, presence and availability related information. The database  information essentially contains group and member information along with presence information associated with each group and member. Apart from group and member information, the database  also stores subscriber information, such as privileges, presence information, etc. The other components of the MS  may interact with the database  to retrieve\/update the group, members and presence information for various operations. The database  also has pointers to the native address book database  on the MS , to provide seamless \u201calias\u201d naming for contacts used with cellular calls, as well as AVS features.","The user interface  provides a mechanism for the user to view and manage groups, group members, contacts, presence and availability. The user interface  also makes it possible to invoke the AVS features from the group\/contact list screens, as described in more detail below.","Client Application","The BREW\u2122 AVS client application  enables users to communicate instantly (i.e., in real-time) among group members. This service is provided on wireless MS  that have a Push-to-talk (PTT) button and speaker capability. AVS calls include PTT calls, Voice Bridge (Instant Conference) and Voice Notes (Instant Voice Message).","The BREW\u2122 AVS client application  is a downloadable over-the-air (OTA) application, for the BREW-enabled MS . The BREW\u2122 AVS client application  can be downloaded over-the-air (OTA) and requires no handset replacement. The suite of functions provided by the BREW\u2122 AVS client application  includes Voice Bridge (instant group conferencing), Voice Notes (instant voice messaging for individuals and groups), and Instant Availability.","Specifically, using the BREW\u2122 AVS client application , the MS  can perform following operations:\n\n","The following table describes the user interface screens and different options available from the BREW\u2122 AVS client application :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0073"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Input\/",{}]},{"entry":["Component Name","Output","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Welcome Screen","Input","NA"]},{"entry":[{},"Output","This will display the initial welcome"]},{"entry":[{},{},"screen of the BREW\u2009\u2122 AVS client"]},{"entry":[{},{},"application for 5 seconds and after that"]},{"entry":[{},{},"user will be navigated to the \u201cAVS\u201d main"]},{"entry":[{},{},"screen automatically."]},{"entry":["Main Screen","Input","The BREW\u2009\u2122 AVS client application is"]},{"entry":[{},{},"not configured."]},{"entry":[{},"Output","The main screen will prompt the user to"]},{"entry":[{},{},"enter the name."]},{"entry":["Main Screen","Input","The user enters the name, and the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"application asks whether the user wants to"]},{"entry":[{},{},"setup the BREW\u2009\u2122 AVS client"]},{"entry":[{},{},"application, with Yes\/No options."]},{"entry":[{},"Output","If user presses yes, then the Progress bar"]},{"entry":[{},{},"will be displayed indicating that the"]},{"entry":[{},{},"provisioning is in process.
