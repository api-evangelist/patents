title: Remote application installation and control for a mobile device
abstract: In many cases, it is desirable to remotely install a software application on a mobile device that performs a function without requiring user intervention on the device, such as in the case where a device is lost or stolen. In one embodiment, a method implemented on the mobile device after installation of the software includes: determining an identifier for a computing device associated with the user; performing a function of the mobile device to obtain information regarding the mobile device; and sending the information for delivery to the computing device using the identifier. In one embodiment, software can be remotely installed on a device that, when installed, locates the device and transmits the location to an email address associated with the device so that a user can recover the device if it is lost or stolen.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/445,957, filed Feb. 23, 2011, entitled \u201cREMOTE APPLICATION INSTALLATION AND CONTROL FOR A MOBILE DEVICE,\u201d by Richardson et al., the entire contents of which application is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to mobile communication devices in general, and more particularly, but not limited to, remote installation of an application on a mobile device for performing a function on the mobile device.","Mobile devices have evolved beyond simple telephone functionality and are now more complex multi-functional devices. In addition to voice communications, many mobile devices are capable of text messaging, e-mail communications, Internet access, and the ability to run full-featured application software. Mobile devices can use these capabilities to perform online transactions such as banking, stock trading, payments, and other financial activities. Furthermore, mobile devices used by an individual, a business, or a government agency often store confidential or private information in forms such as electronic documents, text messages, access codes, passwords, account numbers, e-mail addresses, personal communications, phone numbers, and financial information.","As the criticality of mobile devices grows, missing devices become an increasingly severe problem. Currently, when a mobile device is lost, a user may try to locate it by calling the device's phone number; however, unless it is within close proximity to the user, the device will not likely be found. If the mobile device is not found, the user must deactivate the account associated with the missing device and transfer it to a new device, which is likely purchased at substantial cost to the user or organization. Any data present on the missing device will be lost unless it is backed up or stored somewhere outside of the device. Re-entering lost data such as contact information and device settings may entail hours of work. In addition, certain types of information being present on a mobile device may require a business or government agency to perform a damaging and costly public breach disclosure.","A malicious person who steals or finds a mobile device may use the device itself or the information stored on it for illegitimate purposes. A stolen device may be used to place phone calls, perform financial transactions, or subject its owner to financial loss in other ways. Furthermore, the confidential or private information on a device may be extracted by an unauthorized individual and used to the detriment of the device's owner. In many cases, the loss of government, business, or personal data is far more problematic than the replacement cost of the mobile device. In the case of government or certain business devices, preventing the data from a lost or stolen device from falling into malicious hands is of extreme importance to national security.","It is desirable for users and administrators to be able to remediate problems associated with lost or stolen devices as quickly and easily as possible. In organizations that utilize multiple types of mobile devices, each with separate management systems, dealing with a lost or stolen device may be a complex process. Furthermore, end users typically must contact and rely on an administrator in order to secure a missing device, often resulting in a period of several days between the time of loss and when remote security actions are finally initiated. Such a delay significantly increases the risk of financial or information loss associated with the missing device.","Systems and methods to provide remote installation of an application for performing a function on a mobile device are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.","In one embodiment, a method implemented in a data processing system includes: receiving, at a mobile device of a user, an application for remote installation on the mobile device; installing, via the mobile device, the application on the mobile device; executing the application on the mobile device, the executing comprising performing a function of the mobile device; and sending information to a computing device associated with the user.","In another embodiment, a method for remote installation of software on a mobile device of a user includes: determining an identifier for a computing device associated with the user; performing a function of the mobile device to obtain information regarding the mobile device; and sending the information for delivery to the computing device using the identifier.","The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods, including data processing systems which perform these methods, and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.","Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However, in certain instances, well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment; and, such references mean at least one.","Reference in this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.","It is desirable that both users and administrators be able to obtain remote access to a lost or stolen mobile device in order to secure the stored data, locate the mobile device, and provide feedback that confirms that the desired actions have successfully been executed. For users, it is desirable to be able to secure, control, and manage one or more personal devices. For administrators, it is desirable to be able to secure, control and manage a plurality of devices of multiple device types in order to be effective in an organization that has a heterogeneous mobile device deployment. At least one embodiment of the disclosure below provides for remote installation of an application for performing a function on a mobile device in order for a user to locate the device.","In one embodiment a mobile device of a user receives an application (e.g., an Android application package or .apk file) for remote installation on the mobile device (the user does not have to be in possession of the mobile device during the installation). For example, the owner of the mobile device may have selected the application from an application marketplace (e.g., the Android Market) for remote installation on an Android-based phone. It should be noted that the application marketplace may be, for example, one of many Android marketplaces (i.e., external markets that allow remote installation).","The application is remotely installed on the mobile device (e.g., using an Android marketplace). After this remote installation, the application is launched on the mobile device. During execution of the application, a function is performed on the mobile device to obtain or provide information or data (e.g., obtaining data from a global positioning system (GPS) module). The information\/data is sent to the user (e.g., to an email account of the user on a messaging server; to a another hardware or computing device of the user, such as a secondary mobile phone; or to some other device, such as a laptop or personal computer). In one embodiment, the launching and\/or execution of the application on the device may be initiated in response to an event on the mobile device (e.g., an activity on the mobile device such as, for example, receipt of a text or email message).","In one embodiment, the method further comprises receiving a message at the mobile device, and the executing the application is initiated on the mobile device in response to the receiving the message. In one embodiment, the message contains a predetermined text string that launches the application (e.g., a text message containing the word \u201clocate\u201d). In one embodiment, the mobile device is an Android-based phone that operates using the Android operating system.","In one embodiment, the mobile device comprises a position identification unit, the function is the obtaining of location data, and the executing the application further comprises obtaining a geographic location using the position identification unit. In other embodiments, additional and\/or alternative sources of information (e.g., cell tower data) may be used to determine or obtain a location of the mobile device. Any of several conventional location techniques may be used by the mobile device.","In another embodiment, the function is the locking of access to the mobile device other than by use of a password of the user, or the creating of a loud sound using the phone. Other functions may be implemented depending on the hardware and other software available on the mobile device.","In one embodiment, the location and\/or other information is sent to the user or owner of the mobile device in a message (e.g., a text or email message). In another embodiment, the information is sent to a computing device that is a messaging server storing a messaging account associated with the user, and the sending the information comprises sending a message to the messaging account.","In one embodiment, the application launches and automatically performs the function in response to an event (e.g., an action or another type of event such as a change in location of the mobile device) on the mobile device after the application has been installed on the mobile device. Examples of events include a change in location of the mobile device (e.g., as determined by a GPS unit), and a user turning on a screen of the mobile device.","In one example, Android devices are not currently designed for automatic launching of a newly-installed application. The mobile device is monitored for an event (e.g., an activity or intent) used to initiate launching or execution of the application. For example, the event on the mobile device may be selected from the group consisting of receipt of a message by the mobile device, an input provided by a user of the mobile device, an intent firing on the mobile device (for an Android device), the mobile device starting up, and an activation of a button or user interface element on the mobile device.","In one embodiment, the application or other software (e.g., when using operating systems other than the Android system) is configured to launch automatically after the remote installation by declaring itself as a background application or as wanting to receive one or more defined events.","In one embodiment for Android-based devices, monitoring for an event is accomplished by an application declaring an \u201cintent-filter\u201d for one of its components that tells the operating system that the application is interested in receiving notifications of particular types of events on the mobile device. When an event occurs that matches an intent-filter declared by the application, the operating system will start a component of the application that registered the intent-filter and provide information about the event (e.g., an Intent object) to the application.","In this embodiment, the application may register with the operating system to receive a variety of intents that are likely to occur on a device so that the application is started relatively soon after being installed on the device. The application does not necessarily register these intent-filters due to an interest in the particular events they correspond to, but rather so that a component of the application will start (i.e., begin executing in the operating system) so that the component (or another component of the application) can perform whatever function (e.g., locating the device) or action is desired as soon as possible after the application has been installed.","Some examples of monitoring include monitoring for the following events: an installation referrer callback by filtering for an intent with the name \u201ccom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\u201d; a network connectivity change by filtering for an intent with the name \u201candroid.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE\u201d; receiving an SMS message by filtering for an intent with the name \u201candroid.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED\u201d; the device starting up by filtering for an intent with the name \u201candroid.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\u201d; and a press of the camera button by filtering for an intent with the name \u201candroid.intent.action.CAMERA_BUTTON\u201d.","Various examples of intents, among numerous other intents for the Android system, that may be monitored include the following representative examples:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201ccom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201ccom.lookout.labs.planb.intent.action.LAUNCHED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.bluetooth.intent.action.BONDING_CREATED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.bluetooth.intent.action.DISABLED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.bluetooth.intent.action.DISCOVERY_STARTED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.bluetooth.intent.action.ENABLED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.bluetooth.intent.action.HEADSET_STATE_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.bluetooth.intent.action.MODE_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.net.wifi.RSSI_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.net.wifi.SCAN_RESULTS\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.net.wifi.STATE_CHANGE\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.net.wifi.WIFI_STATE_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.net.wifi.supplicant.CONNECTION_CHANGE\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.net.wifi.supplicant.STATE_CHANGE\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.intent.action.SCREEN_ON\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.intent.action.USER_PRESENT\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.intent.action.TIME_TICK\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.intent.action.TIME_SET\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.intent.action.DATE_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.intent.action.TIMEZONE_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.intent.action.PHONE_STATE\u201d ><\/action>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.accounts.AccountAuthenticator\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.accounts.LOGIN_ACCOUNTS_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.intent.action.DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.intent.action.DOWNLOAD_NOTIFICATION_CLICKED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name=\u201candroid.location.PROVIDERS_CHANGED\u201d \/>"},{"entry":"<action android:name="},{"entry":"\u201candroid.speech.action.GET_LANGUAGE_DETAILS\u201d \/>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In another embodiment, on other operating systems (e.g., Apple's iOS operating system), an application or software on a mobile device can declare that it wants to receive location change events, so that the operating system wakes up the application whenever the location changes (e.g., new Wi-Fi networks determined to be in range of the mobile device, detection of cell tower changes, or detection of a location change by a GPS unit of the mobile device). For example, the iOS operating system also allows an application to declare that it is a VOIP application, and as such, the operating system will wake the application up based on a timer event (e.g., a timer period ending every 10 minutes; this time is configurable by the application). On the iOS operating system, whenever an application is woken up, it may choose to perform functions or actions for a limited period of time before it has to shut down again. This time period may be used to control, or used in conjunction with performing, the various functions and actions as described herein.","In other embodiments, the method further comprises sending a plurality of messages to the messaging account, with each of the plurality of messages including a link to a map indicating an updated location of the mobile device. The messages may be sent periodically to update the location for the user. The number of messages may be limited to a predetermined limit, and\/or the time period in which messages are sent may be limited to a predetermined limit.","In one embodiment, the executing of the application comprises using an application programming interface (API) of an operating system of the mobile device to obtain an address associated with the messaging account, and the sending the message comprises sending the message to the address. For example, a message may be sent to another mobile device of the user or to a messaging server (e.g., to the user's GMAIL mail address). The message may be selected from the group consisting of a text message, an email message, a video file, and a voice communication. In some embodiments, the message is a text message or email message that includes an embedded link to a map. The map includes a visual indication of the geographic location of the mobile device. The link may connect a computing device of the user to a server (e.g., Google map server) that is configured to provide the map on a web page in order to display the location of the mobile device to the user.","In one embodiment, a user visits a web server that provides a marketplace of applications. For example, the application may be received and installed as an Android package from an Android marketplace server. In one embodiment, the application has a size of less than 200 thousand bytes to better ensure downloading and installation in a shorter time period and\/or with less power consumption. In one example, the first installed, lightweight application is an initial application followed by a second application with more full functionality. In response to receiving a new application for installation, the initial application is un-installed or removed from the mobile device and the new application is installed. For example, the new application is an expanded version of the initial application, and the new application has a size of greater than 500 thousand bytes.","In one embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium includes a software application, that when installed on a mobile device, causes the mobile device to: determine an account or email address of a user of the mobile device; perform a function on the mobile device to obtain information; and send the information to the account or email address. The application is configured for remote installation on the mobile device. For example, the application may be built as specified for other Android applications for use on the Android platform. The remote installation functionality itself is provided with the Android platform.","For example, the mobile device is configured to work with an application marketplace that enables remote installation. This requires that the application market provider (e.g., Google) has software running on the mobile device, a method to access the marketplace from a different device (e.g. a computer) other than the target mobile device, and an account management system that associates the user account of marketplace software on the mobile device with the market website\/application that is accessible via the different device (e.g. a computer). Additionally, the marketplace provides the ability for a user to select an application on a computer and have it installed onto the mobile device.","In another embodiment, a system (e.g., an application marketplace server) includes memory storage to store several various applications for mobile devices including a first application. The system includes at least one processor coupled to access the memory and configured to perform a method comprising: receiving a selection of the first application from a user; and sending the first application for remote installation on a mobile device of the user, wherein the first selected application is configured to, after installation, execute a function on the mobile device to obtain information, and to send the information to a messaging account associated with the user.","In one embodiment, the receiving the selection comprises receiving input provided by the user via a web page (e.g., hosted by an Android marketplace server), and each of the applications offered is an Android application package for remote installation on a mobile device. In one example, the system provides a predetermined text string to the user. The text string is to be included by the user in a message sent to the mobile device after a selected application is installed. The receipt of the text string at the mobile device causes the launching or initiation of the selected application on the mobile device (i.e., in response to receipt by the mobile device of the message including the text).","In an alternative embodiment, a web server is used to provide information regarding a user's mobile device. The method comprises storing a plurality of applications for mobile devices including a first application; storing a messaging account for a user of a mobile device; receiving a selection of the first application from the user via a web page; sending a password to the user; sending the first application for remote installation on the mobile device, wherein the first application is configured to, after installation, execute a function on the mobile device to obtain data; and hosting a web page, accessible only via entry of the password, to present information to the user based on the data.","In one example, the function is the obtaining of location data for the mobile device, and the information presented to the user is the geographic location of the mobile device. In one example, the method further comprises creating the password in response to receiving a message sent by the first application after installation on the mobile device. The sent message includes information to identify the messaging account. In another example, the sending of the password comprises sending a message to the user including the password. Various specific embodiments are now discussed further below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["141","143","145","147","149","123","125","121","121","123","123","141","143","145","147","149"]},"As an example, an owner of an Android phone that has been lost (e.g., mobile device ) may visit a web site hosted by marketplace  and select a phone-locating application for remote installation on mobile device . The user may authenticate itself to marketplace  by its email address (e.g., GMAIL mail address) and password. Mobile device  sends a message to the user (e.g., to the user's GMAIL mail address). The user then logs on to messaging server  via user terminal  to see the message. The message includes a link to a map server (e.g., Google maps) that provides an icon indicating the geographic location of the phone.","The marketplace  and\/or messaging server  are connected to respective data storage facilities to store applications, messaging account data for users, user preference data, and other data. In , messaging server  is connected to communication network  to deliver messages (e.g., email or text) to user terminals - or one of a user's mobile devices ,  (e.g., the mobile device that has not been lost by the user).","Although  illustrates an example system implemented in client-server architecture, embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various alternative architectures. For example, the application marketplace  may be implemented via a peer to peer network of user terminals in some embodiments, where applications and data\/information from mobile devices are shared via peer to peer communication connections.","In some embodiments, a combination of client server architecture and peer to peer architecture can be used, in which one or more centralized server may be used to provide some of the information and\/or services and the peer to peer network is used to provide other information and\/or services. Thus, embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to a particular architecture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["123","123"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","402","402","404","402"]},"Additional information regarding various non-limiting examples, including determining the location of a mobile device, and sending and presenting information related to location for a user, is described in previously-published U.S. patent application having publication no. 2011\/0047033 A1, published Feb. 24, 2011, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOBILE DEVICE REPLACEMENT,\u201d by Mahaffey et al., the entire contents of which application is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, and also in the Appendix A (titled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOBILE DEVICE REPLACEMENT\u201d) of previously-filed U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/445,957, filed Feb. 23, 2011, entitled \u201cREMOTE APPLICATION INSTALLATION AND CONTROL FOR A MOBILE DEVICE,\u201d by Richardson et al., which was incorporated by reference above. This Appendix A also includes examples of a mobile device, a server, and a system architecture that may be adapted for use with some of the methods described herein. The exemplary information provided in this Appendix A does not limit the generality of the present disclosure.","Several non-limiting examples of the above systems and methods are now described below. In a first example, an application for locating a lost phone is selected and remotely installed on a phone of a user. After loading the application, the user sends an SMS message to the phone with the word \u201clocate\u201d in the message. The application locates the phone using GPS functionality of the phone and sends the location to the user's email account. It should be noted that in this example the user can locate its phone even though no locate application was installed prior to losing the phone. The location of the phone is provided on a Google map. The application sends a map link to the user's email address.","The application is installed using the Android Market service, which lets a user send applications to the user's phone from the web. Applications may be provided on a website such as, for example, the \u201cmarket.android.com\u201d website, which is accessible by a web browser.","After the application is installed, it starts locating the user's phone using cell towers and GPS, even if GPS was not switched on when the phone was lost (i.e., the application switches on the GPS functionality of the mobile device). The application continues to update the phone's location for a predetermined time period (e.g., 10 minutes) and to provide messages during this time period. A new time period can be started again by texting \u201clocate\u201d to the user's number from any other phone.","The application detects the user's email address, and sends the user a Google Maps link. For example, there is an API on Android-based mobile devices that enumerates all of the accounts that the mobile device is synced with. The installed application uses this API to determine the user's email address.","The user may receive up to a predetermined number (e.g., ten) email messages per cycle, so the user can see if the lost phone is moving or standing still. Each email message is, for example, sent via an SMS message. In another example, the mobile device may communicate with a server. The server then sends an email to an email address supplied to the server during the communication. In this example, only the user's phone can be located, and the application only sends the location to the user's email address. In this example, the application cannot be used to locate a phone of another person other than the user.","In one embodiment, the sending of messages to the user is implemented by SMS to email transport services provided by carriers. These carriers or another communication system that makes the SMS to email transition is used to operate the sending of messages to the user.","In another example, when the installed application first launches (by being downloaded remotely and activating due to intent firing or receipt of an SMS message), the application immediately detects the phone's email address. This address may or may not be an \u201c@gmail.com\u201d address, but the address will always be associated with a Google account of the user. The application immediately sends a message to this address, and subsequently sends location updates to the address.","Thus, the application permits a secure way to communicate with the legitimate owner of the phone without the user having to take any action (e.g., manual entering of information) on the phone itself. In prior approaches, a locate application would ask the user to enter an email address, but in this example, such user action is not required. In other words, the user does not have to specify whom the email message should be sent to\u2014the application determines this automatically.","In another example, instead of merely sending an email or message as described in the example above, the identified email address may be used to create an account on a server. This server is distinct from application marketplace  or messaging server  above. For example, this distinct server may be controlled by the developer of the application that is remotely installed on the user's mobile device, in which case the application may be configured to send data (e.g., obtained via the mobile device as described above) to the server, and the server is configured to pass that data on to the user. The distinct server automatically generates a password and sends it to the identified email address. For improved security, the user is requested to sign-in and change this password. At this point in the process, there is a completed user account, with user credentials and client-server capabilities, without the user's taking any action other than remotely installing the application as described above.","As an example of the above account creation, a user installs the application from an Android marketplace. The distinct server creates an account and emails the password to the user. The user receives the email and logs into the account. The user tracks its phone in real-time from a web page (e.g., by observing an updated location on a map display on a web page hosted by the distinct server\u2014in one case, this may be the distinct server showing a map supplied by a Google server, or in another case this may be a map displayed on a Google server using location information supplied by the distinct server).","The distinct server also generally provides the user with remote access to the mobile device. This remote access may include the ability to perform various functions or actions on the phone (e.g., by selecting functions to execute from a list of functions displayed to the user on a web page). A web page hosted by the distinct server may provide the user with the ability to configure reports of information or data that are sent to the distinct server and\/or otherwise to a device of the user. This configuration may include parameters such as frequency of report. The distinct server may provide the user with remote access to the mobile device to perform other functions or actions such as scream or play a sound using the device, lock or block access to the device, wipe data from the device, backup data from the device to another computing device, and\/or locate the device (e.g., see various mobile device functions and actions described in Appendix A of previously-filed U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/445,957 referenced above, which may be implemented via the user's remote access as hosted by the distinct server; also see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010\/0210240, titled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REMOTELY SECURING OR RECOVERING A MOBILE DEVICE, by Mahaffey et al., published Aug. 19, 2010, the entire contents of which application is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein).","In another embodiment using the distinct server, the following three elements may be associated: An instance of an application on a mobile device, an email address and associated account (e.g., a Google GMAIL mail account), and a third-party web-based application (e.g., hosted by the distinct server).","In one example, this method may be used for a photo-sharing site as follows:\n\n","As an example of one of the ways to launch the application after installation on the mobile device (done in this example because the automatic launching of a newly-downloaded application is not a built-in feature of the Android phone) the application registers to receive notifications for events on the phone (e.g., background activity like receiving a text message, engaging the network connection, or receiving a phone call). For example, when the event occurs, the operating system starts the application to perform the notification to the user. The application monitors for any activity whatsoever, which causes the application to launch. As an example, Android phones permit the watching for events (e.g., actions) on the phone, and the performing of a function or taking of an action based on an observed event.","The application watches for any event (e.g., for any intent when the mobile device is based on the Android system), and then starts up whenever that event is called. For example, an intent to send a text message may be detected. Instead of waiting for a specific intent, the application waits for any intent (i.e., any intent that gets called on the mobile device). The application intercepts this call and uses that as a basis to launch the application. In other embodiments (e.g., that do not use the Android system) any sort of notification\/callback system may be used to start an application. For example, the background location change or the VoIP socket keep-alive features on iOS.","Now, another example is provided below with further details regarding the functions of the application on the mobile device, and the manner in which the application interacts with the Android operating system running on the mobile device. In this example, the application performs the following functions:","Watches for one or more events (e.g., intents or other actions), and the application launches when it sees one of these events.","The application immediately reads the email address.","The application reads the carrier that is configured on the phone.","Depending on the carrier, the application chooses a method to compose an SMS message (alternatively, a server component could be included in the application). Each carrier has a different SMS-to-email conversion mechanism. The application is configured to select a method to use based on the particular carrier.","The application silently (i.e., without user notification or manual user action) opens the SMS system and composes and sends the SMS message. The content of the SMS message begins with an email address. The SMS message is sent to the carrier.","The carrier detects the email, which causes the carrier to take the rest of the content, compose an email message to that email address, and include the content as the body of the message. This first message is sent, notifying the user that the process has started and linking the user to a website for more info.","The application checks to see if a GPS unit on the mobile device is turned on. If it is not turned on, the application turns it on. The application attempts to locate the phone using standard Android location determination methods.","When a location is detected, the application composes an SMS message using the method above.","The application converts a latitude-longitude (lat-long) location to a map (e.g., Google Maps) link.","The SMS message contains a \u201csponsor\u201d label, the map link, an accuracy for the location in meters, and a link to the above website.","If the message is too long to fit in a text message, the application removes the least relevant information (e.g., labels and secondary links) from the message until it can fit in an SMS text message.","Additional SMS messages are sent when a more accurate location is found, though messages are not sent more often than is configured. Messages may be sent, for example, more than 60 seconds apart.","SMS messages are sent for a set period of time after the request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"In , the system  includes an inter-connect  (e.g., bus and system core logic), which interconnects a microprocessor(s)  and memory . The microprocessor  is coupled to cache memory  in the example of .","The inter-connect  interconnects the microprocessor(s)  and the memory  together and also interconnects them to a display controller and display device  and to peripheral devices such as input\/output (I\/O) devices  through an input\/output controller(s) . Typical I\/O devices include mice, keyboards, modems, network interfaces, printers, scanners, video cameras and other devices which are well known in the art.","The inter-connect  may include one or more buses connected to one another through various bridges, controllers and\/or adapters. In one embodiment the I\/O controller  includes a USB (Universal Serial Bus) adapter for controlling USB peripherals, and\/or an IEEE-1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE-1394 peripherals.","The memory  may include ROM (Read Only Memory), and volatile RAM (Random Access Memory) and non-volatile memory, such as hard drive, flash memory, etc.","Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. Non-volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive, a magnetic optical drive, or an optical drive (e.g., a DVD RAM), or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non-volatile memory may also be a random access memory.","The non-volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non-volatile memory that is remote from the system, such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface, can also be used.","In one embodiment, a data processing system as illustrated in  is used to implement application marketplace , messaging server , and\/or other servers.","In another embodiment, a data processing system as illustrated in  is used to implement a user terminal or a mobile device. A user terminal may be in the form, for example, of a notebook computer or a personal desktop computer.","In some embodiments, one or more servers of the system can be replaced with the service of a peer to peer network of a plurality of data processing systems, or a network of distributed computing systems.

In one embodiment, the user input device  is configured to receive or generate user data or content. The user input device  may include a text input device, a still image camera, a video camera, and\/or a sound recorder, etc.","In this description, various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However, those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor, such as a microprocessor. Alternatively, or in combination, the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry, with or without software instructions, such as using an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions, or in combination with software instructions. Thus, the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems, various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer-readable media used to actually effect the distribution.","At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache or a remote storage device.","Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system, middleware, service delivery platform, SDK (Software Development Kit) component, web services, or other specific application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions referred to as \u201ccomputer programs.\u201d Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API (Application Programming Interface). The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer, cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.","A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory and\/or cache. Portions of this software and\/or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further, the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and\/or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively, portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically, just in time, when needed for execution. Thus, it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.","Examples of computer-readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non-recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media (e.g., Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD ROMS), Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), etc.), among others. The computer-readable media may store the instructions.","The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. However, propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.","In general, a tangible machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (e.g., stores) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).","In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order, operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.","In the foregoing specification, the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof.
