{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","Embodiment 1","Embodiment 2"],"p":["This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 200710177937.6, filed on Nov. 22, 2007, incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.","The present invention relates to software protection, and more particularly, to method and apparatus for protecting .net programs.","As a new cross-language software development platform based on the Internet, *net was introduced by Microsoft in line with the trends of distributed computing, component oriented, enterprise-level applications, software-as-a-service and web-centered demands in the software industry. Although it is not a development language, the .net platform provides support for a number of development languages. Among others, the *net platform helps users interact with different smart devices via the web, while making sure that the interaction is controlled by users, instead of applications, which gives users a personalized and comprehensive experience by smart devices connected to XML web services. The smart devices are tools with a web function, such as a personal computer, a palm computer, and a smart phone. With software on these devices, the devices are capable of interacting with users, networks, information and other devices or services more smartly.","The compilation of a .net language includes two phases. Firstly, an advanced language is compiled into an intermediate language (namely, intermediate code) called IL, which is more similar to a machine language than the advanced language. However, the intermediate language contains some abstract concepts (e.g. classes, and exceptions). When compiling the advanced language for the first time, a compiler will save the compiled intermediate language to a .dll or .exe file before creating a stub function for each of methods of a class. The stub function calls a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and passes its address as an argument to the just-in-time compiler. The just-in-time compiler then obtains the intermediate language from the .dll or .exe file, compiles the intermediate language into a machine language, and replaces a temporary calling function with a machine language in memory. The stub function then calls the compiler and compiles itself into a native machine language. For example, the JIT compiler is a typical just-in-time compiler. The JIT compiler compiles a code segment before execution of the code segment. The compilation result is a native static machine code, e.g. a machine code of an x86 instruction program under runtime environment.","A so-called Virtual Machine (VM) can be imaged as a \u201cmachine\u201d simulated by software, which has a processor, a memory, a register etc. for simulating execution of all instructions. There are no specific requirements for runtime environment for software executed on the \u201cmachine\u201d. The VM is transparent to programs executed thereon. For example, an x86 VM simulates runtime environment of an x86 instruction program, while a c51 VM simulates runtime environment of a c51 instruction program.","A compilation process refers to a process of translating a source program written with an advanced language into an equivalent low-level language (assembly language or machine language) target program. A decompilation process can be deemed as a reverse process of the compilation process, that is, a process of translating a target code of machine language into an equivalent code of assembly language or advanced language. An instruction transformation refers to a process of transforming a target instruction on a platform into a target instruction on a different platform according to execution logic of a program.","The .net architecture provides an outstanding convenience at the cost of bringing a sensitive defect that a .net program set can be easily decompiled. There are many .net intermediate code solutions to this defect in the prior art, although they are not very effective indeed. These solutions only reduce readability of the decompiled code without achieving an essential effect of anti-decompilation. An obfuscated source code can still be easily decompiled by attackers with malicious intent. Although developers can employ strong encryption algorithms, the code can be obtained because it will be decrypted for execution in a computer memory at runtime.","Currently, a pure software protection method for .net programs includes the steps of:\n\n","Generally, a shell is added to an executable file to implement protection. Users actually execute the shell, which will uncompress the protected program in the memory, and transfer control power to the uncompressed real program. All the above processes are performed in the memory, so that users do not know (and do not need to know) the processes, which will not affect execution rate. If a verification device for a software dongle or key disk is also added to the shell, a shell encryption is formed. The shell will or will not compress the program at all. Advantages of the shell involve anti-tracing, encrypting code and data, and protecting integrity of program data, which ensure that the program code is not modified or traced and debugged by hackers or others with malicious intent.","In prior art, a hardware device is often applied to protect a .net program. In other words, one or more parts of the .net program are extracted from the .net program to an encryption apparatus to run thereon, while the remaining program runs on a computer, so as to protect the .net program. An advanced encryption apparatus is programmable, and is used to protect a program by storing a key code of the program to be protected in an encryption apparatus and implementing communication between the program to be protected on the computer and an information security device. Therefore, shell calling instructions need to be written. The protected program performs communications with the encryption apparatus by calling an Application Programming Interface (API), which is an interfacing convention among different components of a system and a programming interface for exchanging information and commands between applications and a hardware system. A specific VM may be developed in the advanced encryption apparatus by developers, so as to execute a code in a format conforming to the VM directly in the encryption apparatus.","However, the hardware protection method has disadvantages of small protection scope, low protection strength and controllability, and restricted program code executed each time, thus a lot of work is required in this method. In another regard, the pure software protection method for .net programs in the prior art is easy to be cracked because the protected .net program still runs in the memory, which brings risks to the .net program.","To overcome the problems of the prior art, the present invention provides a method for protecting .net programs. The method includes the steps of:\n\n","The step A of the method may include: automatically or manually selecting a binary code segment according to its importance from a compiled .net program, containing .net intermediate language instructions.","The transforming the binary code segment at the step B may include: logically transforming the binary code segment, and encrypting or compressing the binary code segment that has been logically transformed.","The transforming the binary code segment at the step B may include: logically transforming the binary code segment, or encrypting or compressing the binary code segment.","The logically transforming the binary code segment includes: exchanging instructions, disordering instructions, or recoding.","The writing a shell calling instruction to the .net program at the step C may include: writing a shell calling instruction to an original location of the binary code segment in the .net program.","The step D may include the substeps of:\n\n","The transforming is based on a previous convention with the .net virtual machine in the shell of the .net program, and is directed to a source code on the basis of its original instruction format.","The shell calling instruction is adapted to call the shell, and the .net virtual machine is automatically called upon the shell is loaded and executed.","In another aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for protecting .net programs. The apparatus includes:\n\n","an executing module, adapted for executing the transformed binary code segment upon running to the shell calling instruction of the .net program.","The executing module includes:\n\n","Alternatively, the executing module includes:\n\n","By transforming the binary code segment of a .net program and executing the transformed binary code segment through a .net virtual machine, effective protection for the .net program is achieved with the present invention, without any restrictions. Only by a simple transformation, a program running on the .net platform is protected. In addition, the transformation is processed in a predetermined way, and is controlled by a fixed or changeable rule. Thereby, the decompiled code is disordered. The security strength of software protection can be improved. Even though someone with malicious intent can fetch the transformed source code by detecting the memory, the program cannot be executed properly without awareness of the rule of transformation. Therefore, it is more difficult to crack the source code.","The present invention is further described with the embodiments and the drawings below.","The present invention provides a method for protecting .net programs using pure software. The method mainly includes the following steps of: selecting a binary code segment containing .net intermediate language instructions from a compiled .net program; transforming the binary code segment, and removing the binary code segment from the .net program; writing the transformed binary code segment to a shell of the .net program, and writing a shell calling instruction to the .net program; and executing the .net program, calling a .net virtual machine by the shell calling instruction upon executing the shell calling instruction, and executing the transformed binary code segment by the .net virtual machine.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the transformation of the binary code segment is based on a previous convention with the .net virtual machine in the shell of the .net program, and is directed to a source code in original instruction format. An implementation of the transformation may include logically transforming the binary code segment, or encrypting or compressing the binary code segment, or by logically transforming the binary code segment, and then encrypting or compressing the binary code segment that has been logically transformed. The logically transforming may include exchanging instructions, disordering instructions, recoding etc. The following is a detailed description of an embodiment of the present invention, with regard to a transformation of the binary code segment by exchanging instructions.","Referring to , the present invention provides a method for protecting .net programs, which includes the following steps.","Step . compiling a .net program to be protected to .net binary code segments.","A .net program is provided below for the purpose of description:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Class test"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]},{"entry":[{},"Int Add(int a,int b)"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]},{"entry":[{},"Return a+b;"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"Static int main(String args[ ])"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Add(1,3);"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2002\/\/Begin loading a PE file"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if(VM_READFILE(0,sizeof(g_Dosx.e_magic),"},{"entry":"(char *)&g_Dosx.e_magic) == \u22121 )"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003return 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if(VM_READFILE(0x3C,sizeof(g_Dosx.e_lfanew),"},{"entry":"(char *)&g_Dosx.e_lfanew) == \u22121)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003return 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if(g_Dosx.e_magic!=0x5a4d)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003return 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/File Header Offset"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Off=g_Dosx.e_lfanew+4;"},{"entry":"\u2003if( VM_READFILE(m_Off,sizeof(g_Filex.Machine)+"},{"entry":"sizeof(g_Filex.NumberOfSections),(char*)&g_Filex.Machine) == \u22121 )"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003return 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Option Header Offset"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Off+=sizeof(IMAGE_FILE_HEADER);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Off+=0x60;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Off+=(IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR\u2003*"},{"entry":"sizeof(IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY_X));"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get Com_Directory"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if( VM_READFILE(m_Off,sizeof(g_ComDirx),"},{"entry":"(char *)&g_ComDirx) == \u22121 )"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003return 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get Section_Header Offset"},{"entry":"\u2003g_SectionOff=g_Dosx.e_lfanew+4+sizeof(IMAGE_FILE_HEADER)+"},{"entry":"sizeof(IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get _Cor20"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Off=Rva2Raw_x(g_ComDirx.VirtualAddress);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003if( VM_READFILE(m_Off,sizeof(g_Cor20x),"},{"entry":"(char *)&g_Cor20x) == \u22121 )"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003return 0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get PE_EXTEND offset"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003g_PeExtendOff=Rva2Raw_x(g_Cor20x.MetaData.VirtualAddress);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get Pe_Extend"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003GetPeExtendHeader_x( );"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get Meta_Header"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003GetMetaHeader_x( );"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\/\/Get number and size of metadata tables"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Index=0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003while (m_Index <= 43)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003{"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003g_RowOfTables[m_Index]=GetRowsOfTables_x(m_Index);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003m_Index++;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003m_Index=0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003while (m_Index <= 43)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003{"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003g_SizeOfTables[m_Index]=GetSizeOfTables_x(m_Index);"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003m_Index++;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The above .net program is compiled into a .net binary code segment with a machine assembly language.","Step . selecting a binary code segment containing .net intermediate language instructions from the compiled .net program.","The .net intermediate language instructions include the IL instructions.
