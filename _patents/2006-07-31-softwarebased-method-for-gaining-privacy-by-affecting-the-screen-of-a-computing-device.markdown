title: Software-based method for gaining privacy by affecting the screen of a computing device
abstract: A method and apparatus for allowing the user of an electronic device to enhance privacy over a display with the use of software, are disclosed. A security window including a translucent graphical effects region may be displayed on the electronic device such that it overlays content the user may choose to protect. The security window allows the protected content to remain discernable for the user of the device yet substantially indiscernible to a person at a further distance and/or greater viewing angle from the screen of the device. One or more security windows, each of which may be of any size, shape, texture, translucency level and any other graphical or behavioral properties may be displayed on the display associated with the electronic device. The user may control the size, shape, texture, translucency level and any other graphical or behavioral properties of the security window and graphical effects region. The user may invoke or terminate a security window with the single click of a button. Security windows may automatically attach to applications in focus, or be attached in response to a user command, and allow uninterrupted usability of those applications.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to computer graphics applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to the application of graphics software to reduce the legibility of a computer screen to a potential viewer.","The evolution of computer screens has been progressively achieving higher resolution, brightness, sharpness, response time and contrast ratio. As screens are becoming larger, brighter and sharper, they are generally easier to read from a greater distance and wider angles. For example, laptops with passive-matrix screens, popular in the late 1990s, have been replaced with active-matrix, or TFT screens, in which each pixel is illuminated. The direct result is that a computer's TFT screen appears clearer and easier to read from a greater distance and wider viewing angle. New technologies continue to improve computer screens by increasing brightness and reducing glare, making screens easier to read in daylight and from greater distances and wider angles.","While the trend of bigger, better, brighter, and sharper screens offers a great benefit to the user, it also presents a drawback: the content of the screen may be more visible to prying eyes in the vicinity of the user. The proliferation of portable computers and their usage at public places, coupled with their larger-and-better-than-ever screens, compromise privacy. For example, more and more corporate users use their portable computers for work of potentially sensitive nature-ordinarily conducted behind closed doors in an office\u2014at public places such as coffee shops and airplanes, where their screens could be read by dozens of people at any given time.","In recognition of the increased need for privacy demanded by computer users, hardware manufacturers have introduced hardware-based monitor security devices. Examples of hardware-based monitor security devices include computer privacy filters, or screens (collectively, privacy filters, unless otherwise noted), introduced by companies such as 3M\u00ae, feature a physical device that is adhered to, or placed over, a computer screen. Once such privacy filter is applied (i.e. placed over or adhered to) to a computer screen, its optics are designed to distort the view of the computer screen, when viewed from a wide angle or greater distance. The usage of a privacy filter may keep information displayed away from prying eyes, as a person to either side of the user may find their view of the computer screen distorted and intangible. Other related hardware-based monitor security devices are computer LCD screens that are manufactured in such way that they can be \u201cread\u201d (or viewed in a tangible way) only by a user sitting directly in front of them.","Hardware-based monitor security devices have multiple drawbacks. Among these drawbacks is the bulk and inconvenience, especially for mobile computing. Some filters are not easily removed from a monitor to allow viewing without the distorting effect of the screen, which users may want to do when security is less of a concern (as when a computer user may be using the computer to show something to others). Additionally, hardware monitor security devices in the form of privacy screens are ineffective in giving the audience of a presentation on a large display, such as an LCD projector or large flat screen TV, privacy from prying audience who may be standing a substantial distance away. (e.g. a LCD projected presentation at a company board room with glass walls, where people standing outside the room may be able to see sensitive projected information). There are other limitations and drawbacks of hardware monitor security devices to those described above.","A software-implemented method for allowing a user to enhance privacy over any portion of their computer's display, is disclosed. The user may choose to display one or more translucent region(s) over any portion of their screen in such a manner as to allow the user to discern the content covered by the region, while making the task of discerning the content covered by the region more difficult to a person at a greater distance and wider angle to the screen, than the user. The translucent region may be turned on and off randomly by the user, via a pointing device, keyboard command, software hot-key, designated key on the keyboard or any other method. The user may control the translucent region's shape, size, position, opaqueness and other behavioral characteristics. Applications covered by the translucent region are unaffected by it in terms of behavior. The translucent region may be optimized in such a manner as to have a minimal impact on the user sitting in front of the screen\u2014so that they can read content covered by the translucent region with minimal strain\u2014while offering the maximum obstruction to viewers further and at wider angles to the screen than the user. Different patterns may be applied to the translucent region, either automatically or at the user's choosing, so as to optimize its effectiveness under various conditions. The user may manually choose the pattern to be applied to the translucent region from a library of patterns; or, allow the software to choose, apply and adjust a pattern automatically. The user may move and reposition the translucent region over an application manually; or, instruct the software to track an application and reposition the translucent region automatically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","102","102","104","102","104","106","104","108","108","104","106","104","108","108","108","102","114","102","104","114","104","108","102","110","108","110","104","302","302","304","302","310","302","310","302","302","304","304","302","302","302","304","302","304","304","302","304","302","302","304","302","302","302","304","302","304","302","110","108","112","108","114","108","102","110","112","108","114","104","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","204","200","202","202","212","200","214","204","200","200","216","200","210","204","204","200","200","206","204","208","204","210","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["304","302"]},"Secuirty window  may include a shaded, translucent region  as the graphical effect.

Another possible embodiment is shown in , which is a generalized flow diagram illustrating the use of a software hot key to open and close secure regions or \u201csecurity windows.\u201d A software hot key is a shortcut which allows the user to instruct a computing device to perform a function\u2014such as launch an application\u2014with a single key stroke at any time, regardless of any other applications or processes which may be running. An application may register a hot key with an operating system running on a device, instructing the operating system on what key (or keys) would define the hot-key-shortcut, and what application to invoke once that key (or keys) is pressed. Process  registers hot keys with the operation system, allowing the hot keys to open and close security windows, and un-registers the hot keys. At step  hot keys are defined and registered with the operating system running on a device, preferably one specific key to designate the launching of a new security window, and one for closing a security window. At step  the application which registered the hot keys is hidden such that it may become a process running away from the user's view. At any point in time, a user may press the specific key on the keyboard designated as a hot key in step . In step , the operating system, having received they user's pressing of a key designated as a hot key, notifies the application controlling security windows. At step  a determination is made whether the hot key pressed is a hot key designated for launching a new security window, or closing an existing security window. If at step  a determination is made that the hot key pressed was intended to create a new security window, at step  a new security window is created. To \u201capply\u201d the new security window to a window that is currently in focus (or \u201con top\u201d), at steps - the newly-created security window may be positioned on top of the current window in focus. In one preferred embodiment, pressing the hot key initiates associating the security window with a specific window in order to cover that window; thus, the newly-created security window should match the location and dimensions of the window in focus. At step  a determination is made whether there is a window in focus. At step  the location and size of the window in focus are obtained. At step  the security window created at step  is resized to the location and dimensions determined in step . If at step  the determination is made there is no window in focus, at step  the security window created at step  is set to a default location and size. If at step  the hot key invoked as denoting closing is identified, at step  a determination is made whether there is a window currently in focus. If the determination at step  is affirmative, at step  the size and location of the window in focus may be obtained. At step  a determination may be made whether any one of the existing security windows is associated with the window in focus. The determination may be made by accessing a stored record of security windows associated with other windows; or, it may be determined that, upon recursion of all security windows, the security window having the closest size and position to the window in focus, is said to be associated with the window in focus. Thus, an assumption may be made that that is the security window the user wishes to close and the handle to that security window may be obtained in step . Step  then terminates that security window. If step  determines there is no window in focus, or if at step  it is determined there is no security window associated with the window in focus, at step  a handle to the first security window is obtained, and at step  this window is terminated. In other embodiments of the present invention, at step  a handle to the first, last or any arbitrary security window may be obtained; or, at step  the security window closest to the mouse cursor may be determined. For a complete shutdown of the application exhibiting the behavior of this invention, at step  a message from the operating system indicating the user has taken action to close this application may be received. at step  the hot keys registered in step  may be un-registered. At step  a common procedure to terminate the application's running on the device may be executed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","810","804","810","806","804","814","812","812","812","812","804","812","804","816","810","816","818","820","816","810","822","810","810","816","812","816","812","816"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","902","904","924","904","906","904","908","906","910","924","906","904","924","910","910","912","914","914","916","918","910","912","918","914","918","920","900","900"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B"],"b":["1000","1002","1002","1000","1006","1000","1004","1006","1006","1002","1006","1008","1000","1004","1006","1004","1006","1004"],"i":["a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","b","b","a","b","a\/b","a\/b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1102","1104","1112","1104","1106","1104","1108","1110","1114","1114","1114","1116","1114","1118","1110","1112","1120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1202","1208","1202","1204","1206","1208","1210","1212","1214","1206","1216","1218","1224","1218","1212","1220","1212","1206","1222","1218","1224","1216","1212","1206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","2","9","1304","1300","1302","1302","1302","1304","1300","1302","1","11","4","1310","4","1306","1300","1304","1308","1304","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","1302","1300","4","1306","4","1310","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","1304","1302","1304","2","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["1412","1410","1404","1406","1408","1402","1402","1410","1404","1406","1412","1402","1412","1412","1408","1412","1408","1404","1406","1410","1408","1412","1412","1408"]}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present invention and further advantages thereof, references are now made to the following Detailed Description, taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A & 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
