title: Apparatuses, methods and systems for rich internet/cloud printing and print product traffic control management
abstract: This disclosure details the implementation of apparatuses, methods and systems for a Rich Internet Printing and Print product traffic control Manager (hereinafter, “Manager”). The high volume and varied makeup of modern printing needs may render some confused as to the best printing mode for a given job. Often, individuals will settle into a routine of using the same printer, printing mode, printing service, and/or the like for all jobs regardless of whether a different printing method may be preferable or more nearly suited to the job at hand. The Manager may serve as an intermediary agency to direct print jobs to one or more particular printing methods, internal or external document production agencies, printers, and/or the like that are deemed most suitable for the printing job at hand. In an embodiment, the Manager may comprise a single print driver that may be installed on a local computer system. Once installed, a Manager print option may appear among the other printer options in a print menu. By selecting the Manager print option and issuing a print command, a user may direct his or her print job directly to the Manager for analysis and routing to an appropriate printing method, printer, agency, and/or the like.

No. 61\/096,736, filed Sep. 12, 2008, entitled, \u201cAPPARATUSES, METHODS, AND SYSTEMS FOR A PRINT PRODUCT TRAFFIC CONTROL MANAGER,\u201d, to all of which priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 is claimed.","The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are herein expressly incorporated by reference.","The present invention is directed generally to apparatuses, methods, and systems of document management, to APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR RICH INTERNET\/CLOUD PRINTING AND PRINT PRODUCT TRAFFIC CONTROL MANAGEMENT.","In printing a document, various options are often available, particularly at the enterprise level. For example, an individual may print a document to a simple, local printer, a more advanced color or laser printer, a copy machine, and\/or the like. Often, different printer drivers are installed on the individual's computer to format a given print job for the particular printer or printing method that the individual wishes to use. Other printing options have also come about, such as printing to a file (e.g., PDF, XPS, etc.) or printing via the assistance of a specially designated department (e.g., printing, reproduction, word processing, etc). Various external document production agencies may also provide printing services, including specialty services such as binding, special paper, high quality printing, and\/or the like.","This disclosure details the implementation of apparatuses, methods and systems for a Rich Internet Printing and Print product traffic control Manager (hereinafter, \u201cManager\u201d). The high volume and varied makeup of modern printing needs may render some confused as to the best printing mode for a given job. Often, individuals will settle into a routine of using the same printer, printing mode, printing service, and\/or the like for all jobs regardless of whether a different printing method may be preferable or more nearly suited to the job at hand. The Manager may serve as an intermediary agency to direct print jobs to one or more particular printing methods, internal or external document production agencies, printers, and\/or the like that are deemed most suitable for the printing job at hand. The Manager is capable of routing print jobs to and across multiple print devices and\/or services spanning a local, domestic, international, or global network of document reproduction resources. In an embodiment, the Manager may comprise a single print driver that may be installed on a local computer system. Once installed, a Manager print option may appear among the other printer options in a print menu. In an alternative embodiment, Manager components may be configured within, as part of, and\/or in association with one or more rich media web applications for printing rich media content, and may require no such installation. It should also be noted that the Manager may be implemented to run in the Cloud, over a distributed communication network, and\/or the like. By selecting the Manager print option and issuing a print command, a user may direct his or her print job directly to the Manager for analysis and routing to an appropriate printing method, printer, agency, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, a processor-implemented method for routing document reproduction requests is disclosed, comprising: receiving a document reproduction request and a document; analyzing the document based on a set of document classification criteria to determine a document classification; determining a reproduction destination based on the document classification and a reproduction routing schedule; and directing the document to the reproduction destination.","In another embodiment, a processor-implemented method for routing document reproduction requests is disclosed, comprising: receiving a document reproduction request; analyzing the document reproduction request based on a set of reproduction request criteria to determine a reproduction request classification; comparing the reproduction request classification to a plurality of reproduction facility records to determine a reproduction facility; and directing the document to the reproduction facility.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","In order to address various issues and improve over the prior art, the invention is directed to apparatuses, methods and systems for rich internet printing and print product traffic control management. It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of a Manager individual and\/or enterprise user, reproduction method and\/or agency, server, content and\/or document type, content source, data transmission and\/or network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the Manager may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses an embodiment of the Manager primarily within the context of enterprise document reproduction and\/or printing. However, it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily configured\/customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example, aspects of the Manager may be adapted for non-enterprise and\/or small scale document reproduction, electronic reproduction, document access management, and\/or the like applications. Aspects of the Manager may further be adapted, in some embodiments, to capture of content, such as rich internet application generated content and\/or other multimedia content, and intelligent selection of one or more user interfaces, output devices, and\/or the like for provision and\/or display of captured content. It is to be understood that the Manager may be further adapted to other implementations or document management and\/or reproduction applications.","Manager",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","105","110","105","110","105","110"]},"In one implementation, an individual and\/or enterprise user  may directly engage the PPTC  in order to have print jobs and\/or document reproduction requests routed to and\/or among various available print facilities thereby. In one implementation, user-level access to the PPTC may be facilitated by print driver software installed at a user, enterprise, network and\/or the like computer system and configured to direct one or more print jobs and\/or document reproduction requests to the PPTC for re-routing to one or more print facilities. The PPTC may route some print jobs to one or more local and\/or enterprise print facilities , such as a local printer, network printer, enterprise print and\/or reproduction department, and\/or the like. The PPTC may route print jobs to one or more PSPs, which may generate print products  in accordance with instructions received from and\/or relayed by the PPTC , and deliver generated print products  to the user\/enterprise  and\/or to one or more third party recipients  specified in the print instructions.","In one implementation, a user  may employ RICP features and\/or functionality to enable printing of media content derived from internet sources, such as RIA media sources . In the instant specification, RIA sources should be understood to include those internet content sources implemented using Adobe Flash\/Flex, Microsoft Silverlight, HTML\/AJAX, Java\/JavaFX, and\/or any other software technologies configured to generate rich user interface experiences approaching the sophisticated look and functionality of desktop software over network resources. A user  may engage an RIA media source  to retrieve RIA media content. In one implementation, the RIA media source  may engage the RICP  upon receipt of an indication from the user  of a desire to print RIA media content. The RICP  may then generate a print user interface (UI) for provision and display to the user , allowing the user to provide print specifications and\/or print product attributes relevant to RICP printing and\/or production of a final print product related to selected RIA media content . In an alternative implementation, a client-side computer system associated with the user\/enterprise  may detect an attempt to print RIA media content and directly engage RICP functionality to facilitate RIA media content printing. The RICP  may subsequently capture selected media content, convert content to one or more page description language (hereinafter, \u201cPDL\u201d) formats (e.g., Adobe Portable Document Format [PDF], Microsoft XML Paper Specification [XPS], Postscript, PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, XSLFO, HTML, and\/or the like), and direct converted media content to one or more print facilities, such as a local\/enterprise print facility . In one implementation, the RICP  may interface with the PPTC  to pass captured RIA media content thereto for routing to one or more appropriately selected print facilities. Coupling of the RICP  and PPTC  provides distinct advantages for printing rich media content inasmuch as the PPTC may direct complex and\/or variegated multimedia content to print facilities best suited to faithfully reproduce that content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["105","201","110"]},"In one implementation, the Manager Controller  may be coupled to one or more interface components and\/or functional modules. For example, the Manager Controller  may be coupled to a RIA Source Interface  configured to receive RIA source content, RIA instructions, and\/or the like. The Manager Controller  may further be coupled to a User\/Print Interface  configured to transmit an RICP UI to display print options and\/or print product configurations to a user, receive print option specifications therefrom, provide print instructions and\/or printable content for display and\/or printing on a local and\/or enterprise printer, and\/or the like. The Manager Controller  may further be coupled to a PPTC interface  configured to relay printable content, instructions, metadata, and\/or the like to the PPTC  for subsequent routing to one or more printers and\/or PSPs. In one implementation, print job metadata may be configured in a job definition format (JDF), an example of which is provided

Optionally, the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally, a cryptographic processor  and\/or a global positioning system (GPS) component  may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and provides a base signal. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of signals embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative signals may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply signal communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. Of course, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests.

The CPU interacts with memory through signal passing through conductive conduits to execute stored signal program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such signal passing facilitates communication within the Manager controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount of speed, parallel, mainframe and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.","Power Source","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells, in one embodiment, the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell  is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the Manager thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example, the power source  is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment, an outside power source  is provided through a connection across the I\/O  interface. For example, a USB and\/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.","Interface Adapters","Interface bus(es)  may accept, connect, and\/or communicate to a number of interface adapters, conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards, such as, but not limited to: input output interfaces (I\/O) , storage interfaces , network interfaces , and\/or the like. Optionally, cryptographic processor interfaces  similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed, such as, but not limited to: Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), Card Bus, (Extended) Industry Standard Architecture ((E)ISA), Micro Channel Architecture (MCA), NuBus, Peripheral Component Interconnect (Extended) (PCI(X)), PCI Express, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA), and\/or the like.","Storage interfaces  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to a number of storage devices such as, but not limited to: storage devices , removable disc devices, and\/or the like.

A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further, multiple network interfaces  may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example, multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast, multicast, and\/or unicast networks.","Input Output interfaces (I\/O)  may accept, communicate, and\/or connect to user input devices , peripheral devices , cryptographic processor devices , and\/or the like. I\/O may employ connection protocols such as, but not limited to: Apple Desktop Bus (ADB); Apple Desktop Connector (ADC); audio: analog, digital, monaural, RCA, stereo, and\/or the like; IEEE 1394a-b; infrared; joystick; keyboard; midi; optical; PC AT; PS\/2; parallel; radio; serial; USB; video interface: BNC, coaxial, composite, digital, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), RCA, RF antennae, S-Video, VGA, and\/or the like; wireless; and\/or the like. A common output device is a television set, which accepts signals from a video interface. Also, a video display, which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) or Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) based monitor with an interface (e.g., DVI circuitry and cable) that accepts signals from a video interface, may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Typically, the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface (e.g., an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable; a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable, etc.).","User input devices  may be card readers, dongles, finger print readers, gloves, graphics tablets, joysticks, keyboards, mouse (mice), remote controls, retina readers, trackballs, trackpads, and\/or the like.","Peripheral devices  may be connected and\/or communicate to I\/O and\/or other facilities of the like such as network interfaces, storage interfaces, and\/or the like.

A MC68HC16 microcontroller, commonly manufactured by Motorola Inc., may be used for and\/or within cryptographic units. Equivalent microcontrollers and\/or processors may also be used. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16-bit multiply-and-accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512-bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents, as well as allow for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of CPU. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include VLSI Technology's 33 MHz 6868 or Semaphore Communications' 40 MHz Roadrunner 184.","Memory","Generally, any mechanization and\/or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and\/or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However, memory is a fungible technology and resource; thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the Manager controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and\/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., CD ROM\/RAM\/Recordable (R), ReWritable (RW), DVD R\/RW, etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); and\/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","Component Collection","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the Manager component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","Operating System","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the Manager controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Plan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and\/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS\/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista\/XP (Server), Palm OS, and\/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the Manager controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the Manager controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, twitter, SMS, SMTP, and\/or the like.","Information Server","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the Manager controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port 21, and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the Manager database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the Manager database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the Manager. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the Manager as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","User Interface","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista (i.e., Aero)\/XP, or Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact with, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Web Browser","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Some Web browsers allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Of course, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the Manager enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","Mail Server","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POP3), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the Manager.","Access to the Manager mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","Mail Client","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","Cryptographic Server","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the Manager may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the Manager component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the Manager and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The Manager Database","The Manager database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the Manager database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data, but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the Manager database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the Manager database  may be integrated into another component such as the Manager component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Reproduction_Jobs table may include fields such as, but not limited to: job_ID, job_name, user_name, authorization, document_ID, document_classification, number_of_copies, reproduction_method, reproduction_destination, warnings, special_handling_instructions, schedule_ID, schedule_last_updated, schedule_creator, access_restrictions, and\/or the like.

A Routing Rules table may include fields such as, but not limited to: rule_ID, user_ID(s), PSP_ID(s), RIA_ID(s), rule_name, rule_type, rule_definition, and\/or the like. These tables may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on the Manager controller.","In one embodiment, the Manager database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search Manager component may treat the combination of the Manager database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the Manager. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the Manager may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The Manager may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The Manager database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Manager database communicates with the Manager component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The Manager Component","The Manager component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the Manager component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the Manager that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the Manager affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The Manager component is configurable to access, calculate, engage, exchange, generate, identify, instruct, match, process, search, serve, store, and\/or facilitate document analysis and\/or document reproduction, generation, administration, termination, and\/or the like and use of the Manager.","The Manager component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, WebObjects, and\/or the like.

The Manager component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Manager component communicates with the Manager database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The Manager may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Distributed Managers","The structure and\/or operation of any of the Manager node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the Manager controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. Again, the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.","The entirety of this disclosure (including the Cover Page, Title, Headings, Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, Claims, Abstract, Figures, and otherwise) shows by way of illustration various embodiments in which the claimed inventions may be practiced.
