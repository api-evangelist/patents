title: Systems, methods and graphical user interfaces for previewing image capture device output results
abstract: The user enters the desired image capture parameters to be used when capturing an electronic image of an original document into one or more portions of a preview graphical user interface. Then, either automatically, or upon selecting a preview function, a preview pane portion of the preview graphical user interface is generated. The preview pane portion graphically illustrates how the various image capture parameters selected by the user will be applied to the original document to generate the captured electronic image data. Each of the different types of image capture parameters has a different visual cue associated with it. The visual cues visually inform the user of the image capture parameters that the user has selected. Thus, without actually capturing a preview image and without filling the preview pane portion with an actual preview image, the user can accurately determine what the resulting image will look like after the original document is captured. Thus, most preview scans can be eliminated. The user can also easily determine whether a preview scan is required. For example, a preview scan may still be desirable if it is difficult for the user to determine if the selected image capture parameters will result in the desired captured electronic image data. However, even if the user determines that a preview scan is still desirable, the selected image capture parameters will generally be closer to the required image capture parameters before the actual preview scan is generated than without using the preview graphical user interface.

Field of Invention","This invention is directed to a graphical user interface for an image capture device, such as a scanner.","2. Description of Related Art","Scanners and other types of image capture devices have become ubiquitous office productivity tools for generating electronic images of physical original documents. Once an electronic image of a physical original document has been generated, the electronic image data can be used in an infinite variety of ways to increase the productivity and the product quality of an office. Such image capture devices include desktop scanners, other stand-alone scanners, digital still cameras, digital video cameras, the scanning input portions of digital copiers, facsimile machines and other multi-function devices that are capable of generating electronic image data from an original document, and the like. These image capture devices can also include image databases that store previously captured electronic image data.","However, as the cost of scanners and other image capture devices has dropped and the output quality of the captured electronic image data has improved, scanners and other image capture devices have been provided with an ever-increasing number of controllable features. Similarly, as users have become comfortable with capturing and using electronic image data obtained from original documents, the uses to which the electronic image data has been put, and thus the needed control over the quality and appearance of the electronic image data, have expanded greatly.","In response, standard interfaces between such image capture devices, including those indicated above, and the various application programs that use such captured electronic image data have been developed. These standard interfaces allow standard-compliant image capture devices and standard-compliant applications to easily communicate. One exemplary embodiment of such a standard interface is the TWAIN\u2122 interface. The TWAIN\u2122 interface allows any TWAIN\u2122-compliant application program to input and use electronic image data using any TWAIN\u2122-compliant image capture device.","The TWAIN\u2122-compliant component protocol facilitates communication between application programs and image capture devices, such as those indicated above. One such TWAIN\u2122 image capture device is the XEROX\u00ae DigiPath\u2122 scanner.","The ever-increasing numbers of features provided by image capturing devices such as the Xerox\u00aeDigiPath\u2122 scanner cause users of these image capturing devices to find it increasingly difficult to obtain the desired scanning results without generating a preview scan. A preview scan is a scan of a document on a platen of the image capture devices that is generated when the user requests a preview of the actual image. For example, the preview image can be generated by driving a scan bar of a scanner to generate a low resolution image of the document.","The preview image allows the operator to confirm, among other things, whether the original document has been fed correctly into the scanner to obtain the desired orientation of the resulting image, whether the desired cropping or framing of the input image has been correctly defined, whether the desired scaling of the input image has been correctly defined, whether the proper image type has been selected to select the appropriate scanning parameters, and the like.","However, generating a preview scan takes time that could otherwise be used to generate actual production scans. Thus, users often do not wish to generate a preview scan prior to generating a production scan of the original document due to reduced productivity that the preview scan causes. However, if the production operator does not generate a preview scan, it is often difficult to determine exactly how the resulting electronic image will appear. Moreover, generating a second production scan, because the scanned image did not correspond to the desired scanned image, often takes more time than generating the preview scan would have taken. Thus, generating a production scan that does not correspond to the desired electronic image reduces the operator's productivity beyond that cause by generating a preview scan. Moreover, even determining whether a preview scan should be performed, rather than performing a preview scan automatically, can be complex and time consuming.","This invention thus provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow the user to visualize the results of generating a production scan of an original document using the current scan parameters without generating a preview scan.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow an operator to determine, without generating a preview scan, if the original document will be fed correctly into the image capture device and if the captured image will have the desired orientation.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow a user to determine, without generating a preview scan, whether the current image capture parameters will crop or frame the desired portion of the original document.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow a user to easily determine, without generating a preview scan, whether the captured portion of the original document will be scaled as desired.","This invention separately provides systems, methods and graphical user interfaces that allow the user to determine, without generating a preview scan, whether the current image type parameters correspond to the desired image type parameter.","This invention separately provides one or more graphical user interfaces that graphically illustrate how the current image capture parameters will be applied to the document to be scanned.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces of this invention, the user enters the desired image capture parameters to be used when capturing an electronic image of an original document into one or more portions of one or more graphical user interfaces. Then, either automatically, or upon selecting a preview function, a preview pane portion of the graphical user interface is generated. The preview pane portion graphically illustrates how the various image capture parameters selected by the user will be applied to the original document to generate the captured electronic image data.","In particular, in various exemplary embodiments, various ones of the different types of image capture parameters has a different visual cue associated with it. The visual cues visually inform the user of the image capture parameters that the user has selected. Thus, without actually capturing a preview image and without filling the preview pane portion with an actual preview image, the user can accurately determine what the resulting image will look like after the original document is captured. Thus, most preview scans can be eliminated.","Moreover, the user can quickly determine whether a preview scan is required or not. For example, a preview scan may still be desirable if it is difficult for the user to determine if the selected image capture parameters will result in the desired captured electronic image data. However, even if the user determines that a preview scan is still desirable, the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces according to this invention will still be useful, in that the selected image capture parameters are likely to be closer to the required image capture parameters before the actual preview scan is generated than without using the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces of this invention.","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of various embodiments of the systems, methods and graphical user interfaces according to this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","130","131","132","131","120","133"]},"It should be appreciated that the electronic image data capture device can also be referred to as variously, a scanner, an image capture device, an electronic image data generating device, or the like, and, regardless of the name, can be any one of a stand-alone scanner, a digital copier, a facsimile machine, a multi-function device, a digital still camera, a digital video camera, an electronic image database storing previously generated electronic image data, or any other known or later device that is capable of generating (or supplying) electronic image data from an original document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","210","220","230","240","210","100","210","212","250","250","210","220","230"]},"The protocol layer  includes a TWAIN\u2122 code portion  of the TWAIN\u2122 driver (or data source) , a source manager  and a TWAIN\u2122 code portion  of a TWAIN\u2122-compliant application .

The preview mimic  provides visual cues to the user to allow the user to determine if the various image capture parameters the user has entered through the basic features tab , the image quality tab  and\/or the image size tab  will result in a scanned image that accurately corresponds to the users desired scanned image. In particular, the dimensions of the selected page size, selected by using the page size list box , are represented by the page size mimic portion .","Similarly, if the crop\/frame check box  is checked, thus enabling the crop\/frame control parameters, the crop\/frame marquee  will be displayed in the preview pane portion . In particular, the crop\/frame marquee  will indicate the various values entered in the top, left, right and bottom parameter boxes \u2013. Then, by selecting the crop\/frame marquee , the user can move the top, left, right and\/or bottom edges of the rectangular crop\/frame selection area  to change the desired dimensions of the rectangular crop\/frame selection area .","Similarly, if the reduce\/enlarge check box  is checked, thus enabling the reduce\/enlarge control parameters \u2013, a scale marquee  is displayed. The scale marquee  indicates the resulting dimensions after scaling the captured image based on the values entered into the enabled scale factor parameter boxes  and  or the enabled dimension parameter boxes  and . Moreover, as indicated in , the dimensions of the scale marquee  can be tied to the dimensions of the crop\/frame marquee  if, for example, the scale-to radio button  has been selected. That is, the scale-to function scales the rectangular crop\/frame selection area , if the crop radio button  is selected, or the page size of the original document of the frame radio button  is selected, as indicated by the page mimic . Thus, changing either the dimensions of the rectangular crop\/frame selection area , such as, for example, by selecting and manipulating the crop\/frame marquee , the dimensions of the scale marquee  will change proportionally. This is shown in , by the portions of the scale marquee  that extend and connect to the crop\/frame marquee .","In contrast, if the frame radio button  and the scale-to radio button  were both selected, the connecting portions of the scale marquee  would instead extend to the corners of the page mimic . In further contrast, if the fit-to radio button  were selected, the scale marquee  has fixed dimensions. In this case, the scale marquee  is not connected to, nor is it re-scaled by, manipulations to either the crop\/frame marquee  or the page mimic .","The preview mimic  also includes an image orientation mimic  that indicates the image orientation that will result based on the selected parameters for the SEF\/LEF original document orientation button , the rotate button  and the orientation mimic . In addition, if the two-sided check box  has been selected, the image orientation mimic  will also indicate whether the front or back side of the original document is being imaged. Additionally, if the image orientation mimic  vindicates the back side of the original document is being previewed, the orientation of the image orientation mimic  will depend on whether the head-to-head or the head-to-toe relationship has been defined between the front and back side images on the original document. Finally, the preview mimic  includes an image quality profile mimic . The image quality profile mimic  indicates the particular image quality profile selected in the image quality profile list box . For example, in the graphical user interface  shown in , the image quality profile mimic  indicates that a \u201cphoto\u201d image quality profile has been selected.","Thus, the preview mimic  allows the user to quickly and visually verify that the various image capture parameters that the user has input to the basic features tab , the image quality tab , and\/or the image size tab  will result in the captured image desired by the user. In addition, the page size mimic , the crop\/frame marquee  and\/or the scale marquee  allow the user to visually adjust the selected image capture parameters so that the adjusted image capture parameters will result in a captured image that more closely corresponds to the desired captured image. Accordingly, the user can avoid the need to view a preview scan in most cases.","Furthermore, in situations where the user still believes a preview scan is desirable, by using the various elements of the preview mimic , the preview scan will more closely correspond to the desired production scan. In this way, because only fine adjustments to the image capture parameters should be necessary in view of the preview scan, the user can avoid needing to view additional preview scans before the user decides that the current image capture parameters will result in the desired captured image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A\u20138C","FIG. 8A","FIGS. 8A\u20138C","FIGS. 8A\u20138C"],"b":["500","550"]},"In any case, beginning in step S, control continues to step S, where a determination is made whether the preview pane portion is enabled and displayed. If not, control jumps back to step S until the preview pane portion is enabled and displayed. Otherwise, once the preview pane portion is enabled and displayed, control continues step S.","In step S, the page mimic is displayed using the currently selected page size. In particular, if the user has not consciously changed the currently selected page size, the currently selected page size will be a default page size. Next, in step S, a determination is made whether the crop\/frame check box has been enabled. If so, control continues to step S. Otherwise, control jumps to step S.","In step S, the crop\/frame marquee is displayed using the currently selected rectangular selection area values. Then, in step S, a determination is made whether any one or more of the rectangular selection area values have been changed. If not, control jumps directly to step S. Otherwise, control continues to step S.","In step S, the current selection area values are updated. Control then jumps back to step S. In particular, the selection area values can be updated in step S in two ways. First, the user can enter a new selection area values into the image size tab. In this case, updating the selection area values comprising forwarding the new selection area values so that the crop\/frame marquee can be re-displayed in step S using the new current selection area values. Alternatively, the selection area values can be updated in step S by selecting and manipulating the crop\/frame marquee. In this case, the selection area values resulting after the crop\/frame marquee has been manipulated are determined and displayed in the appropriate portions of the image size tab.","In step S, a determination is made whether the scale\/enlarge check box has been enabled. If so, control continues to step S. Otherwise, control jumps to step S.","In step S, a determination is made whether the \u201cscale-to\u201d scaling function has been enabled. If not, control continues to step S. Otherwise, control continues to step S. In step S, because the \u201cfit-to\u201d scaling function was selected, the scale marquee is displayed based on the selected values in the \u201cfit-to\u201d scale parameter boxes. Control then jumps to step S.","In contrast, in step S, a determination is made whether the crop function has been enabled. If so, control continues to step S. Otherwise, either the frame function has been enabled, or neither crop function nor the frame function has been enabled. In either case, control jumps to step S.","In step S, the scale marquee is linked to the crop\/frame marquee. Control then jumps directly to step S. In contrast, in step S, the scale marquee is linked to the page size mimic. Next, in step S, the scale marquee is displayed based on the selected scale factor and either the selected dimensions of the page size or the selected dimensions for the crop selection area. Then, in step S, a determination is made whether the scale parameters have been changed by the user. If so, control jumps back to step S. Otherwise, control continues to step S.","In step S, the image orientation mimic is displayed based on the selected page orientation and image orientation on the page, including whether the two-sided check box has been checked, and, if so, which one of the head-to-head or head-to-toe radio buttons have been selected. Then, in step S, the image quality profile mimic is displayed based on the selected image quality profile. Next, in step S, a determination is made whether the user has selected to take a preview scan. If so, control continues to step S. Otherwise, control jumps to step S.","In step S, a preview image is captured. Next, in step S, the captured preview image is displayed in the preview pane portion. Control then jumps back to step S, where a determination is made whether the preview image should be removed from the previewed pane and an new set of scanning parameter visual cues should be displayed.","In contrast, in step S, a determination is made whether the user has requested that a production image be captured. If not, control again jumps back to step S. Otherwise, control continues to step S. In step S, an image of the original document on the image capture device is captured using the selected image capture parameters, especially those using the visual cues according to this invention. Next, in step S, a determination is made whether to stop. If not, control once again jumps back to step S. Otherwise, if the user does wish to exit the preview process, control continues to step S, where the method ends.","It should be appreciated that the image capture device control systems  and  shown in  can each be implemented on a general purpose computer. However, it should also be appreciated that the image capture device control systems  and  can also each be implemented on a special purpose computer, a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit elements, an ASIC or other integrated circuit, a digital signal processor, a hardwired electronic or logic circuit such as a discreet element circuit, a programmable logic device such as a PLD, PLA, FPGA and\/or PAL, or the like.
