Technical Field","Embodiments described herein relate generally to a semiconductor integrated circuit and, more particularly, to a semiconductor integrated circuit capable of controlling a read command.","2. Background","Typically, a semiconductor integrated circuit operates by synchronizing a command signal and an address with the rising edge of a clock. The trend towards an increase in data bandwidth has a tradeoff in that the number of pins required by the semiconductor integrated circuit is increased. Since a reduced number of pins can be considered beneficial, techniques for achieving such results have been considered.","For example, the use of a multiplexing scheme for the pins has been considered. In this scheme multi-addressing can be performed relative to one address pin using rising and falling edges of a clock. For example, the address pin is used as a first address at the rising edge of the clock, and if the address pin is synchronized with the falling edge of the clock, the address pin can be used as a tenth address. In this way, the requisite number of pins can be partially reduced.","However, a semiconductor integrated circuit typically starts a read or write operation at a subsequent rising edge occurring after multi-addressing is performed twice after an external read or write command is applied to the semiconductor integrated circuit. Thus an address access time (tAA) may be increased in a scheme for reducing the number of requisite pins.","Embodiments of the present invention include a semiconductor integrated circuit capable of improving an address access time (tAA).","According to one embodiment, a semiconductor integrated circuit includes a command decoder configured to provide a write or read command using a rising or falling clock in response to an external command that defines write and read modes, a shift register unit configured to shift an external address and the write command by a write latency in response to the write command, and a column address latch unit configured to latch the external address as a column address in the read mode, and latch a write address, which is provided from the shift register unit, to provide the write address as the column address in the write mode.","According to another embodiment, a semiconductor integrated circuit, which performs multiplexing using rising and falling  clocks through one address pin, includes a command decoder configured to provide a first write command and a read command by synchronizing the first write command and the read command with the rising and falling clocks in response to an external command, a shift register unit configured to shift an external address and the lo write command by a write latency in response to the write command, thereby providing a write address and a second write command, a burst command controller configured to provide a burst read-write command, which indicates an additional write or read operation, and a burst address, which corresponds to the burst read-write command, in response to the first write command, the read command and a burst length if a predetermined burst length is exceeded, and a column address latch unit configured to latch the external address as a column address in the read mode, provide the write address as the column address by latching the write address in the write mode, and latch the burst address as the column address in response to the burst read-write command.","According to further another embodiment, a semiconductor integrated circuit includes a command decoder configured to provide a write command and a read command, a read\/write command controller configured to provide a write-read clock in synchronization with a first edge of a clock in response to the write-read command, and provide the write-read clock in synchronization with a second edge of the clock in response to the read command, and a column address latch unit configured to latch the external address as a column address in response to the read command, and provide the column address by latching the write address, which is provided from a shift register unit, in response to the write-read command.","According to still another embodiment, a semiconductor integrated circuit includes a command decoder configured to provide a read command in synchronization with a first edge of a clock, a read\/write command controller configured to provide a read clock in synchronization with a second edge of the clock in response to the read command, and a column address latch unit configured to latch an external address in response to the read command, and provide a column address in synchronization with the second edge of the clock.","These and other features, aspects, and embodiments are described below in the section entitled \u201cDetailed Description.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , in an embodiment of the present invention the semiconductor integrated circuit includes first and second pad sections  and  each having a plurality of pads, a memory area \u2018A\u2019 having a plurality of banks, and a peripheral circuit area \u2018B\u2019 formed at a periphery of the memory area \u2018A\u2019.","External signals are applied to the semiconductor integrated circuit through the pads of the first and second pad sections  and , and internal signals of the semiconductor integrated circuit are transmitted to the outside through the pads.","The number and arrangement of the banks of the memory area \u2018A\u2019 may vary depending on the configuration and\/or degree of integration of the semiconductor integrated circuit.","In an embodiment, the peripheral circuit area \u2018B\u2019 includes the command controller . The command controller  controls the memory area \u2018A\u2019. In an embodiment, the command controller  provides a write command in synchronization with a rising clock and a read command in synchronization with a falling clock. Hereinafter, the command controller  will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring to , in an embodiment the command controller  includes a command decoder , a shift register unit , a column address latch unit  and a burst command controller .","The command decoder  provides a first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 and a read command \u2018RD\u2019, which correspond to a rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 or a falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019, in response to an external command \u2018CMD\u2019 and a chip select signal \u2018CSB\u2019. For example, if the external command \u2018CMD\u2019 is received and defines a write mode, the command decoder  provides the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 synchronized with the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019. If the external command \u2018CMD\u2019 is received and defines a read mode, the command decoder  provides the read command \u2018RD\u2019 synchronized to the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019. Thus, as described above, according to an embodiment of the present invention the read command \u2018RD\u2019 and the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 can be provided in synchronization with each edge of a clock (the rising and falling edges corresponding to the rising clock and the falling clock) according to the external command \u2018CMD\u2019. In more detail, the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 denotes a clock generated in synchronization with the rising edge of the clock. Further, the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019 denotes a clock generated in synchronization with the falling edge of the clock. Since generating rising and falling clocks from a clock signal is generally known in the art, a detailed description about the generation scheme thereof will be omitted.","In an embodiment, the shift register unit  includes a column address shift register  and a command shift register .","The column address shift register  provides a write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019, which is delayed by a write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019, in response to an external address \u2018ADD\u2019, the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019, the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 and the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019.","Further, the command shift register  is configured to provide a second write command \u2018WT\u2019, which is delayed by the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019, in response to the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019, the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 and the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019.","Such a write command is a synchronous command which requires time regulation of a clock base.","In other words, the semiconductor integrated circuit starts a write operation with an internal write command, which satisfies a predetermined time requirement necessary for an actual write operation, in response to the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 which represents the write mode. Thus, the shift register unit  synchronizes the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 and the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 with the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 and delays by the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019, thereby providing the write command \u2018WT\u2019 and the write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019 which are necessary for the actual write operation.","In an embodiment, the burst command controller  includes a column command generator , a read\/write command controller , a burst command generator  and a burst address counter .","The column command generator  provides a write-read command \u2018WTRDB\u2019 in response to the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019, the read command \u2018RD\u2019 and a reset signal \u2018RESET\u2019. Thus, it is possible to determine whether the signal corresponds to the read command \u2018RD\u2019 or the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 based on a level (e.g., a logic level) of the write-read command \u2018WTRDB\u2019.","The read\/write command controller  provides a write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 and a burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019, the read command \u2018RD\u2019, the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019, the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019 the reset signal \u2018REST\u2019 and burst length \u2018BL\u2019. The read\/write command controller  is configured to provide the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 as the write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019, or provide the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019 as the write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 in response to the read command \u2018RD\u2019. Further, the read\/write command controller  can be configured to provide the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 in response to the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 provided from an MRS (mode register set). For example, the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 may be set as 4, 8 or 16. For the purpose of illustration, the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is set to 4.","In an embodiment, the burst command generator  provides a burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 in response to the write-read command \u2018WTRDB\u2019, the write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 and the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019. That is, either a read mode or a write mode is performed, and the selection of read mode\/write mode is based on the level (e.g., voltage level) of the write-read command \u2018WTRDB\u2019. When the base burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is set to 4, as described above, the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 is generated once. If the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is 8, the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 is generated twice. If the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is 16, the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 is generated four times. Thus, if the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is 16, the read command \u2018RD\u2019 (or the write command \u2018WT\u2019) must be provided once, and an additional read command must be provided three times. In this regard, a command including additional read information corresponds to the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019. The relationship between the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 and the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 can be explained in the same manner as described above. However, it should be understood that the above description is for explaining, but not limited to, a read or write operation when the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is set to 4.","In an embodiment, the burst address counter  is configured to provide a burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019 in response to the read command \u2018RD\u2019, the second write command \u2018WT\u2019, the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019, the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 and a column address \u2018YADD\u2019. In detail, when providing the burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019 in response to the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019, the burst address counter  counts from (and increments) the column address \u2018YADD\u2019, which is latched in response to the read command \u2018RD\u2019 or the second write command \u2018WT\u2019, to the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 and then provides the burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019.","In an embodiment, the column address latch unit  is configured to provide the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019, the read command \u2018RD\u2019, the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019, the write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019, the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 and the burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019. In detail, the column address latch unit  provides the write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019 to the memory area \u2018A\u2019 as the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019, provides the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 to the memory area \u2018A\u2019 as the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the read command \u2018RD\u2019, and provide the burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019 to the memory area \u2018A\u2019 as the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019. According to one embodiment, in the case of the read command \u2018RD\u2019, the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 is provided in synchronization with the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019. Further, a read-related operation of the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 can also be provided in synchronization with the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},"Referring to , the command decoder  according to an embodiment includes first and second NAND gates ND and ND, and first and second inverters IV and IV.","The first NAND gate ND is connected in series to the first inverter IV, and performs a NAND logical operation on the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 and the external command \u2018CMD\u2019.","The second NAND gate ND is connected in series to the second inverter IV, and performs a NAND logical operation on the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019 and the external command \u2018CMD\u2019.","If the external command \u2018CMD\u2019 is a write mode command, the command decoder  provides the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 synchronized with the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019. If the external command \u2018CMD\u2019 is a read mode command, the command decoder  provides the read command \u2018RD\u2019 synchronized with the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019. In an embodiment, the command decoder  can divide edges of the synchronization clock into falling and rising edges according to the read command \u2018RD\u2019 and the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , the command shift register  of the shift register unit  includes a plurality of transmitters (for the purpose of illustration, first to fourth transmitters T to T), and a first latency activation unit .","In an embodiment, each of the first to fourth transmitters T to T includes a transfer gate TR and a latch unit L.","The first transmitter T transmits the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 in synchronization with a rising edge of the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019. The transfer gate TR is turned on when the level of the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 is a high level. The latch unit L latches the signal output by the transfer gate TR.","The second transmitter T is configured to transmit the signal from the first transmitter T in synchronization with a falling edge of the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019. As shown in , the configuration of the transfer gate TR is such that the transfer gate is turned on when the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019 is a low level. The latch unit L latches the signal output by the transfer gate TR. The third and fourth transmitters T and T operate in a manner similar to that of the first and second transmitters T and T.","Accordingly, the first to fourth transmitters T to T are alternately turned on\/off in response to the rising clock \u2018RCLK\u2019. Thus, a signal transmission time after turn-on of the first and third transmitters T and T or the second and fourth transmitters T and T is delayed by one clock period corresponding to each pair of a turned-on and turned-off transmitter of the transmitters T to T.","In an embodiment, the first latency activation unit  is configured to provide output signals of the first to fourth transmitters T to T as the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 in response to the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019 of the semiconductor integrated circuit. The first latency activation unit  includes pass gates PASS and inverters INV and INV, which receive the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019, respectively.","The operation of the first latency activation unit  will now be described. If the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019 is 1, the first write latency \u2018WL<>\u2019 is at an activated level, for example, in  the activated level is a high level. Thus, the pass gate PASS, which receives the first activated write latency \u2018WL<>\u2019, is turned on, so that the output signal of the second transmitter T can be provided as the second write command \u2018WT\u2019. That is, time transmission time is delayed by one clock period through the first and second transmitters T and T or the third and fourth transmitters T and T, and therefore when the configuration of  is used an address signal delayed by one clock period can be provided when the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019 is 1.","In an embodiment, the column address shift register  includes first to fourth transmitters T to T, a write command receiver  and a second latency activation unit .","Since the configuration and operation principle of the column address shift register  is substantially identical to that of the command shift register , a detailed description thereof will be omitted in order to avoid redundancy. Briefly, the column address shift register  receives the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 in order to provide the write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019 by delaying the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 by the write latency \u2018WL<1:4>\u2019. In order to operate in response to the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019, the column address shift register  further includes the write command receiver .","In an embodiment, the write command receiver  includes an inverter INVi and a transfer gate TR to transmit the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 in response to an activated level of the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , in an embodiment the column command generator  includes a first PMOS transistor P, first and second NMOS transistors N and N, and a latch unit L.","The first PMOS transistor P includes a gate terminal, which receives an inverted first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 (obtained by passing the first write command \u2018EWT\u2019 through a first inverter INV); a source terminal, which receives a supply voltage \u2018VDD\u2019; and a drain terminal connected to node \u2018a\u2019.","In an embodiment, the first NMOS transistor N includes a gate terminal, which receives the read command \u2018RD\u2019; a source terminal connected to a ground voltage \u2018VSS\u2019; and a drain terminal connected to node \u2018a\u2019.","In an embodiment, the second NMOS transistor N includes a gate terminal, which receives the reset signal \u2018RESET\u2019; a source terminal connected to the ground voltage \u2018VSS\u2019; and a drain terminal connected to node \u2018a\u2019.

Further, when the read command \u2018RD\u2019 is activated, the write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 corresponds to the falling clock \u2018FCLK\u2019. In the semiconductor integrated circuit according to an embodiment, the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is set to 4 as an initial value. However, as described above, the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is not limited to this initial value.","In such a case, the burst signal generator  can further include a divide-by-4 circuit.","For example, if the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is 4, the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019, which is divided by 4 clock periods, is activated by the burst signal generator  in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 or the read command \u2018RD\u2019. If the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 is 8, a counter pulse can be generated twice by the divide-by-4 circuit so that the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 activated after being delayed by the 4 clock periods can be activated twice. As described above, when the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 exceeds 4, an internal read-write command signal is required to additionally provide the read or write command.","Although not shown in the drawings, similar to the command decoder  shown in , in an embodiment the burst command generator  provides the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 by a NAND logical operation performed on the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019, the write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 and the write-read command \u2018WTRDB\u2019. Thus, the burst command generator  provides an additional write or read command synchronized with the write-read clock \u2018WTRD_CLK\u2019 whenever the burst signal \u2018BURST\u2019 is activated.","Further, when an additional internal command is required according to the write-read command \u2018WTRDB\u2019 and the burst length \u2018BL\u2019, the burst address counter (\u2018\u2019 in ) can count the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 latched in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 or the read command \u2018RD\u2019 while increasing the column address \u2018YADD\u2019, thereby providing the burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019. In detail, if the burst length \u2018BL\u2019 exceeds 4, the burst address counter  receives the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 latched in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 or the read command \u2018RD\u2019, and counts the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 while increasing the column address \u2018YADD\u2019. At this time, an address increment mode may include an interleaving mode or a sequential mode according to the configuration or characteristics of the circuit.","According to an embodiment, the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 is provided in synchronization with either the rising or falling edge of the clock according to which of the read or write modes the device is in. However, the scope of the disclosure is not limited thereto. That is, the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 or burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019 scheme may be omitted according to the configuration or characteristics of the semiconductor integrated circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2"]},"Referring to , in an embodiment, the column address latch unit  includes first to third address latch units ,  and , and a latch section .","In an embodiment, the first address latch unit  provides the external address \u2018ADD\u2019 as the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the read command \u2018RD\u2019.","The first address latch unit  shown in  is a clocked-inverter that is responsive to the read command \u2018RD\u2019 and includes first and second PMOS transistors P and P and first and second NMOS transistors N and N, which are connected in series.","The second address latch unit  shown in  provides the write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019 as the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019.","The second address latch unit  is a clocked-inverter that is responsive to the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 and includes third and fourth PMOS transistors P and P and third and fourth NMOS transistors N and N, which are connected in series.","The third address latch unit  shown in  provides the burst address \u2018BURST_ADD\u2019 as the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 in response to the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019.","The third address latch unit  is a clocked-inverter that is responsive to the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 and includes fifth and sixth PMOS transistors P and P and fifth and sixth NMOS transistors N and N, which are connected in series.","In an embodiment, the first to third address latch units  share an output node e connected to the input of the latch section .The latch section  is configured to provide the column address \u2018YADD\u2019 by inverting and latching the signal of node \u2018e\u2019.","The operation of the column address latch unit  will now be described.

When the second write command \u2018WT\u2019 is activated, the third PMOS transistor P and the fourth NMOS transistor N are turned on, so the write address \u2018WT_ADD\u2019 is provided to node \u2018e\u2019. Similarly, when the burst read-write command \u2018BURST_WTRD\u2019 is activated, the fifth PMOS transistor P and the sixth NMOS transistor N are turned on, so the burst address\u2018BURST_ADD\u2019 is provided to node \u2018e\u2019.","As described above, according to the commands, the column address latch unit  can selectively provide an address to which delay is applied; an external address; and an address that is further counted in addition to the basic burst length \u2018BL\u2019.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"]},"Referring to , the external command \u2018CMD\u2019 is provided in synchronization with the rising edge of a clock \u2018CLK\u2019.
