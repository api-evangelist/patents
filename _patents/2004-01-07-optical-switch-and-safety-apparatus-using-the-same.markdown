{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","Example 1","Example 2"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to optical switches which can control an operation of a circuit by detecting, as a switching signal, existence of a substance of various kinds such as pathogens, physiological substances, and toxic substances, and which can be applied to various safety apparatuses; and safety apparatuses using the optical switches.","2. Description of the Related Art","To date, many kinds of optical switching circuits have been proposed (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 2002-208720 and 2002-350748). However, they employ semiconductors, mirrors, or the like, and none is known that utilizes detecting the change of the wavelength of light. Furthermore, with regards to optical switches which use the wavelength change of light, ones that can control an operation of a circuit by detecting existence of various substances such as pathogens, physiological substances, and toxic substances as a switching signal and that can be applied to various safety apparatuses are yet to be provided.","On the other hand, in waste water treatment processes and the like, the safety of the waste water was achieved by detecting existence of toxic substances by, for example, inspecting the survival of fish such as carp that had been released in a lagoon where the waste water was kept before being released to a river, or by analyzing samples of the waste water at constant intervals. However, these processes had problems including that continuous processing is not possible, that they are complex, and that they do not provide sufficient safety. Although, some safety apparatuses which employ optical switches have been proposed (see, for example, JP-A Nos. 2001-63944 and 10-198426), these are not the ones which operate upon detecting a slight change of wavelength.","Objects and Advantages","An object of the present invention is to provide optical switches which can control an operation of a circuit by detecting, as a switching signal, existence of a substance of various kinds such as pathogens, physiological substances, and toxic substances, and which can be applied to various safety apparatuses.","Another object of the present invention is to provide safety apparatuses which are suitable for hospitals, laboratories, factories, plants, and the like, and which can avoid a hazard by activating a hazard evasive apparatus upon detecting, as a hazard signal, existence of a substance of various kinds such as pathogens, physiological substances, and toxic substances.","The optical switch of the present invention comprises: an optical irradiation unit to irradiate light; an optical interference unit which can interact with a switching signal, which interferes with light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit and radiates it as interference light, and which can vary the wavelength of the interference light after interaction with the switching signal; and a switching unit which is provided in the path of the interference light, which detects a wavelength change of the interference light radiated by the optical interference unit, and which conducts one of activating and deactivating a circuit. In the optical switch according to the present invention, the optical irradiation unit irradiates light. The optical interference unit interferes with the light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit, and radiates as an interference light. The optical interference unit can interact with the switching signal, and after interacting with the switching signal, the wavelength of the interference light is changed. The switching unit detects the wavelength change of the interference light radiated by the optical interference unit. Then, the switching unit activates or deactivates the circuit. In this manner, the optical switch controls the operation of the circuit.","The safety apparatus of the present invention comprises: an optical irradiation unit to irradiate light; an optical interference unit which can interact with a hazard signal, which interferes with light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit and radiates it as interference light, and which can vary the wavelength of the interference light after interaction with the hazard signal; a wavelength change detecting unit which is provided in the path of the interference light, and which detects a wavelength change of the interference light radiated by the optical interference unit; and a hazard evasive apparatus activating unit which activates a hazard evasive apparatus when the wavelength change detecting unit detects a wavelength change of the interference light. In the safety apparatus according to the present invention, the optical irradiation unit irradiates light. The optical interference unit interferes with the light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit, and radiates as an interference light. The optical interference unit can interact with the hazard signal, and after interacting with the hazard signal, the wavelength of the interference light is changed. The wavelength change detecting unit detects the wavelength change of the interference light radiated by the optical interference unit. The hazard evasive apparatus activating unit activates the hazard evasive apparatus. As a result, hazards are evaded, and safety is secured.","(Optical Switch)","The optical switch of the present invention comprises an optical irradiation unit , an optical interference unit , a switching unit  as shown in , and other unit which may be suitably selected as required.","<Optical Irradiation Unit>","The optical irradiation unit is not particularly limited provided that it irradiates light, and may be selected according to the purpose from light sources known in the art such as for example a halogen lamp (e.g., xenon lamp) or a laser light irradiation device.","Among these, a laser light irradiation device is preferred as it can irradiate a linear luminous flux. In this case, it is easy to control the incidence angle of the light irradiated from this optical irradiation unit to the optical interference unit. Other advantages are that the area of the light-receiving surface in the optical interference unit irradiated by light from the optical irradiation unit can be designed small; that the light-receiving surface of the wavelength change detecting part which detects the wavelength change of the interference light due to the optical interference unit, can be designed small; that measurement noise can be controlled; and that it is possible to prevent switch malfunction effectively.","In the present invention, when a spectrophotometer is used as the wavelength change detecting part, a light source built into this spectrophotometer can be used as the optical irradiation unit.","<Optical Interference Unit>","The optical interference unit has the functions of interfering with the light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit and being able to interact with the switching signal. It interferes with the light irradiated from the optical irradiation unit and radiates it as an interference light, and changes the wavelength of the interference light after interaction with the switching signal. The radiation may be reflected light or transmitted light.","The optical interference unit is not particularly limited as long as it has the functions and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, for example comprising at least a film-like material wherein a rod-shaped material is aligned.","Among these, a film-like material wherein a rod-shaped material is aligned on a substrate is preferred. In this case, as the film-like material is provided on the substrate, the structural stability of this film-like material and surface smoothness are excellent, detection errors can be reduced, and switch malfunction can be prevented.","Substrate","The substrate is not particularly limited as long as the film-like material can be arranged on its surface, and can be selected according to the purpose, but for example, from the viewpoint of reducing detection errors, it preferably has excellent surface smoothness, examples are one or more selected from among semiconductors, ceramics, metals, glass and plastics, or an interference filter or pigment filter. The semiconductor may be selected from among those known in the art, e.g., silicon.","Among these substrates, those comprising an identical refractive index film having a substantially equivalent refractive index to that of the rod-shaped material forming the film-like material on the surface, are preferred. In this case, the thickness of the film-like material which is further provided on this substrate can be made thin, the optical interference unit can be easily manufactured at low cost, and the wavelength of the interference light can be easily adjusted to the visible light region. Depending on the thickness and quality of the material of the oxide film, the interference light due to this substrate may show an interference color, and in this case it can also be used as a \u201cpre-colored substrate\u201d.","The thickness of the identical refractive index film varies with the refractive index of the rod-shaped material and cannot be uniquely specified, but it is of the order of 50 nm to 1 \u03bcm.","This identical refractive index film can be formed according to methods known in the art, for example vacuum film-forming methods such as the CVD method and PVD method, or thermal oxidation methods. As an example, when the substrate is a silicon substrate, it can be formed as an oxide film by heating this silicon substrate at 900\u00b0 C. to 1000\u00b0 C.","Among the substrates, those comprising a different refractive index film having a different refractive index from that of the film-like material on the surface are also preferred. In this case, as the substrate comprises a different refractive index film having a different refractive index from the film-like material on the surface, interference light having a sharp spectral curve can be radiated, and even if the wavelength change (wavelength shift) of this interference light is very small, it can be detected simply, reliably, rapidly and with high sensitivity, and accordingly, this provides an excellent circuit switching performance.","The different refractive index film may also have a different refractive index from that of the substrate and may comprise two or more films, and if there are two or more films, their respective different refractive indices may also be mutually different.","The different refractive index film is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose, but a dielectric film may for example be mentioned.","Materials for the dielectric film include, for example, TiO, CeO, TaO, ZrO, SbO, HfO, LaO, MgO, AlO, SiO, InO, ZnO, SnO, CdSnO, CdInO, ZnSnO, ZnSnO, MgInO, ZnInO, and InSnO, among which TiOand SiOare preferable.","The interference filter may be selected from among those known in the art, and commercial filters may also be used. In this case, a sharp interference light with a sharp spectral curve can be radiated, and even if the wavelength change (wavelength shift) of this interference light is very small, it can be detected simply, reliably, rapidly and with high sensitivity, which is advantageous. Also, the thickness of the film-like material further provided on this substrate can be made thin, and as a result, the optical interference unit can be manufactured easily and the optical switch can also be designed as a transmission type apparatus.","The interference filter may be a monochrome filter which extracts a narrow wavelength band (50 nm or less), or it may be a relatively wideband filter such as a dielectric multilayer film, MDM type (e.g., metal\/dielectric\/metal) or DMD type (e.g., dielectric multilayer film\/metal\/dielectric multilayer film). In these cases, the dielectric may be formed of an inorganic substance, or may be formed of an organic substance.","In the present invention, the interference filter may also comprise a different refractive index film of different refractive index from the refractive index of the film-like material, on the surface of the substrate.","Film-like Material","The film-like material is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose, for example it may be formed from the rod-shaped material.","The thickness of the film-like material may be suitably selected according to the wavelength of the interference light before and after wavelength change, the refractive index of the substrate, etc., but for example, it is preferably 50 nm to 1 \u03bcm.","In the present invention, one or more films may be provided on the surface of the film-like material. This film is not particularly limited and may be selected according to the purpose, but it is preferred that the film has a refractive index which is substantially equivalent to that of the refractive index of the substrate surface in contact with the film-like material. In this case, even an interference light having a sharp spectral curve can be radiated, and even if the wavelength change (wavelength shift) of this interference light is very small, it can be detected simply, reliably, rapidly and with high sensitivity, and this in turn provides an excellent circuit switching performance.","The film is not particularly limited, and may be selected according to the purpose. For example, a dielectric film is preferred.","The dielectric film may be formed on the surface of the film-like material according to, for example, a known process. Specifically, gold, silver, platinum, platinum\/palladium, or the like may be selected as materials for the dielectric film, and a thin layer of these materials may be formed by ion coater or the like on the surface of the film-like material. The material of the dielectric is not limited to the above, and may also be an oxide such as silicon oxide.","Rod-shaped Material","The rod material is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, for example a rod-shaped inorganic molecule or a rod-shaped organic molecule.","One of these may be used alone, or two or more may be used together. Among these, a rod-shaped organic molecule is preferred from the viewpoints that it easily interacts with the switching signal, molecular treatment is easy, formation of the film-like material is easy, and even if the surface quality of the undersurface of the film-like material is not smooth, the surface on the opposite side can easily be maintained smooth.","The rod-shaped organic molecule is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, e.g., a biopolymer or a polysaccharide.","Examples of the biopolymer are a fibrous protein, an \u03b1-helix polypeptide and a nucleic acid (DNA, RNA). Examples of this fibrous protein are those having an \u03b1-helix structure such as \u03b1-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomycin and silk fibroin.","The polysaccharide may for example be amylose or the like.","From the viewpoint of maintaining the stability rod-shape of the organic molecule, a helical molecule wherein the molecule has a helical structure is preferred. In this case, even if the surface quality (e.g., the surface quality of the substrate) of the undersurface of the film-like material is not smooth, the surface (upper surface) (surface on which light is incident from the optical irradiation unit) on the opposite side can easily be maintained smooth, and measurement errors of wavelength variation produced when the surface is not smooth, can be reduced, and this in turn provides an excellent circuit switching performance.","Among those mentioned above, the spiral molecule may be an \u03b1-helix polypeptide, DNA, amylose, etc.","\u03b1-Helix Polypeptide","The \u03b1-helix polypeptide is one of the secondary structures of a polypeptide. It is rotated once (forms one spiral) every 3.6 aminoacid residues, forms substantially parallel hydrogen bonds with the spiral axis between the imido group (\u2014NH\u2014) and carbonyl group (\u2014CO\u2014) every fourth aminoacid, and has a structure which is stable energywise due to the repetition of 7 aminoacids as one unit.","The direction of the helix of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may be right-handed or left-handed. Due to stability factors, only \u03b1-helix polypeptides having a right-handed helix are found in nature.","The aminoacid which forms the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and may be selected according to the purpose if it can form an \u03b1-helix structure. Aminoacids which can easily form this \u03b1-helix structure are preferred, examples of such aminoacids being aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), histidine (His), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), thyrosin (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe) and tryptophan (Trp). One of these may be used alone, or two or more may be used together.","By suitably selecting the aminoacid, the \u03b1-helix polypeptide can be designed to have hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity or amphiphilicity. If hydrophilicity is conferred, the aminoacid may for example be serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), asparagine (Asn) or glutamine (Gln). If hydrophibicity is to be conferred, the aminoacid may for example be phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), isoleucine (Ile), thyrosin (Tyr), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu) or valine (Val).","The aminoacid forming the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may for example be a L-amino acid or D-amino acid, or a derivative thereof wherein the side chains are modified.","In the \u03b1-helix polypeptide, by esterifying the carboxyl group in the amino acid which forms this \u03b1-helix which does not form a peptide linkage, hydrophobicity can be conferred by esterification, or hydrophilicity can be conferred by hydrolyzing this esterified carboxyl group.","The number of linkages (polymerization degree) of the aminoacid in the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, but it is preferably 10 to 5000.","If the number of linkages (polymerization degree) is less than 10, the polyaminoacid may not be able to form a stable \u03b1-helix, and if the number of linkages (polymerization degree) is more than 5000, it may become difficult to orient it in a perpendicular direction.","Examples of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide are polyglutamic acid derivatives such as poly(\u03b3-methyl-L-glutamate), poly(\u03b3-ethyl-L-glutamate), poly(\u03b3-benzyl-L-glutamate), poly(L-glutamine acid-\u03b3-benzyl) and poly (n-hexyl-L-glutamate), polyaspartic acid derivatives such as poly(\u03b2-benzyl-L-aspartate), poly(L-leucine), poly(L-alanine), poly(L-methionine), poly(L-phenylalanine), and poly(L-lysine)-poly(\u03b3-methyl-L-glutamate).","The \u03b1-helix polypeptide may be suitably be synthesized or prepared by a method known in the art, or the commercial product may be used.","As an example of the synthesis of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide, the block copolypeptide [poly(L-lysine)-poly(\u03b3-methyl-L-glutamate)] PLLZ-PMLGmay be synthesized as follows. The block copolypeptide [poly(L-lysine)-poly(\u03b3-methyl-L-glutamate)] PLLZ-PMLG, is synthesized by polymerizing N-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N-carboxylic acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) using n-hexylamine as initiator, and then polymerizing \u03b3-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxylic acid anhydride (MLG-NCA) as shown by the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"228.94mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US07076127-20060711-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The synthesis of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide is not limited to the above, and can also be achieved by genetic engineering. For example, a host cell is transformed by an expression vector incorporating DNA which codes for the polypeptide, and this transformant is then cultured.","Examples of this expression vector are a plasmid vector, a phage vector, or the chimera vector of a plasmid and phage.","Examples of the host cell are prokaryon microorganisms such as and , eukaryon microorganisms such as yeast fungus, and animal cells.","The \u03b1-helix polypeptide may also be prepared by cutting out the \u03b1-helix structure portion from natural fibrous proteins such as \u03b1-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomycin and silk fibroin.","DNA","The DNA may be single-stranded DNA, but from the viewpoint of stabilizing the rod shape, it is preferred that it is double-stranded DNA.","The double-stranded DNA has a double helix structure wherein two right-handed helical polynucleotide chains are positioned so that they extend in mutually opposite directions around one central axis.","The polynucleotide chain is formed by four kinds of nucleic acid bases, i.e., adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). In the polynucleotide chain, the nucleic acid bases mutually project inside a plane perpendicular to the central axis, forming the so-called Watson-Crick base pairs wherein thymine is specifically hydrogen-bonded to adenine, and cytosine is specifically hydrogen-bonded to guanine, respectively. As a result, in the double-stranded DNA, two polypeptide chains are joined together complementarily.","The DNA can be prepared by the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method, the LCR (Ligase Chain Reaction) method, the 3SR (Self-sustained Sequence Replication) method and the SDA (Strand Displacement Amplification) method known in the art, but among these, the PCR method is preferred.","The DNA may be directly cut out enzymatically with a restriction enzyme, prepared by a gene cloning method, or prepared by a chemosynthesis method.","In the case of the gene cloning method, the DNA can be prepared in large amounts by incorporating the product of amplifying a normal nucleic acid into a vector selected from a plasmid vector, a phage vector or the chimera vector of a plasmid and phage, and introducing it into an arbitrary host capable of multiplication selected from a prokaryon microorganism such as or , eukaryon microorganism such as yeast fungus, or animal cells.","The chemosynthesis method may be a liquid phase process such as the triester method and phosphorous acid method, or a solid phase synthetic process using an insoluble carrier. In the case of the chemosynthesis method, after preparing single-stranded DNA in large amount using an automatic synthesis machine known in the art, double-stranded DNA can be prepared by performing annealing.","Amylose","The amylose is a polysaccharide having a helical structure wherein D-glucose which forms starch, a homopolysaccharide for storing higher plants, is connected in a straight chain by \u03b1-1,4 bonds.","The molecular weight of the amylose is preferably of the order of from several thousands to about 150,000 in terms of number average molecular weight.","The amylose may be a commercial product, or may be suitably prepared according to a known method.","Part of the amylose may also contain amylopectin.","The length of the rod-shaped organic molecule is not particularly limited, and can be suitably selected according to the purpose.","The diameter of the rod-shaped organic molecule is not particularly limited, but in the case of the \u03b1-helix polypeptide, it is of the order of 0.8 nm to 2.0 nm.","The rod-shaped organic molecule may be completely lipophilic (hydrophobic), hydrophilic, or amphiphilic wherein part is lipophilic (hydrophobic) or hydrophilic, and the other part has the opposite affinity to this part.","The wavelength of the interference light due to the optical interference unit may or may not be in the visible light region. The former case is preferred as the wavelength of the interference light can be detected visually, and it is more preferred that the wavelength of the interference light is in the visible light region after wavelength change. In this case, this interference light can be observed as an interference color, the principle whereby this interference color is observed being based on so-called structural color formation.","Structural Color Formation","Reflection of the incident light as the colored interference light is a color formation (color of interference light) in which, when an external stimulus, such as an electric field, a magnetic field, heat, light (e.g., natural light, infrared light, ultraviolet light), or the like, is applied to the film, light of a specific wavelength is reflected in accordance with the thickness of the film and the refractive index thereof, on the basis of the multilayer thin-film interference theory which is the basic principle of color formation of the scaly powder of the wings of a Morpho butterfly. As a result, color formation (colored interference light) occurs at the surface of the film. In the structural color formation, a dye or pigment is unnecessary.","Hereinafter, the principles of light reflection of incident light as colored interference light will be explained.","As shown in , the wavelength (\u03bb) of the interference light due to this film-like material (or film-like material formed of the rod-shaped material  and oxide layer in the substrate ) when the film-like material (or film-like material formed of the rod-shaped material  and oxide layer in the substrate ), is irradiated by the optical irradiation unit, is emphasized under the conditions shown in the following mathematical formula (1), and enfeebled under the conditions shown in the following mathematical formula (2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"tl"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"n","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03b1"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"tl"},{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"m"},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","msqrt":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"n","mn":"2"},"mo":"-","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"sin","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u03b1"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}}},"In mathematical formula (1) and mathematical formula (2), \u03bb is the wavelength (nm) of interference light, \u03b1 is the incidence angle (\u00b0) of light on the film-like material (or film-like material formed of the rod-shaped organic molecules  and oxide layer in the substrate ), \u201ct\u201d is the thickness (nm) of the film-like material (or the film-like material and the oxide layer in the substrate), \u201c1\u201d is the number of the film-like materials (or film-like material and oxide layer in the substrate), \u201cn\u201d is the refractive index of the film-like material (or film-like material formed of the rod-shaped organic molecules  and oxide layer in the substrate ), and \u201cm\u201d is an integer equal to 1 or more.","The thickness of the film-like material (or film-like material formed of the rod-shaped organic molecules  and oxide layer in the substrate ), is preferably 810 nm or less, but more preferably 10 nm to 810 nm.","By suitably changing the thickness, the color (wavelength) of the structural color can be changed.","The film-like material may be a monomolecular film-like material of the rod material, or may be a laminated film-like material of this monomolecular film-like material.","The monomolecular film-like material or the laminated film-like material may be formed for example by a coating method known in the art, or Langmuir-Blodgett's technique (LB method).","In the former case, among the coating methods known in the art, spin coating is preferable for its ease of operation, and, when the film-like material is formed with a rod-shaped material, it is advantageous for its ability to form the film-like material efficiently by self-organization based on liquid crystallinity of the rod-shaped material or by self-organization based on interaction between a terminal functional group of the rod-shaped material and the substrate.","In the latter case, an LB film-forming apparatus known in the art (e.g., NL-LB400 NK-MWC, Japan Laser & Electronics Laboratories) can be used.","The monomolecular film-like material can be formed on the substrate  using an extrusion member , for example in the state where lipophilic (hydrophobic) or amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules are floating on a water surface (aqueous phase), or the state where hydrophilic or amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules are floating on an oil surface (oil phase), i.e., a state wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules  are oriented as shown in . By repeating this operation, a laminated film comprising a desired number of monomolecular films can be formed on the substrate .","At this time, it is preferred to give the surface of the substrate  a surface treatment such as hydrophilic treatment and lipophilic treatment for the purpose of making the rod-shaped organic molecules  adhere or bond, for example if the rod-shaped organic molecule  (e.g., an \u03b1-helix polypeptide) is hydrophilic, it is preferred to first perform a surface treatment beforehand, such as hydrophilization treatment using octadecyl trimethylsiloxane or the like. When the surface of the substrate  is treated to be hydrophilic, the rod-shaped organic molecules  can be arranged vertically on the substrate , and when the surface of the substrate  is treated to be hydrophobic, the rod-shaped organic molecules  can be arranged horizontally on the substrate . The hydrophilic treatment and lipophilic treatment are performed using, for example, a coupling agent.","When the monomolecular film of amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules  is formed, the state wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules  float on the oil phase or aqueous phase is such that the lipophilic parts (hydrophobic parts) are oriented adjacent to each other, and the hydrophilic parts are oriented adjacent to each other in the rod-shaped organic molecules  on the aqueous phase or oil phase, as shown in .","Described above is an example of a monomolecular film wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules are oriented in the plane direction of the monomolecular film (laid horizontally) or a laminated film comprising monomolecular films. A monomolecular film wherein the rod-shaped organic molecules are oriented in the thickness direction of the monomolecular film (standing state) can for example be formed as described below. Specifically, as shown in  and B, first, the pH of the water (aqueous phase) is adjusted to an alkalinity of about 12 with the amphiphilic rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide) floating on the water surface (aqueous phase). As a result, the hydrophilic parts of the rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide) lose the \u03b1-helix structure and take up a random configuration. At this time, the lipophilic parts (hydrophobic parts) of the rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide) retain their \u03b1-helix structure. Next, the pH of the water (aqueous phase) is adjusted to an acidity of about 5. As a result, the hydrophilic parts of the rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide) again take up an \u03b1-helix structure. At this time, when a pressure member  brought into contact with the rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide), the pressure member  presses the rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide) by air pressure from the side in the direction indicated by the arrows in , and the rod-shaped organic molecules  remain standing on the water (aqueous phase) and the hydrophilic parts become oriented effectively perpendicular to the water surface in the aqueous phase to take up an \u03b1-helix structure. Hence, as described above referring to , a monomolecular film can be formed on a substrate  by extruding on the substrate  using a pressure member  with the rod-shaped organic molecules  (\u03b1-helix polypeptide) aligned in an orderly manner. By repeating this operation, a laminated film comprising a desired number of monomolecular films can be formed on the substrate .","Signal Interaction Part","In the present invention, it is preferred that the rod-shaped material comprises a signal interaction part which is capable of interaction with the switching signal.

Another is a small, weak peak at 1626 cmdue to an amide group I in the \u03b2-structure. The last one is a peak at 1551 cmdue to an amide group II in the \u03b1-helix structure. From the measurement results of this FT-IR spectrum, it was confirmed that the above-mentioned PHeLG molecule maintains an \u03b1-helical structure in the monomolecular film.","Regarding the monomolecular film due to PHeLG, as the thickness when there were 20 monomolecular film layers due to this PHeLG was 32 nm, the thickness per layer was computed to be 1.6 nm.","Next, when the relation between the number of laminated layers and structural coloration in the laminated film (film-like material) due to this monomolecular film was examined, it was found that when this laminated film contained 60 layers, 70 layers and 80 layers of these monomolecular films, the visible light reflection spectra shown in  were obtained. Also, a laminated film (film-like material) containing 40 to 50 layers of these monomolecular films showed a brown coloration, a laminated film (film-like material) containing 60 to 70 layers of these monomolecular films showed a dark blue (deep blue) coloration, a laminated film (film-like material) containing 80 to 100 layers of these monomolecular films showed a light blue (thin blue) coloration, a laminated film (film-like material) containing nearly 120 layers of these monomolecular films showed a yellow coloration, and a laminated film (film-like material) containing up to 160 layers of these monomolecular films showed a purplish red coloration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0214","num":"0213"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"The wavelength (\u03bb) of the visible light reflection spectrum is affected by the incidence angle (\u03b1) of the light on the laminated film (film-like material) due to the monomolecular film.
