{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field of the invention relates generally to data processing and digital processing systems. More specifically, the invention is related to inbound transferring of financial data within a complex computer system environment that includes a number of computer applications.","Virtually every successful business enterprise implements various computer applications to automate different business processes. For example, an enterprise automates the processing of purchase orders with the help of so called logistics computer application. The same enterprise could use a supply chain management application to organize and optimize the production of goods and services. Many large enterprises have subsidiaries or branches in different locations, sometimes in different countries. Such enterprises usually have complex computer system environments that include separate or autonomous sets of computer applications at each location for automating the respective business processes. The sets of different computer applications running at the different locations (or subsidiary companies, or branches) could be integrated in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Very often, some of the computer applications in such a set are legacy programs developed by different vendors.","In every business enterprise or legal entity, financial documents are attached to virtually all activities that involve resource management. For example, processing of sales orders in a logistic system of a company is accompanied by crediting revenue accounts and debiting account receivables in the company general ledger; transfer of goods from suppliers to consumers is accompanied by debiting material stock accounts and crediting special reconciliation accounts; employees payroll is accompanied with debiting expense accounts and crediting liability accounts; etc. Typically, the application that automates an action creates a corresponding business transaction and produces the accounting document that accompanies this action, e.g., a logistic system produces the necessary accounting documents for each purchase order. The different autonomous applications running in an enterprise produce accounting documents or accounting entries that are incorporated in a number of financial documents and are posted to the general ledger of the enterprise. In general, such enterprise employs a central financial system to receive and post financial documents produced by the sets of applications at the different locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","115","110","110","120"]},"Chart of accounts  stores a full list of general ledger (GL) accounts. The GL accounts are used in the accounting entries that are generated for each of the transactions performed in logistics application . To generate an accounting entry, logistics application  needs additional financial configurations and customizations. These additional data reflect company and statutory requirements, and are stored in module other finance configuration . Logistics application  utilizes financial logic  to generate the necessary accounting entries based on the data from logistics transaction data , chart of accounts  and other finance configuration . The generated accounting entries for the transactions or actions executed in logistics application  are included in financial documents . Financial documents  contain the relevant general ledger accounts from chart of accounts  and are locally stored in local GL  by logistics application  for different purposes, e.g., auditing, reporting, settlement, etc.","Logistics application  and the other applications in the same or different locations with similar accounting capabilities, if any, replicate financial documents  to accounting application . Replicated documents  are centrally posted in central GL . Central GL  stores a full record of the performed transactions by the applications running in the enterprise. Logistics application , as well as any other business application with accounting capabilities running in computer system , utilizes inbound interface  to replicate financial documents  to accounting application .","The financial configuration master data, necessary for generating accounting entries by logistics application , and by the rest of the business applications running in computer system , is stored in accounting application . This master data includes chart of GL accounts , and configuration data (not illustrated in ). Accounting application  utilizes interface  to replicate chart of GL accounts  to logistics application .","Generally, the master data is frequently changed due to various reasons, including organizational changes, changes in the business practices, statutory changes, etc. In a system environment, where a set of autonomous applications generate accounting entries and replicate them to a accounting application, financial configuration master data have to be replicated or distributed consistently among a number of different business applications. Often, the business applications are even developed by different vendors. Additionally, the changes to the master data usually require changes in the local configuration and customization in the different business applications. The accounting functionality integrated in the various business applications of an enterprise is not directly related with their main purpose and functions\u2014to automate various business processes.","The financial governance of the different business applications, characterized with frequent need for ensuring consistent transfer of financial data, and the related re-configuration and re-customization of the accounting functionality, could be a tedious task for the administrative staff. Such financial governance consumes substantial resources, and generates a potential for errors in accounting entries with unpredictable consequences. Furthermore, different business applications have to implement similar accounting functionality and to use the same inbound and outbound interfaces to generate coherent accounting statements. This is difficult even when all applications running in an enterprise environment are developed by one and the same vendor. When different vendors are involved in the process, the resource consumption and the risk of errors and inconsistency could be much higher.","Systems and methods for using account symbols instead of general ledger accounts in the accounting documents generated by the business applications running in an enterprise environment are described. A correspondence between account symbols and general ledger accounts is defined and stored in a memory of a computer system. A business application generates accounting entries where account symbols are included instead of general ledger accounts. The generated account entries are received as messages at an accounting application through an inbound interface. The account symbols in the accounting entries are replaced with corresponding general ledger accounts at the receiving accounting application. Financial documents are generated at the receiving application based on the accounting entries. The financial documents are posted to the general ledger of the enterprise.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for \u2018Using Account Symbols instead of General Ledger Accounts in the Transaction Messages of the Business Applications of an Enterprise\u2019 are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In a typical enterprise computer system environment one or more enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are employed. Every ERP system automates various business processes of an organizational entity of the enterprise by running a number of business applications, e.g., logistics application, supply change management, human capital management, etc. In addition to automating business processes, the business applications generate accounting entries corresponding to the transactions of these processes. The accounting entries are transferred from the business applications of the ERP systems to a central financial system that runs accounting application. The accounting application generates detailed financial documents complying with various statutory and enterprise accounting requirements, and post the documents in enterprise general ledger (GL).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","210","215","100","210","200","210","210","110","210","225","225"]},"Logistics transaction data  stores information about the tasks or transactions performed in logistics application . The performed transactions correspond to actions or events of various business processes. For each such transaction, logistics application  generates accounting entry  according to implemented financial logic . Appropriate account symbols , based on the types of the transactions, are used in the generated accounting entries . Computer system  concentrates the main financial logic of accounting application  illustrated with block . Therefore, accounting entries  are not complete financial documents compared to financial documents  in . According to one embodiment of the invention, logistics application  does not create full featured financial documents, but only a kind of notification accounting entries. In these notifications account symbols are used to differentiate cost and revenue elements, e.g., stock accounts, etc., contained in the logistics transaction.","Accounting entries  are transferred to accounting application  using inbound interface , according to one embodiment of the invention. Interface  could be invoked by logistics application  directly. Alternatively, the functionality of inbound interface  could be triggered by receiving asynchronous messages at accounting application  containing accounting entries . Inbound interface  of accounting application  substitutes the account symbols with the corresponding GL accounts. Alternatively, account symbols in accounting entries  could be replaced with the corresponding GL account numbers by financial logic . Simplified accounting entries  are transformed by financial logic  to full featured financial documents  that are posted to enterprise central general ledger .","The correspondence between account symbols and GL account numbers is preserved in mapping table  that defines a relation between chart of GL accounts  and list of account symbols . According to one embodiment of the invention, the relation provided by mapping table  is one-to-one. Alternatively, one-to-many or many-to-many relations could be used instead. Different lists of account symbols  could be used by different business applications.","Account symbols  are distributed or replicated to logistics application  through interface . In different embodiments of the invention, interface  could be outbound interface of accounting application  or inbound interface of logistics application . When a change to chart of GL accounts  is required, the relevant updates are limited to accounting application  involving chart of GL accounts  and mapping table . Very rarely, changes to account symbols  are necessary. However, in order to have some potential for changing the assignments due to valuation or classification election changes, interface  could transfer not only account symbols , but also one or more major logistic classifications to logistics application . Respectively, interface  transfers basic configuration data for financial logic  in one embodiment of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","200","300","315","310","320","330","310","320","300","300"]},"According to one embodiment of the invention, business applications  and  could be of different types, e.g., automating different types of business processes, like for example, supply chain management application and logistics application. Business applications  and  could be developed by different vendors and integrated by a middleware layer or by utilizing standard interfaces (not illustrated). Further, business applications  and  could be developed by one and a same vendor, using similar interfaces. Furthermore, business applications  and  could be modules of a same enterprise resource planning application. Regardless of the concrete implementation, business applications  and  have similar modules and functionality for generating account records corresponding to the performed business transactions. Business applications  and  store lists of account symbols  and , respectively. Account symbols  and  are used by financial logic  and  to generate accounting entries  and  corresponding to the executed business transactions.","Business applications  and  communicate accounting entries  and , respectively, to accounting application  through network . Accounting application  provides interface  to receive accounting entries  and . According to one embodiment of the invention, financial logic  is stored as computer program instructions in random access memory (RAM)  for producing financial documents. Processor  executes instructions of interface  and financial logic  to receive accounting entries  and ; to replace the account symbols  and  in accounting entries  and  with GL accounts according to mapping table ; to generate full featured financial documents ; and to post financial documents  to enterprise general ledger .","According to one embodiment of the invention, storage  provides means for storing any of the following: chart of GL accounts ; list or lists of account symbols ; mapping table  defining relation or correspondence between chart of GL accounts , and list or lists of account symbols ; full featured financial documents ; and enterprise general ledger . Storage  could be implemented as a relational database. In another embodiment of the invention, storage  could be an autonomous computer system outside accounting application  within enterprise computer system . In another embodiment of the invention, some of the enlisted elements could be persisted instead in a computer file system as one or more flat files, or files with various structure, e.g., extensible markup language (XML) files.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","405","410"]},"Account symbols correspond to real account numbers, i.e., to general ledger accounts. The real account numbers may be defined within an enterprise based on internal principles, statutory requirements, etc.; or may be statutorily defined. An enterprise is obligated to generate and keep financial documents including detailed accounting records for every business transaction. The accounting records debit and credit different GL accounts. The various business applications of an enterprise execute business transactions and provide accounting data for generating the corresponding financial documents. In order to optimize the accounting recording, business applications produce simplified accounting entries corresponding to the business transaction that include account symbols instead of GL account numbers. For example, instead of keeping a full chart of GL accounts and spend resources to maintain a complex financial logic in a business application, a short list of account symbols applicable for the pertinent business could be used. The simplified accounting entries provide minimum information that is necessary to generate detailed financial document with real GL account numbers corresponding to the business transactions. The different business applications running in an enterprise may use different sets of account symbols.","Once generated, account entries are sent to an accounting application at . Business applications send messages or notifications containing the accounting entries corresponding to the performed business transactions or tasks. The accounting application provides complete accounting functionality to generate the detailed full featured financial documents for the general ledger of the enterprise. At , an inbound interface of the accounting application is invoked to handle the accounting entries received from the business applications. According to one embodiment of the invention, the interface is triggered within the accounting application by the incoming messages. Alternatively, call methods for the inbound interface could be provided directly to the business applications. Once invoked, inbound interface processes the received accounting entries.","At , the processing of the received accounting entries continues with replacing the account symbols with the relevant GL account numbers. The account symbols are substituted with account numbers based on a predefined correspondence. In one embodiment, the replacement could be based on defined correspondence, and on the type of the business transactions corresponding to the received accounting entries. The logic for the replacement of the account symbols with GL accounts could be integrated within the inbound interface. Alternatively, this functionality could be a part of the financial logic implemented in the accounting application.","After replacing the account symbols with GL account numbers, and based on the information in the received account entries, accounting application generates detailed financial documents for the business transactions at . The detailed financial documents contain all statutory features necessary to record the business transactions in the enterprise. At , the complete financial documents are posted to the enterprise general ledger by the accounting application.","Computer systems  and  as shown in  and , respectively, and process  as shown in  illustrate how the governance of the financial recording in an enterprise is improved by concentrating the financial logic in a single centralized accounting application or financial system. Thus, communication between business applications and the accounting application is simplified and easier to maintain. The frequent small statutory or organizational updates to the financial logic take place in the accounting application. Therefore, the support of the accounting functionality in the business applications is limited to few basic tasks. These tasks may include an initial setup of the accounting functionality, and occasional re-setup in case of larger updates of the financial logic, or the correspondence between account symbols and GL accounts. By following the described approach, the owners of the business applications and accounting application in the enterprise are more independent and autonomous.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","505"]},"At , the defined correspondence between the GL accounts and the account symbols is stored as a mapping table in the memory of a computer system accessed by the accounting application. The mapping table could be an electronic file with flat structure, or a file with a structure organized in a particular pattern, e.g., extensible markup language (XML) file. In one embodiment of the invention, the mapping table could be stored as a table, or combination of tables, in a database. Similar to the mapping table, the chart of GL accounts and the list of account symbols are also stored in the memory of a computer system.","At , the defined account symbols are distributed or replicated from the accounting application to one or more business applications executed in the enterprise. One and the same list of account symbols is distributed to the different business applications, according to one embodiment of the invention. Alternatively, different lists of account symbols are distributed to different business applications. Process  continues at  with initial configuration and customization of the financial logic implemented in each business application running in the enterprise. This initial setup allows business applications to generate accounting entries for the possible business transactions using the replicated account symbols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"At , a requirement for change in the financial configuration of accounting application is received. The requirement for change may involve an update of the chart of GL accounts, an update of the financial configuration and customization of the financial logic, etc. The impact of the changes over the financial configuration of the enterprise is analyzed at . The analysis shows the scope of the change, the involved modules that implement the accounting functionality in the centralized accounting application and in the business applications employed in the enterprise. The required change could be limited to chart of accounts stored in the accounting application, or could involve reconfiguration of the entire accounting mechanism in the accounting applications and in the business applications.","At , the required changes or the accounting mechanisms are accomplished to the accounting application. The necessary updates to the chart of GL accounts are implemented, and the financial logic is re-configured, when necessary. At , the scope of the required change is checked to determine whether re-assignment of the account symbols to the GL accounts is involved. In other words, whether the correspondence between the GL account numbers and the account symbols is altered in such a way, that an update to the account symbols replicated to one or more of the employed business applications have been made. If there is a change in the account symbols assigned to GL accounts at the accounting application, the changed account symbols are distributed to the employed business applications at .","At , the scope of the required change is checked to determine whether re-configuration of the financial logic implemented in the employed business applications for generating accounting entries corresponding to the executed transactions is involved. In case such change is required, the financial logic or set up at the business applications is re-configured and re-customized accordingly at . Additionally, the financial logic in the business applications may require re-configuration or re-customization in order to use the appropriate account symbols that have been updated in response to the required changes.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable medium as instructions.
