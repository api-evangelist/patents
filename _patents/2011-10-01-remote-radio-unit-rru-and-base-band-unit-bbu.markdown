{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example Embodiments"],"p":["Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base transceiver station (BTS) and a wireless mobile device. Some wireless devices communicate using an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) digital modulation scheme via a physical layer. OFDM standards and protocols can include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi. In 3GPP radio access networks (RANs) in LTE systems, the BTS can be a combination of evolved Node Bs (also commonly denoted as enhanced Node Bs, eNodeBs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), which communicates with the wireless mobile device, known as a user equipment (UE). A downlink (DL) transmission can be a communication from the BTS (or eNodeB) to the wireless mobile device (or UE), and an uplink (UL) transmission can be a communication from the wireless mobile device to the BTS.","In a centralized, cooperative, or cloud radio access network (C-RAN), the base transceiver station (or eNodeB) functionality can be subdivided between a base band unit (BBU) processing pool and a remote radio unit (RRU) or a remote radio head (RRH) with optical fiber connecting the BBU to the RRU. A common public radio interface (CPRI) can be used to define an interface between the BBU and the RRU.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence. As used herein, the terms a RRU and a RRH are considered to be interchangeable. As used herein, the terms BTS and eNodeB are considered to be interchangeable, where the eNodeB is the BTS in the LTE RAN.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In a C-RAN, the functionality of the BTS (or eNodeB) can be split between a BBU  and an RRU  (or RRH), as illustrated in . For example, the BBU can provide the radio functions of the digital baseband domain, and the RRU can provide the analog radio frequency functions. The BBU and the RRU can communicate with each other via a physical transport network, such as an optical transport network. The physical transport network between the RRUs and BBUs can act as a bottleneck on a C-RAN with heavy mobile internet traffic. The fiber of the physical transport network between the RRUs and BBUs may carry a large amount of baseband sampling data in real time. A C-RAN re-architecture can be used to reduce the data rate by reducing the digital processing at the BBU, which can reduce the baseband sampling data transmitted over the physical transport network. In the C-RAN re-architecture, part of the baseband processing can be moved to the RRU to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the physical transport network. For example, a cyclic prefix (CP) can be moved from the BBU to the RRU, thus reducing the data rate in the physical transport network. Several examples are provided showing different C-RAN architectures that can be used to reduce the amount of data transmitted between an RRU and a BBU.","A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system, communication layers can include the physical (PHY), media access control (MAC), radio link control (RLC), packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), and radio resource control (RRC) layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system, as illustrated in  for a downlink channel processing and B for an uplink channel processing.","In downlink channel processing, a base transceiver station (BTS) can include media access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layer processing elements, such as a MAC layer processor, a channel coder, a channel interleaver, a channel modulator, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processor, a transmit power controller, a frame and slot signal generator, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modulator, a cyclic prefix (CP) adder, a channel filter, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), an up converter, a gain controller, a carrier multiplexer, a power amplifier and limiter a radio frequency (RF) filter, and one or more transmit antennas. The terms \u201cBTS\u201d and \u201ceNodeB\u201d are used interchangeably throughout.","The functionality of the BTS (or eNodeB) can be split between a BBU  and RRU  (or RRH), as illustrated in . For example, the BBU can provide the radio functions of the digital baseband domain, and the RRU can provide the analog radio frequency functions. In the common public radio interface (CPRI) standard, the BBU can provide similar functionality to a radio element controller (REC) and the RRU can provide similar functionality to a radio element (RE). The BBU can provide radio base station control and management . In another example, the BBU can include backhaul transport  processing; MAC layer  processing; channel coding, interleaving, and modulation ; MIMO processing ; transmit power control of each physical channel ; frame and slot signal generation ; IFFT  modulation; and adding CP . The RRU can include channel filtering , digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion , up conversion , on\/off control of each carrier , carrier multiplexing , power amplification and limiting , and RF filtering .","In uplink channel processing, the BTS can include MAC and PHY layer processing elements, such as one or more receive antennas, an RF filter, a low noise amplifier, a carrier de-multiplexer, an automatic gain controller, a down converter, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a CP remover, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) demodulator, a transmit power control and feedback information detector, a signal distribution and signal processor, a MIMO detector, a channel de-modulator, a channel de-interleaver, a channel decoder, and a MAC layer processor. The functionality of the BTS (or eNodeB) can be split between a BBU  and an RRU  (or RRH), as illustrated in . For example, the RRU can include RF filtering , low noise amplification , carrier de-multiplexing , automatic gain control (AGC) , down conversion , digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion , and channel filtering . The BBU can include CP removal ; FFT  demodulation; transmit power control and feedback information detection ; signal distribution to signal processing units ; MIMO detection ; channel decoding, de-interleaving, and de-modulation ; MAC layer  processing; and backhaul transport  processing.","One way of reducing the amount of data transported between an RRU and a BBU is by moving the location where a CP module functions from the BBU to the RRU.  provide examples for downlink channel processing and uplink channel processing, respectively.","In a downlink channel processing example, a CP module including the CP adder  can be located in the RRU , as illustrated in . The RRU can be configured to communicate with the BBU  via a physical communication link, such as a fiber optic cable in an optical transport network, using a general interface (or shared interface) between the RRU and BBU, such as the CPRI. The RRU can be configured to communicate with a wireless mobile device via an air interface using a wireless standard, such as 3GPP LTE or WiMAX. The BBU can be configured for MAC layer processing, transport layer processing, and\/or logical layer processing. The general interface (e.g., CPRI) can provide an interface between the CP adder in the CP module in the RRU and an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modulator  in a modulating module in the BBU.","In an uplink channel processing example, the CP module including the CP remover  can be located in the RRU , as illustrated in . The general interface (e.g., CPRI) can provide an interface between an output of the CP remover in the CP module in the RRU and an input of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) demodulator  in the modulating module in the BBU .","The RRU and BBU of a RAN can be included in a centralized, cooperative, or cloud radio access network (C-RAN). The purpose and components of a C-RAN are briefly reviewed. Additional examples for C-RAN re-architecture are provided following the CRAN review.","The proliferation of the mobile broadband internet has increased the mobile internet traffic and the load on the BTS and the core network in the RAN. A typical RAN architecture can include a BTS which connects to a fixed number of sector antennas that can cover a small area and that can handle transmission\/reception signals in the sector coverage area. In addition, the typical RAN can be limited by interference, so improving spectrum capacity can be limited.","C-RAN can provide centralized processing, co-operative radio, and real-time cloud infrastructure RAN. Centralized signal processing can greatly reduce the number of site equipment rooms needed to cover the same area as a traditional RAN. Co-operative radio with distributed antenna equipped by a remote radio unit (RRU) can provide higher spectrum efficiency than the traditional RAN. A real-time cloud infrastructure based on an open platform and BTS virtualization can enable processing power aggregation and dynamic allocation, which can reduce the power consumption and increase infrastructure utilization rate. C-RAN can provide reduced cost and lower energy consumption, higher spectral efficiency, support multiple standards and smooth evolution, and better internet services to end users.","A typical characteristic of a mobile network is that mobile devices frequently move from one place to another. The movement of mobile devices can have a time-geometry trend. During work hours, a large number of mobile devices move from residential areas to central office areas and industrial areas for work. During evening hours or non-work hours, mobile devices move back to the residential areas (e.g., homes) or entertainment areas. Thus, the network load moves in the mobile network with a similar pattern.","More specifically, each BTS's processing capability may be used by the active mobile devices within the BTS's cell range. When mobile devices move outside the BTS's cell range, the BTS can remain idle with a large portion of the BTS's processing power wasted. In a macro view of the mobile network, the BTSs in residential areas or entertainment areas may be largely idle during work hours, and the BTSs in central office areas and industrial areas may be largely idle during non-work hours. The C-RAN architecture can allow BTS processing to be utilized in both the residential and\/or entertainment areas and the central office and\/or industrial areas during both work hours and non-work hours, thus balancing the network load and reducing the idle time of BTS processors and increasing the coverage area of the BTS.","As illustrated in , the C-RAN can be composed of three parts: a remote radio pool  equipped by remote radio units (RRUs) A-I with antennas, a base band processing pool  including base-band units (BBUs) A-C, and a fiber or cable A-D and G in a physical transport network  connecting at least one of the RRUs in the remote radio pool to at least one of the BBUs in the base band pool. The base band processing pool can be centralized. Each BBU can include a high-performance general purpose processor, a real-time virtualization processor, and\/or a physical (PHY) layer processor and\/or a MAC layer processor A-F. The BBUs can be coupled to a load balancer and switch A-B via electrical or optical cabling C. The physical transport network can be a low-latency transport network, a bandwidth-efficient network, and\/or an optical transport network  using optical fiber or optical cabling. In another example, the physical transport network can be a high speed electrical transport network. The physical transport network can provide a physical communication link between the BBU and the RRU. The physical communication link can include an optical fiber link or a wired electrical link. The physical communication link can use the CPRI. In the CPRI standard, the BBU can be referred to as a radio element controller (REC). The RRU can be referred to as a remote radio head (RRH), a remote radio equipment (RRE), or a radio equipment (RE). Each RRU can be separated from the BBU by a selected distance. For example, each RRU may be separated from a BBU by at least 50 meters. However, the actual design and layout can depend on system specifications. The actual distance of each RRU may be greater than or less than 50 meters. Each RRU can include a sector, cell, or coverage area E for a mobile device, such as a user equipment (UE) A-J, where the mobile device may be located within multiple sectors, cells, or coverage areas. The distributed RRUs of the C-RAN can provide a RAN with high capacity and a wide coverage area.","RRUs A-I can be smaller, easier to install, easier to maintain, and consume less power than the BBUs A-C. The base band processing pool  can aggregate the processing power of the BBU through real-time virtualization technology and provide the signal processing capacity to the virtual BTSs or RRUs in the pool. The physical transport network can distribute the processed signals to the RRUs in the remote radio pool . The centralized BBU pool can reduce the number of BTS rooms used for BBUs and can make resource aggregation and large-scale cooperative radio transmission\/reception possible. A BTS room can be an equipment room used to house BBUs of the BBU pool and other BTS processing equipment.","A physical communication link can use the CPRI. A radio element controller (REC) can contain the radio functions of the digital baseband domain, and a radio element (RE) can contain the analog radio frequency functions. The functional split between both parts can be performed so that a generic interface based on In-Phase and Quadrature-Phase (IQ or I\/Q) data can be defined. CPRI can be used to transmit IQ samples between the REC (or BBU) and the RE (or RRU). For WiMAX, the REC can provide access to network entities (e.g. other BSs or access services network gateway (ASN-GW)), and the RE can serve as the air interface to a subscriber station (SS) and\/or a mobile subscriber station (MSS). For evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) network, UTRAN, or evolved UTRAN (eUTRAN) used in 3GPP LTE, the REC can provide access to the evolved packet core (EPC) for the transport of user plane and control plane traffic via an S1 interface, and the RE can serve as the air interface to the UE.","The physical transport network  can act as a bottleneck on a C-RAN with heavy mobile internet traffic. The fiber of the physical transport network between the RRUs and BBUs may carry a large amount of baseband sampling data in real time. For example, in a 20 megahertz (MHz) frequency-division duplexing (FDD) four antennas deployment, with 16 bit per I\/Q sample respectively and 8B\/10B line coding, the rate on a fiber (or fiber link rate) is 4\u00d716\u00d72\u00d710\/8\u00d730.72M=4.915 Gigabits per sample (Gbps) (4 antennas\u00d716 bit per I\/Q sample\u00d72 bits per I\/Q data\u00d710\/8 bits for line coding\u00d730.72 megabits (Mb) per sample for an LTE sampling rate). The fiber link rate (also referred to as the CPRI rate when CPRI is used) can be the data rate on a fiber or cable of the physical transport network. Support of more advanced feature such as carrier aggregation or more antennas (e.g., eight antennas) can dramatically increase the data rate on the physical transport network. The high data rates between the REC and the RE to carry the baseband sampling data in real time can reduce the cost effectiveness of the CRAN architecture.","Three different approaches can be used to handle the high data rate of the physical transport network. In a first approach, data compression techniques such as reducing number of bits\/sample or non-linear quantization can be used, which can reduce performance (using simple quantization) or increase complexity. Second, the fiber network can be upgraded to provide wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which can increase the cost of the physical transport network and the C-RAN. Third, a C-RAN re-architecture can dramatically reduce the data rate by reducing the digital processing at the BBU and\/or the amount of baseband sampling data transmitted over the physical transport network. In the C-RAN re-architecture, part of the baseband processing can be moved to the RRU to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the physical transport network.","As previously discussed in a downlink (DL) channel processing example shown in , the CP module including the CP adder  can be located in the RRU . The RRU can be configured to communicate with the BBU  via a physical communication link using a general interface between the RRU and BBU, such as the CPRI. The RRU can be configured to communicate with a wireless mobile device via an air interface using a wireless standard, such as 3GPP LTE or WiMAX. The BBU can be configured for MAC layer processing, transport layer processing, and\/or logical layer processing. The general interface (e.g., CPRI) can provide an interface between the CP adder in the CP module in the RRU and an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modulator  in a modulating module in the BBU.","As previously discussed in an uplink (UL) channel processing example shown in , the CP module including a CP remover  can be located in the RRU . The general interface (e.g., CPRI) can provide an interface between the CP remover in the CP module in the RRU and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) demodulator  in the modulating module in the BBU. Moving the CP module, which includes the add CP operation and the remove CP operation, from the RRU to the BBU () can reduce a fiber link rate for the CPRI rate) by approximately 7% over the configurations of , with minimal performance complexity at the RRU. A random access channel (RACH) processing module may be used for uplink channel processing when the CP remover is located within the RRU. A physical random access channel (PRACH) or a random access channel (RACH) can be used for initial access by the UE to the RAN and when the UE losses its uplink synchronization.","In another example, a modulating module can be located in the RRU  along with the CF module. The modulating module can include an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modulator for DL channel processing, or a fast Fourier transform (FFT) demodulator for UL channel processing. In the DL channel processing, IFFT  and add CP  can be moved to and be performed in the RRU, as shown in . In the UL channel processing, the FFT , remove CP , and the digital signal processing for PRACH channel  can be moved to and performed in the RRU, as shown in . Locating the modulating module and the CP module in the RRU can still maintain minimal signal processing at the RRU, so RRU power consumption and\/or maintenance cost can be kept low. In addition, an approximately 45% reduction in the fiber link rate can be generated using the configurations illustrated in  over the configurations illustrated in .","In another example illustrated in  for, a DL frame and signal slot generation  operation is moved from the BBU  to the RRU , and thus a frame and signal slot generation module can be located in the RRU. The fiber link rate can be reduced by approximately 53% in a DL transmission using the configuration illustrated in  over the configuration illustrated in . For an UL transmission, the configuration illustrated in FIG. B can be used.","In another example illustrated in , a MIMO processing  operation for a DL transmission and a MIMO detection  operation for a UL transmission can be moved from the BBU  to the RRU . The RRU  can include a frame and slot signal generation  module for DL channel processing, a signal distribution and signal processing unit  module for UL channel processing, a transmit power control module, and a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) module. The transmit power control module can provide power control for each physical channel  for downlink channel processing or transmit power control and\/or feedback information detection  for uplink channel processing. The MIMO module can provide MIMO processing for DL channel processing or MIMO detection for UL channel processing.","The configurations illustrated in  can reduce the fiber link rate when the number of antennas is more than the number of data streams. For example, when the RRU has four transmit\/receive antennas, two DL transmission streams, and one UL transmission stream, the DL transmission can have an approximately 50% reduction in the fiber link rate and the UL transmission can have an approximately 75% reduction in the fiber link rate relative to the configurations illustrated in . With the configuration illustrated in , some cooperative MIMO schemes, such as UL joint processing, can be limited.","In another example shown in , a channel coding, interleaving, and modulation  operation for a DL transmission and a channel decoding, de-interleaving, and de-modulation  operation for a UL transmission can be moved from the BBU  to the RRU . A channel coding module, a channel interleaving module, and a channel modulation module can be included in the RRU. The channel coding module can include a channel coder for DL channel processing or a channel decoder for UL channel processing. The channel interleaving module can include a channel interleaver for DL channel processing or a channel de-interleaver for UL channel processing. The channel modulation module can include a channel modulator for DL channel processing or a channel de-modulator for UL channel processing. The configuration illustrated in  can partition the processing based on MAC\/PHY processing, where the RRU performs PHY layer processing and the BBU performs MAC layer processing. The configuration illustrated in  can reduce the fiber link rate by more than 90% relative to the configurations illustrated in . Moving most of the PHY layer processing to the RRU can increase the power consumption and complexity of the RRU.","The configurations illustrated in , B, and A-B provide re-partitions of the digital signal processing between BBU and RRU, which can reduce the data rate on the fiber transmission, and balance the processing that is performed at the BBU and the RRU. The C-RAN re-architecture can reduce signaling between the RRU and the BBU and enable BBU visualization using cloud based servers.","As illustrated in  and A-B, the RRU can also include a channel filtering  module for DL channel processing, a digital-analog conversion module, a frequency conversion module, a gain, control module, a carrier multiplexing module, an amplification module, and a filtering module. The digital-analog conversion module can include a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)  for downlink channel processing or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)  for uplink channel processing. The conversion module can include an up converter  for downlink channel processing or a down converter  for uplink channel processing. The gain control module can include an on\/off controller for each carrier  for downlink channel processing or an automatic gain controller (AGC)  for uplink channel processing. The carrier multiplexing  module can include a carrier multiplexer for downlink channel processing or a carrier de-multiplexer  for uplink channel processing. The amplification module can include a power amplifier and limiter  for downlink channel processing or a low noise amplifier  for uplink channel processing. The filtering module can include a radio frequency filter  or .","Another example provides a method  for downlink channel processing on a remote radio unit (RRU) in a radio access network (RAN), as shown in the flow chart in . The method includes the operation of receiving a signal at the RRU from a base band unit (BBU) via a physical communication link, wherein the BBU is configured for media access control (MAC) layer processing, and the RRU is configured to communicate with a wireless mobile device via an air interface, as in block . The operation of adding a cyclic prefix (CP) to the signal with a CP adder follows, as in block .","The method  can further include the operation of inverse Fast Fourier transform (IFFT) processing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols into a modulated signal using an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modulator, prior to adding the CP and after receiving the signal at the RRU. Another operation of the method can include generating a frame and slot signal using a frame and slot signal generator, prior to IFFT processing and after receiving the signal at the RRU. The operations of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing for separating a channel data stream into a plurality of MIMO data streams for multiple antenna ports using a MIMO processor, and controlling a transmit power of each physical channel using a transmit power controller can also be included, prior to generating the frame and slot signal and after receiving the signal at the RRU.

Another operation of the method can include detecting feedback information from the OFDM symbols or controlling the transmit power of a received OFDM signal at the RRU using a transmit power controller or a feedback information detector, distributing the OFDM signal to signal processing units and processing the OFDM signal at the RRU using a signal distributor and a signal processing unit, and detecting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) data streams and combining the plurality of MIMO data streams into a data stream at the RRU using a MIMO detector, after FFT processing and before sending the signal to the BBU.
