{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is the U.S. National Stage of PCT\/FR2009\/052687, filed Dec. 23, 2009, which in turn claims priority to French Patent Application No. 0859143, filed Dec. 30, 2008, the entire contents of all applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The present invention relates to a gateway server provided with a microkernel. It also relates to a method for transmitting data between networks via a gateway server.","Conventional operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows or GNU\/Linux, have not been designed to have strong security constraints. The result is a poorly secure design in the form of an operating system which uses operative layers which can be represented in accordance with different models, such as the OSI (open systems interconnection) model.","Within the scope of a gateway server  (), also known as a \u2018proxy\u2019, this representation can be carried out simply in three levels:\n\n","A monolithic kernel of this type includes low-level software, such as the scheduler, process manager, memory manager and device drivers, as well as some high-level services such as file systems, cryptographic algorithm systems or filtering systems.\n\n","In a protocol stack each layer solves a specific number of problems regarding data transmission and provides well-defined services to the upper layers of the first level . These top layers are closer to the user and manage more abstract data by using the services of the lower layers which edit these data so they can be sent over a physical medium.\n\n","A gateway server  of this type can have a filtering function intended to ensure the transmission of data  received, for example, from an unsecured network  such as the Internet network to a sensitive network . In this case, these data  are processed:\n\n","The present invention is based on the fact that such a server, and the method required for its implementation, have drawbacks. In particular, they have weaknesses in terms of the complexity of a monolithic kernel and the architecture of a computer system which does not allow formal verification of the vulnerability of a gateway server.","More specifically, no mechanism makes it possible to prove that the data from  subsequently pass through all the filtering steps performed by the levels ,  and . A voluntary or accidental dysfunction  may thus occur over one of these levels  or  and may lead to a bypassing of the control level .","By way of example, such a dysfunction  is demonstrated at the communication level , for example within the layer specific to the TCP\/IP stack. In this case, this dysfunction  transmits data coming from the network  to the network  without the prior transmission of said data to the control level .","It is thus possible to access the network  independently of the rules of transmission which must be applied by the control level , which constitutes an unacceptable flaw of the server .","In order to solve this problem, the present invention relates to a gateway server provided with a first subsystem including a media level, a communication level and a control level, said server also including a microkernel and an IPC controller managing communication between the server resources allocated to the first subsystem, characterised in that said server includes:\n\n","A gateway server of this type solves the problem of the absence of transmission control functions caused by provoked or accidental dysfunctions at the media level and\/or communication level of a gateway server.","In fact, such a dysfunction cannot result in the transmission of data between networks in a server according to the invention since only the control level can transmit data between these networks via the shared memory.","Such a server therefore affords numerous advantages. On the one hand it makes it possible to respond to a lack of clearly established security rules in the sensitive network since these rules can be implemented by its control level.","It also makes it possible to prevent an attack emanating from a non-sensitive network with the aim of bypassing the security level of a gateway server by bypassing the control level thereof.","A server according to the invention thus makes it possible to protect a network which is sensitive to voluntary or involuntary external attacks. In this manner, it makes it possible to ensure a security policy between networks of different sensitivity, for example between an unsecured network and a sensitive network.","In one embodiment each subsystem comprises means for encoding information, which has been received in a request which conforms to a network communications protocol, into a binary structure which conforms to a communications protocol for communication between the control level of the first subsystem and the control level of the second subsystem.","In this case each sub-system may comprise means for encoding the information into a binary structure after processing of said information in the communication level and then in the control level of said subsystem.","In accordance with one embodiment the server comprises means for identifying, as a function of the nature of the request, data which are characteristic of the request and have to be encoded in the binary structure.","In one embodiment the server comprises means for associating the request received with a request which has been predefined in a limited list of authorised requests.","In accordance with one embodiment the microkernel comprises means for associating each application implemented by a subsystem with the control of a server resource.","In one embodiment the server comprises means for limiting communication in such a way that neither the media level nor the communication level of a subsystem can communicate directly with the media level or the communication level of the other subsystem without the intermediary of the control levels of the subsystems.","In accordance with one embodiment the server comprises means for analysing the syntax and validity of the protocols filtered by each layer used in the server.","The invention also relates to a method for controlling a gateway server provided with a first subsystem including a media level, a communication level and a control level, said server also including a microkernel and an IPC controller managing communication between the server resources allocated to the first subsystem, characterised in that, since the server is also provided with a second subsystem including a second media level, a second communication level and a second control level such that the microkernel and the IPC controller also manage communication between the server resources allocated to said second subsystem, a memory with shared reading and writing, established under the control of the microkernel, is used to send requests between the control level of the first subsystem and the control level of the second subsystem with the aid of a server according to any one of the above embodiments.","Lastly, the invention also relates to a computer program product including program code instructions recorded on a support which can be read by a computer to implement a method according to the invention when said program runs on a computer.","With reference to , a gateway server  according to the invention comprises two media levels  and , two communication levels  and , and two control levels  and .","However, a single microkernel  is used to carry out some basic functions, including the management of communication between the server resources, in particular by IPC (inter process communication) message transfer.","In addition to this management, a second generation microkernel includes a clock driver and a scheduler such that a microkernel of this type includes less than 20,000 code lines.","By contrast, a monolithic microkernel includes millions of code lines with a proportional risk of bugs and security flaws. It can hardly be verified as conforming to the specifications of code verifiers and current formal proof systems.","Moreover, monolithic kernels have poor isolation properties. In fact, user processes can break the different types of isolation thanks to pipelines, files, the shared memory, etc. The management of interprocess communication is not trusted.","In fact, as previously mentioned, within a monolithic kernel there is no isolation between kernel subsystems such as between the drivers and network stacks. A driver of a bugged or corrupted hardware component may therefore put the entire system at risk.","The use of \u2018second generation\u2019 microkernels solves the problem linked to a flaw within the control level. These microkernels are of such a size that they can be serviced easily and evaluated formally so as, for example, to certify them at a higher level such as level  of the EAL (evaluation assurance level) international standard.","For example, the most commonly known second generation microkernels, which are currently used in different variations, are supported on an L4 API (application programming interface), which was designed by Jochen Liedtke.","A gateway server provided with such a microkernel thus makes it possible to respond to the complexity and vulnerability of monolithic kernels. In terms of security such a system benefits from the security of the microkernel.","However, the security of servers also depends on the security of the IPC communication since this represents a possible means of transmitting dangerous data. For reasons of efficacy the management of the security of communications is traditionally left to the servers, the microkernel being satisfied with transmitting the messages.","This is why, in this embodiment, the microkernel  includes an IPC controller  offering a mechanism of communication rights such that two applications can only communicate with one another if the controller  recognises that these applications have the appropriate rights.","In fact, the microkernel considers each application, for example of services or drivers, as the subject of security criteria which are provided to it beforehand.","From these criteria the microkernel  can allocate system resources to the applications that it manages in accordance with a rule established upon its start-up, whilst its IPC controller  allocates or refuses rights for communication between these applications.","In other words the microkernel  identifies the resources to be allocated, such as the memory, inputs and outputs and privileges for the management levels, as well as any communication waiting for the authorisation of the IPC controller .","When an application requires IPC communication between different elements, the IPC controller  thus determines from this list whether the requesting application has a right to communicate with the recipient application.","The IPC controller  thus performs the function of an IPC controller for, for example, issuing communication rights to specific applications on request. Said IPC controller can likewise detect attempts to violate security criteria and supply an audit on the violation potential.","In this embodiment the microkernel  also maintains previously authorised communications for each application.","Such a structure makes it possible to accurately control the use of the resources whilst each application is simultaneously connected to the control of a resource, that is to say of a hardware component or mechanism, which reinforces the control to block the spread of an attack or bug.","In the server , the data processing thus uses two subsystems, more specifically:\n\n","In fact, each subsystem manages a flow of data, for example at its network interface or its protocol stack, by using its own physical resources which are isolated from the other subsystem apart from between their control levels, as will be described below.","The microkernel  and its IPC controller  thus only authorise communications between the respective media level  or  and the respective communication level  or , said communication level only being able to communicate with the respective control level  or .","Supposing that an attack or bug originating from the network  were to succeed in infiltrating through a flaw in one of the layers of the media level  and\/or communication level , for example in the application of a driver and\/or of the protocol stack, data cannot therefore be transmitted to the sensitive network  without being processed by the control levels  and .","Furthermore, the architecture of the server makes it possible to carry out a deep filtering process of the network, this filtering process using an analysis of the syntax and of the validity of the protocols filtered by each layer of the server, for example: Ethernet, IP, TOP, application level.","For this reason, a request received by the unsecured subsystem is transformed, during the progressive processing thereof by the communication level  and then by the control level , from a request into a simple, clearly defined binary structure.","Such a transformation is shown in , which illustrates the decomposition of an HTTP protocol request into binary data encoding the information transmitted by said HTTP instruction.","More specifically, these data include a \u201cget\u201d instruction, a URL address, the version of the HTTP protocol used and the file formats taken into account by a browsing or navigation software.","These binary data, shown in a table for reasons of clarity, are then sent to the control level  of the secured subsystem via the intermediary of a memory  which is shared between the two subsystems.","To this end, an exhaustively defined protocol is used. Such a protocol defines all requests which can be emitted by the control level  of the unsecured network, in such a way that the data fields required for these requests can, on the one hand, be predetermined and, on the other, be filled in by binary data encoding the information identified in the received request.","The requests sent by the unsecured network  via the gateway server  are thus processed by the unsecured subsystem in order to extract therefrom any data which are characteristic of said requests, these characteristic data being sent to the secured subsystem via the control level  of said unsecured subsystem.","The secured subsystem then rewrites the request in accordance with its communication level , for example in accordance with an HTTP protocol, on the basis of previously extracted characteristic data. This request is then sent via the communication level  to the recipient server which can then be validly and securely forced.","Such a processing of data is shown in  from binary data previously obtained from an HTTP request.","In return, the response of the recipient server is received by the media level , then by the communication level  so as to reach the control level .","Said control level  can then transmit the binary data obtained from the response through the shared memory  such that said memory transmits it to the requester via the levels ,  and then  of the unsecured subsystem.","It would appear that a gateway server according to the invention does not aim to block bugs and\/or attacks, but to limit their effect on the sensitive network since all requests emitted within the sensitive network by said server are requests validated by their rewriting, said validated requests not corresponding exactly to the initial request. The security of the gateway is thus ensured by the architecture of the server.","To summarise, each subsystem acts as a trap which can only communicate with the other subsystem via the intermediary of a memory in which binary data are recorded which encode the information identified in a request received at the input of one of the subsystems in predefined fields.","In this way, the subsystems only communicate via the intermediary of their control level, which is particularly trusted owing to the presence of a microkernel, and by means of data of which the scope is limited to the predefined field.","The present invention may encompass numerous variations. In particular, the description given above of the invention provides a microkernel  including the IPC controller  although, depending on the variations and criteria used to define a microkernel, said IPC controller  may be located outside the microkernel ."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be better understood upon reading the following description which is given solely by way of non-limiting example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
