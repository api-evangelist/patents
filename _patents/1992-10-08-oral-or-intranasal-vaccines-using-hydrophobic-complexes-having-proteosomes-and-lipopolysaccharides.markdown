title: Oral or intranasal vaccines using hydrophobic complexes having proteosomes and lipopolysaccharides
abstract: An immunogenic complex, essentially consisting of neisserial outer membrane protein proteosomes hydrophobically complexed to native purified bacterial lipopolysaccaride and formulated in accordance with the current invention for mucosal delivery such as via the oral or intranasal route is used as a vaccine. Specifically, a vaccine using lipopolysaccharides complexed to proteosomes for such mucosal administration induces IgG and IgA antibodies in sera and in respiratory and intestinal fluids. Furthermore, such antibodies are associated with protection against shigella infection and these vaccines are herein demonstrated to protect against mucosal infection with shigella.

"],"sup":"nd "},"Since the demonstration in 1967 (Formal, S. B. et al. 1967. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 25: 347\u2013349) that parenteral immunization with live or killed bacteria was ineffective in protecting against oral challenge or monkeys with , the major thrust of research has focused on the use of live attenuated or genetically constructed vaccines (Formal, S. B. and M. M. Levine. in Bacterial Vaccines, pp. 167\u2013186). The problems associated with development of successful live vaccines include the narrow window between efficacy and safety of such vaccines since their ability to cause disease and side effects can be exceedingly dose dependant. The novelty of the current approach is emphasized by the fact that results of immunogenicity and protection in established animal models of disease were achieved despite using a sub-unit, non-living vaccine delivery system that is safe for intranasal or oral delivery. While several other approaches to the problem of development of oral or intranasal vaccines to protect against mucosal diseases in the gastro-intestinal or respiratory tract have been explored, none uses the technology of the instant invention; nor have they been effective in demonstrating induction of high levels of IgA and IgG in both mucosal secretions and sera as well as protection in established animal models as is here shown.","The data herein disclosed show that the instant invention can be used as an oral or intranasal non-living sub-unit vaccine to protect against mucosal diseases of the gastro-intestinal tract such as shigellosis. In addition, since high antibody levels are induced in either the respiratory or gastro-intestinal tracts following either oral or intranasal immunization, and since protection is shown against either conjunctival or respiratory challenge, these vaccines can also be used to protect against diseases that enter the body via respiratory, ocular or gastro-intestinal routes. By logical extension of the well-known common mucosal immune system, these vaccines also will result in protection against mucosal diseases of the urogenital and auditory tracts.","Proteosomes have previously been used with peptides (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/642,093 filed Jan. 16, 1991 which is a Continuation of 07\/065,440 filed Jun. 23,1987) and large proteins (U.S. patent application entitled \u201cImmunopotentiating System for Large Proteins and Polypeptides\u201d Ser. No. 07\/336,952, filed 12 Apr. 1989) in vaccine development of parenteral vaccines and Zollinger et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,543; Nov. 17, 1987) have used meningoccoccal outer memebrane proteins non-covalently complexed to detoxified lipopolysaccharides or polysaccarides in parenteral vaccines. The Zollinger work, however, specifically teaches away from the instant invention since the thrust of their work emphasizes that detoxified LPS or polysaccharide can be used wheras in the instant invention, detoxified LPS, in direct contrast to the non-detoxified LPS, is entirely ineffective. Furthermore, Zollinger neither showed, claimed nor suggested that his vaccines would be effective when deliverd via the oral or intranasal route.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel vaccine delivery system using proteosomes hydrophobically complexed to lipopolysaccharides and formulated for oral or intranasal administration to induce protective antibodies in sera and\/or respiratory and\/or intestinal secretions that are associated with protection against disease.","In accordance with the invention, vaccines using 2a or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce anti-LPS antibodies in the aformentioned fluids and protect against homologous shigella infection in a well-known animal model of shigellosis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"S. flexneri "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":["S. flexneri ","S.

Jann. 1965. Carbohydr. Chem. 5:83.11). The LPS extraction protocol was generally as follows:","Grow bacteria in LB for 2\u20133 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. Incubate 3 ml starter in rho-bottles with nutrient agar (+2% agar), overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Harvest bacteria with 15 ml saline\/bottle (+glass beads) and filter the suspension through gauze pad. Centrifuge the filtrate at 5000 RPM, 4\u00b0 C., (Sorval RC5B, 250ml tubes, cat. 03937 in GSA rotor) for 15 minutes and resuspend the pellet in \u00bc5 ml saline\/Tube.\n\nAdd acetone to the resuspended bacteria (1.5 L\/10 ml resuspended bacteria) and left for two days. Remove the Acetone by filtration through Whatman paper under vacuum and dry the bacteria completely under vacuum to form white, fine powder. Add dHO to the powder (25 ml\/1.4 gr dried bacteria) and gently steer until all powder is hydrated. Add phenol (at 37\u00b0 C.) to the mixture (1:1 w\/w) and agitate gently in 68\u00b0 C. preheated water bath for 10 min. Cool the mixture in ice and centrifuge at 3000 RPM, 4\u00b0 C., (30 ml tubes, cat. 03163 in GSA rotor) for 30 min. Gently collect the upper phase (water phase) and add cold dHO (0.5 volume of the collected upper phase) to the lower phase and mix well. Centrifuge as in #9, collect upper phase and combine the two upper phases.\n\nReextract the combined upper phases as in #8\u2013#11. Dialyze against HO for two days (15 K dialyzis bag) with at least two water exchanges. Centrifuge at 10000 RPM, 4\u00b0 C. (30 ml tubes, cat. 03163 in GSA rotor) for 30 minutes and collect supernatant. Add absolute ethanol (ethanol\/supernatant 10:1 v\/v) and leave for two days at 4\u00b0 C. Centrifuge at 10000 RPM, 4\u00b0 C. (250 ml tubes, cat. 03937 in GSA rotor) for 2 hrs, discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in \u00bc10 ml dHO Dialyze against dHO in 15 K dialyzis bag for two days. Freeze dry.\n","Alkaline detoxified LPS (LPSad) was prepared using mild alkaline treatment (Skidmore, B. J. et al. 1975. 114:770). This alkaline-detoxified LPS was ineffective in the system.","Outer membrane proteins from group B serotype 2b were extracted with detergent as follows:\n\n","LP-S or LPSad from 2a or and group B serotype 2b outer membrane proteins were mixed at 1:1 ratio (w\/w) in 1% Empigen (2 mg\/ml final concentration of LPS\/LPSad and protein). The mixture was dialyzed in 1000 DALTON molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) dialyzis bags against PBS at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 days with daily buffer exchanges versus PBS or Tris saline buffer or their equivelant. Since both the proteosomes and the LPS are of very high molecular weight, it is obviously likely that dialysis membrane with MWCO of far greater than 1000 daltons can reasonably be used and similarly, the length of the dialysis time would be considerably shortened. The vaccine preparations, prot-LPS or prot-LPSad were kept at 4\u00b0 C. and diluted to the specific concentration with PBS just prior to vaccination.","Samples of vaccine preparation were eluted through CL-4B column (2.5\u00d740 cm) and fractions were collected. The various fractions were assayed for protein by the Bradford method (Bradford, M. M. 1970. 72:248.) with BSA as standard. The LPS level in each fraction was calculated by competition ELISA as follows: 100 ul samples from each column fraction were incubated with 300 ul of specific-LPS-positive guinea-pig serum diluted 1:150 in filler for 1 hr, 37\u00b0 C. Homologous LPS samples ranging from 100 \u00ccg\/ml to 3.125 \u00ccg\/ml were incubated as standards. The incubated serum and samples or standards were placed in LPS-precoated and blocked 96 wells plates for 2 hrs, 37\u00b0 C. and the plates were developed as described under ELISA. The LPS level in each fraction was calculated with the standard curve obtained from the LPS standards.","1) Mice: balb\\c, age 7\u201310 weeks, 4\u20135 per group were immunized with the specific antigens either orally or intranasally. Orally (P.O.): 100 ul PBS, 0.2 M NaHCocontaining 100 \u00ccg LPS\/LPSad or 200 \u00ccg prot-LPS\/LPSad complex. Intranasally (I.N.): 25 ul PBS containing 10 \u00ccg LPS\/LPSad or 20 ug prot-LPS\/LPSad complex. Mice were anaesthetized prior to intranasal immunization. Four vaccine preparation were used: LPS, LPSad, prot-LPS, prot-LPSad. A control group was vaccinated with PBS, 0.2 M NaHCo(P.O.) or PBS (I.N.). The vaccines were given in four different protocols: (a) one dose (b) two doses one week apart, (c) two doses three week apart, and (d) three doses one and three weeks apart.","2) Guinea pigs: DH guinea pigs age 2\u20133 month were immunized with prot-LPS administrated either orally or intranasally. Orally: 200 ul PBS, 0.2 M NaHCocontaining 200 ug prot-LPS complex or intranasally: 50 ul PBS containing 40 ug prot-LPS complex. The animals were aneasthesized in both cases.","1) Mouse lung wash: 9\u201311 days after the last immunization mice were sacrificed by COsuffocation and lungs exposed. A canula was inserted into the trachea and using three-way stopcock, lungs were washed with 2 ml PBS, 0.1% BSA and wash fluids were collected.","2) Mouse intestinal wash: Following the lung wash, the small intestine was removed and 2 ml PBS, 0.1% BSA, 50 mM EDTA and 0.1 mg\/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor were passed through and collected. PMSF (1 mM final concentration) was added to the intestine wash after collection. Both lung and intestine washes were vortexed vigorously and centrifuged to remove cells and debris, the supernatents were collected and kept at \u221220\u00b0 C. until assayed.","Serum preparation: Sera were prepared. from blood collected from the killed mice and kept at \u221220\u00b0 C. until assayed. Blood from guinea pigs was collected via cardiopuncture under anaesthetization, serum was separated and kept at \u221220\u00b0 C. until assayed.","ELISA: The antibody level in the various extracts e.g. serum, intestinal wash and lung wash was determined as described (2). Briefly, 96 wells flat bottom high binding plates (Costar, Cambridge, Mass., US) were precoated with the specific LPS, blocked with BSA\/casein and washed three times. Serially double diluted samples in blocking solution were incubated in the plates and after the incubation period, the plates were washed three times and alkaline-phosphatase conjugated anti-guinea pig or anti-mouse IgG\/IgA diluted 1:1000 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., US) was added. plates were then washed three times, substrate was added and the absorbance at 405 nm was detected. The antibody titer is expressed as the maximal dilution which gave an O.D. equal or above the indicated value after specific processing period.","Challenge in guinea pigs (Sereny test): Based on the standard challenge assay for the pathogenesis of shigellosis (Sereny, B. 1957. 4:367; Hartman, B. A. et al 1991. 59:4075.), the conjunctival sac of one eye of the animal was inoculated with 30 \u00ccl suspension containing about 1X10bacteria and the eye lids were lightly massaged. Two to three days after inoculation, the eyes were screened for the level of keratoconjunctivitis developed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"]},"9\u201311 days after the last immunization, serum and secretions from intestines and lungs were collected and the specific antibody level was measured in ELISA. Proteosome-LPS complex has a remarkable advantage as compared to LPS, LPSad or prot-LPSad complex in inducing antibody production against 2a LPS in the serum (, Table 1). Indeed, the inability of LPS alone, or even alkaline-detoxified LPS complexed to proteosomes (prot-LPSad) to give significant antibody levels emphasizes the remarkable specificty of the instant invention since only the native LPS complexed to proteosomes (Prot-LPS) was effective. Similar data were obtained with proteosomes complexed to LPS from . The LPS-specific antibody titer in serum of mice immunized with Proteosome-LPS complex after one, two or three doses of vaccine () shows that the highest levels of IgA or IgG were achieved when the vaccine was given at 2 doses, 3 weeks apart or in 3 doses. In most cases, one dose of vaccine failed to elicit any detectable antibody levels in the serum as measured by ELISA after 1 hr incubation with the substrate. Longer incubation periods show induction of antibody production by the proteose-LPS complex even after one dose of vaccine (data not shown). There was no relative advantage to oral or intranasal routes in terms of serum antibody levels (). The specific anti-2a LPS IgA levels in mice intestine shows a good correlation to the response observed in the serum in terms of the dose dependency and the lack of differences between oral and intranasal immunization (). Similar data was obtained using LPS complexed to proteosomes. In lungs however, intranasal immunization was more efficient in eliciting anti-2a LPS IgA as compared to oral immunization (). Using LPS complexed to proteosomes, lung antibody levels were good using both routes.","Following the results obtained with mice which emphasized the necessity of a booster dose, we vaccinated three groups of guinea pigs with prot-LPS preparation, all three groups were vaccinated either orally or intranasally. The first group was vaccinated with two doses of vaccine at 0 and 3 weeks and the second group was vaccinated with three doses at 0,1 and 3 weeks. 12\u201314 days after the last vaccination, the guinea pigs were challenged (sereny test) with 30\u00cc1 PBS containing 7.6\u00d710(group 1), 1\u00d710(group 2) or 2.6\u00d710(group 3) 2a (E22). Two or three days after the challenge, the animals were examined for keratoconjunctivitis. The animals could be sub-divided into three sub-groups upon the severity of infection observed. The results obtained in the sereny tests () shows clearly that the prot-LPS complex was able to elicit in vivo protection against the homologous bacteria. The combined results shows that after intranasal immunization, 14 out of 19 animals were at least partially protected (p<0.001). After oral immunization, 11 out of 16 were at least partially protected (p<0.001) and 9 out of 16 were completely protected (p<0.001). All animals in the control groups (16 out of 16) were completely unprotected.","Similar experiments performedusing LPS complexed to proteosomes showed that whereas 80% (e.g. 8 out of 10) guinea pigs were infected in control groups (Sereny test), 70% to 80% of guinea pigs immunized with two doses of LPS complexed to proteosomes were protected in three separate experiments. In these experiments, proteosomes from two different sources were used emphasizing the reproducibility of the vaccine. In addition, in the respiratory model of shigella infection developed by L. Hale et al, 90% (9 out of 10) swiss outbred mice challenged with shigella intranasally died whereas 75% (6 of 8) mice immunized orally twice with 100 ug of complexed to proteosomes survived thus confirming the efficacy of the vaccine even when challenged to induce death by respiratory infection.","Data from mice immunized with either the 2a or vaccines immunized either orally or intranasally also showed high levels of anti-meningococcal protein antibodies in sera, intestinal secretions and lung washes indicating the applicabilityh of these vaccines to protect against meningococcal diseases as well."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
