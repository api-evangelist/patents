A slotted cylinder transducer  features a hollow support member  in a cylindrical configuration and having an axial opening . The diameter of the support member  is D. Transducer material  is supported concentrically within the support member and is typically of a piezoelectric material and provided with an axial opening. The outer support member  may be thinned at selected locations to facilitate control of vibrational frequency and frequency bandwidth of the transducer assembly. The thinned portions of the support member  may be adapted to retain a compliant material, such as urethane, to smooth the outer surface of the support member . The hollow interior  of the transducer assembly  may be filled with a compliant material, such as urethane. The support member  is provided with an axially extending side opening , and the transducer material  is similarly provided with an axially extending side opening , the two side openings  and  being aligned with each other. Side openings  and  give a slot having dimension \u201cg\u201d. Bending nodes  and  occur in the transducer  opposite side openings  and . Transducer  bends as shown at arrows . The slotted cylinder projector operates in a bending mode in a manner analogous to other resonant objects forced by piezoelectric components. These include tuning forks and vibrating cantilevers.","Piezoelectric material must be polled before it can be used as a transducer. Polling involves raising the temperature of the material and putting an electric field across the material in the same direction that a field will be applied to the material in use. When the piezoelectric strain is desired in a different dimension from the direction of electric field application and polling, the transducer material is known as a 3-1 transducer material. In a 3-3 piezoelectric material, strain is produced in the same direction as the polling direction and application of the electric field.","When electrical signals are introduced to the transducer material , the transducer material  vibrates. The outer support member  limits the amplitude of the vibrations of the transducer material . Such transducers  are generally referred to as slotted cylinder projectors and are capable of providing low frequency acoustics. Slotted cylinder projectors are efficient and small in size, and provide sufficient power to find application in underwater sonar projectors.","The resonant frequency (F) of a slotted cylinder projector is proportional to the square root of Young's modulus, Y, of support member :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["F","r"]},"mo":"\u2245","mrow":{"mi":".0655","mo":"\u00d7","mfrac":{"mi":"ct","msup":{"mi":"D","mn":"2"}}}},{"mi":".0655","mo":["\u00d7","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mi":"t","msup":{"mi":"D","mn":"2"}},"msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mi":["Y","p"]}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":"12"},"An equivalent circuit model developed based upon kinetic and potential energies of a slotted cylinder of length L, effective density (\u03c1), effective Young's modulus (Y), length of the cylinder L, thickness t, diameter of the inner ring Dwherein M=dynamic mass and K=stiffness, comprises:\n\n5.4\n\nand\n\n=0.99()\u2003\u2003(2)\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","32","30","34","36","36","34","38","38","36","36","40","40","36","36","42","34","36","36","36","36","34","32","36","36","44","44","30"]},"Acoustic transducers and more particularly slotted cylinder projectors are often used in high pressure environments and environments with varying temperatures.

First transducer material layer  conforms to the interior surface of support member . A second transducer material layer  is disposed on the interior surface of first transducer material layer . The transducer material for both layers is preferably a piezoelectric material such as a piezoceramic composite. First transducer material layer  has electrical contacts A and B that are in contact with the transducer material layer  and insulated from electrical contact with other components. Second transducer material layer  has electrical contacts A and B in contact with second transducer material layer  and insulated to prevent electrical contact with other components. First transducer material layer  and second transducer material layer  are thus configured for 3-1 transducer mode operation because the electric field is provided in a different direction from the piezoelectric strain.","An electrical drive circuit  is provided for transducer assembly .

These arcuate wedges have a major arcuate surface positioned against the interior of support member . A minor arcuate surface is opposite the major arcuate surface in the support member hollow . Each wedge portion has first and second radial surfaces adjacent to other wedge portions. First and second transverse surfaces of the wedge portions are provided perpendicular to the axis of the support member.","Each transducer portion  includes a first region  poled in a first direction and a second region  poled in a second direction. (The first direction and the second direction can be the same direction). For 3-3 operation it is preferred that the poling be from one radial surface to another. An inactive region  is positioned between the first region  and the second region . Inactive region  is not poled. Transducer portions  are insulated from electrical contact with support member  by insulation . Inactive region  can act as effective insulation between first region  and second region . As an alternative, first region  can be formed separately from second region , and inactive layer  can be a non-conducting adhesive.","As may best be seen in , one transducer portion  is shown. First region  has electrodes A and B positioned on the first radial surface and the second radial surface of portion . Second region  has electrodes A and B disposed on the first and second radial surfaces of portion . The first region electrodes A and B of each portion  are together joined to an electrical circuit much like that shown at  in  in order to provide a driving voltage with a bias voltage. Electrodes A and B of each portion  are joined to the electrical circuit to provide a driving voltage to second regions . Adjacent electrodes on different portions are insulated from each other.","In , there is shown an alternate embodiment of the transducer portion . In this embodiment, a dielectric or insulating material \u2032 is utilized between first region  and second region . Insulating material \u2032 has no piezoelectric properties. This embodiment could be easier to manufacture than that shown in .","In one embodiment, first region  is poled in an opposite direction from second region . This allows opposite piezoelectric strain induction with a voltage having the same polarity on adjacent electrodes. In another embodiment, first region  and second region  are poled in the same direction. Magnitude of the piezoelectric strain induction can be controlled by providing different voltages to different electrodes.","There is thus provided an acoustic transducer wherein the stiffness thereof is variable, using at least two actively polled piezoelectric slotted cylinder projector layers within the slotted cylinder projector. Further, dynamic slotted cylinder projector nodes provide for active stiffness control of the split ring transducer by having the un-polled piezoelectric volume located between two active piezoelectric volumes, per . Further, the dead piezoelectric volume offers a dynamic node region, the two piezoelectric volumes being voltage and phase controlled in order to achieve desired performance at various operating conditions and operating performances. Other benefits include the ability to drive the two polarized piezoelectric volumes in order to achieve the desired frequency operating bandwidth, the ability to shift the resonant frequency to the desired frequency of operation (operating at resonance allows maximum operating efficiency), the ability to drive the two polarized piezoelectric volumes in order to achieve the greatest efficiency at the optimal design frequency, resulting in decrease in operating bandwidth; and optimization of the two drive voltage magnitudes and phases at various ambient pressures to achieve the maximum frequency bandwidth, greatest efficiency, and desired performance.","Controlling the resonance frequency makes possible highly efficient transducer assembly operation obtained from operating close to, or at, resonance. The control of the resonance of the transducer assembly with the open and short circuit stiffness of the active piezoelectric material is used to drive the transducer assembly. Increasing the DC bias (V) on the PZT driver stiffens the transducer assembly resulting increased resonance frequency. The resonance frequency is directly proportional to the Young's modulus of the assembly as seen in Equation 1.","It will be appreciated that this invention is applicable to all transducer\/projectors and not limited to slotted cylinder projectors. Improved efficiency and band width can be realized on all transducers using this proposed active variable compliance, i.e. active stiffening.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which are shown illustrative comparative devices, as well as an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, and wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
