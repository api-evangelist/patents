The entire contents of the foregoing application are hereby incorporated in their entirety.","This invention was made with government support under grant nos. 1R21NS059380 and 3R21NS059380-01S1 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This application incorporates by reference the ASCII text file identified by the name SequenceListing.txt, containing 1.49 KB of data, created on Nov. 12, 2010 and filed in computer-readable format (CRF).","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than one-third of the world's population, approximately 2 billion people, is infested with helminths. In 1999, the WHO estimated that schistosomiasis and soil-based helminths represented more than 40% of the disease burden due to all tropical disease, excluding malaria. While most parasitic infestations are preventable and treatable, the effects of an infestation can be chronic and long-term and may eventually cause death. For example, a person who has endured persistent and heavy infestations is likely to suffer from anemia, malnutrition and chronic irreversible diseases, such as liver fibrosis, cancer of the bladder and kidney failure. These parasites also affect livestock, which can facilitate infestation in humans by causing contamination via soil or food supplies.","In addition to the health risk posed to humans by parasites, plants are highly susceptible to parasitic infestations. Effects of nematode damage to plants include stunting, chlorosis, nutrient deficiencies, wilting, root abnormalities and reduced yield.","While there are a number of antihelminthic treatments currently available, some scientists are concerned that the parasites will develop resistance to these treatments, especially in developing countries where people are repeatedly infected with helminths and receive multiple doses of antihelminthic drugs. In fact, resistance to antihelminthic drugs has been observed in livestock due to frequent and repeated treatments. Moreover, rates of re-infection by helminths are very high due to the number and the durability of infective eggs on surfaces and in soil. While infection is active, some parasitic nematode species (e.g., ) release an estimated 100,000 new embryos per adult female per day. Currently available anti-helminthics work by paralyzing the infectious nematode through blocking ion channels and receptors and do not inactivate the embryos that cause re-infection. Therefore, it is advantageous to develop new therapies for the treatment and prevention of parasitic infestations and, in particular, therapies that limit the possibility of parasitic re-infection, in both plants and animals,","The present invention is based, at least in part, on the development and use of screening assays to identify compounds that inhibit the RNA-binding activity of MEX-3, MEX-5 and\/or POS-1, RNA binding proteins which are required for early embryogenesis in parasitic worms.

In regulating the soma\/germline asymmetry, MEX-5 activates the SOCS-box protein ZIF-1, which functions as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that degrades germ plasm proteins in somatic blastomers, resulting in reduced expression of germline proteins in germline blastomers. MEX-5 is expressed at uniform levels in both oocytes and newly fertilized eggs (see Schubert C. M. et al., (2000) 5:671-682; Hunter, C. et al. (2002) 129:747-759; Cuenca, A. A. et al. (2003) 130:1255-1265; Lin (2003) 258:226-239; DeRenzo C. et al., (2003) 424:685-689; Nishi et al. (2008) 135:687-697).","The term \u201cPOS-1\u201d includes a CCCH-type zinc finger protein that is necessary for the proper fate specification of germ cells, intestine, pharynx and hypodermis. POS-1 is also required in posterior blastomers for positive regulation of apx-1 mRNA translation and negative regulation of glp-1 mRNA translation by direct binding to the spatial control region in the glp-1 mRNA 3\u2032 UTR. POS-1 is first found in low levels in one-cell embryos and in high levels in germline blastomeres, where it disappears after the P4 division. POS-1 colocalizes with cytoplasmic and perinuclear P granules in the germline blastomeres P1, P2, P3 and P4 (see Kohara, Y. et al. (1999) 126:1-11; Oguro, K. et al. (2003) 130:2495-2503).","The term \u201cMEX-3\u201d includes a KH domain-containing RNA binding protein that is necessary for specifying the identities of the anterior AB blastomer and its descendent, as well as for the identity of the P3 blastomer and proper segregation of the germline P granules. MEX-3 is found uniformly in the cytoplasm of oocytes and one-cell stage embryos and becomes more abundant in AB and its daughters at the two and four cell stages (see Bowerman et al. (1996) 87:205-216).","In one embodiment, the RNA binding modulatory compounds of the invention, e.g., the compounds of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, modulate (e.g., inhibit) the RNA binding activity of MEX-5, but do not substantially inhibit the RNA binding activity of MEX-3 or POS-1.

Screening Assays","The invention provides methods (also referred to herein as \u201cscreening assays\u201d) for identifying modulators, i.e., candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., peptidomimetics, small molecules or other drugs) which modulate, for example one or more biological activities of an RNA-binding protein, e.g., the ability to 1) interact, e.g., bind, e.g., form a complex, with an RNA molecule, e.g., an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding recognition element of the RNA-binding protein, 2) modulate embryogenesis, 3) modulate cell viability, 4) modulate anterior patterning, 5) modulate germ cell totipotency, 6) modulate development of the intestine, 7) modulate development of germline blastomeres, 8) modulate development of pharyngeal tissue, 9) modulate expression and\/or activity of a gene known to be directly or indirectly regulated by the RNA-binding protein, e.g., PAL-1, NOS-2, APX-1 protein, and GLD-1, 10) modulate tubercle formation, or for testing or optimizing the activity of such agents.","The assays can be used to identify agents that modulate the function of an RNA-binding protein or a molecule in a signal transduction pathway involving the RNA-binding protein. The function of an RNA-binding protein can be affected at any level, including transcription, protein expression, protein localization, and\/or cellular activity. The subject assays can also be used to identify, e.g., agents that alter the interaction of an RNA-binding protein with a binding partner, e.g., an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element, or modulate, e.g., inhibit, the stability of such interaction.","The subject screening assays can measure the activity of an RNA-binding protein directly (e.g., formation of a complex with an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element), or can measure a downstream event controlled by modulation of the RNA-binding protein (e.g., embryogenesis, cell differentiation, expression and\/or activity of, a gene known to be directly or indirectly regulated by the RNA-binding protein, e.g., PAL-1, NOS-2, APX-1 protein, and GLD-1).","The subject screening assays employ indicator compositions. These indicator compositions comprise the components required for performing an assay that detects and\/or measures a particular event. The indicator compositions of the invention provide a reference readout and changes in the readout can be monitored in the presence of one or more test compounds. A difference in the readout in the presence and the absence of the compound indicates that the test compound is a modulator of the molecule(s) present in the indicator composition.","The indicator composition used in the screening assay can be a cell that expresses an RNA-binding protein and\/or an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element. For example, a cell that naturally expresses or, more preferably, a cell that has been engineered to express the protein and\/or the RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element by introducing into the cell an expression vector encoding the protein may be used. The cell may be a helminth cell, a plant cell, a yeast cell, a bacterial cell, or a mammalian cell, e.g., a human cell. Alternatively, the indicator composition can be a cell-free composition that includes the protein and\/or the RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element (e.g., a cell extract or a composition that includes e.g., either purified natural or recombinant protein and\/or RNA).","The indicator compositions used in the screening assays of the invention can be a cell that expresses an RNA-binding protein or biologically active fragment thereof, e.g., a fragment of the protein that interacts, e.g., binds, to an RNA-binding protein recognition element, e.g., a fragment comprising a CCCH-type tandem zinc finger or a KH domain.","In another embodiment, the indicator composition comprises more than one polypeptide. For example, in one embodiment the subject assays are performed in the presence of more than one RNA-binding protein, e.g., MEX-5, GLP-1, NOS-2, MEX-6, POS-1, MEX-3, PAL-1. It will be understood that in addition to the recited proteins, e.g., helminth proteins, e.g., nematode proteins, suitable proteins for use in the methods of the invention include plant and mammalian homologues of such proteins, e.g., TTP, the mammalian homologue of MEX-5. One of ordinary skill in the art can identify such proteins based on sequence and\/or database and\/or homology searching and analyses.","Compounds that modulate the expression and\/or activity of an RNA-binding protein, identified using the assays described herein can be useful for treating a subject that would benefit from the modulation of expression and\/or activity of the RNA-binding protein, e.g., a subject with a parasitic associate state.","In one embodiment, secondary assays can be used to confirm that the modulating agent affects the RNA-binding protein molecule in a specific manner. For example, compounds identified in a primary screening assay can be used in a secondary, tertiary, etc. screening assay to determine whether the compound affects an RNA-binding protein-related activity as described herein. Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention pertains to a combination of two or more of the assays described herein. For example, a modulating agent can be identified using a cell-based or a cell-free assay, e.g., to detect an interaction, e.g., formation of a complex, and the ability of the agent to modulate the activity of the RNA-binding protein or a molecule involved in a signal transduction pathway involving the RNA-binding protein can be confirmed using a biological read-out to measure, e.g., embryogenesis, an immune response, e.g., cytokine production, in vitro or in vivo.","Moreover, a modulator of an RNA-binding protein expression and\/or activity identified as described herein (e.g., a small molecule) may be used in an animal model and\/or plant model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, or side effects of treatment with such a modulator. Alternatively, a modulator identified as described herein may be used in an animal model to determine the mechanism of action of such a modulator. An example of a nematode parasite model that may be used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment of nematode parasitism with an RNA binding modulatory compound identified herein is described, for example, in Lok J. B. (\u201c2007 , ed. The Research Community, WormBook, doi\/10.1895\/wormbook.1.134.1, at www.wormbook.org), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. is a significant pathogen of humans and can be maintained in laboratory dogs and gerbils. Examples of animal models that may be used to determine the efficacy of treatment of nematode parasitism with an RNA binding modulatory compound identified herein are described, for example, in Camberis, M. et al., (2003 Current Protocols in Immunology 19.12.1-19.12.27), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.","In one embodiment, the screening assays of the invention are high throughput or ultra high throughput (e.g., Fernandes, P. B., Curr Opin Chem. Biol. 1998 2:597; Sundberg, S A, Curr Opin Biotechnol. 2000, 11:47).","Exemplary cell based and cell free assays of the invention are described in more detail below.","Cell Based Assays","The indicator compositions of the invention may be cells that express an RNA-binding protein and\/or an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element. For example, a cell that naturally expresses endogenous polypeptide and\/or RNA molecule, or, more preferably, a cell that has been engineered to express one or more exogenous polypeptides and\/or RNA molecules, e.g., by introducing into the cell an expression vector encoding the protein may be used in a cell based assay.","The cells used in the instant assays can be eukaryotic or prokaryotic in origin. For example, in one embodiment, the cell is a bacterial cell. In one embodiment, the cell is a helminth, e.g., nematode, cell. In another embodiment, the cell is a plant cell. In another embodiment, the cell is a fungal cell, e.g., a yeast cell. In another embodiment, the cell is a vertebrate cell, e.g., an avian or a mammalian cell (e.g., a murine cell, rat cell, rhesus monkey, or a human cell). In another embodiment, the cell is a human cell.","In another embodiment, cells for use in the methods of the invention are derived from a cell line, preferably one which expresses low levels of endogenous RNA-binding protein and\/or an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element and is then engineered to express recombinant protein and\/or RNA.","Recombinant expression vectors that may be used for expression of polypeptides are known in the art. For example, the cDNA is first introduced into a recombinant expression vector using standard molecular biology techniques. A cDNA can be obtained, for example, by amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by screening an appropriate cDNA library.","When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions are often provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. Non-limiting examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, B., (1987) Nature 329:840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman, et al. (1987), EMBO J. 6:187-195). A variety of mammalian expression vectors carrying different regulatory sequences are commercially available.","Vector DNA may be introduced into cells via conventional transfection techniques. As used herein, the various forms of the term \u201ctransfection\u201d are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into host cells, including calcium phosphate co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation. Suitable methods for transfecting host cells can be found in Sambrook, et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press (1989)), and other laboratory manuals.","For stable transfection of cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (e.g., resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Nucleic acid encoding a selectable marker can be introduced into a host cell on a separate vector from that encoding an RNA-binding protein and\/or an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element, on the same vector. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die).","In one embodiment, within the expression vector coding sequences are operatively linked to regulatory sequences that allow for constitutive expression of the molecule in the indicator cell (e.g., viral regulatory sequences, such as a cytomegalovirus promoter\/enhancer, may be used). Use of a recombinant expression vector that allows for constitutive expression of the genes in the indicator cell is preferred for identification of compounds that enhance or inhibit the activity of the molecule. In an alternative embodiment, within the expression vector the coding sequences are operatively linked to regulatory sequences of the endogenous gene (i.e., the promoter regulatory region derived from the endogenous gene). Use of a recombinant expression vector in which expression is controlled by the endogenous regulatory sequences is preferred for identification of compounds that enhance or inhibit the transcriptional expression of the molecule.","For example, an indicator cell can be transfected with an expression vector comprising an RNA-binding protein, or biologically active fragment thereof, incubated in the presence and in the absence of a test compound, and the effect of the compound on the expression and\/or activity of the molecule or on a biological response regulated by the RNA-binding protein, e.g., an RNA-binding protein-related activity, can be determined. The biological activities of an RNA-binding protein include activities determined in vivo, or in vitro, according to standard techniques. Activity can be a direct activity, such as an association with a target molecule (e.g., an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element). Alternatively, activity may be an indirect activity, such as, for example, a cellular signaling activity occurring downstream of the interaction of the protein with a target molecule or a biological effect occurring as a result of the signaling cascade triggered by that interaction, such as embryogenesis and\/or cell differentiation.","Compounds that modulate RNA-binding protein production, expression and\/or activity of may be identified using various \u201cread-outs.\u201d","For example, in one embodiment, gene expression of an RNA-binding protein can be measured. In another embodiment, expression of a gene controlled by an RNA-binding protein can be measured.","In another embodiment, protein expression may be measured. For example, standard techniques such as Western blotting or in situ detection can be used.","In one embodiment a downstream effect of modulation of an RNA-binding protein, e.g., the effect of a compound on cell viability and\/or embryogenesis, and\/or tubercle formation in a plant, may be used as an indicator of modulation of the activity of an RNA-binding protein by, for example, monitoring directly (e.g. by microscopic examination of the cells), or indirectly, e.g., by monitoring one or more markers of, for example, embryogenesis.","Standard methods for detecting mRNA of interest, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blotting, are known in the art. Standard methods for detecting protein secretion in culture supernatants, such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), are also known in the art. Proteins can also be detected using antibodies, e.g., in an immunoprecipitation reaction or for staining and FACS analysis.","The ability of the test compound to modulate an RNA-binding molecule interaction with a target molecule can also be determined. For example, in one embodiment, the interaction of an RNA-binding molecule and an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element can be measured as described in, for example, Pagano, et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282:8883 and Farley, et al. (2008) RNA 14: 2685. In certain embodiments of the invention, the RNA-binding protein recognition element comprises the consensus sequence UA(U)RD(N)G. In still other embodiments of the invention, the RNA-binding protein recognition element comprises the consensus sequence DKAG(N)UHUA. In one embodiment, the RNA-binding protein recognition element, i.e., DKAG(N)UHUA, binds with MEX-3. In another embodiment, the RNA-binding protein recognition element, i.e., UA(U)RD(N)G, binds with POS-1.","Determining the ability of the test compound to modulate, for example, an RNA-binding molecule, binding to a target molecule (e.g., a target RNA molecule, e.g., an RNA-binding protein recognition element) can also be accomplished, for example, by determining the ability of the molecules to be coimmunoprecipitated or by coupling the target molecule with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the target molecule to an RNA-binding molecule or an RNA-binding molecule-interacting polypeptide can be determined, e.g., by detecting the labeled target molecule in a complex. Alternatively, for example, an RNA-binding molecule can be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label to monitor the ability of a test compound to modulate an RNA-binding molecule binding to a target molecule in a complex.","Determining the ability of the test compound to interact with an RNA-binding molecule can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that interaction of the compound can be determined by detecting the labeled compound in a complex. For example, targets can be labeled with 125I, 35S, 14C, or 3H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, compounds can be labeled, e.g., with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product.","In another embodiment, fluorescence technologies can be used, e.g., fluorescence polarization, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (Selvin, P R, Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000 7:730; Hertzberg R P and Pope A J, Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2000 4:445).","It is also within the scope of this invention to determine the ability of a compound to interact with an RNA-binding protein without the labeling of any of the interactants. For example, a microphysiometer may be used to detect the interaction of a compound with a an RNA-binding protein without the labeling of either the compound or the molecule (McConnell, H. M., et al. (1992) Science 257:1906-1912). As used herein, a \u201cmicrophysiometer\u201d (e.g., Cytosensor) is an analytical instrument that measures the rate at which a cell acidifies its environment using a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). Changes in this acidification rate may be used as an indicator of the interaction between compounds.","In yet another aspect of the invention, an RNA-binding protein or fragments thereof may be used as \u201cbait protein\u201d e.g., in a two-hybrid assay or three-hybrid assay (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,317; Zervos, et al. (1993) Cell 72:223-232; Madura, et al. (11993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:12046-12054; Bartel, et al. (1993) Biotechniques 14:920-924; Iwabuchi, et al. (1993) Oncogene 8: 1693-1696; and Brent WO94\/10300), to identify other proteins, which bind to or interact with an RNA-binding protein (\u201cbinding proteins\u201d or \u201cbp\u201d) and are involved in an RNA-binding protein activity. Such proteins are also likely to be involved in the propagation of signals by the RNA-binding protein. The two-hybrid system is based on the modular nature of most transcription factors, which consist of separable DNA-binding and activation domains. Briefly, the assay utilizes two different DNA constructs. In one construct, the gene that codes for an RNA-binding protein is fused to a gene encoding the DNA binding domain of a known transcription factor (e.g., GAL-4). In the other construct, a DNA sequence, from a library of DNA sequences, that encodes an unidentified protein (\u201cprey\u201d or \u201csample\u201d) is fused to a gene that codes for the activation domain of the known transcription factor. If the \u201cbait\u201d and the \u201cprey\u201d proteins are able to interact, in vivo, forming an RNA-binding protein-dependent complex, the DNA-binding and activation domains of the transcription factor are brought into close proximity. This proximity allows transcription of a reporter gene (e.g., LacZ) which is operably linked to a transcriptional regulatory site responsive to the transcription factor. Expression of the reporter gene can be detected and cell colonies containing the functional transcription factor can be isolated and used to obtain the cloned gene which encodes the protein which interacts with the RNA-binding protein.","Cell-Free Assays","Alternatively, the indicator composition can be a cell-free composition that includes an RNA-binding protein, e.g., a cell extract from a cell expressing the protein or a composition that includes purified either natural or recombinant protein.","In one embodiment, the indicator composition is a cell free composition. Polypeptides expressed by recombinant methods in a host cells or culture medium can be isolated from the host cells, or cell culture medium using standard methods for protein purification. For example, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, ultrafiltration, electrophoresis, and immunoaffinity purification with antibodies may be used to produce a purified or semi-purified protein that may be used in a cell free composition. Alternatively, a lysate or an extract of cells expressing the protein of interest can be prepared for use as cell-free composition. Cell extracts with the appropriate post-translation modifications of proteins can be prepared using commercially available resources found at, for example Promega, Inc.","In one embodiment, compounds that specifically modulate an activity of an RNA-binding protein may be identified. For example, compounds that modulate an activity of an RNA-binding protein are identified based on their ability to modulate the interaction of an RNA-binding protein with a target molecule to which the RNA-binding protein binds, e.g., RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element. Suitable assays are known in the art that allow for the detection of protein-protein interactions (e.g., immunoprecipitations and the like) or that allow for the detection of interactions between a DNA or RNA binding protein and a target DNA or RNA sequence (e.g., electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNAse I footprinting assays and the like). By performing such assays in the presence and absence of test compounds, these assays may be used to identify compounds that modulate (e.g., inhibit or enhance) the interaction of an RNA-binding protein with a target molecule.","In the methods of the invention for identifying test compounds that modulate an interaction between an RNA-binding protein and a target molecule, the complete RNA-binding protein may be used in the method, or, alternatively, only portions of the protein may be used. For example, an isolated CCH-type tandem zinger finder domain or a KH domain may be used. An assay may be used to identify test compounds that either stimulate or inhibit the interaction between the an RNA-binding protein and a target molecule. A test compound that stimulates the interaction between the protein and a target molecule is identified based upon its ability to increase the degree of interaction as compared to the degree of interaction in the absence of the test compound and such a compound would be expected to, e.g., increase, the activity of an RNA-binding protein in the cell. A test compound that inhibits the interaction between the protein and a target molecule is identified based upon its ability to decrease the degree of interaction between the protein and a target molecule as compared to the degree of interaction in the absence of the compound and such a compound would be expected to, e.g., decrease, RNA-binding protein activity.","In one embodiment, the amount of binding of an RNA-binding protein to an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element in the presence of the test compound is greater than the amount of binding in the absence of the test compound, in which case the test compound is identified as a compound that enhances binding of an RNA-binding protein to an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element. In another embodiment, the amount of binding of the RNA-binding protein to an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element in the presence of the test compound is less than the amount of binding of an RNA-binding protein to an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element in the absence of the test compound, in which case the test compound is identified as a compound that inhibits binding of an RNA-binding protein to an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element.","For example, interaction, e.g., formation of a complex, of the test compound to an RNA-binding protein can be determined either directly or indirectly as described above. Determining the ability of an RNA-binding protein to interact with a test compound can also be accomplished using a technology such as real-time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) (Sjolander, S, and Urbaniczky, C. (1991) Anal. Chem. 63:2338-2345; Szabo, et al. (1995) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5:699-705). As used herein, \u201cBIA\u201d is a technology for studying biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BIAcore). Changes in the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) may be used as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules.","In one embodiment of the above assay methods, it may be desirable to immobilize either an RNA-binding protein or an RNA molecule comprising an RNA-binding protein recognition element for example, to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the molecules, or to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding to a surface can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Examples of Such vessels include microtitre plates, test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein can be provided in which a domain that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix is added to one or more of the molecules. For example, glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins or glutathione-S-transferase\/target fusion proteins can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) or glutathione derivatized microtitre plates, which are then combined with the test compound or the test compound and either the non-adsorbed target protein or RNA-binding protein, and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation (e.g., at physiological conditions for salt and pH). Following incubation, the beads or microtitre plate wells are washed to remove any unbound components, the matrix is immobilized in the case of beads, and complex formation is determined either directly or indirectly, for example, as described above. Alternatively, the complexes can be dissociated from the matrix, and the level of binding or activity determined using standard techniques.","Other techniques for immobilizing proteins on matrices can also be used in the screening assays of the invention. For example, proteins may be immobilized utilizing conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated protein or target molecules can be prepared from biotin-NHS(N-hydroxy-succinimide) using techniques known in the art (e.g., biotinylation kit, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.), and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin-coated 96 well plates (Pierce Chemical). Alternatively, antibodies which are reactive with protein or target molecules but which do not interfere with binding of the protein to its target molecule can be derivatized to the wells of the plate, and unbound target or SLIM protein is trapped in the wells by antibody conjugation. Methods for detecting such complexes, in addition to those described above for the GST-immobilized complexes, include immunodetection of complexes using antibodies reactive with an RNA-binding protein.","Test Compounds","A variety of test compounds can be evaluated using the screening assays described herein. The term \u201ctest compound\u201d includes any reagent or test agent which is employed in the assays of the invention and assayed. More than one compound, e.g., a plurality of compounds, can be tested at the same time in a screening assay. The term \u201cscreening assay\u201d preferably refers to assays which test the ability of a plurality of compounds to influence the readout of choice rather than to tests which test the ability of one compound to influence a readout. Preferably, the subject assays identify compounds not previously known to have the effect that is being screened for. In one embodiment, high throughput screening may be used to assay for the activity of a compound.","In certain embodiments, the compounds to be tested can be derived from libraries (i.e., are members of a library of compounds). While the use of libraries of peptides is well established in the art, new techniques have been developed which have allowed the production of mixtures of other compounds, Such as benzodiazepines (Bunin, et al. (1992). J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:10987; DeWitt et al. (1993). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 90:6909) peptoids (Zuckerman. (1994). J. Med. Chem. 37:2678) oligocarbamates (Cho, et al. (1993). Science. 261:11303), and hydantoins (DeWitt, et al. supra). An approach for the synthesis of molecular libraries of small organic molecules with a diversity of 104-105 as been described (Carell, et al. (1994). Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33:2059; Carell, et al. (1994) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33:2061).","The compounds of the present invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries, synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution, the \u2018one-bead one-compound\u2019 library method, and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, K. S. (1997) Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145). Other exemplary methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: Erb, et al. (1994). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 91:11422-; Horwell, et al. (1996) Immunopharmacology 33:68-; and in Gallop, et al. (1994); J. Med. Chem. 37:1233.","Exemplary compounds which can be screened for activity include, but are not limited to, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, small organic molecules, and natural product extract libraries.","Candidate\/test compounds include, for example, 1) peptides such as soluble peptides, including Ig-tailed fusion peptides and members of random peptide libraries (see, e.g., Lam, K. S., et al. (1991) Nature 354:82-84; Houghten, R., et al. (1991) Nature 354:84-86) and combinatorial chemistry-derived molecular libraries made of D- and\/or L-configuration amino acids; 2) phosphopeptides (e.g., members of random and partially degenerate, directed phosphopeptide libraries, see, e.g., Songyang, Z., et al. (1993) Cell 72:767-778); 3) antibodies (e.g., antibodies (e.g., intracellular, polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, anti-idiotypic, chimeric, and single chain antibodies as well as Fab, F(ab\u2032)2, Fab expression library fragments, and epitope-binding fragments of antibodies); 4) small organic and inorganic molecules (e.g., molecules obtained from combinatorial and natural product libraries); 5) enzymes (e.g., endoribonucleases, hydrolases, nucleases, proteases, synthatases, isomerases, polymerases, kinases, phosphatases, oxido-reductases and ATPases), and 6) mutant forms of molecules.","The test compounds of the present invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; spatially addressable parallel solid phase or Solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the \u2018one-bead one-compound\u2019 library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, K. S.

Biol. 222:301-310; Ladner supra.).","Compounds identified in the subject screening assays may be used, e.g., in methods of modulating embryogenesis, a parasitic associated state. It will be understood that it may be desirable to formulate such compound(s) as pharmaceutical compositions (described supra) prior to contacting them with cells.","Once a test compound is identified that directly or indirectly modulates, e.g., inhibits, an RNA-binding protein activity by one of the variety of methods described herein, the selected test compound (or \u201ccompound of interest\u201d) can then be further evaluated for its effect on cells, for example by contacting the compound of interest with cells either in vivo (e.g., by administering the compound of interest to a subject) or ex vivo (e.g., by isolating cells from the subject and contacting the isolated cells with the compound of interest or, alternatively, by contacting the compound of interest with a cell line) and determining the effect of the compound of interest on the cells, as compared to an appropriate control (such as untreated cells or cells treated with a control compound, or carrier, that does not modulate the biological response).","The instant invention also pertains to compounds identified in the subject screening assays.","III. Pharmaceutical Compositions","The invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., a compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Each of these compounds may be used alone or in combination as a part of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.","In one embodiment, the RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, is administered in combination with an additional agent, e.g., an anti-helminthic agent. The language \u201cin combination with\u201d an additional agent, e.g., an antihelminthic agent, includes co-administration of the compound with an additional agent, e.g., an antihelminthic agent, administration of the compound first, followed by administration of an additional agent, e.g., an antihelminthic agent, and administration of an additional agent, e.g., antihelminthic agent first, followed by administration of the compound. The compound can be administered substantially at the same time as the additional agent, e.g., antihelminthic agent, or at substantially different times as the additional agent, e.g., antihelminthic agent. Optimal administration rates for a given protocol of administration of the compound and\/or the additional agent, e.g., antihelminthic agent, can be readily ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage determination tests conducted with regard to the specific compounds being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, the particular site of administration and the like.","The phrases \u201canti-helmintic agent\u201d and \u201canti-helminthic agent,\u201d used interchangeably herein, include compounds that expel parasitic worms from the body of a subject. In one embodiment, the anti-helmintic agent is a vermifuge agent (e.g., a compound that stuns the parasitic worm prior to or substantially at the same time as the expelling). In another embodiment, the anti-helmintic agent is a vermicide (e.g., a compound that kills the parasitic worm prior to or substantially at the same time as the expelling). Examples of anti-helmintic agents include, but are not limited to, abamectin (e.g., Affirm\u00ae, Agri-Mek\u00ae, Avermectin\u00ae, Avid\u00ae, Vertimec\u00ae or Zephyr\u00ae), praziquantel (e.g., Biltricide\u00ae), albendazole (e.g., Albenza\u00ae, Eskazole\u00ae or Zentel\u00ae), diethylcarbamazine (e.g., Hetrazan\u00ae, Carbilazine\u00ae, Caricide\u00ae, Cypip\u00ae, Ethodryl\u00ae, Notezine\u00ae, Spatonin\u00ae, Filaribits\u00ae or Banocide Forte\u00ae), mebendazole (e.g., Ovex\u00ae, Vermox\u00ae or Antiox\u00ae), niclosamide (e.g., Niclocide\u00ae), ivermectin (e.g., Stromectol\u00ae, Mectizan\u00ae or Ivexterm\u00ae), suramin (e.g., Germanin\u00ae), thiabendazole (e.g., Mintezol\u00ae, Tresaderm\u00ae or Arbotect\u00ae), pyrantel pamoate, levamisole (e.g., Ergamisol\u00ae), triclabendazole, (e.g., Fasonex\u00ae) flubendazole (e.g., Flutelmium\u00ae, Flubenol\u00ae, Biovermin\u00ae or Flumoxal\u00ae), fenbendazole (e.g., Panacur\u00ae, Safe-Guard\u00ae or Panacur Rabbit\u00ae), octadepsipeptide (e.g., emodepside), piperazine derivatives, amino acetonitrile derivatives (e.g., monepantel, Zolvix\u00ae), oxamniquine (e.g., Vansil\u00ae or Mansil\u00ae), metrifonate (e.g., trichlorfon), bithionol, niridazole (e.g., Ambilgar\u00ae), stibophen, ciclobendazole, oxantel, pyrvinium, bephenium, desapidin and dichlorophen. One of skill in the art using conventional medical diagnoses would be able to determine the appropriate anti-helmintic agent to administer in combination with the RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., the compounds of a compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2.","The RNA binding modulatory compounds, e.g., compounds of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds disclosed herein that are basic in nature are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and palmoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The preparation of other compounds not specifically described in the experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the described reactions that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.","The RNA binding modulatory compounds, e.g., compounds of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, that are acidic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable base salts. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of those compounds that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such pharmaceutically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower alkanolamnionium and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines. The pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of the compounds that are acidic in nature may be formed with pharmaceutically acceptable cations by conventional methods. Thus, these salts may be readily prepared by treating the compounds disclosed herein with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutically acceptable cation and evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, a lower alkyl alcohol solution of the compounds of the invention may be mixed with an alkoxide of the desired metal and the solution subsequently evaporated to dryness.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d includes any carrier that is suitable for administration to a mammal.","These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microbes may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered to a subject, e.g., a non-human animal or a human, orally, parenterally, topically, rectally, nasally, intravaginally or intracisternally. They are, of course, given by forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, etc., administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal or vaginal suppositories.","The phrases \u201cparenteral administration\u201d and \u201cadministered parenterally\u201d as used herein include modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion.","The phrases \u201csystemic administration,\u201d \u201cadministered systemically,\u201d \u201cperipheral administration\u201d and \u201cadministered peripherally,\u201d as used herein, includes the administration of the RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIe, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the subject's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.","In some methods, the compositions of the invention can be topically administered to any epithelial surface. An \u201cepithelial surface\u201d includes an area of tissue that covers external surfaces of a body, or which lines hollow structures including, but not limited to, cutaneous and mucosal surfaces. Such epithelial surfaces include oral, pharyngeal, esophageal, pulmonary, ocular, aural, nasal, buccal, lingual, vaginal, cervical, genitourinary, alimentary, and anorectal surfaces.","Compositions can be formulated in a variety of conventional forms employed for topical administration. These include, for example, semi-solid and liquid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions or suspensions, suppositories, douches, enemas, gels, creams, emulsions, lotions, slurries, powders, sprays, lipsticks, foams, pastes, toothpastes, ointments, salves, balms, douches, drops, troches, chewing gums, lozenges, mouthwashes, rinses.","Conventionally used carriers for topical applications include pectin, gelatin and derivatives thereof, polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid polymers or copolymers thereof, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, or oxidized cellulose, guar gum, acacia gum, karaya gum, tragacanth gum, bentonite, agar, carbomer, bladderwrack, ceratonia, dextran and derivatives thereof, ghatti gum, hectorite, ispaghula husk, polyvinypyrrolidone, silica and derivatives thereof, xanthan gum, kaolin, talc, starch and derivatives thereof, paraffin, water, vegetable and animal oils, polyethylene, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, propanol, propylene glycol (glycols, alcohols), fixed oils, sodium, potassium, aluminum, magnesium or calcium salts (such as chloride, carbonate, bicarbonate, citrate, gluconate, lactate, acetate, gluceptate or tartrate).","Standard composition strategies for topical agents can be applied to the RNA binding modulatory compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in order to enhance the persistence and residence time of the drug, and to improve the prophylactic efficacy achieved.","For topical application to be used in the lower intestinal tract or vaginally, a rectal suppository, a suitable enema, a gel, an ointment, a solution, a suspension or an insert can be used. Topical transdermal patches may also be used. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of the compositions of the invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium.","Compositions of the invention can be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating carrier which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum or vagina to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax, polyethylene glycols, a suppository wax or a salicylate that is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent. Compositions which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, films, or spray compositions containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. The carrier employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be compatible with vaginal administration.","For ophthalmic applications, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the compositions can be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum. Exemplary ophthalmic compositions include eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like.","Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compound of the invention, carriers such as lactose, talc, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.","Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of an RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but typically include nonionic surfactants (e.g., Tweens, Pluronics, polyethylene glycol and the like), proteins like serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions. Generation of the aerosol or any other means of delivery of the present invention may be accomplished by any of the methods known in the art. For example, in the case of aerosol delivery, the compound is supplied in a finely divided form along with any suitable carrier with a propellant.","Liquefied propellants are typically gases at ambient conditions and are condensed under pressure. The propellant may be any acceptable and known in the art including propane and butane, or other lower alkanes, such as those of up to 5 carbons. The composition is held within a container with an appropriate propellant and valve, and maintained at elevated pressure until released by action of the valve.","Compositions of the invention can also be orally administered in any orally-acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and\/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of sucrose octasulfate and\/or antibiotic or contraceptive agent(s) as an active ingredient. A compound described herein may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added. Tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and\/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.","Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.","Suspensions, in addition to compounds of the invention, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.","Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention can be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents.","Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant. The RNA binding modulatory compound, e.g., compound of formula I, Ia, Ib, II, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VIa, VIb, VII, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, VIIe, VIIf or a compound of Table 1 or 2, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof will represent some percentage of the total dose in other dosage forms in a material forming a combination product, including liquid solutions or suspensions, suppositories, douches, enemas, gels, creams, emulsions, lotions slurries, soaps, shampoos, detergents, powders, sprays, lipsticks, foams, pastes, toothpastes, ointments, salves, balms, douches, drops, troches, lozenges, mouthwashes, rinses and others.","In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention may be administered prophylactically. For prophylactic applications, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be applied prior to potential infection.

M., Farley, B. M., McCoig, L. M. and Ryder, S. P. (2007) \u201cMolecular basis of RNA recognition by the embryonic polarity determinant MEX-5;\u201d 282, 8883-8894. The fragment of mex-5 containing the TZF domain (amino acids 236-350) was amplified from a commercially available ORFeome clone (Open Biosystems) and sub-cloned into the vector pMal-c (NEB), which encodes maltose binding protein as an N-terminal fusion. This construct is termed pMal-MEX-5 (236-350).","MEX-5 is expressed in JM109 liquid cultures grown at 37\u00b0 C. Cultures were induced during mid log phase by the addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and allowed to grow for three hours. An amount of 100 \u03bcM zinc acetate (final concentration) was added at the time of induction. The pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.8, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, EDTA free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche), 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc)) and lysed by sonication. The soluble protein was purified in three steps using standard chromatography methods: (1) amylose affinity (NEB), (2) Hi-TRAP-Q (GE Healthcare), and (3) Hi-TRAP-S (GE Healthcare). The Q buffer was composed of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 20 mM-1500 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc). The S buffer was composed of 50 mM MOPS, pH 6.0, 20 mM-1500 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc). The pure fractions, determined by coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, were dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mM NaCl, 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc), 2 mM DTT). The protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and the calculated extinction coefficient. The protein was stored at 50 \u03bcM concentration at 4\u00b0 C.","POS-1: The expression and purification of recombinant POS-1 protein has been previously described in Farley, B. M., Pagano, J. M. and Ryder, S. P. (2008) \u201cRNA target specificity of the embryonic cell fate determinant POS-1.\u201d RNA, 14, 2685-2697. The sequence encoding amino acids 80-180 of POS-1 was amplified from the corresponding ORFeome (Open Biosystems) clone via PCR and cloned in frame into the multiple cloning site of pHMTc, a derivative of pMal-c2x (NEB) that includes an N-terminal 6-his tag and a TEV protease site after MBP.","The protein was expressed from this construct in strain BL21 (DE3) Gold (Stratagene). The protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc)at mid-log phase. Cells were induced for three hours prior to harvesting and the cells were lysed and purified using an amylose column (NEB). The eluate was passed through a HiTrap SP column, and the collected flow through was purified over a HiTrap Q (GE Healthcare) column. The following buffers were used: Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc)), S buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 6.0, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc)), and Q buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 20 mM-750 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc)). The purified POS-1 was dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 25 mM NaCl, 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc), 2 mM DTT), concentrated to approximately 100 \u03bcM using a 30,000 MWCO spin concentrator (vivascience Group), and stored at 4\u00b0 C. for up to two months.","MEX-3: The sequence encoding amino acids 45-205 of MEX-3 was amplified from the ORFeome clone (Open Biosystems) and subcloned into pMal-c (NEB). MBP-MEX-3(45-205) was expressed and purified from BL21 (DE3) Gold (Stratagene) . A liquid culture grown at 37\u00b0 C. was induced at mid-log phase with 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside and grown for 3 hours before harvesting cells. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer and purified using amylose affinity resin (NEB), followed by a HiTrap Q and Source 15Q (GE Healthcare) columns at 4\u00b0 C. using the lysis buffer and Q-buffer outlined for MEX-5, above. The purified MEX-3 was dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) and stored at 4\u00b0 C. at a concentration between 30-50 \u03bcM.\n\nFluorescein-Labeled RNA Oligonucleotides:\n","All RNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon or Integrated DNA Technologies. Upon arrival, each RNA was deprotected and stored according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to use, the RNA was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, and the concentration determined by UV spectrophotometry using the calculated extinction coefficient at 260 nm based on the specific sequence. The sequence of the MEX-5 binding RNA (TCR2) is UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAA (SEQ ID NO:1). The POS-1 binding RNA (BMF018) is AACUAUUAUUAUUUGUUAUUCAUAUUUU (SEQ ID NO:2). The MEX-3 binding RNA (SEQ14) is CGAGCAGGAAGUGUGCAGAGUUUAGGACGU (SEQ ID NO:3).","The RNA used for the small molecule screen was labeled at the 3\u2032-end with fluorescein by Dharmacon during synthesis. In a few cases, follow up experiments were performed with post-synthetically labeled RNA. In this case, fluorescein 5-thiosemicarbazide (FTS C, Invitrogen) was used to 3\u2032-end label each RNA after treatment with sodium periodate (see Reines, S. A. and Cantor, C. R. (1974) \u201cNew fluorescent hydrazide reagents for the oxidized 3\u2032-terminus of RNA\u201d 1, 767-786). A representative 50 \u03bcl reaction consisted of 0.5 nanomoles RNA, 100 mM NaOAc, pH 5.1, and 5 nanomoles NaIO. After the reaction was complete (90 minutes at room temperature), the sample was ethanol precipitated by adding 1 \u03bcl RNase free glycogen (Invitrogen 20 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl), 1\/20volume of 5 M NaCl, and 2 volumes of 100% ice-cold ethanol. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of 100 mM NaOAc, pH 5.1 containing 1 mM FTSC and was allowed to react overnight at 4\u00b0 C. in the dark. The unreacted label was removed by ethanol precipitation with resuspension of the pellet in a small volume of TE, and purification over a Roche G-25 size exclusion spin column. The labeling efficiency is determined by calculating the ratio of fluorescein absorbance at 490 nm to RNA-fluorescein absorbance at 260 nm. Typical efficiencies are 60-80%.","Screening Protocol:","MEX-5: The ability of MEX-5 to associate with RNA was monitored by fluorescence polarization using a victor V3 or victor V2V plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in 384-well FluoTrak microplates (Grenier). Each plate contained 320 wells with 32 no protein control wells and 32 no compound control wells. The concentration of MEX-5 and fluorescein-labeled TCR2 RNA was chosen to maximize signal to noise while maintaining sub-saturation binding. The final concentration of reagents in each experimental well was 120 nM MBP-MEX-5, 2 nM TCR2 RNA, 192 \u03bcM test compound, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl 0.01% IGEPAL CA-360, 0.01 mg\/mL tRNA from (Sigma, 2000 Units) and 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc). The Z-value calculated for each plate from the no protein and no compound controls ranged between 0.8 and 0.9 (see Zhang, J. H., Chung, T. D. and Oldenburg, K. R. (1999) \u201cA Simple Statistical Parameter for Use in Evaluation and Validation of High Throughput Screening Assays\u201d 4, 67-73).","Each day, two stock solutions were prepared, a protein mix and an RNA mix. The protein mix contained 200 nM MBP-MEX-5 dissolved in 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc). The RNA mix contained 5 nM labeled TCR2 RNA, 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 0.025% IGEPAL CA-360 (Sigma), 0.025 mg\/mL tRNA, and 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc). A 96-pin liquid handling robot was used to transfer 2 \u03bcL of 2 mM stock of test compound dissolved in DMSO into 320 wells of a microplate. The remaining 84 wells were filled with 2 \u03bcL of DMSO (no protein and no compound controls). Subsequently, a \u03bcFill plate dispenser was used to transfer 30 \u03bcL of protein stock into the plate 352 wells of the plate. The remaining 32 wells received 30 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM Zn(OAc)(no protein controls). Finally, The \u03bcFill plate dispenser was used to transfer 20 \u03bcL of RNA stock into all 384 wells of the plate.","The apparent polarization (mP) of each well of the plate was determined using victor V3 or victor V2V plate reader. Each plate was measured in triplicate with a measurement time of 0.4 seconds per well, an excitation band pass filter of 480\u00b131 nm, and an emission band pass filter of 535\u00b140 nm. The data was processed with Microsoft Excel and Wavemetrics Igor Pro. The well score was defined by the following equation:\n\nSCORE=(mP\u2212mP)\/(mP\u2212mP)\n\nCompounds with a score of less than or equal to 0.25 (75% inhibition) where the fluorescence intensity (S) is within 2-fold of the control wells were identified as compounds capable of modulating, e.g., inhibiting, the RNA binding activity of MEX-5.\n\nPOS-1: POS-1 inhibitor screening proceeded using the protocol described above, except MBP-POS-1 and BMF018 RNA were used in place of MEX-5 and TCR2 RNA.\n\nMEX-3: MEX-3 screening proceeded as above with the following modifications. MBP-MEX-3 protein and SEQ14 RNA were used in place of MEX-5 and TCR2 RNA. The final concentration of MBP-MEX-3 was reduced to 80 nM in each well, thus the concentration in the protein stock was reduced to 133.3 nM. Zinc acetate was not used in the either the RNA stock or the Protein stock.\n","Results of the screening assays for each of MEX-5, POS-1 and MEX-3 are shown below in Table 2. Table 2 provides those test compounds which were identified as modulators, e.g., inhibitors, of the RNA binding activity of MEX-5, POS-1 and\/or MEX-3, and includes the corresponding scores (where the lowest score correlates to the greatest inhibition) for each compound that were obtained in the assays for each of MEX-5, POS-1 and MEX-3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0528","num":"0527"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"238pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

order to further evaluate the ability of a particular RNA binding modulatory compound identified herein to inhibit embryogenesis, e.g., in a nematode, the compounds identified herein are tested in a standard hermaphrodite worm reproduction assay s.

Adult worms are removed or killed. Finally, the ratio of dead eggs to hatchlings is determined by inspection with a stereomicroscope.","A further dose response assay was performed on select compounds of the invention as described below. A sub-saturating concentration of MEX-5 or POS-1 (120 nM) was equilibrated with limiting fluorescein labeled RNA (2-3 nM, TCR2 RNA or MEX-3 UTR fragment RNA respectively) in the presence of varying concentrations of compound. Following equilibration, the reactions were loaded onto a 5% slab polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis for about 1 hour to separate protein-RNA complex from free RNA. The gel was scanned on a FUJI FLA-5000 imager, and the fraction of bound RNA determined by dividing the intensity of the bound RNA by the intensity of the bound RNA plus the free RNA. The fraction of the compound bound to the protein was plotted as a function of compound concentration and fit to a sigmoidal dose response function in order to determine the IC, the concentration that gives half maximal inhibition.
