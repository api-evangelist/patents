title: Method of treating fluid containing vapor phase metals, vapor phase metal compounds, or both
abstract: Perlite, particularly, perlite in powdered form, is employed to adsorb metals and metal compounds from fluids, in particular gases at elevated temperature. Treatment of perlite by boiling with sulfuric acid or suspending in a suspension of sulfur in carbon disulfide has been shown to significantly expand the surface area of perlite, thus increasing the efficiency of the process. In select embodiments, powdered perlite is treated to expand its surface area and injected into a fluid stream, such as flue gas, held for a specific retention period, and removed for subsequent disposal. In other embodiments powdered perlite is provided in an adsorption bed. Fluids containing metals or metal compounds in vapor form are permitted to pass through the adsorption bed until the expanded perlite powder is saturated (exhausted) with the metal and metal compounds adsorbed thereon. The perlite is then replaced, disposing of the exhausted perlite.

Developmental work was conducted under the task orders DACA42-01-T-0109 and DACA42-02-P-0088 in a contract titled \u201cPreliminary Investigation of Removal of Lead and Mercury Vapor Using Perlite or Modified Chitosan Coated Perlite Powder.\u201d The contract was between the Nuclear Science and Engineering Institute, University of Missouri-Columbia, Mo. 65211 and the U.S. Army Engineering Research and Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory, Champaign, Ill. This patent and related ones are available for licensing. Contact Bea Shahin at 217 373-7234.","This application claims the benefit of prior co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/525,843, Perlite Sorbents for Vapor Phase Metals and Metal Compounds, by Hay et al., filed Dec. 1, 2003, and is related to U.S. Pat. No. 7,524,494 B2, Method for Surface Treating Perlite Sorbents for Improved Adsorbing of Vapor Phase Metals and Metal Compounds at Elevated Temperatures, issued Apr. 28, 2009, both incorporated herein by reference.","The amount of heavy metals contained in flue gases released from high temperature incinerators, such as demilitarization furnaces operated by the U.S. Government and its contractors, is monitored and controlled in accordance with EPA regulations. A typical air pollution control technique is to inject activated carbon or its modified form (activated carbon impregnated with various chemicals) as sorbents into the flue gas or the combustion chamber to capture the metal vapors. The carbon is then separated from the flue gas in a downstream filter system. Chen, S., Rostam-Abadi, M., and R. Chang. -, Book of Abstracts, 216ACS National Meeting, Boston, Aug. 23-27, 1998.","As an example, the U.S. Army operates and maintains deactivation furnaces for conventional and chemical munitions demilitarization operations. These furnaces are subject to the Hazardous Waste Combustor (HWC) National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). The HWC NESHAP has stringent standards for lead and mercury emissions among various other volatile and semi-volatile metals and toxic organic compounds. Existing incinerators are currently not to exceed 240 micrograms\/dry standard cubic meter (\u03bcg\/dscm) for lead and cadmium emissions. The current compliance standard is set at 24 \u03bcg\/dscm for new incinerators. These metal emissions exist as vapors near the furnace and afterburner in the air handling system. Thus a desired technology is one that adsorbs these metals while they exist as vapors at the high temperature locations in the air handling system before they condense to form sub-micron particulates that are extremely difficult to capture by conventional filtration systems. Existing adsorbent technologies are not effective at high temperatures and even if they could be made more effective they would be too costly to employ in this application.","A number of studies exist on the removal of lead vapor from a gas stream. Yang et al. (2001) reported a method of reducing volatile lead emissions from waste incineration by high temperature capture of vapor phase metals before they condense into fine particles. Packed bed sorption experiments with calcinated kaolin at 973-1173\u00b0 C. were conducted. Lead reacts with the sorbent to form water insoluble lead-mineral complexes. Increased bed temperature resulted in increased capture rates, but it had no effect on maximum uptake. Diffusional resistance developed in the interior of the porous kaolin particles. This resistance became limiting only after the conversion of lead-kaolin reached a value greater than 50%. Yang, H., Yun, J., Kang, M., Kim, J., and Y. Kang; ; Korean J. Chem. Eng., 18(4), 499-505, 2001.","Vapors of lead chloride were removed by adsorption on a bed of AlOat 570-650\u00b0 C. The concentration of lead was measured during the adsorption process by low-energy radiation. The rate of adsorption increased with the flow rate. The amount adsorbed at saturation depended on the internal surface area of the adsorbent as well as on the particle size. Aharoni, C., Neuman, M., and A. Notea; Ind. Eng. Chem., Process Des. Dev. 14(4), 417-421, 1975.","Wronkowski (1965) reported adsorption of tetraethyl lead on two kinds of activated carbons at 18\u00b0 C. with partial pressure in the range 0.03-0.9 atmospheres. The amount adsorbed depended on the specific surface of the given carbon and on the structure of its pores. Wronkowski, C., , Gaz. Woda Tech. Sanit., 39(4), 131-132, 1965.","Uberoi and Shadman (1990) evaluated several sorbents for removal of lead compounds, mainly PbCl. The sorbents were silica, alpha-alumina, and natural kaolinite, bauxite, emathlite, and lime. The experiments were carried out at 700\u00b0 C. At this temperature PbClchemically reacted with the sorbent producing both water soluble and insoluble compounds. The authors provided relative sorption capacity, with kaoline giving the best result. Uberoi, M. and M. Shadman; -; AIChE J., 36, 307, 1990.","Wey and his coworkers studied the adsorption mechanisms of heavy metals, including lead, on silica sands using a fluidized bed system at the temperature range of 600 to 800\u00b0 C. Within this temperature range chemical reactions rather than a physical adsorption are preferred. They noted that for lead, both chemical and physical adsorption mechanisms are all-important depending on the reacting environment. Saturation adsorption capacities of silica sand for lead were 16.08 mg\/g at 600\u00b0 C. and 12 mg\/g at 800\u00b0 C. Chen, X., Feng, X., Liu, J., Fryxell, G. E., and M. Gong. -(), Sep. Sci.

These metals may be contained in high temperature flue gases, for example. A further embodiment of the present invention encompasses the perlite or surface-modified perlite used as the sorbent. As a sorbent, it may be injected into the fluid containing the metal in vapor form, such as a flue gas, placed in a fixed bed through which the metal in vapor form passes, or both. Surface-modified perlites may be used as high-temperature sorbents but are not limited to that application.","Perlite is an aluminosilicate material derived from volcanic rocks.

Adsorption capacity of perlite for lead vapors, particularly when using sulfuric-acid treated perlite, is very high in comparison to conventional sorbents employed at similar temperatures. The stability and surface characteristics of perlite make it extremely well suited for high temperature applications. The resultant \u201ccontaminated sorbent\u201d can be easily vitrified or encapsulated and safely disposed.","Perlite and modified perlites are capable of adsorbing metal in a vapor or gaseous phase. The surface area of un-modified perlite is relatively low leading to a physical limitation on the amount of metal it may adsorb. Perlite may be activated by using strong alkalies and strong acids, either alone or in one or more series combinations. Steam activation may be used in batch treatment using high pressure-high temperature steam. Thus, coating the surface of perlite with appropriate chemicals enhances the adsorption capacity of perlite. Because of its physicochemical stability above 1000\u00b0 F. and its lightweight, perlite is suitable for sorbent injection-type control technology near the entrance to the flue stack of furnaces.","Steam activation, using a Parr Autoclave (Parr Instrument Co., 211 53St., Moline, Ill. 61265) or similar apparatus may be employed in a batch mode using high temperature-high pressure steam. Perlite may be activated using KOH, NaCO, HCl, HSO, and HNO, and a combination of acid followed by alkali treatment. The activated perlite may be treated with sulfur and sulfur in CS. Approximately 20% by mass of elemental sulfur, and 0.1 M solution of sulfur in CSmay be used.","The adsorption capacity of pure perlite and some surface-modified perlites for lead vapors in argon has been evaluated at 100, 200 and 350\u00b0 C. Generally, 3.0 M solutions are used to treat the perlite.","Perlite was treated with the following chemicals for testing: sulfur, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sodium hydroxide. Various sources of sulfur were used, including sulfuric acid, direct sulfur impregnation, and impregnation with sulfur dissolved in carbon disulfide. Various treatments for modifying perlite were investigated.","HCl treated perlite: 50 grams of expanded perlite was boiled with 500 ml of 3.0 M HCl for about two hours at 100-110\u00b0 C. After cooling, the mixture was filtered and washed with distilled water until the filtrate was free from chloride ions. The product was then dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","NaOH treated perlite: 25 grams of expanded perlite was boiled with 250 ml of 3.0 M NaOH solution at 100-110\u00b0 C. for two hours. After cooling, the pH of the suspension was adjusted to 2.0 by adding 1:1 (v\/v) HCl with stirring. The suspension was allowed to stand for 24 hours and then it was filtered and washed with distilled water until the filtrate gave a negative test for chloride ions. It was then dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","HCl and NaOH treated perlite: 25 grams of HCl treated perlite was suspended in 250 ml of 3.0 M NaOH solution and boiled at 100-110\u00b0 C. for two hours. The pH of the suspension was adjusted by adding 1:1 (v\/v) HCl with stirring. The suspension was allowed to stand for 24 hours. The suspension was filtered and washed with distilled water until the filtrate showed the absence of chloride ions. It was then dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","HNOtreated perlite: 25 grams of expanded perlite was boiled with 250 ml of 3.0 M HNOfor about two hours at 100-110\u00b0 C. After cooling, the mixture was filtered and washed with distilled water until the filtrate was neutralized. The product was then dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","HSOtreated perlite: 25 grams of expanded perlite was suspended in 250 ml of 2.0 M HSOand boiled for about two hours at 100-110\u00b0 C. The product was filtered, washed with distilled water until the filtrate was neutralized, and dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","Elemental sulfur impregnated perlite: 20 grams of perlite was mixed with 5 grams of elemental sulfur and heated to about 400-500\u00b0 C. in a furnace under an argon atmosphere for about 15 minutes.","Cs+sulfur-impregnated perlite: 25 grams of perlite was suspended in 250 ml of 0.125 M solution of sulfur in CSfor 24 hours. The CSwas evaporated at room temperature by passing argon gas through the suspension and the resultant product was dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a surface-modified perlite sorbent may be prepared as follows: About 25 grams of expanded perlite is suspended in 250 ml of two-molar sulfuric acid (2.0 M HSO) and boiled for about two hours at 100-110\u00b0 C. The resultant modified perlite is then filtered, washed with distilled water until the filtrate is neutralized, and dried in an oven at 110\u00b0 C.","Refer to , depicting the schematic diagram of a dynamic adsorption apparatus  used to determine the metal vapor adsorption capacity of perlite, modified perlite, and conventional sorbents, such as activated carbon (charcoal).","Lead vapor in the concentration level of a few \u03bcg\/mwas obtained by using a first furnace  to heat a small amount of pure lead metal granules  in a stainless steel container . Air\/argon from a gas bottle  was released from the bottle  by a first valve  and controlled via a first flow controller  before flowing to a second valve  at the entrance of the container . By flowing the gas through the container , lead vapor (not shown separately) from the heated lead granules  is swept out the other side of the container  into insulated tubing  that is provided with a three-way switching  for either collecting the vapor product, e.g., in a scrubber, or sending it to a tube  that serves as an adsorption bed for a sorbent of interest , from whence the \u201ccleaned\u201d vapor may be sent to a scrubber. Air\/argon or other suitable gas may also be provided from the first valve  to a second flow controller  and second valve  for direct injection into the tube , depending on the need for maintaining a pre-specified temperature, flow regime, or conditioning the sorbent . A second furnace  is used to maintain a pre-specified temperature in the adsorption bed (tube) . Because vapor pressure is a function of temperature, the temperature and gas flow rate determines the concentration of lead vapor in the final gas stream, thus this dynamic adsorption apparatus  is fitted with means to adjust both gas stream flow and temperature.","An adsorption bed constructed of a 2.54 cm (1-in.) I.D. stainless steel tube  was used. A pre-specified amount of sorbent , such as perlite or modified perlite, was placed between two layers of glass wool (not shown separately). The lower layer of glass wool supports the sorbent  while the upper layer prevents the carry-over of sorbents  from the adsorption bed (tube) . The outside surface of the tube  and the tubing  were wrapped uniformly with a heating tape and three layers of insulating tape (not shown separately) to reduce heat loss. The temperature of the tube  was controlled. Prior to each run, the sorbent  in the tube  was regenerated at 473.15 K for 12 hours with a dry air flow rate of 250 cm\/min to remove moisture and other pollutants that might have been adsorbed on the sorbent  before it was placed in the tube . Following regeneration, the tube  was adjusted to the desired adsorption temperature. The flow rate was controlled using a mass flow controller , . Air\/nitrogen was first passed through the vapor generation system , . After about one hour, the flow was diverted towards the tube  using the three-way switching valve . After a pre-specified time, the adsorption run was stopped and a sample of the \u201ccontaminated adsorbent\u201d was collected for analysis using the Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) method.","Refer to  for results of the evaluation of the sorption capacity at 200\u00b0 C. of perlite, HSO-perlite, activated carbon, HNO-perlite, HCl\/NaOH-perlite, S-perlite, NaS-perlite, and CS\/S-perlite. Untreated perlite removed lead in the range of 1000 to 1706 \u03bcg Pb\/g of perlite at 350\u00b0 C. Sulfur-treated perlite samples showed higher capacity for removal than other treated samples. Among the sulfur-treated samples, the sample that was treated with sulfuric acid showed highest capacity for lead sorption, yielding from about 2000-4700 \u03bcg Pb\/g of perlite with a maximum of 4634 \u03bcg Pb\/g of perlite at 200\u00b0 C. It is likely that lead is both chemically and physically bound to the sulfuric acid-treated perlite.","Refer to , showing that capacity for sorption of lead onto the sulfuric acid-treated perlite increased with increasing temperature up to about 220\u00b0 C.","While the invention has been described in terms of its preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the claims. For example, an embodiment of the present invention has potential applications for treating gaseous emissions from burning fossil fuels as well as industrial emissions containing heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury.
