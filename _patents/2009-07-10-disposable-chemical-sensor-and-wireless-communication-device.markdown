{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation in part of the prior filed, non-provisional application Ser. No. 11\/183,314, filed Jul. 15, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,577,405. This application repeats a substantial portion of prior filed application Ser. No. 11\/183,314, filed Jul. 15, 2005, and adds and claims additional disclosure not present in the prior filed application.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The invention relates to chemical sensor devices and is directed more particularly to a disposable chemical sensor and temperature device which may be dropped into building rubble or other such areas not readily accessible by rescue personnel, to test the environment in the rubble.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The need for this invention is driven by the inability to determine the safety of the environment under the rubble of a collapsed building or other structure prior to initiating rescue operations. There have been experiments with disposable microphones and cameras which may be dropped into the rubble of collapsed buildings, and the like, to aid search and rescue teams to hear survivors over the surface noise levels caused by heavy lift cranes, air hammers, bull dozers, and large numbers of rescue workers.","It has become apparent that there is a need for disposable devices of similar nature, but which are adapted for wireless two-way communication and control to obtain information concerning the environment prior to disturbing an area under the rubble and gives an indication of the likelihood that the area is a candidate for finding survivors. In addition, it would provide two-way communication between a survivor trapped in the rubble and a surface rescue worker, such that a survivor can be alerted to the fact that he should presently make a sound and can react in a manner to make known his\/her presence.","An object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a disposable wireless two-way radio device which may be dropped into a rubble pile and which, by its weight and shape, will tend to drop down well into the rubble before coming to rest.","A further object of the invention is to provide such a device adapted to broadcast a voice message or other signal from a rescue worker at the surface to a location in which the device has come to rest, and to transmit any voice or other message detected by the device back to the rescue worker.","A further object of the invention is to provide such a device adapted to remote sensing of conditions such as temperature and dangerous or toxic chemical gasses.","With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the invention is the provision of a disposable radio communication, chemical sensor and temperature sensor device comprising a body defining an enclosed chamber, a power source mounted in the chamber, an on-off switch mounted on the body and accessible from outside the body, a processor mounted in the chamber and powered by the power source, a transceiver mounted in the chamber and in communication with the processor, a temperature sensor mounted on the exterior of the body and in communication with the processor, and one or more chemical sensors mounted on the exterior of the body and in communication with the processor. A speaker is mounted in the body and is provided with a face portion substantially co-extensive with an outer surface of the body, the speaker being in communication with the processor, and a microphone is mounted in the body and in communication with the processor. The transceiver is adapted to receive a voice signal or other sound signal, from a remote unit and input the signal to the speaker for broadcast, and the microphone is adapted to receive a sound signal from outside the body and input the received signal to the processor for transmittal by the transceiver to the remote unit.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , there is illustrated a disposable chemical sensor and wireless communication device  representing an embodiment of the invention including a body , preferably of a spherical configuration designed to be rugged enough to with stand impacts and other crushing forces, defining an enclosed chamber . In a preferred embodiment the body is made of a hard metal such as titanium or metal alloy such as titanium and steel, and is reinforced with internal supports  of the same material. The body is weighted  to keep it oriented in a particular spatial plane.","A power source  is mounted in the chamber  and may comprise one or more dry cell batteries. A processor on-off switch  is mounted on the body  and is accessible from outside of the body to turn on a digital processor  which, when turned on, is powered by the power source . The processor  serves as a controller of the constituent parts of the disposable chemical sensor and wireless communication device  and can receive data from the parts as input. A transceiver  is in communication with the processor  and is provided with an antenna  for communications between the transceiver  and a remote unit (not shown).","A broadcast speaker  is mounted on the body  and is provided with a face portion  which is substantially co-extensive with the spherical surface of the body . The speaker  is in communication with and controlled by the processor . A chemical sensor  capable of detecting toxic chemicals is mounted on the body  and is provided with a face portion  which is substantially co-extensive with the spherical surface of the body . The chemical sensor  is in communication with and controlled by the processor . A temperature sensor  is mounted on the body  and is provided with a face portion  which is substantially co-extensive with the spherical surface of the body . The temperature sensor  is in communication with the processor .","At least once microphone , and preferably a plurality of microphones of the type shown in , is mounted on the body . The microphones  are in communication with the processor .","The transceiver  is adapted to receive a voice signal from a remote unit (not shown) and input the signal to the processor  and thence to the speaker  for broadcast. The microphones  are adapted to receive any voice or other sound message from outside the body  and input the received message to the processor  for transmittal by the transceiver  to the remote unit. The broadcast signal may be from a rescue worker at the remote unit, or a recording, urging survivors to utter or tap out a sound. The sound signal is typically a voice message, but may be a metallic \u201cping\u201d, or hand clap, or any other noise which a survivor is capable of producing.","An orientation sensor  is disposed in the chamber  and is in communication with the processor  for providing to the rescue worker an indication as to the direction from which a voice or other sound signal reaches the body . In an alternative embodiment, a motorized weight displacement system  will shift the weighting of the body to cause it to move in a desired direction if the device should come to rest in an undesirable location.","In operation, the switch  is moved by an operator to the \u201con\u201d position which starts operation of the processor , which draws power from the power source . The body  is dropped into a void in a rubble area. Because of the shape and weight of the body, it tends to roll and bounce through openings in the rubble until coming to a stop. Upon receipt of a voice message from a rescue worker at a remote site, the speaker  begins broadcasting the message into the surrounding rubble. The processor  continues operation of the speaker , the transceiver , and the microphones  as long as there is power provided by the power source . At the same time, one or more chemical sensors  and the temperature sensor  are attempting to detect any potential toxic gases and measure the temperature of the surrounding environment in the rubble of the collapsed building. In practice, a number of the devices  are tossed into a rubble pile, all in communication with the remote unit.","There is thus provided a disposable chemical sensor and wireless communication device  which may be dropped into a rubble pile and which tends to drop deep into the pile, and which sends any sounds emanating from the area surrounding the device to a remote station for alerting rescue workers to the presence of a survivor and detects the presence of toxic gaseous chemicals and the temperature of the surrounding environment.","The broadcast message would be of the sort urging any survivor hearing the message to make a voice noise or any other kind of noise the survivor is capable of generating.","Any such response to the broadcast message is picked up by one of the microphones  and is routed by the processor  to the transceiver , which sends the response to the remote unit, alerting rescue personnel to the presence of one or more survivor in a given area. The orientation sensor  provides an indication as to the attitude of the body , whether right side up, upside down, or the like. The processor  and transceiver  provide an indication as to which microphone  has received the most pronounced signal. The rescue workers, knowing roughly the location of the body , are thereby enabled to start a search in the likeliest location of a survivor. The chemical sensor  and temperature sensor  provide information concerning the environment to the processor  which then transmits the information via the transceiver  to the rescue workers at the remote unit.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawing in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
