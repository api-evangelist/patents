title: User configurable alarms and alarm trending for process control system
abstract: Various graphical displays for plant process operators are provided which combine aspects of alarm priority and alarm age to assist operators in making better choices in responding to alarms. The disclosed graphical displays provide improved contextual information about specific alarms and the relationships with other alarms in the same control module, equipment module, etc. Hierarchically organized presentations of active alarms and alarm age profiles are also provided to assist operators in evaluating causes of “alarm floods” in chain reactions within complex process environments. Various types of alarm or display alerts are also provided for improved monitoring of processed conditions and changes in process controls.

More specifically, a user interface for a process control system is disclosed that enables the operator to modify, configure and manipulate alarm notifications to show alarm priority, alarm age, details about a specific alarm including alarm profiles, as well as perform alarm trending and superimposing alarm profiles over graphic displays using workstation monitors as well as handheld wireless devices.","Process control systems are widely used in factories and\/or plants in which products are manufactured or processes are controlled (e.g., chemical manufacturing, power plant control, etc.) Process control systems are also used in the harvesting of natural resources such as, for example, oil and gas drilling and handling processes, etc. Virtually any manufacturing process, resource harvesting process, including agriculture, can be automated through the application of one or more process control systems.","The manner in which process control systems are implemented has evolved over the years. Older generations of process control systems were typically implemented using dedicated, centralized hardware. However, modem process control systems are typically implemented using a highly distributed network of workstations, intelligent controllers, smart field devices, and the like, some or all of which may perform a portion of an overall process control strategy or scheme. In particular, most modern process control systems include smart field devices and other process control components that are communicatively coupled to each other and\/or to one or more controllers via one or more digital data busses. Of course, many of these modern process control systems may also include non-smart field devices such as, for example, 4-20 milliamp (MA) devices, 0-10 volts direct current (VDC) devices, etc., which are typically directly coupled to controllers as opposed to a shared digital data bus or the like.","In any event, field devices include, for example, input devices (e.g., devices such as sensors that provide status signals that are indicative of process control parameters such as, for example, temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc.), as well as control operators or actuators that perform actions in response to commands received from controllers and\/or other field devices. For example, a controller may send signals to a valve to increase pressure or flow, to a heater or chiller to change a temperature, to a mixer to agitate ingredients in a process control system, etc.","Obviously, in a complicated process system, a large number of different field devices are transmitting data which eventually is presented at an operator's workstation. Further, all of the field devices either directly present \u201calarms\u201d to an operator's workstation or the signals transmitted by the field devices are interpreted by software which results in an alarm being sent to an operator's workstation. An operator may receive a large number of alarms during a typical shift. Because most process systems are configured so that alarms are sent in advance of the need for a corrective action as opposed to after a serious problem has been created. Therefore, because an operator may receive a large number of \u201cpreemptive\u201d alarms during a shift, operators are often in need of ways to prioritize the alarms received at their workstations. Thus, there is a need for graphical interface software that enables operators to prioritize alarms and make choices in responding to alarms when the number of alarms being received at the operator's workstation is excessive and there are too many to be handled at once.","Another problem associated with currently available user interfaces for process control systems is the lack of contextual information about a specific alarm when the alarm is presented at the user interface or monitor. Specifically, typical systems include an alarm banner disposed at the bottom of the screen whereby all of the information about the physical plant component and the alarm, including the date and time are presented on a single line. As a result, limited information is provided to the operator at a first glance. The operator must then manipulate the screen to receive additional information and make a judgment as to what appropriate action is needed and at what time (i.e., now or later). It would be helpful to provide an operator with improved information about a specific alarm that includes which other active alarms are present in the same control module, equipment module or operator unit. In short, there is a need for improved alarm contextual information which provides operators with additional information regarding other active alarms thereby enabling operators to better understand individual alarms in context of other active alarms.","Another problem associated with alarm signals of process control systems is, simply put, organization. Specifically, due to the large number of field devices sending alarm signals, an operator can be overwhelmed with the sheer number of alarm signals. This situation is commonly referred to as a \u201calarm flood.\u201d The cause of an alarm flood may be a chain reaction of problems occurring within a system. To better evaluate and take corrective action when an alarm flood is occurring, there is a need for improved organization of multiple alarms wherein the alarms are organized hierarchically with age profiles so that an operator can more easily determine the cause of the alarm flood in the \u201cleading edge\u201d of the alarm flood.","Another problem confronted with operators of complex systems involves the number of alarms received and the ability to anticipate problems before they occur. Specifically, there is a need for operators to provide themselves with \u201cdisplay alerts\u201d that would provide operators with specific information used to augment the alarm systems currently available. Specifically, such display alerts could be shift or session specific and could provide tactical alert information enabling an operator to anticipate problems. Such tactical display alerts could also provide one-time operational targets or help the operator ensure that the expected control system response is being achieved.","In satisfaction of the aforenoted needs, a color display encoding method and software is disclosed that combines an indication of alarm priority and alarm age and allows the operator to manipulate the display of other details regarding an alarm.","In an embodiment, a disclosed alarm \u201cdetail display\u201d combines information about a selected alarm, with information about other alarms active in the same control module, as well as parent control objects (equipment modules, units, etc.) and plant areas, including a means to navigate displays providing more information about those control objects.","In an embodiment, alarm monitoring displays are disclosed that are suitable for wireless and\/or handheld devices (e.g., a \u201cPocket PC\u201d or a \u201cPDA\u201d).","In an embodiment, dynamically configurable \u201cdisplay alerts\u201d are disclosed that supplement the \u201cpermanent\u201d alarms in the process control system to monitor \u201cone-time\u201d conditions or operations progress. Such display alerts include, but are not limited to: \u201ctarget\u201d alerts for control parameters to assist in maintaining a constant target value (+\/\u2212 an acceptable error) for a specified period of time; \u201crange\u201d alerts to ensure a control parameter stays within specified limits; \u201cramp\u201d alerts to ensure a control parameter changes in a linear way to a new target value and within the expected time period; and summary displays for \u201cdisplay alerts\u201d for defining and identifying which alerts are running, and the current status of said alerts.","In an embodiment, hierarchical \u201calarm profile\u201d displays are disclosed which are intended to point out where and when the heaviest alarm activity is taking place. Such alarm profile displays can provide a warning or indication of when operators face \u201calarm floods.\u201d In a refinement, the alarm profile displays can indicate active alarm counts vs. alarm age. In another refinement, the alarm profiles can include a selectable time span for: (a) all or selected alarms, (b) all or selected plant areas, (c) all or selected equipment units, and\/or equipment modules. In another refinement, the alarm profile displays can include alarm summaries by alarm age, thereby making it easy to identify the still active alarms that occurred on the \u201cleading edge\u201d of the \u201calarm flood\u201d","In an embodiment, various means for automatically superimposing alarm profiles in the form of a temporary display layer on process graphic displays are disclosed which includes means for finding graphical elements associated with control units, equipment modules, etc. so that alarm profiles can be seen in the spatial context of plant equipment schematics and in process graphical display formats that are familiar to operators.","It should be understood that the figures are not to scale and that various graphical displays are illustrated in partial, diagrammatic and fragmentary views. In some figures, details may have been omitted which are not necessary for an understanding of this disclosure or which render other details difficult to perceived. It should be understood, of course, that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments or graphical displays illustrated herein.","Turning to , a single monitor workstation graphic display is illustrated wherein the screen  includes an alarm panel , a system status panel , a main display area , a tool-panel  and a selector panel . In the screen  shown in , the alarm panel  indicates a moderate priority alarm for the control valve identified as FIC- and with an object shown at  in  which is a primary inlet to the reactor , also shown in . The alarm is indicated at  in . In an embodiment, the color of background of the alarm panel  may indicate when the alarm was activated. For example, a white or clear background could be used for very recent alarms while colored backgrounds could be used for alarms that have been active for an excess of one hour and a dark or black background could be used for alarms that have been active for eight or more hours. The summary shown in the alarm banner  for FIC- is created by clicking the \u201ci\u201d button  next to the indicator  in . For additional information, the operator can click the \u201ci+\u201d button  in  to produce the floating display .","The display logic for the button  captures the module name \u201cFIC-\u201d for the alarm currently selected in the alarm banner  and constructs a calling informational string of \u201cDisplay=\u2018DvAlarmInfo\u2019; Module=\u2018FIC-\u2019\u201d and then passes it on to the workspace function \u201cOPEN_DISPLAY.\u201d The DvAlarmInfo display was configured with a panel category of ALARMINFO. In the framework utilized herein, there is a single floating panel configured to be an ALARMINFO category target so that the floating panel is chosen for the DvAlarmInfo display. If another display is currently open, it is closed to open the display  as shown in  when the button  is pressed.","The display logic in a \u201cDvAlarmInfo\u201d display such as that shown at  in  requires a module name for it's launch information. Finding \u201cFIC-\u201d, it uses that name in calls to the data services layers to obtain information about the valve  labeled FIC- (see ) and it's containing unit and equipment modules. With an understanding of the alarm situation in valve FIC-, and its related modules, the operator closes the \u201cDvAlarmInfo\u201d floating panel , and looks at the primary control display for FIC- as shown in , by pressing the button  in the alarm banner .","Still referring to , by way of example only, the display logic for the alarm banner  buttons captures the module name (\u201cFIC-\u201d) and constructs a calling info string of \u201cPanel=\u2018MAIN\u2019; Module=\u2018FIC-\u2019; Select=\u201cFIC-\u201d; KeepARScrollOneDim\u201d, and then passes the string to workspace function \u201cOPEN_PCD\u201d. The OPEN_PCD function resolves the primary control display name \u201cREACTOR_TOP\u201d for module \u201cFIC-\u201d. It then asks the workspace to resolve PANEL=\u2018MAIN\u2019, and to replace the display currently in that panel with REACTOR_TOP. REACTOR_TOP originated through an import of a P&ID drawing from another system, so it's native aspect ratio is much wider than the MAIN panel  in the current framework. A \u201cKeepARScrollOneDim\u201d directive says that the aspect ratio for REACTOR_TOP should be maintained while scaling it to fill the MAIN panel , with scroll bars for portions of the display that wont fit.","The Select=\u201cFIC-\u201d directive is forwarded to \u201cREACTOR_TOP\u201d telling it to resolve the \u201cbest\u201d selectable graphic object associated with \u201cFIC-\u201d and automatically give it selection focus (scrolling the display as necessary so the selected object is visible and as centered in the MAIN panel as possible.) The presence of the \u201cKeepARScrollOneDim\u201d and \u201cSelect\u201d directives overrides the default workspace behavior which remembers the scaling and scroll position last used on a display, for when it is opened again in the same user\/session.","After looking at \u201cnear by\u201d alarm conditions and process measurements, the operator chooses to make an adjustment to the setpoint on FIC-, and watch how that control loop reacts. The faceplate display  shown in  is the ideal interface for what the operator has in mind, so he pushes the FIC- button  which is still in the alarm banner . The display logic for the faceplate button  captures the module name (\u201cFIC-\u201d) associated module, constructs a calling info string of \u201cModule=\u2018FIC-\u2019\u201d, then passes it to workspace function \u201cOPEN_FPD\u201d.","The OPEN_FPD function resolves the faceplate display name \u201cPID_LOOP_FP\u201d for module \u201cFIC-\u201d. The \u201cPID_LOOPFP\u201d display  was configured with a panel category of \u201cFP\u201d. In the current framework, there are two floating panels configured to be an \u201cFP\u201d targets, both are currently empty, so floating panel  on the left is chosen as it was placed ahead of the other floating panel in the floating panel \u201cuse order\u201d configuration. An instance of the PID_LOOP_FP display  is opened there, passing it the launch information: \u201cModule=\u2018FIC-\u2019\u201d.","The display logic in the \u201cPID_LOOP_FP\u201d display  expects a module name to be in it's launch information. Finding \u201cFIC-\u201d, it uses that name in calls to the data services layers identify the parameters in FIC- it will be reading. Several parameter\/field values from the valve FIC- (see  in ) are used repeatedly in the FIC- display , most notably the scaling parameter associated with the pressure value \u201cPV\u201d and system pressure \u201cSP\u201d parameters. The \u201cpre-update\u201d logic for \u201cPID_LOOP_FP\u201d read the EU and EU values, engineering units string and decimal places information and stores them in \u201clocal display variables\u201d which can be referenced by any of the graphic elements in \u201cPID_LOOP_FP\u201d. In short order, a new instance of \u201cPID_LOOP_FP\u201d appears in the floating panel initially located at its anchor point.","Turning to , if the operator thinks a significant system pressure change is appropriate and using the nudge up  or down  buttons won't do, the operator can push on the button  indicating the set point value. The display logic for the system pressure button  click is to ask the workspace to provide a standard numeric data dialog. The \u201cPID_LOOP_FP\u201d display of  is designed to also be used in workspaces running on PDAs, so it constructs a parameter info string of \u201cInParentDisplay; DockBottom; Title=\u2018FIC-\/PID\/SP.CV\u2019\u201d and passes it to the workspace function \u201cNumericDataEntry\u201d. The NumericDataEntry workspace function sees that the workspace was launched with a \u201cShowKBOnScreen\u201d preference (perhaps running on a hardware where the keyboard is not always present), so it chooses an instance of the standard numeric data dialog with an on screen keypad. The workspace resolves the dimensions and location of this instance of the PID_LOOP_FP display, and locates the dialog box at the bottom of the faceplace display.","The operator can enter a new value for the setpoint in the box . The operator then sees the new value for setpoint reflected in the value shown on the setpoint button  and is assured that the controller is now using\/reporting the new setpoint value. The mode shown in  is in AUTO so the confirms some changes in the control (valve) output, and shortly thereafter the pressure starts moving in the desired direction.","In , the operator can use a three monitor workspace with screens . When a new alarm appears in the alarm banners or the operator can recognizes the \u201ctag\u201d appearing in the banner and can confirms the module description. To correct a problem upstream of FIC- see ), the operator can push the left faceplate button  in  to view upstream components. With a three monitor display of , the operator can put a copy of the upstream display in one of the empty panes - in the left monitor screen . To accomplish this, the operator pushes the \u201ccopy panel content\u201d button  in the toolbar over the main panel . The display logic behind the copy panel content button  prepares a parameter information string of \u201cPanel=MAN\u201d and calls the workspace function CopyPanelContent. The Copy PanelContent function captures the display name currently in the specified panel, the launch information used to create that display, and the current scaling, and scroll position settings.","The operator then pushes a \u201cpaste\u201d button, e.g., , in the combined information and tool button bar  of an empty panel, for example the panel , of the left monitor or screen . The paste button  essentially prepares a parameter information string of \u201cPanel=\u2018<my panel id>\u2019; UseSourceScale\u201d, and calls the workspace function that \u201cpaste copied panel contents\u201d to \u201cthis\u201d panel (in this case ). The new instance of the display, with the original launch information is opened in the panel . The scaling of the source display is preserved, but since the panel is half the size of the source panel, the view is centered on the center point of the source view, and horizontal and vertical scroll bars appear.","Turning to , an operator or operations supervisor monitor the system using a PDA . As shown in , the operator can keep the \u201cTOP_ALARMS\u201d display open in the main panel . The TOP_ALARMS display can be closed by pressing the \u201cTop\u201d button  in the toolbar panel  as shown in .","In , the PDA  produces an alarm banner  and, optionally, a warning-level alarm sound. The operator can push the \u201ci+\u201d button  to check for other alarms in this module, equipment module, and unit. The display logic for the \u201ci+\u201d button  of a PDA  is designed to call up the ALARMINFO display for the selected module. Normally the ALARMINFO display would be retrieved from the DEFAULT subtree under the display configuration storage root directory. However, this workspace was started with the launch information \u201cDisplayPref=PDA\u201d, so it will attempt to find a display definition named ALARMINFO in subtree named PDA, before looking for it in the DEFAULT subtree.","Returning a single workstation as shown in , as one example, the operator has been noticing intermittent deviation alarms on the primary inlet flow control loop for reactor  (RXTR ). Observing the primary control display for reactor , an operator could conclude that the deviation alarm occurs when demand peaks for a few minutes as a result of new production rates. To retrieve information on the inlet flow feed pump VSPMP-, the operator clicks oh the graphic object  representing the pump VSPMP- to generate the display of . The pump object  in the display of  may be taken from a standard library of graphic objects and can be configured to be a selection target, and when selected, to indicate selection with a dashed box around the pump VSPMP- as shown in  and the pump's tag string, and also to make the button visible that opens the runtime object browser application. Clicking on the pump VSPMP- or object  around the pump VSPMP- gives feedback that it is selected in the form of , and the object browser button appears.","In  the operator can review various information about the pump VSPMP-. The first section  has information about the specific pump including location, ID tag number, and physical specifications. A button  is available here to open the \u201cOperations Journal\u201d application for the pump VSPMP-. Another button  is provided to access the Asset Management Solutions (AMS) software data for the device VSPMP-. The second section  contains information about the type and class of pump including buttons - to access the manufacturer's operating guidelines documentation, drawings, or identification pictures, and training documents such as standard procedures such as operating and maintenance procedures. The third-section  provides location information and the fourth section  allows the operator change the display  to other upstream or downstream objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 11-17","FIG. 11","FIG. 9","FIG. 11"],"b":["1","71","14","10","1","72"]},"If the operator desires \u201ctarget alert\u201d he or she selects tab . The parameter that needs to be set for the alert on is already inserted into the box  due to the process change. The operator sets an initial delay of 1 hour by appropriately filling in the box , before checking that the target value of 720\u00b0 has been reached. A different target value may be entered in the box  if necessary and an acceptable deviation band (+\/\u22125 degrees) is entered into the box . The alert check duration of 1 hour (making sure the temperature doesn't drop or overshoot for at least an hour after the target is achieved) is entered into the box . If the operator doesn't have anything more to do when this alert is removed, the \u201cacknowledge\u201d box may be cleared. The remaining boxes in the display  are self explanatory and will not be described in detail here. When finished with the target alert, the operator hits the \u201cadd display alert\u201d button . The display  closes and a runtime workspace adds the new display alert. In an hour, the controller will start checking that the value for TI\/-\/AIN.CV is 720 (+\/\u22125) degrees, and continue for the next hour. After that point, the target alert shown in  will automatically remove itself.","Turning to , a range alert may be desired to check in change in output or throughput. After clicking on the button , the dialog  appears, but operator can switch to the range alert tab  as shown in . If a flow rate of 112 gpm is desired, the operator can set upper and low range limits in the boxes ,  for the display alert. If a flow rate of 112.2 gpm has already been established so there is no need for an initial delay on the display alert and the boxes - are left blank. Also, if the product is to be made for an extended period of time exceeding a shift change, the boxes - can be left blank as well and clicking on the button  can institute the range alert.","A ramp alert is illustrated in . If a large tank needs to be filled, the operator can pull up the tank farm process display, and uses the object browser application to get the link to the product movement procedure checklist. After manually opening and closing the appropriate block valves, the operator can start the pump and verify a steady flow measurement as the product is transferred to the tank. In , a ramp alert is set for a plan to achieve a level of 360 inches (see box ) in the destination tank that level will be achieved in 12 hours (see box ) based upon a target flow rate.","With no discharges planned, operator expects a steady increase of the level of the tank from its present measurement, to the target over the next 12 hours. Rather than set a target alert (with no checking going on for 12 hours), a ramp alert can be chosen instead by clicking on the tab  to check for a steady \u201cramped\u201d measurement throughout the next 12 hours. Since the next shift operator will need to shut off the transfer pump and close valves, the current operator checks the \u201cacknowledge before removing\u201d box  so the completed alert will get the next operator's attention. The operator also adds a comment in box  to remind the next operator what needs to be done.","To check the display alerts described in , the operator presses a \u201cdisplay alerts status\u201d button  in the tool bar  (or alarm banner panel  or elsewhere). This button  replaces the content of the main panel  with the display alerts status application shown in , where the three display alerts of  are summarized. Comparing , the target flow rate of 110-115 gpm of  is not being achieved at the point in time represented in  thereby producing a warning indicator  while the target rate was being met in . Also, the target temperature of 720\u00b0 set in  was not met in  but met in .","As shown in , during a subsequent shift, the new operator may push the display alerts status button  () to review what the previous shift had left him. , would show a single display alert left over, so the operator presses the show details button  to get the information shown in  indicating a level of 315 inches in the tank, still short of the desired 360 inches.","After a couple of hours, the operator would notice a display alert indicator in the alarm banner  area had turned white and began flashing. After opening the display alert status display, the display of  would appear to indicate that the ramp alert of  has been completed, and requires acknowledgment. The operator would then acknowledge the completed display alert and press the button for the primary control display for LI-TF-PRD so that the transfer pump can be stopped and the transfer valves reset.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIGS. 18-20","FIG. 18","FIG. 18","FIG. 19"],"b":["110","14","13","111","112","115","112","116"]},"In , the chart  of  becomes the upper chart in , with the charts for the five most active units\/equipment modules in the plant area disposed below the chart , three of which are shown at -.  shows that nearly all the new alarms are coming from the reactor  unit in chart .
