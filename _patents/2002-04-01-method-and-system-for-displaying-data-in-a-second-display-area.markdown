title: Method and system for displaying data in a second display area
abstract: A method for creating and accessing a graphical user interface in the overscan area outside the area of the display normally visible to users of the common operating systems. This normal display area is generally known as the “desktop”. The desktop serves as the graphical user interface to the operating system. The desktop displays images representing documents and applications available to the user (icons). The desktop is restricted in the common environments to a predetermined set of resolutions (e.g., 640×480, 800×600, 1024×768) as defined by VGA and SuperVGA standards. Displayable borders outside this area are the overscan.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This invention relates to computer user interface displays and the use of the overscan border to present a user interface beyond the perimeter of a standard user interface display.","There was a time when the most popular operating system for personal computers (DOS) did not include a graphical user interface. Any company could create a \u201cmenu\u201d or \u201cshell\u201d which would be the first program launched upon starting the computer and which would present options to the user for launching and managing various applications. Although graphics programming was difficult in the DOS environment, some companies even created graphical user interfaces which could then launch other programs.","Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., introduced such a graphical user interface for launching applications which it called \u201cWindows\u201d. The first three versions of Windows were merely applications which ran under DOS and could be one of numerous items to be selected from a previously running shell or menu which might be offered by a company other than Microsoft. This continued to allow other companies to offer primary user interface programs to users without the user going through a Microsoft controlled user interface.","However, with the introduction by Microsoft of Windows 95\u2122, the initial loading of the operating system presents a Microsoft developed graphical user interface at the outset which occupies the entire screen display. Microsoft arranged with manufacturers of the standard computer hardware to include this operating system with each computer sold. With Microsoft's domination of this market, it became impossible for other software vendors to present an interface to users other than as a Microsoft style icon within the Microsoft \u201cdesktop\u201d consisting of the entire screen display. This prompted a need for access to a user interface which could be presented outside of the standard computer screen display and therefore independent of the dictates of Microsoft for items within its \u201cdesktop\u201d.","Standard personal computers use VGA or Super VGA or XGA video display systems. These display systems operate in standardized modes such as 640\u00d7480 pixels, 800\u00d7600 pixels, 1024\u00d7768 pixels, and 1280\u00d71024 pixels. When one of these display modes is selected, this is the entire area available for display. In the Microsoft Windows environment, the user instructs the Windows operating system to select one of these standard display modes and the Windows operating system then presents all of the applications and their icons within the selected display area. There is no way to cause the Windows \u201cdesktop\u201d to use less than the entire display area and still function as intended and allow another program from another vendor to control the remainder.","The invention is a method for adding a user interface border beyond the standard screen display area. The VGA, SVGA and XGA video systems include a defined border surrounding the display area. The original purpose of this border was to allow adequate time for the horizontal and vertical retrace of the electron gun in a cathode ray tube display. However, as retrace speeds have increased in modern monitors, it is now possible to present a user interface display in this border. The border which can be controlled as a user interface is a portion of what is known as the \u201coverscan\u201d. This invention is a method for presenting a user interface in the overscan.","When the electron gun in a CRT retraces to the left of the screen or the top of the screen, it requires a significant amount of time relative to the presentation of a scanned line of data. During the retrace, the electron gun is turned off (\u201cblanked\u201d). If the blanking time required for the retrace is equal to the amount of time available, there is no usable overscan. However, modern monitors have become much faster in their retrace speeds, leaving a significant amount of time when the electron gun need not be blanked, allowing a displayable border. In the prior art, although the border is usually \u201cblack\u201d (the gun is turned off), it is well-known to specify that the border shall be given any one of six colors. Standard BIOS allows a specification of this color. The desired color is simply specified in one of the registers for the video controller. No data for this color is stored in the buffer of video memory for the display. This invention establishes an additional video buffer for the border and allows his buffer to be written with display data like the regular display buffer. The display area is thereby expanded, on one or more edges, to provide a visible area previously invisible. The pixels within this newly visible area of the display are made accessible to programs though an application programming interface (API) component of this invention. A program incorporating a graphical user interface may be displayed in the previously blanked area of the display, functionally increasing the accessible area of the display without hardware modification.","The invention is a method for displaying an image on a video display system in an overscan area outside of the display area generated by the video display system. The standard display area is defined by two dimensions, each specifying a number of pixels. These dimensions are specified by selecting a video \u201cmode\u201d. The method is accomplished by adjusting parameters for the video display system to increase the number of pixels in at least one dimension of the display system. The number of pixels which is added is less than or equal to the difference between the number of pixels specified in the video mode and a maximum number of pixels which the video display system can effectively display. This difference is the overscan. Because all interface displays are created by writing a desired image to a buffer or memory for the video display, the method requires allocating additional video display memory for the increased pixels. The image written to such memory is then displayed by the system alongside the original display area.","In the preferred embodiment, only the vertical dimension is increased and the overscan user interface is presented below the standard display area. Alternatively, the horizontal dimension may be increased and the overscan user interface displayed to the right of the standard display area. Similarly, the interface image may be displayed on any or all of the four sides of the standard display area.","User input causing movement of a pointer or cursor on the display will move the cursor or pointer to the edge of the display area. The tip of the pointer will stop at the edge most pixel. A transparent window is created which includes the window of the overscan user interface and the adjoining two pixels of the display area. To allow events to be captured in the overscan area, the pointer is displayed off-set from the hotspot such that the hotspot remains within a two pixel-wide area of the standard display on the edge of the display and captured user events which occur while the hotspot is within the two pixel edge of the standard display adjoining the overscan user interface are interpreted as occurring within the overscan area.","Generally speaking, the present invention discloses a programming mechanism and interface in a computer system which provides access and visibility to a portion of the monitor display normally ignored and inaccessible (hereinafter \u201coverscan area\u201d).  shows a standard prior art display desktop running Microsoft Windows95\u2122. Within the desktop  are the taskbar  and desktop icons . In the preferred embodiment, a graphical user interface image is painted onto one or more of the sides of the overscan area as shown in .  show depictions of a SuperVGA display with the addition of a graphical bar user interface displayed in the overscan area. The overscan user interface bar  is defined to reside outside the borders of the \u201cdesktop\u201d display area . In , the display is modified to include a graphical user interface  in a bar 20-pixels high below the bottom edge. In , the display is modified to include a graphical user interface in four bars each 20-pixels high\/wide outside each of the four display edges: a bottom bar , a left side bar , a right side bar , and a top bar .","The overscan interface may include, and is not limited to, buttons, menus, application output controls (such as a \u201cticker window\u201d), animations, and user input controls (such as edit boxes). Because the overscan interface is not obscured by other applications running within the standard desktop, the overscan interface may be constantly visible or it may toggle between visible and invisible states based upon any of a number of programming parameters (including, but not limited to, the state of the active window, the state of a toggle button, etc).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["61","64","66","67","68","60","62","63"]},"The invention provides a method of painting and accessing an area of the computer display not normally accessible in graphics modes.

The determination is based upon a number of parameters, such as whether the current resolution, step , reflects a standard value or previous programmatic manipulation, step . If a standard resolution is already set, the variables are reset to include the specified border areas, step . The CRTC registers are incremented, step , to modify the scanned and blanked areas of the display. If the top or side areas are modified, existing video memory is moved accordingly in subsequent step  of FIG. .","If any of the foregoing routines returns a failure, the program prompts the user for a preference as to whether \u201cwindowed-mode\u201d should be used or the program should exit, step .","Phase 2 of the invention begins by painting the new images into a standard offscreen buffer, step , as is commonly used in the art, and making the contents visible, step , as described in FIG. . If the program is in \u201cwindowed-mode\u201d, step , the offscreen buffer is painted into the standard window client space, step , and made visible, step , using generic windowing-system routines. Otherwise, the linear window position address is mapped, step , as described in  which has been previously explained. Once the linear memory is mapped to a physical memory address, step , again using DPMI, the contents of the offscreen display buffer can be copied into the video buffer directly, step  of FIG. .","The preferred embodiment application includes a standard application message loop, step , which processes system and user events. An example of a minimum functionality process loop is in FIG. . Here the application handles a minimal set of system events, such as painting requests, step , system resolution changes, step , and activation\/deactivation, step . Here, too, is where user events, such as key or mouse events, may be handled, step , detailed in FIG. . System paint messages are handled by painting as appropriate into the offscreen buffer, step , and painting the window or display buffer, step , as appropriate, as described earlier in FIG. . System resolution messages are received whenever the system or user changes the screen or color resolution. The programs reset all registers to the correct new values, then changes the display resolution, step , as earlier described in , to reflect the new resolution modified. User messages are ignored when the program is not the active application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIG. 5"],"b":["186","41","30","43","188","45","47","190","45","192","43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["124","126","128","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
