title: Rural services platform
abstract: A middleware platform is executable by a computer to receive a request for a service, the service provided by a service application in communication with the middleware platform. The middleware platform determines, via a device adaptation component of the middleware platform, capabilities of a device subject to the request. The middleware platform selects an interface having a format that is compatible with the capabilities of the device, and provides the interface to the device in a format corresponding to the capabilities, accesses the service application responsive to the request, processes the request, and returns a response, via the interface, to the device responsive to the processing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to computer-based service delivery, and more specifically, to a rural services platform for providing services to rural locations.","In a typical census, various geographical locations are defined by their population densities. For example, the United States Census Bureau defines a rural area as open country having settlements with fewer than 2,500 residents. Areas designated as rural can have population densities as high as 999 per square mile or as low as 1 person per square mile. As much as 80 percent of the United States' population has been classified as rural. Catering to the needs of populations living in rural communities, whether they live in the United States or in other countries abroad, presents many challenges due to, for example, difficulty in physically accessing geographically dispersed populations, financial constraints in providing low-cost and affordable services, and limited communication infrastructure. In many rural locations, these populations are known to produce less income and commonly receive fewer services than their urban counterparts.","In an effort to address these concerns, many types of organizations (e.g., non-governmental organizations, or NGOs) have been established that seek to reach out to communities that may not otherwise receive the goods and services enjoyed by more densely populated communities. Oftentimes, this means traveling to these areas to work face-to-face with rural community members.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a system for providing services to a rural region is provided. The system includes a computer and a middleware platform executable by the computer. The middleware platform includes components configured in logic to implement a method. The method includes receiving a request for a service, the service provided by a service application in communication with the middleware platform. The method includes determining, via a device adaptation component of the middleware platform, capabilities of a device subject to the request. The method further includes selecting an interface having a format that is compatible with the capabilities of the device, and providing the interface to the device in a format corresponding to the capabilities. The method also includes accessing the service application responsive to the request, the service application including one or more of a banking application, a micro-finance application, an insurance application, and an employment application. The method also includes processing the request, and returning a response, via the interface, to the device responsive to the processing.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for providing services to a rural region is provided. The method includes receiving a request for a service, the service provided by a service application in communication with a middleware platform. The middleware platform is executable by a computer and includes components configured in logic. The method also includes determining, via a device adaptation component of the middleware platform, capabilities of a device subject to the request. The method further includes selecting an interface having a format that is compatible with the capabilities of the device, and providing the interface to the device in a format corresponding to the capabilities. The method also includes accessing the service application responsive to the request, the service application including one or more of a banking application, a micro-finance application, an insurance application, and an employment application. The method also includes processing the request, and returning a response, via the interface, to the device responsive to the processing.","According to a further embodiment of the present invention, a computer program product for providing services to a rural region is provided. The computer program product includes a storage medium having computer-readable instructions embodied thereon, which when executed by a computer in the rural region, cause the computer to implement a method. The method includes receiving a request for a service, the service provided by a service application in communication with a middleware platform configured with the computer-readable instructions. The method also includes determining, via a device adaptation component of the middleware platform, capabilities of the device, selecting an interface having a format that is compatible with the capabilities of the device, and providing the interface to the device in a format corresponding to the capabilities. The method also includes accessing the service application responsive to the request, the service application including one or more of a banking application, a micro-finance application, an insurance application, and an employment application. The method further includes processing the request, and returning a response, via the interface, to the device responsive to the processing.","According to yet a further embodiment of the present invention, a system for providing services to a rural region is provided. The system includes a computer and a middleware platform executable by the computer. The middleware platform includes components configured in logic to implement a method. The method includes processing a transaction, via a service application of a back-end system, the service application communicating with an end user device through the middleware platform. The transaction processing includes conducting communications relating to the transaction with the end user device via one of a text and voice component of the middleware platform, synchronizing data from the transaction with the service application, via a synchronization component of the middleware platform, and completing the transaction by communicating the synchronized data over a connector coupled to the back-end system.","Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features, refer to the description and to the drawings.","According to an exemplary embodiment, rural services and a rural service platform are provided. The rural service platform is a low cost shared model that brings interactive technologies used by a consumer or moderated by a facilitator for the consumer in order to provide financial, advisory, and business services to a rural populace. The rural services can be used by business correspondents who go into remote or rural villages to disburse payments, and by consumers directly (e.g., to conduct transactions through a voice channel). The rural services are configured to provide an array of services across industries, such as banking, finance, agriculture, health care, and education, in a scalable architecture thereby reducing the cost of delivery. The term rural, is used herein in context with a location or region, and specifies an under-populated or sparsely populated area that lacks the resources and services offered by its urban counterparts (e.g., technologic, economic, and\/or other resources, such as banking, healthcare, insurance, education, and transportation, to name a few).","At least a portion of the rural services may be implemented on a cloud infrastructure as middleware and resources that enable dynamic over-the-Internet provisioning of scalable and virtualized resources. This allows a platform provider of the rural services to optimize its cost initially when the number of services and\/or users is few, while supporting scalability as the number of services\/users grows. Moreover, this may increase the overall reliability and performance of the entire system.","It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing, implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather, embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.","For convenience, the Detailed Description includes the following definitions which have been derived from the \u201cDraft NIST Working Definition of Cloud Computing\u201d by Peter Mell and Tim Grance, dated Oct. 7, 2009, which is cited in an IDS filed herewith, and a copy of which is attached thereto.","Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics, at least three service models, and at least four deployment models.","Characteristics are as follows:","On-demand self-service: a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service's provider.","Broad network access: capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).","Resource pooling: the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).","Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.","Measured service: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.","Service Models are as follows:","Software as a Service (SaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based e-mail). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.","Platform as a Service (PaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.","Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).","Deployment Models are as follows:","Private cloud: the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.","Community cloud: the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.","Public cloud: the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.","Hybrid cloud: the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).","A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.","Referring now to , a schematic of an example of a cloud computing node is shown. Cloud computing node  is only one example of a suitable cloud computing node and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the invention described herein. Regardless, cloud computing node  is capable of being implemented and\/or performing any of the functionality set forth hereinabove.","In cloud computing node  there is a computer system\/server , which is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with computer system\/server  include, but are not limited to, personal computer systems, server computer systems, thin clients, thick clients, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputer systems, mainframe computer systems, and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","Computer system\/server  may be described in the general context of computer system-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer system. Generally, program modules may include routines, programs, objects, components, logic, data structures, and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system\/server  may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.","As shown in , computer system\/server  in cloud computing node  is shown in the form of a general-purpose computing device. The components of computer system\/server  may include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a bus  that couples various system components including system memory  to processor .","Bus  represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnects (PCI) bus.","Computer system\/server  typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system\/server , and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media.","System memory  can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM)  and\/or cache memory . Computer system\/server  may further include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/non-volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only, storage system  can be provided for reading from and writing to a non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media (not shown and typically called a \u201chard drive\u201d). Although not shown, a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk (e.g., a \u201cfloppy disk\u201d), and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable, non-volatile optical disk such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances, each can be connected to bus  by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below, memory  may include at least one program product having a set (e.g., at least one) of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments of the invention.","Program\/utility , having a set (at least one) of program modules , may be stored in memory  by way of example, and not limitation, as well as an operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. Each of the operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data or some combination thereof, may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules  generally carry out some of the functions and\/or methodologies of embodiments of the invention as described herein.","Computer system\/server  may also communicate with one or more external devices  such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a display , etc.; one or more devices that enable a user to interact with computer system\/server ; and\/or any devices (e.g., network card, modem, etc.) that enable computer system\/server  to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via I\/O interfaces . Still yet, computer system\/server  can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network (LAN), a general wide area network (WAN), and\/or a public network (e.g., the Internet) via network adapter . As depicted, network adapter  communicates with the other components of computer system\/server  via bus . It should be understood that although not shown, other hardware and\/or software components could be used in conjunction with computer system\/server . Examples, include, but are not limited to: microcode, device drivers, redundant processing units, external disk drive arrays, RAID systems, tape drives, and data archival storage systems, etc.","Referring now to , illustrative cloud computing environment  is depicted. As shown, cloud computing environment  comprises one or more cloud computing nodes  with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers, such as, for example, personal digital assistant (PDA) or cellular telephone A, desktop computer B, laptop computer C, and\/or automobile computer system N may communicate. Nodes  may communicate with one another. They may be grouped (not shown) physically or virtually, in one or more networks, such as Private, Community, Public, or Hybrid clouds as described hereinabove, or a combination thereof This allows cloud computing environment  to offer infrastructure, platforms and\/or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A-N shown in  are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes  and cloud computing environment  can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and\/or network addressable connection (e.g., using a web browser).","Referring now to , a set of functional abstraction layers provided by cloud computing environment  () is shown. It should be understood in advance that the components, layers, and functions shown in  are intended to be illustrative only and embodiments of the invention are not limited thereto. As depicted, the following layers and corresponding functions are provided:","Hardware and software layer  includes hardware and software components. Examples of hardware components include mainframes, in one example IBM\u00ae zSeries\u00ae systems; RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture based servers, in one example IBM pSeries\u00ae systems; IBM xSeries\u00ae systems; IBM BladeCenter\u00ae systems; storage devices; networks and networking components. Examples of software components include network application server software, in one example IBM WebSphere\u00ae application server software; and database software, in one example IBM DB2\u00ae database software. (IBM, zSeries, pSeries, xSeries, BladeCenter, WebSphere, and DB2 are trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation registered in many jurisdictions worldwide)","Virtualization layer  provides an abstraction layer from which the following examples of virtual entities may be provided: virtual servers; virtual storage; virtual networks, including virtual private networks; virtual applications and operating systems; and virtual clients.","In one example, management layer  may provide the functions described below. Resource provisioning provides dynamic procurement of computing resources and other resources that are utilized to perform tasks within the cloud computing environment. Metering and Pricing provide cost tracking as resources are utilized within the cloud computing environment, and billing or invoicing for consumption of these resources. In one example, these resources may comprise application software licenses. Security (not shown) provides identity verification for cloud consumers and tasks, as well as protection for data and other resources. User portal provides access to the cloud computing environment for consumers and system administrators. Service level management provides cloud computing resource allocation and management such that required service levels are met. Service Level Agreement (SLA) planning and fulfillment provide pre-arrangement for, and procurement of, cloud computing resources for which a future requirement is anticipated in accordance with an SLA.","Workloads layer  provides examples of functionality for which the cloud computing environment may be utilized. Examples of workloads and functions which may be provided from this layer include: mapping and navigation; software development and lifecycle management; virtual classroom education delivery; data analytics processing; transaction processing; a mobile desktop for mobile devices (e.g., A, C, and N, as well as mobile nodes  in cloud computing environment ) accessing the cloud computing services, and rural services , to name a few.","In an exemplary embodiment, a rural services application  in the workloads layer  implements the rural services described herein. The rural services may be implemented as many different applications or as components within a single application, as will be described herein. For purposes of illustration, the rural services are shown in  as being implemented by a single application (i.e., rural services application ).","The rural services application  operates as a middleware tool for facilitating a variety of functions and tasks in furtherance of the rural services. These functions and tasks are implemented through an application layer  as, e.g., banking services, insurance services, healthcare services, micro-finance, and employment, to name a few. The rural services application  provides security, synchronization, device management and integration, communications, analytics, and customer profile management functions for end users and related parties, as will be described further in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","500","400","500"]},"The client-side platform  may be implemented in hardware and software. The client-side platform  includes device middleware  and a set of applications  (e.g., shown in  as banking, micro-finance, insurance, and employment) offered to rural consumers (e.g., users ). It will be understood that other applications  may be implemented such as, by way of non-limiting examples, those shown in the application layer  of .","The rural consumers  may interact through a variety of devices, such as kiosks , point-of-sale (PoS) terminal , and mobile communication devices  (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, laptops, netbooks, etc.). In addition, one or more of these devices may be operated by a business correspondent . A business correspondent may be an agent or broker of a service provider (e.g., a service provider providing the services directed to one of the applications ). The devices , , and  may correspond to the devices A-N of .","In the exemplary client-side platform , each of these devices , , and  executes the device middleware , which in turn provides a common set of features to applications  executing on this middleware . The device middleware  includes a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) through which applications  communicate with the middleware components, which components will now be described. The middleware  includes a device integration component  that hides the heterogeneity typically associated with APIs across devices for accessing various device capabilities such as a fingerprint reader, scanner, printer, etc. Also, a device adaptation component  provides capabilities to identify devices by their characteristics and transparently adapt an application (e.g., one of applications ) based on the device (e.g., one of the devices , , and . For example, a user interface of the application (e.g., application ) can be transparently adapted to suit the device on which it is executing. This makes the application portable across these devices.","The rural services client-side platform  provides support for disconnected operations, e.g., no network connectivity and unreliable power supply. The rural services' middleware  includes a sync agent  that allows the applications  to work in a disconnected mode and then synchronizes the data when connectivity is available For example, a user of one of the devices , , and  is executing one of the applications  offline, and the offline activities are logged and recorded locally by the devices (e.g., in internal memory). When the sync agent  determines that the device is connected to a network, the sync agent  synchronizes the data in the local storage with a corresponding server in the network. Also, the since the middleware  is available on a host of battery-operated devices (e.g., netbooks, handheld devices, etc.), it does not require access to a continuous and reliable power supply. The device middleware  also includes a device agent  that provides remote management of these devices through an administrator who may install new applications remotely, push updates, etc. Also, in case a device is lost or stolen, the data and application can be remotely deleted.","Standard authentication schemes (e.g., user id and password combinations) may present challenges to some rural users. The middleware  includes a biometric authentication mechanism  that provides capabilities for fingerprint registration and verification, which can be used by the applications  to authenticate users . This minimizes the risks of fraud by a business correspondent or other individuals. In case on-line connectivity is available, this component  can also use technologies, such as Universal IDs (UIDs) of a user for authentication. To enable security of data stored on the devices, a security component  provides the ability to encrypt the data, both during storage on the device as well as while synchronizing with the server. In this manner, the business correspondent  is unable to tamper with the data in any manner.","The end-users can also interact directly with the backend system of the rural services (e.g., server applications ) using a variety of interface techniques, such as short messaging service (SMS), unstructured supplementary service data (USSD), or a voice (e.g., spoken web) channel (collectively referred to as interface ). This allows them to directly perform a host of transactions such as balance inquiry, funds transfer, etc. Also, for each of the transactions performed through the business correspondent , the users get an SMS (and\/or a Voice call) related to it when the data is synchronized with the server. The voice channel allows users to interact in their local language with the system.","Turning now to , the server-side platform  may be implemented in hardware and software (e.g., by one or more of nodes  in ), as well as through devices and resources shown in the layers , , , , and  of . The server-side platform  may be implemented via one or more cloud computing nodes in cloud computing environment . In this embodiment, the rural services application  may be executed via program modules  (). The rural services may be provided to the device (e.g., devices , , and ).","The server-side platform  includes server applications  that support client applications for banking, insurance, etc., middleware , and connectors  (e.g., software components) that connect to back-end systems  of enterprises that provide services such as banking, micro-finance, insurance, employment, etc. Through the use of such connectors , various third party application service providers, as well as back-end systems , can offer their services on the platform  (e.g., by allowing third party applications  and server-side applications ) to communicate through the server middleware  to corresponding back-end systems . Moreover, the server-side platform  includes a payment gateway  through which end users may pay for availing different services on the platform . The server middleware  provides a set of common services through which a service provider (banking, insurance, etc.) can offer its services to the end users.","The various components of the middleware  will now be described in an exemplary embodiment. A spoken web component  allows initiation and receiving of voice calls in the local language. Spoken web  is a voice-driven ecosystem parallel and complementary to that of the World Wide Web (WWW). It is a network of VoiceSites that are voice driven applications created by users themselves and hosted in the network. The VoiceSites are identified by global identifiers call VoiNumbers and may be interconnected through VoiLinks Various service providers (e.g., those hosting the server applications ) on the platform  can create their VoiceSites through which they can share information and interact with those who may be illiterate or semi-literate, and may interact with these users in the local languages.","An SMS\/USSD handler component  allows functionality for sending and receiving of SMS messages and interaction through a USSD channel. This component , along with the spoken web component , allows a user to interact directly with the back-end system (e.g., one of back-end systems ) and perform a host of transactions using a land-line or mobile phone. A sync management component  allows data and transactions from the client devices (e.g., devices , , and  of ) to be synchronized with the server. When the data is synchronized, the corresponding server-side application (e.g., application(s) ) executes these transactions on the back-end system  using enterprise connectors . This process completes the transaction, and a corresponding success or failure is reported to the end user using SMS or voice channel (e.g., via SMS\/USSD handler ). A security component  enables data to be encrypted before being stored on the server or while transferring to back-end systems .","Certain administrative tasks may need to be performed on the devices (e.g., devices , , and ), such as updating applications , installing new applications, locking devices, data wipe-out, etc. Since the actual devices are located in geographically disperse or rural areas, it would be prohibitively expensive for a platform owner to manage these devices on-site by sending an administrator. The server middleware  provides a device management component  that allows an administrator to management the client remotely. Each device has a device agent (e.g., device agent  of ) installed as part of the client middleware . An administrator accesses the device management component  to send commands wirelessly to the agent device  using standard protocols. The administrator sends appropriate commands and data to that agent  based on the desired task to perform these operations. This can significantly reduce the cost of managing this system.","A customer profile management component  allows a common repository of customer profile and data across various services offered through this platform . In essence, an end user may register once with the platform  to use any of the offered services. This reduces the overhead of registering for each individual service and verification of user data. Also, a common user view is provided across services thereby enabling useful analytics to be performed such as product recommendation, cross-sell, up-sell, inferring spending patterns, etc. An analytics component  performs such analysis, and assists in fine-tuning existing offerings, as well as launching new ones effectively.","Turning now to , a flow diagram describing a process for implementing the rural services will now be described in an exemplary embodiment. The process described in  relates to a client-side implementation (e.g., through the client-side platform  of ). In this embodiment, the rural services application , in conjunction with applications , are executed via an end user device.","At step , the rural services application , via the device middleware , receives a request for a service from an end user. The request may be directed to any of the services provided by the applications , such as a request to conduct a banking transaction, a request for an insurance claim, etc. Alternatively, the operator of the device may be a business correspondent  who initiates tasks for end users on behalf of one or more service providers. The request may be facilitated by a common interface that includes user-selectable options for each of the applications  (e.g., via representational icons) provided to the device by the device middleware . The application  for which the request is received communicates with the device middleware  through an API configured via the device middleware .","At step , the device adaptation component  identifies the characteristics and capabilities of the device. For example, different types of devices may operate using different communications protocols and through different channels, as well as using different operating systems and related components. By way of illustration, a personal digital assistant (e.g., mobile device  of ) may communicate over a cellular network and\/or a satellite network. Further, the personal digital assistant may execute an operating system that is different from that of a kiosk (e.g., kiosk ) or POS terminal (e.g., POS terminal ). The device adaptation component  transparently adapts the application  for the requested service (e.g., one of applications ) based on these device characteristics via an interface that corresponds to the identified device characteristics at step  (e.g., identifies an appropriate interface), and provides the interface to the device at step .","At step , the middleware  accesses the server-side application  corresponding to the request, the application  processes the request through the server middleware  at step , and returns a response to the device based on the nature of the processed request, or transaction, via step . For example, the response may be a notification of a successful execution of the request.","In addition to identification of device characteristics and capabilities, and also the adaptation of the application  for the requested service, the device middleware  provides numerous additional functions for the end user (or other end users) via the aforementioned components , , , , and  described in . The device middleware  enables end users who may be technologically disadvantaged (e.g., in IT-related matters and devices) and\/or those living in remote or rural communities the opportunity to conduct transactions and communications with a number of service providers via these components. In one embodiment, the device middleware  enables end users who may be technologically disadvantaged to easily authenticate themselves with a service provider in preparation of conducting a secure transaction (e.g., a bank transaction). The bio-metric authentication component  and the device integration component  collectively provide the end user with the ability to access secure services by authentication through biometric scanning (e.g., fingerprint scanning), such that the end users do not need to perform tedious account set up processes typically associated with secure accounts (e.g., user name and password combinations, digital certificates, etc.). The device integration component  enables the user, e.g., to authenticate through any authentication system elements (scanner, reader, etc.) that may be resident on the device through which the authentication is desired. The bio-metric authentication component  provides capabilities for initiating fingerprint registration and verification. In addition, the end users can authenticate through voice and\/or text messaging protocols. For example, an end user who is technologically disadvantaged may communicate (and conduct transactions) through SMS\/USSD or voice channels (e.g., spoken web) using their own mobile phones.","Other functions provided by the device middleware  are security and synchronization of data. The security component  provides the ability to encrypt the data, both during storage on the device as well as while synchronizing with the server (e.g., via the sync agent component ). This enables security in preventing others from tampering with the end user's data. In addition, the sync agent component  ensures no data is lost when the end user is working offline. In remote or rural areas, reliable network connectivity can be an issue. The sync agent component  synchronizes the data from the end user device with end user data stored on the network. Another function provided by the device middleware  includes remote management of devices through an administrator who may install new applications remotely, push updates, etc. Also, in case a device is lost or stolen, the data and application can be remotely deleted. In this manner, end users who reside in remote or rural locations may receive any updates or modifications to device software despite their geographic isolation.","As indicated above, the server-side platform  also implements rural services functions through its server middleware . The server-side platform  facilitates transactions through server applications  (also referred to herein as \u201cservice applications\u201d) on behalf of back-end systems . The server-side platform  enables communications relating to transactions with end user devices via text or voice components of the server middleware . The server middleware  provides security, synchronization management, device management, customer profile management, and analytics, as described above. In addition, the server middleware  provides registration for use of the service applications and storing transaction related data, as well as end user data in a repository that services a plurality of service applications. The server middleware  communicates these transactions with respect to corresponding back-end systems . The server middleware  offers the services of the service applications to end users once the end users have registered for these services (e.g., through the customer profile management component ).","Technical effects of the invention include a middleware framework and architecture for providing services to end users who may be living in remote or rural locations, and who may be technologically disadvantaged or have language barriers. The middleware architecture seamlessly provides various disparate services through the use of integrated authentication, security, synchronization, communication and device management tools. These tools interoperate to ensure data integrity when connectivity is lacking, as well as simplified authentication mechanisms.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
