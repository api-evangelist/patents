title: Dial up telephone conferencing system controlled by an online computer network
abstract: In a telephone conferencing system, a digital communication network such as the Internet is used to establish and control the telephone connections between multiple conferees with the telephone network being the means of exchanging verbal information. Each conferee may have a computer connected to the digital network, and each has an independent telephone instrument connected to the public switched telephone network. An in-charge conferee utilizes his computer containing appropriate software to initiate the conference and to control the participation of the conferees. The in-charge conferee sends digital control signals to a switch interface controlling a telephone switch as a gateway to the telephone network using SS7 control signals. These SS7 control signals include the commands by which the conferee telephones are rung up, brought on line, or dropped from the conference. The switch provides telephone status information back over the digital network, and the in-charge conferee, as well as other conferees provided with appropriate software, display this status information on their PC monitors.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to telephone conferencing, and in particular to dial up telephone conferencing utilizing computer control.","2. Description Relative to Prior Art","In the art, it is known that telephone conferences may be implemented through \u201cconferencing centers\u201d provided as a service by local and long distance telephone companies. A list of telephone numbers of the conferees and the date and time at which the conference is to begin is supplied to a conference center operator who performs the dialing operations to bring the conferees simultaneously on line to initiate the conference. This technique is limited by the necessity of setting up a relatively inflexible forum in which all participants must be designated in advance, and the inclusion and reliance upon outside telephone company personnel to implement the conference.","A more recent form of conferencing utilizes digital networks such as the Internet that are publicly accessible by individual computers (typically PCs) via Internet Relay Chat (IRC) hosts. The conferees come on line and are interconnected by means of the host, and may utilize software which allows fully duplexed communication between the PCs. Typically, the conference is conducted with the exchanged information visually appearing on the individual PC display screens. In more sophisticated applications allowing audio communication between the conferees, additional hardware is required at each PC site. A microphone and analog to digital converter provide digitized audio input to a PC by means of appropriate software, such as commercially available VocalTec software, and the audio output is derived from the digital information transmitted over the Internet by use of a digital to analog converter feeding a speaker. Encryption software may be employed to \u201cscramble\u201d the digital information transmitted via the network, but all potential conferees must be provided with this software, and must be alerted to the fact that it is being used. Hence, a conference of multiple conferees requires additional hardware and software at each PC site in order to implement a conference by means of the Internet.","Referring to , a conferee station  consists of a PC computer  and a telephone . Conferee stations , , correspondingly have PC computers ,  and telephones , . Other conferee stations, i.e.  may still be connected into the conference network without the requirement of a computer; the conferee station  comprising only the telephone . All the PCs are connected to the Internet network  using standard Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) connect software. The telephones , , ,  are tied into the telephone network  in a conventional manner. It will be noted that the telephones , , ,  are independent of the Internet network . A switch interface  controlling a telephone switch  is also connected so as to receive control signals via the Internet  and to transmit them to the telephone network , as will be described below.","Any one of the conferee stations , , , possessing a PC, may be designated as Conference Meister. For convenience of explanation, it is assumed that conferee station  is designated as Conference Meister. To implement this designation, PC  of conferee station  is provided with additional software which allows PC  to communicate with the switch interface  both to control the telephone switch  and to receive status information from the telephone switch , via the Internet .","The Conference Meister station  and the switch interface  communicate over the TCP\/IP transport layer of the Internet  using the Internet's User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with checksum. A common fixed-length interprocess message called the Conference Protocol Data Unit (CDPU), using the software format further described below in Table I, is exchanged between the Conference Meister  and the switch interface , in the data field of a UDP-Datagram. The switch interface  converts the CDPU into Signalling System 7 (SS7) commands which act on the switch , and attendantly, on the telephone network  to control the conferees telephones , , , . SS7 is an internationally recognized telephony standard of 255 commands for controlling telephone calls via switch  using standard lookup table procedures. The switch interface  interacting with the switch  may be implemented incorporating a standard micro-computer such as a Motorola 68705P5 performing the table lookup translation of SS7 commands into CPDU commands stored in its ROM memory. It will be noted that the switch interface  is bidirectional, and telephone connection status information as established by the switch , i.e. ringing, off-hook, on-hook busy, for all participants is transmitted back via the Internet to the Conference Meister for icon display on his PC.","All fields in the CPDU are ASCII character fields. The CPDU consists of 32 bytes of data as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Session ID\/","Conference ID\/","Command\/Response Code\/","Data\/"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["4 bytes","2 bytes","2 bytes","24 bytes"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The Session ID and Conference ID fields contain administrative \u201chousekeeping\u201d information.

By providing CDPU software to the other conferees, the invention allows any other one of the conferee stations, i.e. , , to serve as a Conference Meister.","The functional interrelation of the elements of the system illustrated in  may be further understood by reference to . In , the abbreviations, used industry-wide, have the following meanings: SSP=Central Office (i.e. Service Signalling Point), SCP=Service Control Point, (it is an alternate SS7 entry point), and STP=Signal Transfer Point. (In the drawings, different but related elements are identified with the same reference characters, albeit that corresponding elements in the various drawings are distinguished by primes.) The components of the telephone system are expanded in the box \u2032 showing one or more interconnected telephone central offices, e.g. ,  that also contain control elements of the SS7 system, e.g. , . As one example of the interaction between the telephone system and the control disclosed in the present invention, a call placed by telephone \u2032 using conventional dialing enters the system through telephone central office . The call is internally routed, if necessary, by the SS7 control system over the telephone network to a telephone central office  which is connected to a telephone system\/Internet interface, \u2032 and \u2032, that sends SS7 signals to an Internet computer  that a telephone call is in process and destined to the Internet \u2032. (The dashed lines of  denote digital control functions; while the heavy black lines denote transmitted audio telephone signals as will be described below.) As is known in the art, within the Internet system are digital computers, e.g. , acting as routers, servers and capable of performing other digital manipulations. Hence, via the interface\/switch control path \u2032, \u2032 the telephone central office advises the Internet computer , via the SS7\/Internet control interface, that an audio signal is to be passed to the Internet. The telephone central office  transmits  the voice signals  originating at telephone \u2032, to the Internet computer  where it is digitized, if necessary, and packetized for transmission on the Internet. This switching and inter-node connecting of this entire process has taken place between the telephone system \u2032 and the Internet \u2032 under control of SS7 signals. Internet computer  converts or maps the SS7 command signals to TCP control signals that route and process the packets through the Internet, as disclosed above. The message  transits the Internet \u2032 to its destination, say, PC  of  where software decodes the audio message , rings the telephone , and provides an analog audio signal for telephone , corresponding to audio signal , generated at telephone instrument \u2032.","In a second embodiment of the invention, the system of  may be further configured to provide an inherent call-back capability. Though it uses the same conferencing software described above, call-back can be between just two parties. Essentially each PC station is set up so it can serve as a \u201cconference meister\u201d; no other special software or hardware need be installed on a station's PC. Only the initiating station requires a PC or other access to the Internet. A suitably programmed touchtone phone can be used to access the Internet without the use of a computer such as the PC. The two party call-back feature sets up the call via the Internet with the conversation taking place on the normal telephone system in a manner substantially the same as that described above for conferencing.","Referring to , a participating PC call-back station shows a display chart  on its monitor. The display chart  contains the station identification  (e.g. Richard) and a contact list , and the PC station's call-back telephone number . The contacts are shown with their complete dial-up telephone numbers, e.g. , , and by clicking on one or more of the displayed contacts, calls are dialed to the selected parties via the Internet and the switch  of , as previously described for conference calling. It will be appreciated that single parties can be selected to allow two person telephone conversation utilizing the convenience of simplified \u201cpoint and click\u201d dialing via the stored telephone numbers shown on the PC monitor screen. In the two party call-back connection system described above, it is not necessary to have two telephone lines at a PC station, i.e. one for connection to the Internet and one for carrying the telephonic conversation. With a single telephone line, the system software may be set to instantly disconnect the Internet connection after the called party's number is transmitted by the PC to the switch , and to ring the call initiator's telephone simultaneously. In this manner, the calling party and the called party are connected by means of a single telephone line in seconds.","Anonymity of the caller is preserved by the invention even when the calling party has automatic numbering identification (ANI) or \u201cCaller ID\u201d. Since the system makes all its connections to the called party via the call-back technique from the remote switch  under control of the \u201cconference meister\u201d software, the only records of all the connected telephone numbers are recorded at the switch , including the number of the calling party. This occurs because the caller or \u201cconference meister\u201d is also one of the call-back numbers. Each connection is shown as a separate call on the inter-office telephone control (SS7) software originating from the switch , not from a calling party's telephone. The switch  can have an anonymous telephone number assigned as the originating number. Alternately, the calling party can designate some other listed number for ANI sending or Caller ID purposes which would key the called party as to who is calling.","With the anonymous option, no traceable record of a call is available locally. This minimizes industrial espionage at hotels, customer offices, and even private homes where merely the fact that certain parties made a call could be valuable information. The proper legal authorities can always get the full records from the central switch  if need be to document who initiated the call, and which telephones were called.","In a third embodiment, the call-back system can be expanded to include an advertising feature. Referring to , a display \u2032 is expanded to include an advertising block . Under this embodiment, in order to place a call via the call-back system or activate a conference, the program requires clicking on the advertising block  by the caller to create a record that the advertisement was seen by the caller. Various subroutines can then be activated such as requiring additional periodic clicks on the advertisement to keep the call connected, or linking the caller to a web page of the advertiser providing additional information as to the users of the system.","It will be noted that the displays , \u2032 are to be implemented in various colors, and that the selection by clicking on any portion of the display will be highlighted in a manner known in the computer art.","The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, other data networks, such as a private intranet rather than the Internet, may be used for digital data communication among the conferee PCs, as well as other telephone signaling."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be described with respect to the drawings, which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
