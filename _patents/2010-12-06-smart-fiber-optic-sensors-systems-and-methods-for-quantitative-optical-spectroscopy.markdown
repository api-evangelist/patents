abstract: Smart fiber optic sensors, systems, and methods for performing quantitative optical spectroscopy are disclosed. In one embodiment, smart fiber optic sensor can include a sensing channel, a calibration channel, and a pressure sensing channel. External force or pressure can be calculated at pressure sensing channel for monitoring and controlling pressure at a sensor-specimen interface thereby ensuring more accurate specimen spectral data is collected. Contact pressure can be adjusted to remain within a specified range. A calibration light of the calibration channel and an illumination light of the sensing channel can be generated simultaneously from a shared light source. Pressure sensing channel can transmit light from a second light source and collect pressure spectral data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","REFERENCES"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/266,843, filed Dec. 4, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This presently disclosed subject matter was made with U.S. Government support under Grant No. BC044776 awarded by the DOD. Thus, the U.S. Government has certain rights in the presently disclosed subject matter.","The subject matter disclosed herein relates to fiber optic sensors, systems, and methods for quantitative tissue optical spectroscopy. More particularly, the subject matter disclosed herein relates to smart fiber optic sensors, systems, and methods for quantitative tissue optical spectroscopy which can reduce error by combining self-calibration and pressure sensing channels operable concurrently with a specimen sensing channel.","Cancer, for example, oral and cervical cancer, is a growing global health problem that disproportionately impacts the developing world. Each year, over 481,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed worldwide, with a 5-year mortality of \u02dc50% and nearly two-thirds of which occur in developing countries. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women with an incidence and death rate of 16 and 9 per 100,000 women, respectively, and 80% of cases occur in the developing world. Detecting and grading precancerous and malignant oral lesions is mostly accomplished by visual screening and biopsy of suspicious tissue sites. The Pap smear is the standard of care for screening for cervical cancer. An effective cancer screening and diagnostic program often requires both sophisticated and expensive medical facilities and well-trained and experienced doctors and nurses. The high death rate in developing countries is largely due to the fact that these countries do not have the appropriate medical infrastructure and resources to support the organized screening and diagnostic programs that are available in the United States or other developed countries. Thus, there is a critical global need for a portable, easy-to-use, low cost, and reliable device that can rapidly screen for oral and cervical cancer in low-resource settings.","It is well documented in numerous studies that oral and cervical cancers, if detected at early stages, have a better chance of being successfully treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of the three, therefore significantly improving the survival rates. One such early detection method can include analyzing optical absorption and scattering properties of epithelial tissues which reflect their underlying physiological and morphological properties. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-VIS DRS), which measures tissue absorption and scattering properties, has shown promise for diagnosis of early precancerous changes in the cervix and oral cavity. Tissue absorption and scattering can be quantified using in vivo DRS measurements. For example, in the UV and visible light band, dominant absorbers in oral and cervical tissue are oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), arising from blood vessels in the stroma. Light scattering is primarily caused by cell nuclei and organelles in the epithelium and stroma, as well as collagen fibers and cross-links in stroma. Neoplastic and cancerous tissue exhibit significant changes in their physiological and morphological characteristics that can be quantified optically: Stromal layer absorption is expected to increase with angiogenesis, whereas stromal scattering is expected to go down with neoplastic progression as extracellular collagen networks degrade. Epithelial scattering has been shown to increase, for example, due to increased nuclear size, increased DNA content, and hyperchromasia. UV-VIS DRS has a penetration depth that can be tuned to be comparable to the thickness of the epithelial layer or deeper to probe both the epithelial and stromal layers [1], [2], [3].","Hardware employed for UV-VIS DRS measurements typically consists of a broadband light source, a spectrometer for multispectral detection, and a fiber-optic probe for relaying light to and from the instrument. Although fiber-optic probes are well-suited to access tissue sites in the oral cavity and cervix they are susceptible to several sources of systematic and random error that can influence the robustness of this technology, particularly in resource-poor settings. One such error arises from an uncontrolled probe-to-tissue interface which makes it difficult to obtain a reproducible tissue reflectance spectrum due to probe to tissue coupling and physiological changes induced by the probe pressure. That is, a probe technician or operator can unknowingly interfere with spectral measurement of the specimen when contact pressure between the probe and the tissue rises. One study found that there was a decrease in the diffuse reflectance and increase in the scattering coefficient between 400-1800 nm with compression of in vitro human skin [4]. Another study reported that extracted blood vessel radius, oxygen saturation, and Mie theory slope decreased with contact pressure, while the reduced scattering coefficient at 700 nm increased as a function of pressure [5]. A more recent study concluded that elevation in probe pressure can induce major alterations in the profile of the reflectance spectra between 400-650 nm and the changes in the extracted tissue optical properties depend not only on the probe pressure, but also on tissue type [6]. It is generally believed that the changes may be attributed to the compression of the blood vessels which causes reduced blood flow and alterations in the metabolism of the tissue as well as a change in the density of the scatterers. Thus, it appears that unknown and uncontrolled contact pressure at the probe specimen interface can adversely affect measurements and early detection of affected tissue.","Another error in conventional systems can arise from the lack of a robust, real-time calibration makes the calibration process time-consuming and potentially inaccurate, particularly when attempting to quantify absolute absorption and scattering coefficients. It has been established that in order to consistently yield accurate estimation of tissue optical properties, calibration can compensate for the wavelength-dependent instrument response, lamp intensity fluctuations, and fiber bending losses [7], [8]. Conventional calibration techniques typically rely on measurements using reflectance standards of known optical properties and\/or tissue phantoms, typically after the clinical measurements are completed. These measurements are subject to a number of limitations, however. First, because the calibration is performed at the beginning or end of the study, real-time instrument fluctuations, such as lamp drift and fiber bending loss cannot be compensated for. Second, these measurements can require an additional thirty minutes for lamp warm-up and another ten to twenty minutes for calibration, which adds up to a significant amount of time, especially in a clinical setting. Thus, a better calibration method is needed, on that can compensate for real-time instrument fluctuations.","Finally, and in addition to being problematic and error prone, typical DRS systems can be expensive to use as they comprise bulky, high power and expensive optical components, such as thermal light sources, spectrometers, and cooled CCD cameras, which need a stable power supply. Thermal light sources have large footprint, short life-time, low power efficiency, and low coupling efficiency to optical fibers. Spectrometers using grating spectrometers and cooled CCD cameras have extremely high wavelength resolution and sensitivity, but are very bulky and expensive and consume a large amount of electrical power. In addition, a stable power supply is very often required to operate a thermal lamp and a CCD camera. Taken together, it is very difficult for DRS systems in their current forms to be directly used for cancer screening in developing countries.","Consequently, there remains a need for improved smart fiber optic sensor systems and methods for quantitative tissue optical spectroscopy that overcome or alleviate shortcomings of the prior art systems and methods. In particular, there remains a need for a low power consumption, low-cost DRS device that can be used to obtain accurate and reproducible quantitative measurements of absorption and scattering coefficients with applications to global health screening of cervical and oral cancers. Such improvements can comprise, but are not limited to, utilizing of emitting diodes (LEDs) as illumination sources; using miniature fiber-optic spectrometers for light detection and a smart fiber-optic probe for reliable measurements of tissue diffuse reflectance spectra. The LEDs and spectrometers can be powered and controlled by a laptop computer using custom computer readable media, making the system highly portable. Smart fiber optic sensors, systems, and methods can integrate a specimen sensing channel, a self-calibration channel, and an interferometric fiber-optic pressure sensor into a single instrument. The pressure sensor can provide real-time pressure readings at the probe-specimen interface such that an operator can adjust the applied force on the probe. The spectra can only be saved and processed if the desired pressure is reached. The pressure sensor can ensure that the probe-tissue coupling is reliable and the pressure induced tissue physiological changes are consistent between measurements. The self-calibration channel can collect a calibration spectrum concurrently with the tissue spectrum, which will be used to correct for source fluctuations and fiber bending loss that occurs during the measurements. With the smart fiber optic sensors, systems, and methods disclosed herein it can be possible to perform accurate and reproducible DRS for rapid screening of cancers or charactering in vivo tissues in resource-limited countries without having to use expensive optical components and high capacity stable power supplies. More importantly, it can eliminate the need for instrument warm-up and extra on-site calibration measurements, thus saving 40-60 minutes of time.","The subject matter described herein includes relates to smart fiber optic sensors, systems, and methods for quantitative tissue optical spectroscopy. According to one aspect, a smart fiber optic sensor comprises a sensing channel for illuminating a specimen and for collecting spectral reflections from the specimen from which specimen spectral data can be determined. Smart fiber optic sensor can comprise a pressure sensing channel for collecting pressure sensor spectral reflections from which a contact pressure can be determined and a calibration channel for obtaining calibration spectral reflections usable for correcting the specimen spectral data.","A smart fiber optic sensor system can comprise a smart fiber optic sensor described above and a signal processor or processing unit, coupled to the each of the sensing channel, the pressure sensing channel, and the calibration channel, the processing unit being adapted to receive and correct the spectral data of the specimen and for calculating the contact pressure at the sensor\/specimen interface in real-time.","A method for utilizing a smart fiber optic sensor can comprise contacting the specimen with the smart fiber optic sensor, generating specimen spectral data, pressure sensor spectral data, and calibration data. The method can further comprise calculating contact pressure using the pressure sensor spectral data and correcting specimen spectral data using the calibration data. The specimen spectral data can optionally be analyzed and stored.","At least portion of the subject matter described herein may be implemented in hardware, a combination of hardware and software, firmware, or any combination of hardware, software, and firmware.

In one embodiment, system  comprises a diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) system. Smart fiber optic sensor system  can be used to perform noninvasive UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance as well fluorescence spectroscopy in clinical settings or preclinical animal models. The system can comprise one or more LEDs as illumination sources, a three-channel miniature spectrometer for light detection, a fiber-optic probe, and a processing unit or module for processing custom computer readable media. Smart fiber optic sensor system  can further integrate a diaphragm-based Fabry-Perot interferometric (DFPI) pressure sensor with a tissue sensing channel. As  illustrates, smart fiber optic system  can comprise a processor or processing unit  connected to each of three fiber optic groupings or \u201cchannels\u201d and a smart fiber optic probe, or sensor, generally designated . Processing unit  can comprise a portable laptop computer. Each channel can comprise fiber optic groupings or \u201clegs\u201d distributed between illumination sources and imaging spectrometer and\/or spectrometer channels A, B, and C. One or more of the fiber optic channels can share an illumination source and\/or an imaging spectrometer or spectrometer channel.","A first fiber optic channel  can comprise a sensing channel  wherein the illumination source comprises a first light source  and a first spectrometer channel A, designated . A second fiber optic channel  can comprise a calibration channel wherein the illumination source comprises first light source  and a second spectrometer channel C, designated . Thus, both sensing channel  and calibration channel  can share first light source . Optionally, calibration channel  can utilize a same spectrometer and\/or spectrometer channel as either sensing channel  or a fiber optic pressure sensor channel. A third fiber optic channel  can comprise a fiber optic pressure sensor channel wherein the illumination source can comprise a second light source  and a third spectrometer channel B, designated . The reflectance and\/or fluorescence spectrum from the specimen can be detected by spectrometer channel , the signals from a pressure sensor can be detected by spectrometer channel , and the calibration spectrum can be detected by spectrometer channel . In an alternative embodiment, three separate spectrometers can be used rather than a three-channel spectrometer. In another alternative embodiment, a dual-channel spectrometer can be used instead of a three-channel spectrometer. For example, spectrometer could comprise a dual channel fiber-optic spectrometer such as those manufactured by Avantes BV, wherein one channel could detect DRS from sensing channel and the second spectrometer channel could be shared by calibration channel  and pressure sensing channel . That is, the second channel of a dual channel spectrometer could detect the signals from calibration channel and pressure sensor. In one embodiment, spectrometer can comprise a white LED based miniature spectrometer consisting of a high power white LED and a USB 4000 spectrometer, such as those manufactured by Ocean Optics of Orlando, Fla. The spectrometer can comprise a 1-mm fiber optic for illumination and another 1-mm fiber for collection with a source-to-detector separation (SDS) of 2.3 mm. Diffuse reflectance from a specimen can be detected by spectrometer channel .","In one embodiment, fiber optic pressure sensor channel  can comprise an interferometric pressure sensor. Pressure sensor channel  can provide real-time pressure data at the probe-specimen interface such that an operator, or technician can manually control the pressure at the interface within an optimal minimal range for ensuring best probe-specimen coupling, without affecting the tissue physiology. Thus, the smart fiber optic sensor  disclosed herein can integrate together the sensing , calibration  and, for example, interferometric pressure sensor channels  into a single optical probe. Smart fiber optic sensor  can be adapted to accommodate any probe instrument, including but not limited to, side firing and forward firing probes.","Sensing channel  can comprise a detection fiber portion, or collection leg  which can couple to first spectrometer  at coupler . Sensing channel  can also comprise an illumination fiber leg  coupled to first light source  at coupler  for collecting a DRS from a specimen. In one embodiment, specimen can comprise an in vivo tissue sample . In one embodiment, first light source  can comprise a white light emitting diode (LED) such as white fiber LED LE-1x-c manufactured by WT&T Inc. Light source  can comprise a wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm as the source for DRS. In one embodiment, sensing channel  can comprise a high power white LED as the source for DRS and\/or one or multiple UV\/visible LEDs (with or without a bandpass filter) as the excitation source for fluorescence spectroscopy. The white LED and color LED(s) can share the same source fibers (, ) or have independent source fibers. The fluorescence channel can be used to quantify both intrinsic fluorophores (such as FAD, NADH, collagen and porphyrin), and endogenous fluorophores (such as the nanoparticle contrast agents, chemotherapy drug, and Doxirubicin). The different LEDs can be switched on\/off sequentially. In other embodiments, first light source  can comprise any suitable broadband light source. In one embodiment, a broadband light source with a monochromator (e.g., a scanning double-excitation monochromator) or a plurality of laser diodes may also be used along with a plurality of photo-detectors in lieu of spectrometer . It is well established that LEDs utilize less power and\/or energy than conventional illumination sources such as xenon lamps or white light bulbs.","Sensing channel  can comprise a channel wherein light from first light source  illuminates a sample, or specimen  and at least one detection fiber  can capture the reflected light (i.e., spectral data) which can ultimately be provided to spectrograph  via the fiber array shown in cross-sectional views of . The cross-sectional views are associated with the open ended terminus of probe tip  (). Notably, each individual detection fiber  can run the entire length of collection leg  and main portion of probe .","Still referring to , calibration channel  can comprise illumination fiber leg  and a calibration return leg . Calibration return leg  can couple to second spectrometer  at coupler . Illumination fiber leg  can share first light source  with sensing channel , for example, a white LED, and can collect a calibration spectrum concurrently with the tissue measurement which can be used for real-time instrument and probe calibration. Illumination fiber leg can comprise two source fibers, for example illumination source fiber  utilized in sensing channel  for illuminating the specimen and a calibration source fiber  utilized in calibration channel  for internal calibration (see ). Illumination source fiber  and calibration source fiber , respectively, can run parallel to each other within illumination fiber leg . Illumination source fiber  can extend into a ridged probe tip  for contacting and sensing the specimen. In one embodiment, each of illumination source fiber  and calibration source fiber  can comprise the same diameter fiber or fibers and all of the fibers can be made from the same materials (e.g., same fiber clad, core, etc.) and can comprise the same numerical aperture (NA) for identical bending response. Calibration source fiber  is discussed below with respect to , but may not extend all the way to specimen surface . Calibration return leg  of calibration channel  is also discussed with respect to  and can be useful for collecting calibration light generated at first light source  and reflected by a reflective material  () and transmit the reflected light to spectrometer . In one embodiment, smart fiber optic sensor  can be used to concurrently measure the spectral data of first light source  and spectral data of sample . Notably, the configuration is advantageous because it can account for real-time light source intensity fluctuations and fiber bending loss (i.e., light intensity fluctuations caused by bending the instrument). For example, the bending effect on illumination source fiber  is assumed to be the same as that of calibration source fiber . Also, light source warm-up and separate calibration measurements are also unnecessary with a smart fiber optic sensor and system.","Still referring to , fiber optic pressure sensor channel  can comprise second illumination fiber leg  and a pressure return leg . Second illumination fiber leg  can couple to second light source  at second light source coupler . Pressure return leg  can couple to spectrometer  at spectrometer coupler . Second illumination fiber leg  and pressure return leg  can comprise a single lead in\/out fiber (single-mode or multi-mode) forming a low-coherence DFPI at the end face of the lead in\/out fiber. Second light source  can comprise an 850 nm LED with a spectral width of 30 or 60 nm such as those manufactured by Appointech Inc. Smart fiber optic sensor  can comprise collection, illumination fiber, second illumination fiber, calibration return, and pressure return legs. Smart fiber optic sensor  can further comprise a probe portion, leg  extending from a breakout tube . Probe portion can comprise a probe tip portion, generally designated . Probe tip portion  can comprise a calibration housing portion  and a rigid probe tip . Probe tip  can contact a surface of specimen . Specimen  can comprise a tissue sample or any turbid medium. A contact pressure at the probe\/specimen interface can advantageously be calculated and controlled using fiber optic pressure sensing channel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","152","126","150","124","152","150","138","144","144","150","104","114","120","154","156","152","110","154","120","126","106","116","154","138","142","140","152","154","152","152","152","126","154","152"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["156","138","128","108","118","154","156","120","158","132","135","138","130","132","135","158"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["3","4","144","142","105","144","144","152","150","170","152","150","172","170","144","152","150","158"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 1"],"b":["140","142","144","140","152","154","126","152","142","146","154","142","154","160","160","154","156","160","156","156","108","162","154","156"]},"In one embodiment, calibration source fiber  and calibration return fiber  can comprise the same fiber (i.e., a source\/return calibration fiber). For example, a single source-return calibration fiber may originate from light source , enter housing section , and bend or loop back in such a manner that the calibration source\/return fiber exits housing section . That is, the calibration source-return fiber can be bent within housing section  in the smart fiber optic sensor such that the calibration source fiber functions as the calibration return fiber (since a mirror or other reflective element is not used). The calibration fiber would then be configured to interface with spectrometer channel  via calibration return leg . Notably, reflective material  would not be utilized in this particular embodiment. Although cross sectional view shows one calibration return fiber , additional calibration return fibers may be used. For example, additional calibration return fibers may be implemented as backup return fibers in case the primary return fiber fails or if additional calibration channels are to be implemented.","In one embodiment, smart fiber optic sensor  can comprise calibration channel that can be used to record the lamp spectrum and instrument\/fiber responses concurrently with tissue measurements. For example, at least one calibration source fiber  can transmit, or communicate calibration light and calibration return fiber  can collect, or communicate the calibration light reflected by reflective material  within calibration housing  and transmit it to spectrometer . The calibration spectra from the calibration channel can be detected by spectrometer  and used for calibration of the specimen spectrum obtained concurrently.","In one embodiment, calibration source fiber  of the calibration channel can have the same diameter as and run along the illumination fiber  of the sensing channel. Calibration return fiber  can be the same diameter as the collection fiber  in the tissue channel for identical bending response. To account for the wavelength dependence, a correlation factor may be applied before being processed with the specimen spectral data. For example, because the calibration channel may have wavelength responses that differ from the wavelength responses exhibited in the sensing channel, the wavelength response in the calibration channel may require correction and\/or compensation. For example, to correct the calibration channel's wavelength dependence, a spectral measurement may be taken from a reflectance standard (e.g., a Spectralon puck), which is characterized by a flat wavelength response. A correction factor may be generated for each sensor, or probe by dividing the spectral data of the reflectance standard by the self-calibration spectrum concurrently obtained with spectral data of the reflectance standard. For example, the correlation factor may comprise\n\n(\u03bb)=Puck(\u03bb)\/(\u03bb)\n\nwhere Puck (A) is measured from Spectralon puck by the sensing channel and SC(A) is the concurrent spectrum measured by the calibration channel. The calibrated reference phantom and tissue spectra can be input into the fast scalable Monte Carlo inverse model [9] which extracts the tissue \u03bc\u2032 and \u03bc, from which tissue absorber concentrations can be derived. With the smart fiber optic sensor, or probe, no separate calibration measurements are needed. Exemplary Monte Carlo algorithms suitable for use with the subject matter described herein can be found, for example, in international patent application number PCT\/US2007\/006624 to Palmer et al.; international patent application number PCT\/US2008\/0270091 to Ramanujam et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,835,786 to Palmer et al., the entireties of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. In an alternative, a diffusion algorithm or inverse diffusion algorithm may be used instead of a Monte Carlo algorithm. Notably, tissue measurements can be started right after the instrument is turned on and fiber bending loss can be accounted for in real-time. All these together could save as much as 60 minutes of precious time.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 3A and 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["144","150","152","152","106","150","104","150","144","144","152","152","146","106","126","105","152","154"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["170","170","158","170","115","168","176","180","176","180","168","176","178","172","172","158","178","170","115","158","178","158","1","171","172","2","1","2","112","158","172","158","178","1","2","170"]},"Still referring to , pressure sensor  can be fabricated in one embodiment by inserting a 50\/125 \u03bcm multimode fiber into a fused silica ferrule having an outer diameter of 1.5 mm and inner diameter of 127 \u03bcm.

In one aspect, data can be automatically stored if and only if pressure is within an optimal range and upon successful calibration. An optimal range can comprise a minimal optimal range wherein spectral data will be minimally affected by the contact pressure.

It is expected that the time required to measure and analyze the spectra from a specimen be less than 2 seconds",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B","sub":["s","a ","s","s","s","a ","s"],"sup":"\u22121 "},"Inversions were performed in the wavelengths range of 450-600 nm using across-days data analysis, in which the target and reference phantoms were from the different days (representative of what would happen in an actual clinical setting).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Target\/","Spectralon Puck","Self-Calibration"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Reference","Day 1\/2","Day 2\/1","Day 1\/2","Day 2\/1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Error in [Hb]","8.4 +\/\u2212 4.9%","\u20024.5 +\/\u2212 1.5%","7.0 +\/\u2212 4.4%","8.6 +\/\u2212 3.9%"]},{"entry":["Error in \u03bcs\u2032","9.0 +\/\u2212 3.2%","12.5 +\/\u2212 6.1%","3.8 +\/\u2212 3.4%","2.1 +\/\u2212 1.1%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"sub":["s","s"],"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B","b":"120"},"As alluded to earlier,  illustrates sensor pressure sensitivity as a function of the diaphragm thickness at three diaphragm diameters, D=1.0 (a=0.5), 1.5 (a=0.75), and 2.0 mm (a=1.0). In general, it can be noted that sensitivity decreases with increasing diaphragm thickness, but the effect becomes less apparent at smaller diameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["400","402","404"]},"Step  includes calculating contact pressure using the spectral data from the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor can comprise a DFPI and pressure sensor spectral data can comprise reflectance data reflected along a cavity length of the DFPI. The pressure sensor can be disposed in a probe tip of the smart fiber optic sensor. Calculating pressure can comprise transmitting a low-coherence illumination light using a fiber optic fiber to a DFPI pressure sensor and collecting spectral data reflected by the pressure sensor via the same fiber optic fiber. As illustrated in , low-coherence light can propagate through the coupler to reach a lead in\/out fiber. The output light from the DFPI can propagates through the coupler and a signal (from R and R, ) can be detected by the spectrometer that would be an interferogram from which the cavity length can be calculated using an algorithm. Cavity length can range from a few to several hundred micrometers. An external pressure (e.g., contact pressure with a specimen) can contact an outer surface of the diaphragm and bend the diaphragm toward the fiber and thus change the length of the air cavity. The applied pressure, or force, can therefore, be calculated by measuring the change of the cavity length from atmospheric pressure. A determination can be made regarding whether to analyze and save the spectral data from the sensing and calibration channels based on the pressure data. If pressure is not from a minimal preset range, the contact pressure may be too great thereby affecting specimen spectral data, thus, resulting in error and potentially inaccurate specimen data. Contact pressure at the probe\/specimen interface can be adjusted and\/or controlled such that the measured pressure stays within a specified, preset pressure range. In one aspect, the contact pressure can be controlled by an operator or technician based on real time pressure readings. As noted earlier, the first light source shared by sensing and calibration channels comprises a first emission spectra and the second light source utilized by the pressure sensing channel comprises a second emission spectra, and the first and second emission spectra do not overlap.","Step  includes correcting specimen spectral data using the calibration data. Correcting specimen spectral data can comprise transmitting calibration light via at least one calibration source fiber disposed in calibration channel, wherein the calibration light and the illumination light of the sensing channel can be generated simultaneously from the shared, first light source. Correcting specimen spectral data can further comprise collecting correcting spectral data associated with the calibration light via at least one calibration return fiber of the calibration channel contemporaneously with the collection of the spectral data of the specimen. The specimen spectral data received from the sensing channel can be corrected using the calibration spectral data received from the calibration channel.","Optional steps include analyzing and storing the specimen spectral data. Analyzing and storing the collected spectral data can comprise analyzing the calibrated spectral data to extract the specimen optical and physiological properties using, for example, an inverse MC model for reflectance. In one aspect, the data can be automatically analyzed and stored using a determination based upon the pressure data. If the pressure data is within a specified, preset range, then the specimen spectral data and calibration data can be automatically analyzed and\/or stored.","In sum, it is describable to utilize a USB powered smart sensor system for performing in vivo quantitative DRS of soft tissues in wavelength range from 420-720 nm. The applications related to cancer screening in a global population can be greatly improved by the methods and systems disclosed herein. The smart sensor technology disclosed herein can incorporate innovations to several component areas. For example, white LEDs, miniature spectrometers, and a smart fiber-optic sensor can reduce the complexity, size, and cost of conventional optical spectroscopy systems. The systems and methods disclosed herein also minimize the amount of technical skill required to perform optical spectroscopy for early cancer detection applications. The compact integration of a tissue sensing portion, a pressure sensor, and a calibration portion into a single fiber-optic probe enables significant improvement in accuracy and robustness for extraction of tissue optical properties. By limiting or controlling the probe pressure and performing real-time calibration both systematic and random errors in reflectance measurements can be reduced. Further, the sensitivity and specificity for early cancer diagnosis can be improved.","Although the smart sensor discussed herein can be useful for screening and diagnostics for cancers such as oral and cervical cancers, it is not limited thereto. The systems and methods disclosed can be translated to other organ sites, such as the skin, bladder, etc. and can also be used for non-cancer applications such as monitoring vital signs during major surgeries in an intra-operative setting. The systems and methods disclosed herein can be used for any optical spectroscopy application known now or in the future.","The disclosure of each of the following references is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[1] Schwarz, R.
