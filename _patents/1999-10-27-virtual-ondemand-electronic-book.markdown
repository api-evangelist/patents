title: Virtual on-demand electronic book
abstract: An electronic book selection and delivery system distributes text to subscribers. The system provides for on-demand and virtual on-demand delivery of electronic books. Specified electronic books may be broadcast to a set of subscribers. Alternatively, a first section of the specified electronic books may be broadcast. A second section of each of the electronic books is then available for later delivery, upon order by a subscriber. The second sections, as well as first sections, and true on-demand electronic books may be loaded into one or more queues. The queues may then be emptied based on a priority model. Electronic books in an on-demand queue may be given priority for delivery over electronic books in other queues.

This application is also related to co-pending application filed together herewith entitled METHOD FOR VIRTUAL ON-DEMAND ELECTRONIC BOOK. These patents and applications are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention is directed to on-demand delivery of electronic books. More specifically, the invention is a virtual on-demand electronic book delivery system and method. typeset printing has the world stood on the brink of such a revolution in the distribution of text material. The definition of the word \u201cbook\u201d will change drastically in the near future. Due to reasons such as security, convenience, cost, and other technical problems, book and magazine publishers are currently only able to distribute their products in paper form. This invention solves the problems encountered by publishers.","An electronic book selection and delivery system is a new way to distribute electronic books to bookstores, public libraries, schools and subscribers. The technological breakthroughs of this invention provide a secure system for both delivering selected electronic books and receiving payments. The system has an unusual combination of features that provides the subscriber with an electronic book viewer that has a high tech aura while being very practical, portable, and easy to use.","The clear advantage of the system is that it eliminates the distribution of a physical object such as a paper book from a book or text distribution system. The purchase of an electronic book may become a PAY-PER-READ\u2122 event, avoiding the overhead, \u201cmiddle-men,\u201d printing costs, and time delay associated with the current book distribution system. Published material and text such as the President's speech, a new law, a court decision on abortion, or O. J. Simpson's testimony can be made immediately available to the subscriber at a nominal fee.","The system is a novel combination of new technology involving the television, cable, telephone, and computer industries. The system uses high bandwidth data transmissions, strong security measures, sophisticated digital switching, high resolution visual displays, novel controls, and subscriber-friendly interface software.","The primary components of the system are the subsystem for placing the text onto a signal path and the subsystem for receiving and selecting text that was placed on the signal path. An embodiment of the system includes additional components and optional features that enhance the system. The system may be configured for use by bookstores, public libraries, schools and subscribers.","The system for subscriber use is made up of four subsystems, namely: (1) an operations center, (2) a distribution system, (3) a home system including reception, selection, viewing, transacting and transmission capabilities, and (4) a billing and collection system.","The operations center performs several primary functions: manipulating text data (including receiving, formatting and storing of text data), security encoding of text, cataloging of books, providing a messaging center capability, and performing uplink functions. The system delivers the text from the operations center to subscriber homes by inserting text data into an appropriate signal path. In an embodiment, insertion of text is generally performed with an encoder at an uplink site that is within or near the operations center. If the signal path is a video signal path, the system can use several lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI), all the lines of the analog video signal, a digital video signal or unused portions of bandwidth to transmit text data. Using the VBI delivery method, the top ten or twenty book titles may be transmitted with video during normal programming utilizing existing cable, satellite, wireless or broadcast transmission capability without disruption to the subscriber's video reception. Using the entire video signal, thousands of books may be transmitted within just one hour of air time. Nearly any analog or digital video distribution system may be used to deliver the video signal with included text. The operations center may also use the Internet for delivery of electronic books. Such an operations center may include one or more web servers, delivery servers and transaction servers. The servers may be co-located, or may be linked by a high speed network, including the Internet.","The text data may also be transmitted over other low and high speed signal paths including a telephone network (e.g., a public switched telephone network) having a high speed connection such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection.","The home system performs four primary functions: connecting to the video distribution system, selecting text, storing text, and transacting through a phone or cable communicating mechanism. The components of the home system may be configured in a variety of hardware configurations. Each function may be performed by a separate component, the components may be integrated, or the capability of existing cable set top terminals and televisions may be utilized. A connector, library unit and an electronic book viewer unit are used in one embodiment. In another embodiment, all the functions of the home system are included in the single viewer unit. The connector portion of the home system receives the electronic book signal and strips or extracts the text from the signal. The library stores the text signal, provides a subscriber-friendly software interface to the system and processes the transactions at the subscriber's home. The viewer provides a screen for viewing text or menus and novel subscriber-friendly controls.","The viewer may be a portable book-shaped device that stores one or more electronic books for viewing and provides a screen for interacting with the library. A high resolution LCD display is used to both read the books and to interact with the library software. An optional phone connector or return-path cable connection initiates the telephone calls and, with the aid of the library, transmits the necessary data to complete the ordering and billing portion of the subscriber transaction. The subscriber-friendly controls include a bookmark, current book and page turn button. The billing and collection system performs transaction management, authorizations, collections and publisher payments automatically utilizing the telephone system.","True \u201con demand\u201d electronic book delivery systems require infrastructure designed and sized for worst-case peak demand service. For example, in the case of an on-demand electronic book service, the infrastructure would have to be designed to support concurrent downloading of content to the maximum number of subscribers all accessing and attempting to download electronic book content at the same time. In practice, both statistical and historical data are used to limit the design infrastructure because there is a low probability that all subscribers will actually demand service at the same time. In this case, the design can allow for a grade of service that will block access to some subscribers with a low probability of occurrence. As an example, assume a service with 1000 subscribers, where statistical and historical data indicate that the probability of having more than 100 simultaneous subscribers at any time is 0.01. The system can be designed with a 99% grade of service (i.e., at peak time, a subscriber has a 99% chance of receiving on-demand service) by an infrastructure that supports simultaneous downloading of content to 100 subscribers.","However, even with these design approaches, there are two fundamental problems:","Systems and infrastructure must be designed to support a particular grade of service at the busiest time of use, and","Subscribers will not receive on demand service if the design grade of service loading is exceeded.","The subject invention eliminates both of these problems, and allows for implementation of economic and efficient infrastructures. Further, the invention provides for increased ease of use by electronic book subscribers and increased promotional, marketing and sales opportunities for electronic book content suppliers.","The invention is entitled \u201cvirtual\u201d books on demand because from the perspective of book subscribers, the service appears to be true on-demand, while from the perspective of system and infrastructure design, efficiencies in service can be obtained because the downloading of content does not have to be on-demand.","The electronic book-on-demand system includes mechanisms for broadcasting content from centralized sources to electronic book home systems. The general approach to broadcasting content has two fundamental concepts. First, popular content is broadcast on a cyclical basis and is available to multiple subscribers at any given time. Popular content may be content that is requested by a large number of subscribers or is promoted heavily by content providers. Second, less-popular content is transmitted upon specific request by subscribers. For example, a New York Times \u201cbest seller\u201d may be transmitted cyclically while an obscure classroom textbook may be transmitted only on request by a specific subscriber. In this model, content can be viewed as a queuing model, where the broadcast medium (or media) services the queued content elements. As with any queued system, there are queuing delays from the time an element is requested until the item can be sent. These delays are variable, based on the number of items queued and the number of concurrent or overlapping requests to queue new content. As such, during non-busy times, requests for specific content are likely to be serviced on-demand, that is, there will be a very small delay due to queuing. However, with traditional approaches at busy times the delay may be substantial, and the service may not be able to meet the subscriber's expectation of on-demand service.","By moving the content from a central broadcast point to the electronic book or local library system, the electronic book-on-demand system can avoid the queuing delay problem. For example, if a subscriber's electronic book was downloaded with all of the popular content, the subscribers would have true on-demand access to this content without the need to download the content upon the subscriber's request. Although this approach works well from the subscriber's perspective, it is unreasonably inefficient in the use of extensive storage media in the book.","However, if the book unit contained the first \u201cn\u201d pages of content from each popular book (the \u201cFirst Section\u201d rather than the entire book) the subscriber could begin accessing the content immediately, while the remaining content is queued for transmission (or captured as a cyclical transmission of the electronic book) based on the subscriber's interest in this content.","The invention includes this approach of broadcasting the first section of multiple content elements, storage of these sections in the viewer or library unit, and subsequent queuing and reduced cyclical broadcasting of content in a background mode rather than an on-demand mode. True on-demand broadcasts then may be reserved for the first sections of less-popular (i.e., content that does not warrant any cyclical broadcasting) content specifically requested on-demand by system subscribers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["200","200","204","208","212","216","200","204","208","204","212","212","208","216","212"]},"Using a connector  and text selector  combination, various methods of selecting and retrieving desired text from the composite video signal are possible. Text may be preselected, selected as received or selected after being received and stored. In a method the connector  strips or extracts all the text from the composite video signal and the text selector  screens all the text as received from the connector . The text selector  only stores text in long term or permanent memory if the text passes a screening process described below.","An overview of the delivery system  is shown in . The delivery system  includes: an operations center  including an uplink site , the distribution system , a home system  including the connector , a library , a viewer , and a connector , telecommunications system , Internet web sites  and \u2032, an intranet , and a billing and collection system . Also as shown in , the home system  may include connections to a television  and a personal computer . The television  and the personal computer  may be used to display menu screens, electronic books, electronic files, or any other information associated with the delivery system . In addition, the television  and the personal computer  may provide control functions that replicate and supplement those of the viewer  and the library .","The operations center  receives textual material from outside sources, or content providers , such as publishers, newspapers, and on-line services. Alternately, the outside sources  may maintain electronic books at the Internet web site . The outside sources  may convert textual and graphical material to digital formats, or may contract with another vendor to provide this service. The operations center  may receive the textual and graphical material in various digital formats and may convert the textual material to a standard compressed format for storage. In so doing, the operations center  may create a pool of textual material that is available to be delivered to the home system . The textual material may be grouped by books or titles for easy access.","As used herein, \u201cbook\u201d means textual or graphical information such as contained in any novels, encyclopedias, articles, magazines, newspapers, periodicals, catalogs or manuals. The term \u201ctitle\u201d may represent the actual title assigned by an author to a book, or any other designation indicating a particular group, portion, or category of textual information. The title may refer to a series of related textual information, a grouping of textual information, or a portion of textual data. For example, \u201cLatest Harlequin Romance,\u201d \u201cFour Child Reading Books (Ages 10-12),\u201d \u201cEncyclopedia \u2018BRITANNICA\u2019\u2122,\u201d \u201cPresident's Speech,\u201d \u201cInstruction Manual,\u201d \u201cSchedule of 4th of July Events,\u201d \u201cPet Handbooks,\u201d \u201cRoe v. Wade,\u201d and \u201cThe Joy of Cooking\u201d are suitable titles. Also, the title may be a graphical symbol or icon. Thus, a picture of a wrench may be a title for a repair book, a picture of a computer a title for a computer book, a graphical symbol of a telephone a title for a telephone book, a drawing of a dagger a title for a mystery book, a picture of a bat and ball a title for a sports book and a picture of tickertape a title for a business book. The term \u201celectronic book\u201d refers to the electronic counterpart to a book, i.e., an electronic file. The electronic book may include any content including text, video, audio, and graphics. The term \u201can interactive electronic book\u201d refers to a book-counterpart electronic file with interactive features.","In an embodiment, the operations center  includes an uplink site  for placing the text onto a video signal and sending the composite video signal into a video distribution system. The uplink site  may include the encoder  (not shown in ) to encode the text onto the video signal.","Many analog and digital distribution systems , or other telecommunications systems, can be used with the delivery system , such as a cable television distribution system, a broadcast television distribution system, video distributed over telephone systems, distribution from the Internet, direct satellite broadcast distribution systems, and other wired and wireless distribution systems.","The home system  performs five primary functions: (1) connecting with the distribution system , (2) selecting data, (3) storing data, (4) displaying data, and (5) handling transactions. An optional function of the home system  is communicating using the telecommunications system . The home system  is made up of primarily four parts: the connector  or similar type of connector for connecting with the distribution system , the library unit  for storing and processing, the viewer , for viewing and manipulating menus and electronic books, and the connector  for connecting the telecommunications system . In an alternate arrangement, the viewer  may include all the functionality and components of the home system .","The billing and collection system  may be co-located with the operations center  or located remote from the operations center . The billing and collection system  may communicate with the home system  using the telecommunications system , for example. Any of a number of telecommunication systems, such as a cellular system, will operate with the billing and collection system . The billing and collection system  records data related to the electronic books or portions of text that are selected or ordered by the subscriber. The billing and collection system  may charge a subscriber's credit account or bill the subscriber. In addition, the billing and collection system  may monitor the amount due to publishers or other outside sources  who have provided textual data or other services such as air time to enable the delivery system  to operate.","When electronic books are provided via the Internet web site , the billing and collecting functions may be incorporated into the Internet web site . For example, a subscriber may pay for an electronic book selection by entering a credit card number into a data field of a page of the Internet web site . In this configuration, a separate billing and collection system may not be required.","The Internet web site \u2032 may be used in conjunction with the home system  to provide additional functionality. For example, the Internet web site \u2032 may be a college professor's Internet web site that is used to post examinations for use with an interactive electronic book, and at which the students may post completed examinations, for example. The Internet web site \u2032 may also be a chat room, bulletin board, or news group site that is used to communicate information related to one or more electronic books.","The intranet  may be a local network linking together a number of related subscribers. For example, a university may establish an intranet for its students. Connections may be provided in dormitory rooms, or through use of an interface device for off-campus students. The intranet  may include a connection to the university's library so that electronic books maintained by the university may be provided to the students. The intranet  may also include web sites for the university's professors, similar to the Internet web site \u2032. In this case, all the functionality of the Internet web site \u2032 would be included in the web sites in the intranet .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","a "],"b":["301","200","301","282","302","250","306","278","254","310","250","250","318","322","326","318","322","326"]},"The billing and collection system \u2032 shown has two sections (, ) one for transaction management, authorizations and publisher payments , and the other for customer service . The customer service section  provides for data entry and access to customer account information. Transaction accounting information  is supplied to credit card companies  by the transaction management section  of the billing and collection system \u2032. The credit card companies  provide billing  to customers either electronically or by mail.","Three methods for communicating between customer base  and the billing and collection system \u2032 are shown: by telephone switching  alone, cellular switching  and telephone switching  combined, and by use of the cable system  and the telephone switching . The system shown supports both one-way  and two-way  cable communication with customers. Public libraries and schools  as well as bookstores  may use the delivery system .","Public libraries and schools  may have a modified system to allow the viewer  to be checked-out or borrowed while bookstores  may rent or sell the viewer  and sell the electronic books. The bookstores  as well as the public libraries and schools  may be serviced by cable . Optional direct broadcast systems (DBS)  can also be used with the delivery system . The DBS  may provide the electronic books using digital satellite technology, with the electronic books being received via a backyard satellite antenna, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["b ","b"],"b":["301","282","279","282","279","282","283","283","279","279"]},"The electronic books may then be transferred via a public switched telephone network (PSTN), for example, direct to a subscriber , a library  and a bookstore .

The Operations Center",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["250","254","250","302","250","402","402","404","406","404","250","410","410","414"]},"The processing at the operations center  is controlled by a processor , which uses an instruction memory . The processor  and instruction memory  may be supplied by a personal computer or mini-computer. To perform the catalog and messaging functions, the operations center  uses a catalog and message memory  and the text generator  if necessary.","The data stream of text, catalog and messages may be encoded by security module encoding  prior to being sent to the uplink module . Various encoding techniques may be used by the security encoding module  such as the commercial derivative of NSA's encryption algorithm (Data Encryption System (DES)) and General Instrument's DigiCipher II. Following encoding, the encoded text may be stored in text memory  prior to being sent to the uplink . A first-in-first-out text memory arrangement may be used under the control of the processor . Various types of memory may be used for the text memory  including RAM. The operations center  may use file server technology for the text memory  to catalog and spool electronic books for transmission as is described below.","To transmit textual data (i.e., electronic books), the delivery system  may use high bandwidth transmission techniques such as those defined by the North American Broadcast Teletext Standard (NABTS) and the World System Teletext (WST) standard. Using the WST format (where each line of the Vertical Blanking Interval contains 266 data bits), a four hundred page book, for example, may be transmitted during programming using four lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval at a rate of approximately one book every 1.6 minutes (63,840 bits per second). Alternatively, electronic books may be transmitted over a dedicated channel, which interrupts programming so that 246 lines of video can be used to transmit approximately 2,250 books every hour (3.9 Mbits per second). A teletext type format is the simplest but possibly the slowest text format to use with the delivery system . In either event, an encoder  is utilized at an uplink site  to insert textual data into the analog video signal. In many other respects, the delivery of the textual information is completed using existing cable television plant and equipment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":["282","250","500","282","250","254","504","254","250","282"]},"As shown in block , files are broken into smaller packets of information.

In some instances, it may be preferable to utilize unused portions of bandwidth (such as 5-40 MHZ, 70-75 MHZ, 100-109 MHZ or other guard bands) instead of the video lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b ","b":["508","512","516","520","532","524","524","532","528","524","536","540","544","544","516","548","552"]},"As an alternative to cable, satellite, broadcast, or other television delivery methods, the public telephone system may be used to transmit books to the subscribers. An average electronic book would take about 7 minutes to transmit over the public telephone system. Using the telephone system, it is not necessary to combine video and text into a composite signal. In most other respects, the operations center  would remain similar whether text delivery was by telephone or cable. File server technology (such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875, entitled AUDIO\/VIDEO NILE SERVER INCLUDING DECOMPRESSION\/PLAYBACK MEANS, issued to Mincer, et al., and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, entitled FILE SERVER SYSTEM HAVING HIGH-SPEED WRITE EXECUTION, issued to Noveck, et al., incorporated herein by reference) may be used at the operations center  with a telephone system text delivery method.","As another alternative to cable, television, and telephone system delivery, the public telephone system may be used to provide access to the Internet, where the Internet web site  (see ) may be accessed. Electronic books may be ordered, paid for, and delivered directly from the Internet web site  over the telephone system.","In any delivery system using the telephone system, individual subscribers may increase the electronic book delivery rate by incorporating high speed modems or other communication devices such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connector, or by use of a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)","II. The Home System","The hardware configuration for a multiple component home system  is shown in . shows a hardware configuration for a two component home system. The hardware components may also be incorporated into a single unit that communicates with a terminal in a television delivery system or with a telephone system by use of a modem, for example. The home system  performs several functions, such as receiving data and video transmissions, stripping (or extracting) the data from the video signal, screening and storing the data, providing subscriber-friendly interface controls and software, displaying menus and text, processing transactions, initiating telephone calls and transmitting billing data. Various hardware configurations may be utilized to achieve the desired functions of the home system . For example, as shown in , the home system  can be configured to use the reception and channel tuning capability of the current installed subscriber base of cable converter boxes and televisions . The home system  can be designed as an advanced set top terminal converter box with menu generation capability, electronic memory and a telephone modem as described in section V below. The home system  may also use other telecommunications systems such as the PSTN to receive electronic books.","The electronic components that make up the home system  may be arranged in a variety of ways. In the four unit system of the viewer  and library unit  are wired together via a signal path  while the remaining components communicate through RF transceivers . Alternatively, the viewer  and the library unit  may communicate using RF signaling over wireless path \u2032.","Also shown in is an auxiliary data device , connected to the viewer , which may be a hand-held calculator or a separate disk drive or other data storage device, for example. A printer  may be connected to the viewer  and\/or the library .","In an embodiment of the home system  there are only two units, the library  and the viewer . shows a two unit home system  with certain optional features. Finally, all the functionality and components of the home system  may be incorporated into one electronic book unit, or viewer .","Referring to , the viewer  may be equipped with a high resolution viewing area , digital logic (including a key , security , and a microprocessor ), video graphics control and memory , power supply circuitry  (not shown), an optional battery  and an optional RF transceiver . In a two unit arrangement, the library  contains the connector function to the distribution system , connector function to the telecommunications system , and memory  (which may be removable and portable \u2032). More specifically, the library  may include data stripping functions , digital logic , the memory , power circuitry , optional telephone connections  (including cellular or PCN \u2032), an optional battery (not shown), optional tuner module  and an optional RF transceiver . The video connector  and the telecommunications system connection , as well as the removable portable memory \u2032 of the library  may be broken out into separate components. (shows a removable portable hard disk memory \u2032 with removable cartridges .) The home system  may include an attached keyboard  or a wireless keyboard  (shown in ). Both the attached keyboard  and the wireless keyboard  may be used to communicate with the viewer  or the library . The viewer  may also receive data from auxiliary data source  including a programmable, hand-held calculator and a separate disk drive or other data storage device, for example. The viewer  may output data and text, such as a portion of the electronic book, to the printer  or other display device.","The wireless keyboard  may communicate via radio frequency (RF) signaling, for example. Therefore, the home system  may have as many as six separate components that communicate with each other. The two, three, four, five or six separate components that make up the home system  can communicate with each other in a variety of ways, including hardwired connection , RF transceiver , and other wireless methods.","RF communications are preferred in the home because they allow separate components to be located throughout the home without restriction. The data communicated between the units is preferably secure data. In addition, the library  may provide power to the viewer  through the hardwired connection .","Alternatively, a single unit may perform all of the home system  functions. The single unit may use light-weight materials, including a light-weight battery. A single unit eliminates the need to communicate (externally) between units. The single unit is less expensive and eliminates duplicative processing, memory storage and power circuitry.","To receive and strip the data from the video signal at the subscriber's home, the connector , which may be either a cable interface device or cable connector, for example, is used. The cable connector device includes a tuner , while the cable interface device makes use of existing tuning equipment in the home. In either configuration, data is stripped from the video signal and stored at the subscriber's location in the library . The connector , and modem  initiate telephone calls and transmit ordering and billing information to the operations center  or billing and collection system . Alternatively, the connecter  and the modem  may be used to provide access to the Internet to order and receive electronic books from an Internet web site. A digital connector  is provided to communicate digital information with the set top . The library  incorporates the hardware and software necessary to store the text data, generate menus and effect the purchase transactions. In addition to an RF transceiver , the library  also includes the necessary jacks and connections to allow the delivery system  to be connected to the viewer .

Book Suggestion System","In addition to free previews, in more sophisticated embodiments, the delivery system  provides the subscriber with an electronic book suggestion feature (see ). This is accomplished using the menu system  and the processor with associated memory located at the viewer , library  or at the distribution point ( or ). When necessary, information for the program suggestion feature is sent in the text data of the composite video signal or other transmission medium, including the PSTN, to the home system . With this feature, books or authors are suggested to a subscriber based upon historical data of the subscriber's previous orders, demographics or mood of the subscriber, other indicators, and\/or by text word searches.","In a book suggestion embodiment, text word searches of preview information (such as book cover descriptions, critics' reviews and biographies about the author) and\/or text of books or other titles are performed by the library  using databases stored in the library memory . Personalized book or author suggestions are made to the subscriber by obtaining information from the subscriber indicative of general subscriber interests. Subscriber entries are solicited from the subscriber preferably using the electronic book suggestion entries submenu . The system uses these subscriber entries either directly or indirectly to search for books or authors to suggest to the subscriber. The book suggestion feature may also be supported by databases and processors located at the distribution point ( or ).","Generally, the book suggestion methods may be categorized into two categories, either responsive methods (which respond to a series of subscriber menu entries), or intelligent methods (which analyze data to suggest an electronic book). Using a responsive or intelligent method, the delivery system  determines a list of suggested titles or authors and creates a second or third level submenu ,  to suggest the titles for subscriber selection.","Responsive methods of suggesting titles include, for example, the use of mood questions, searching for authors, and keyword searching. Using the instruction memory  and menu generation hardware (e.g., ) of the viewer , a series of mood questions can be presented on menus to determine a subscribers interest at a particular time. For this methodology, the operations center's  processor  and instruction memory  assign each title mood indicators (and subindicators) from a group such as light, serious, violent, short, long, dull, exciting, complex, easy-read, young theme, old theme, adventure, romance, drama, fiction, science-fiction, etc. These indicators are sent to the home system  with the text data and are stored in the library memory . Based upon the subscriber entries, the processor  associates a set of indicators with the subscriber's request and a set of electronic books with matching indicators are located for suggesting to the subscriber.","Responsive searches for authors or keywords (a search word provided by the subscriber) are generally performed by the library processor  and instruction memory  on data stored in the library memory . For example, a keyword given by the subscriber may be searched for a match in library memory  storing the book reviews, critics and previews databases. Thus, if a subscriber provided an entry of the word \u201csubmarine\u201d on an appropriate submenu, the title \u201cHunt For Red October\u201d may be located by the library processor  using instruction from a routine in the instruction memory .","Intelligent methods of suggesting programs include analyzing personal profile data on the subscriber and\/or historical data about the subscriber such as past books ordered by the subscriber (or buy data). This method is preferred in a book on demand system and can be performed at the distribution point or operations center  by the on-site processor  using subscriber databases stored in memory . The home system  receives the text data including program suggestion information from the distribution point, e.g., the operations center  and generates the program suggestion submenus , ,  using the same text data receiving  and viewer menu generation hardware (e.g., , ) described above. Software routines and algorithms stored in instruction memories (e.g. , ) are used to analyze historical data and book ordered data to determine a line of books to suggest to the subscriber.","The algorithms for this powerful feature of suggesting books or authors to subscribers are disclosed in great detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,549, entitled REPROGRAMMABLE TERMINAL FOR SUGGESTING PROGRAMS OFFERED ON A TELEVISION PROGRAM DELIVERY SYSTEM, issued Sep. 24, 1996, and are incorporated herein by reference.","III. The Billing and Collection System","The billing and collection system  (shown in ) uses the latest technology in electronic transaction and telephone switching to track orders, authorize deliveries, bill subscribers, and credit publishers automatically. The telephone calls initiated by the connector  are received by the billing and collection system , which responds immediately without human intervention by placing the order and charging the subscribers credit card account. Data is compiled periodically and publishers  are credited for sales of their books or other text. The billing and collection system  may also connect with subscribers through two-way cable connections, cellular, or other communication means.","The billing and collection system  may communicate with the operations center  to track changes in available books and to provide statistical data to the operations center .","IV.

The main unit at the public library is the file server . The file server  is a large electronic memory unit that can store thousands of electronic books. Various electronic storage means may be used in the file servers, such as hard disks, read-write CD ROMs and read-only CD ROMs.","The system comprises five components; the file server , a converter or video connector , a controller , a viewer , and a catalog printer . Also shown in is a connection to the Internet web site  and the intranet . The software for controlling the system is primarily located in the controller . The converter or video connector  is similar to those described above. In this configuration the controller unit  monitors the data being transferred to the file server  by the converter . The controller  is preferably provided with a viewing screen and several control buttons. When it is necessary to have a larger screen to perform more sophisticated controlling of the system a viewer  may be connected to the controller  and the viewer screen and controls  may be used.","The controller  is only able to download books to public viewers  that are authorized to receive books from the particular file server . For security reasons the public viewer  may not have access to more than one file server . In this way, security can be maintained over the text data for books. The public viewer  may be limited to receiving one or two electronic books at a time from the controller . When the subscriber of the public viewer  needs a new or additional electronic book, the subscriber returns the viewer  to the school or public library where the subscriber receives a new electronic book from the controller .","In order to track the electronic books that are available on the file server , the titles of the available books may be printed on a catalog printer . The catalog printer  is connected to the library controller  and the titles of the electronic books are downloaded to the catalog printer . None of the coded text for any of the electronic books can be printed using the controller  and catalog printer  of this system. In order to maintain security over the data, none of the electronic book data is allowed to be downloaded to the printer . Once a complete printout of available electronic book titles, magazines, or other textual material is complete, a hard copy of the catalog  can be maintained at the file server .","The Internet web site  may also be used to download content to the server . The intranet  may be established between local libraries in a jurisdiction. For example, all public libraries in a country may be joined by the intranet . Using the intranet , the local public libraries may share electronic books and other data.","The system shown in may also be used at bookstores. The bookstores can rent the public viewer  to subscribers with the text for one or two electronic books loaded onto the public viewer . The public viewer  may be provided with an automatic timeout sequence. The timeout sequence would erase the textual data for the books after a certain period of time, for example, two weeks. It is expected that after a period of time (perhaps within two weeks) the subscriber would return the public viewer  to the bookstore and receive additional electronic books for viewing. Using this arrangement, it is also possible for the bookstore to (permanently) sell a viewer  to a regular subscriber. The subscriber then returns to the bookstore from time to time to receive textual data for an electronic book which the customer can then store permanently on the subscriber's own viewer . Various other configurations are possible for bookstores, schools and public libraries using the file server  and public viewer  described.","A school library, such as a university library, may use an arrangement of components such as shown in . Many of the components are the same between and . In , software for controlling the system is primarily located in the controller \u2032. The converter or video connector \u2032 is similar to those described above.

Alternately, the university may distribute electronic books through a university intranet such as the intranet . Software operating on the server  may keep track of electronic books loaned to individual students. The students may be required to \u201creturn\u201d the electronic books after a set time, or at the end of a semester, for example.","In order to track the electronic books that are available on the file server \u2032, the titles of the available books may be printed on a catalog printer \u2032. The catalog printer \u2032 is connected to the library controller \u2032 and the titles of the electronic books are downloaded to the catalog printer \u2032.","The intranet  may also be establish connection between university libraries that are members of an inter-library loan program. In this way, electronic books that are resident at one university library may be sent to another university library for eventual loan to a student. In an alternative arrangement, the Internet may be used for inter-library loan programs.","V. Use of a Set Top Terminal","Existing set top terminals such as those made by Scientific Atlanta or General Instruments are presently unequipped to handle the delivery system  of the present invention. Although set top terminals may be built which include the library functions, hardware modifications are necessary in order to use the delivery system  with existing set top terminal technology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0181"},"figref":["FIGS. 16","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"i":["a ","b ","a","b"],"b":["16","601","601"]},"A card addition  to a set top terminal  is depicted in . The card  shown provides the additional functionality needed to utilize the book selection system with existing set top terminal  technology. The card  may be configured to slip inside the frame of a set top terminal and become part of the set top terminal, an advanced set top terminal. The primary functions the card  adds to the set top terminal  are the interpreting of data signals, generating of menus, sequencing of menus, and, ultimately, the ability of the subscriber to select an electronic book using either the television or a viewer . The card  also provides a method for a remote location, such as the cable headend, to receive information on electronic books ordered. The electronic books ordered information and control commands may be passed from the cable headend to the card  using telephone lines.","The primary components of the card  are a PC chip CPU , a VGA graphic controller , a video combiner , logic circuitry , NTSC encoder , a receiver , demodulator (not shown), and a dialer \u2032. The card  operates by receiving the data text signal from the cable headend through the coaxial cable. The logic circuitry  of the card  receives data , infrared commands , and synchronization signals (not shown) from the set top terminal . Menu selections made by the viewer  on the remote control are received by the set top terminal's  IR equipment and passed through to the card . The card  interprets the IR signal and determines the electronic book (or menu) the subscriber has selected. The card  modifies the IR command to send the information to the set top terminal . The modified IR command contains the channel information needed by the set top terminal . Using the phone line  and dialer \u2032, the card  is able to transmit electronic books ordered information to the cable headend. It is also possible to receive the electronic books over the telephone lines and by-pass the video distribution system. In this embodiment, the telephone system may be used to provide access to an Internet web site to order and receive electronic books.","These commands are passed through the interface linking the set top terminal's microprocessor with the microprocessor of the hardware upgrades. In this way, subscriber inputs, entered through the set top terminal keypad or remote control, can be transferred to any of the hardware upgrades for processing and responses generated therein can then be sent back to the set top terminal for display. In the preferred embodiment the IR commands  are transferred from set top terminal  to hardware upgrade.","Hardware upgrades may include a microprocessor, interactive software, processing circuitry, bubble memory, and a long-term memory device. In addition to these basic components, the hardware upgrade may make use of an additional telephone modem or CD-ROM device.","An information download hardware upgrade  (shown in ) allows the subscriber to download large volumes of information from the operations center  or cable headend using the set top terminal . The hardware upgrade  will enable subscribers to download data, such as electronic books and magazines, to local storage. Primarily, the hardware upgrade  is an additional local storage unit  (e.g., hard disk, floppy, optical disk or magnetic cartridge and may include a microprocessor , instruction memory , and a random access memory , as shown in ). The viewer  also may be provided with the upgrade  to enable downloaded text to be read without the use of a TV.","The downloadable information may be text or graphics supplied by the operations center  or cable headend. With this upgrade, electronic books may be downloaded and read anywhere with the viewer . Using this upgrade, electronic books may be downloaded and stored in compressed form for later decompression. The electronic books would be decompressed only at the time of viewing. Important text that the public desires immediate access may made available through this system. Text such as the President's speech, a new law, or a recent abortion decision rendered by the Supreme Court may be made immediately available.","In an embodiment, electronic book ordering information is stored at each set top terminal until it is polled by the cable headend using a polling request message format. An example of a polling request message format consists of six fields, namely: (1) a leading flag at the beginning of the message, (2) an address field, (3) a subscriber region designation, (4) a set top terminal identifier that includes a polling command\/response (or P\/F) bit, (5) an information field, and (6) a trailing flag at the end of the message. A similar response frame format for information communicated by the set top terminal to the cable headend in response to the polling request may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0189"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":["617","981","601","981","617","981","601"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0190"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["617","613","983","990","266","613","987","987"]},"Data targeted to individual set top terminals is received by the data receiver \u2032 according to each set top terminal's specific address or ID. In this way, each addressable set top terminal only receives its own data. The data receiver \u2032 may receive set top terminal  specific data in the information field of the signal frame described or on a separate data carrier located at a convenient frequency in the incoming spectrum.","The received data includes information regarding electronic books and menus available for selection. The subscriber may enter a series of commands  using a keypad or remote control in order to choose an electronic book or menu. Upon receipt of such commands, the microprocessor  instructs the tuner to tune to the proper frequency of the channel carrying data and subsequently instructs the processing circuitry  to begin descrambling of this data.","Upon selection of the electronic book, the microprocessor  stores any selection information in local memory (not shown) for later data transmission back to the cable headend. The microprocessor  coordinates all CATV signal reception and also interacts with various upstream data transmission components. Typically, the data transmitter  operates in the return frequency band between 5 and 30 MHZ. In an alternative embodiment, the frequency band of 10 to 15 MHZ may be used. Regardless, however, of the frequency band used, the data transmitter  sends information to the cable headend in the information field of the response frame described. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of variations and combinations of the above-described set top terminal hardware components may be used to accomplish upstream data transmissions.","In the preceding described the use of a set top terminal with the electronic book system. All the functionality of the set top terminal may also be incorporated into a card that is a component of a television.","VI. Books-on-Demand System","Electronic books may be distributed using an electronic book-on-demand system. shows an embodiment of an electronic book-on-demand system . The electronic book-on-demand system  may use powerful two-way communications between a subscriber's home, a bookstore, a school or a public library, for example, and a distribution site . The distribution site  may include an operations center or a cable headend of a television delivery system, or any other remote location capable of storing and transmitting digital data. The distribution site  may also include or use an Internet web site, such as the Internet web site  shown in . In an embodiment, the two-way communication may be provided by the hardware shown in  and described above. The book-on-demand system  may be used in conjunction with the broadcast delivery system  described above to create a virtual book-on-demand system. In this embodiment, the broadcast delivery system  may be used to send initial portions of some electronic book and the book-on-demand system  may be used to delivery the remaining portions on demand. Additional electronic book ordering and delivery systems and methods related to alternative communication paths are described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/289,957, entitled Electronic Book Alternative Delivery Systems, filed on Apr. 13, 1999, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The electronic book-on-demand system  shown in may use offsite storage to include a current library of electronic books that a subscriber may order. As an intermediary between the subscriber's terminal and the content provider  (or other remote site such as a video service provider), the distribution site  performs several functions. The distribution site  provides the primary means for delivering content to individual subscribers. In addition, the distribution site  may prepare the electronic books for delivery. That is, the distribution site  may incorporate the equipment and routines needed to digitize, encrypt, and compress electronic books for transmission to the subscriber terminals. The distribution site  may determine the optimum transmission media, time and date for delivery, and routing plan to send an electronic book to a particular terminal. For example, if a subscriber's terminal accesses the distribution site  using a telephone network, the distribution site may determine the least cost route to transmit the electronic book data. If the subscriber's terminal accesses the distribution site using a cable television system, the distribution site may multiplex the electronic book data with signals and digital information received from the cable television operations center for delivery to the subscriber's terminal. Thus, the distribution site may offer different subscribers different delivery options and may allocate the electronic book data in various manners to accommodate different viewers.","Referring to , in the electronic book-on-demand system , the subscriber selects an electronic book to be downloaded from a menu of available electronic books (see, for example, and ). Data for menus of available electronic books may be sent by the distribution site  to a terminal at a subscriber's location. Terminal may be the home system  described above. Alternatively, terminals , and may be a digital television, a set top terminal and a personal computer, respectfully, or any component capable of receiving digital data, for example. The data for menus may be sent by incorporating the data into a composite video signal, a radio signal, or by using a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the Internet, an intranet, a local area network, a wired or wireless data network, a wireless telephone network, a satellite distribution system, and by hard copy, for example. The menu data may be used at the home system , for example, to generate a menu of available electronic books. Alternatively, the menu data could be presented in the form of a pre-formatted menu. The menu data may also be used to generate a menu of available electronic books that is customized to a particular subscriber. The subscriber can create one or more custom menus by specifying general areas of interest or other data. For example, the subscriber could indicate a preference for mystery novels. In this embodiment, the home system  may generate a menu of available electronic books that are classified as mysteries. The subscriber may also be presented with a customized menu based on books read data collected by the terminals , , and , the distribution site , or the billing and collection system , for example.","The subscriber may select an electronic book to purchase from the menu of available electronic books such as the books you can order menu  shown in . To select the electronic book for purchase, the subscriber may use a remote control device to highlight a selection from the menu  and then operate a send button (not shown in ) to send an order to the distribution site .","After the subscriber's menu selection, information about the subscriber's selection (or order) is communicated to the distribution point  using the two-way cable , the one-way cable , or the telephone system , for example. The electronic book order may also be transmitted by any other suitable means including a LAN, the Internet, and an intranet, for example.","Upon receipt of the electronic book order, the needed textual and graphical information for the electronic book may be spooled and sent to the subscriber. In this manner, electronic books may be sent only when requested by the subscriber. The electronic books may be sent immediately upon demand for the electronic books. Alternatively, the electronic books may be sent after a delay. The length of delay may vary, and may be based on the number of electronic book orders being processed at the distribution site . The delay may also be based on different classes of service. For example, a subscriber may be willing to pay extra for immediate delivery of electronic books.","To support the electronic book-on-demand system , electronic book delivery and distribution may be conducted using a strong nodal architecture distribution system, such as a video-on-demand cable system, a telephone system, individual telephone calls on the PSTN or a wireless telephone system, through the Internet, a local area network, a wired or wireless data network, a wireless telephone network, and a satellite distribution system, for example. The electronic books may also be distributed on storage media such as a CD-ROM, a floppy disk, a PCMCIA card, or a number of other data storage options.","The electronic book-on-demand system  allows for a greater selection of electronic books by the subscriber and limits the amount of communicated electronic book data that is unnecessary or unneeded. The electronic book-on-demand system  also provides the electronic books to the subscriber in a much more timely fashion than other techniques.","The electronic book-on-demand system  may use the distribution site  with sophisticated equipment to access and spool out the electronic books. This can be accomplished using a file server  for storing the electronic books and distribution technology such as cable channel modulators , ATM \u2032 or telephone-type switching  to distribute the electronic books. The file server  and distribution technology that may be used in configuring the electronic book-on-demand system  is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, cited above.","In addition to electronic books, the electronic book-on-demand system  of may support distribution of nearly any digital data. Books or textual files may be received from a publisher  and other sources through local feeds , ATM , and by satellite dish , for example. The data is then stored in a memory  at the file server . In an embodiment, the distribution site  is a cable headend that receives requests from subscribers and delivers text to subscribers over a one-way or a two-way communication system (such as the two-way cable ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0202","num":"0205"},"figref":"FIG. 18","i":"b ","b":["1020","1000","1020","1060","1060","1029","1036","1064","1068","1072","282","1072"]},"A system controller  provides control over the electronic book-on-demand system . Electronic books may be packaged into groups to provide feeds to various regional distributors. In addition, scheduling and marketing research may be conducted at the distribution site . In order to handle the scheduling and market research, electronic book buy data may be received at the distribution site  through a multiplexer . Electronic book buy information may be provided by the distribution site  to the billing and collection system . This data may be used to determine which electronic book should be broadcast more frequently.","The system  may also be coupled to a virtual book-on-demand system (not shown in and ). The virtual book-on-demand system functions to deliver books to subscribers in a manner that appears to be on demand, but that in reality uses some type of delayed delivery mechanism. The virtual book-on-demand system may send a signal to the system  to delivery, or broadcast, one or more electronic books to subscribers as a part of the virtual on-demand process. A virtual book-on-demand system will be described in detail later.","The distribution site  also may be equipped to insert messages or advertisements into the file server. These messages or advertisements will eventually be received by the subscribers.","The master file server  uses an output multiplexer  and the ATM \u2032 as well as satellite connections to distribute digital data. In an embodiment, the distribution site  is a national distribution site and regional distributors  receive digital data from the master file server  through the output multiplexer  and the ATM \u2032. After receiving the electronic books, the regional distributors  store the electronic books in a local file server .","The system controller  includes control software  and an instruction memory to accomplish the processing capabilities of the distribution site . illustrates the various levels of processing capabilities that can be performed by the system controller . Specifically, illustrates an example of the processing routines \u2032 that are included within the control software .","As shown in , the processing routines \u2032 include a Main Program  that calls a Reception routine  as subscriber communications are received. The first level of processing involves identifying the subscriber request . This level of processing can use a Book Request routine  and a Menu Request routine  as well as other routines  for other data requests. The second processing level involves processing the subscriber request . This second processing level may make use of several routines, including a near electronic book-on-demand (NBOD) routine , a virtual electronic book-on-demand (VBOD) routine . The NBOD routine  may be used to process electronic book orders with a resulting slight time delay, from a few minutes to a few hours, for example, between order and delivery. The VBOD routine  may be used to process electronic book orders so that subscribers experience no perceptible delay between order and delivery of an electronic book. The second processing level may also include an advertisement targeting routine , an interactive electronic book routine , and an electronic book suggestion routine . The third level of processing involves locating the data that corresponds to the subscriber's communication or request . Typically, this third processing level may involve the use of a Standard Menus routine  and\/or a Custom Menus routine . The final processing level involves sending the data located in the previous step to the subscriber . This final level of processing can involve a Spool Data routine  and a Text Overlay routine .","Using such a set of processing levels, the system controller  can use its control software  and processing routines \u2032 to: identify the type of subscriber request  received in the subscriber communications; process the subscriber's request  to determine the data to reply to the identified subscriber request; locate the reply data corresponding to the subscriber's request ; and send the located reply data to the subscriber  for local processing by the subscriber's set top terminal. provides only an example of the various processing capabilities available within the distribution site  and those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of other variations in processing levels and routines are feasible.","Although other routines are feasible, the routines identified in can be used to perform system controller  monitoring and management functions. The Reception routine  is the initial routine called by the Main Program  upon receiving a subscriber communication. The Reception routine  can be used to interpret the subscriber communication. The Reception routine  designates the type of subscriber communication as an electronic book request, a menu request or, a data services request. Depending on the type of request, the Reception routine  calls either a Electronic Book Request routine , a Menu Request routine , or an Other Data Requests routine .","With reference to and , the Electronic Book Request routine  is one of the routines that identifies the type of request carried by the communications from a subscriber. The Program Request routine  is called by the Reception routine , \u2032 for all subscriber communications that are related to delivery of an electronic book. The Program Request routine , \u2032 identifies the type of electronic book request in real time as a NBOD request, a VBOD request, an interactive electronic book request, and\/or a request that may be used in the targeting of advertisements to a subscriber. The Electronic Book Request routine  identifies the request and calls the appropriate routine to process the electronic book request.","The Menu Request routine  is another routine that identifies the type of request carried by the communications received from a subscriber. The Menu Request routine  is called by the Reception routine  for all subscriber communications that are menu related. The Menu Request routine  identities the type of menu request in real time as a standard menu or a custom menu. The Menu Request routine  identifies the request and calls the appropriate routine to process the menu request.","The NBOD routine  is one of the routines that can process an electronic book request. The NBOD routine  is called by the Electronic Book Request routine  in order to process a request for a NBOD. The NBOD routine  determines whether a menu or an electronic book will be provided in response to the subscriber request. Where an electronic book is to be provided, the routine determines the transmission medium for transmission of the requested electronic book. The subscriber will subsequently be sent data that verifies the subscriber's terminal is coupled to that transmission medium. The NBOD routine  calls the appropriate routine to locate and\/or send the response to the subscriber.","The VBOD routine  is another routine that processes an electronic book request. The VBOD routine  is called by the Electronic Book Request routine  in order to process a request for VBOD. The VBOD routine  determines whether a menu or an electronic book will be displayed in response to the subscriber request. The VBOD routine  calls the appropriate routine to locate and\/or send the response to the subscriber.","The Advertisement Targeting routine  is a routine that generates packages of commercials and advertisements geared towards particular subscribers. The Advertisement Targeting routine  may make use of a subscriber's demographic information and\/or reading habits to determine those advertisements that are of most interest to that particular subscriber. In so doing, the routine  outputs packages of advertisements targeted towards each subscriber.","The Interactive Electronic Book routine  is another routine that may process an electronic book request. The Interactive Electronic Book routine  is called by the Electronic Book Request routine  in order to process a request for an interactive electronic book. The Interactive Electronic Book routine  makes use of a look-up table that pre-stores all possible subscriber answers to interactive questions posed by the interactive electronic book. The use of a look-up table enables the routine to process subscriber communications and determine a message or electronic book response that can be rapidly generated in order to perform real time interactivity.","The Electronic Book Suggestion routine  is a routine that responds to a menu request . The Electronic Book Suggestion routine  generates particular menus displaying programs for subscriber selection that are geared towards particular subscribers. The Electronic Book Suggestion routine  may use a subscriber's demographic information and\/or reading habits to determine those electronic book or electronic book categories that can be suggested to the subscriber. The routine may also, for example, make use of text searches of electronic book abstracts or query the subscriber for mood in order to determine a suggestion. Thus, the Electronic Book Suggestion routine  can determine whether electronic book data or a menu should be sent to the subscriber in order to carry out the suggestion process.","Once one of the above routines that processes requests has been run, one of routines that can be used to locate data and generate menus can be called. The Standard Menus routine  is a routine that is used to locate data in the file server  and generate a standard or generic menu that can be sent to any subscriber. The Standard Menus routine  makes use of menus that are pre-stored in the file server . The Standard Menus routine  locates the data for the pre-stored menus so that the located data for the menu can be subsequently sent to a subscriber.","The Custom Menus routine  is a routine that is used to locate data and generate a custom menu that is to be sent to a specific subscriber. Because the custom menu must be rapidly created and sent to the subscriber, the Custom Menu routine makes use of a standardized menu format having pre-stored background sections so that video data, such as MPEG 2 data streams, and future MPEG data streams or other encoded data streams can be built for sections of the menu screen in anticipation of the subscriber's communication. In conjunction with the pre-stored menu sections, the routine also makes use of a look-up table that can be used to generate text messages of pre-determined lengths. The routine can then insert or interleave the generated text messages with the pre-built data streams in order to generate a customized menu screen in real time. Alternatively, the menu screen can be built in full and text messages overlaid using text overlaying techniques.","Once a menu has been located or generated or an electronic book request has been otherwise processed, the MPEG 2 data stream or the encoded data stream located or generated must be sent to a subscriber. The Spool Data routine  is a routine that is used to spool such located or generated data. The Spool Data routine  prompts the file server  to send the located or generated data to the subscriber.","The Electronic Book Suggestion routine  is another routine that can be used to send the located or generated data to a subscriber. This routine allows data to be sent to a subscriber in the form of text that can be overlaid on a menu or an electronic book. The routine accommodates both methods of (i) sending text embedded in a signal carrying the menu data, which enables a terminal with a text generator to process the signal and text message and overlay the text onto the menu; and (ii) generating a text message and inserting the text message at the distribution site  into the signal that carries the menu data before the signal is distributed to the terminals.","In addition to the above routines, many other routines  may be used by the system controller  in performing its processing functions. For example, an Account\/Billing routine may be run to generate billing reports for each terminal. Those skilled in the art will recognize a number of other routines and processing flows that can be used to perform the same functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0226"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19"],"i":["b ","a"],"b":["264","1264","264","1076","1283","1283","1293"]},"The Electronic Book Request routine  could, in turn, call the Interactive Electronic Book routine  in order to process the subscriber's request. The data corresponding to the response to the subscriber's request (or \u201canswer\u201d in this example) would then be located and spooled for distribution to the subscriber by the spool data routine . If the response to the subscriber's answer processed by the Interactive Electronic Book routine  requires the use of a menu or another method for generating a question to the subscriber, the Menus routine  would be called before the data is spooled by the Spool Data routine  or the question is overlaid on the interactive electronic book using the Text Overlay routine .

When the peak demand has subsided, the computer system  would cease the processing and delivery functions. Thus, by sharing resources with other high speed computer systems, the electronic book-on-demand system  can meet demand, even when that demand exceeds system capacity.","In any electronic system used for delivery of electronic books, some processing delays may occur from the time an electronic book order arrives at a remote location such as the operations center  shown in . shows an electronic book-on-demand system  that may be used for near real-time processing and delivery of electronic books. The system  includes a processor or server  that processes the electronic book orders. A queue  stores pending electronic book orders that await processing by the server . If the server  is available for processing, the electronic book order will be serviced immediately. Otherwise, the electronic book order may enter the queue  to await availability of the server . When the server  becomes available, an electronic book order leaves the queue  and is serviced. Queues, such as the queue , may be any type of queue such as a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue, for example. Alternately, the system  could include more than one queue. Then, one or more of the queues may operate on a priority basis so that orders for certain electronic books or orders placed by certain subscribers may be placed in a higher priority queue that will be accessed in preference to lower priority queues.","A well-known queuing model may be used to explain the fundamental operation of the electronic book on demand system .

That is, an electronic book order may enter an authorization subsystem, and may be queued in that system. After processing in the authorization subsystem, the electronic book order may arrive at a processing subsystem and be queued at the processing subsystem.","In the discussion above regarding to , the servers  and  were considered to be unavailable for processing any electronic book orders arriving at the electronic book delivery system if the servers  and  were engaged in processing an existing electronic book order. That is, the servers  and  could only process one electronic book order at a time. In an embodiment, a server may processes many electronic book orders in parallel. That is, a server may include several parallel processors that execute tasks associated with filing an electronic book order. For example, a server may include several parallel processors tied to a common processor bus. The processor bus is coupled to a memory controller and to one or more input\/output (I\/O) controllers. However, the server may have a finite capacity. The server models shown in to apply equally to the situation in which the server processes several electronic book orders simultaneously.","As described above, to ensure that all received electronic book orders are processed, the electronic book delivery system may incorporate a buffer, or queue. The queue stores electronic book orders that have entered the system while the processing system is occupied processing other electronic book orders. The memory capacity of the queue may be chosen so that no electronic book orders are \u201clost.\u201d However, such a queue may need to have a prohibitively large capacity. The queue capacity could also be chosen based on market surveys or other information that indicates what a peak load on the system may be. If the expected peak load is exceeded, then electronic book orders may be lost. Alternatively, the system may incorporate switching features that use extra memory capacity in other memory areas of the system, or in other connected systems. For example, if the queue fills, the processor may signal intermediate delivery modules not to accept (not to forward) the electronic book order. In this example, cable headends, such as the cable headend  shown in , for example, may store pending electronic book orders until the operations center  signals that it is again available to receive requests. The operations center  may provide a confirmation menu to the ordering terminal, such as the home system , that indicates how much time is expected before the delivery of the electronic book can be completed.","In another embodiment, a processor associated with the electronic book delivery system, such as the systems  and , could survey orders in a queue to determine if any orders were for a same electronic book. In this case, a server could process all such orders for the same electronic book at one time. The electronic books could then be distributed to the multiple requesting subscribers using broadcast distribution and addressing. The broadcast electronic books may also be encoded on a per user bases to provide security from unauthorized use. For example, the broadcast electronic book may be encoded such that it can be decrypted by any of the targeted users having an appropriate decryption key.","VII. Virtual on-Demand Electronic Book Delivery System and Method","The systems described above work well to distribute electronic books in a pull-type arrangement, i.e., a system in which subscribers initiate all electronic book orders. In a push-type electronic book delivery system, content, in the form of one or more electronic books and other related data, may be continually or periodically sent, or broadcast, to subscribers.","A virtual on-demand electronic book (VBOD) system includes mechanisms for providing content, or electronic books, from centralized sources to terminals, such as the terminals , , or , which may include the viewer  and the library . The general approach to providing the content may follow two fundamental models. First, popular content may be broadcast on a cyclical basis and may be available to multiple subscribers at any time. Popular content may be content that is requested by a large number of subscribers or is promoted heavily by content providers. Second, less-popular content may be transmitted upon specific request by subscribers. For example, an electronic version of a New York Times \u201cbest seller\u201d may be transmitted cyclically while an electronic version of an obscure classroom textbook may be transmitted only on request by a specific subscriber. In this model, content can be viewed as a queuing model, where the broadcast medium (or media) services the queued content elements. As with any queued system, there are queuing delays from the time an element is requested until the element can be sent. These delays are variable, based on the number of elements queued and the number of concurrent or overlapping requests to queue new elements. As such, during non-busy times, requests for specific content are likely to be serviced on-demand, that is, there will be a very small delay due to queuing. However, with traditional approaches, at busy times the delay may be substantial, and the service may not be able to meet the subscriber's expectation of on-demand service.","By moving the content from a central broadcast point to the electronic book viewer  or the library , the queuing delay problem may be avoided. For example, if a subscriber's electronic book viewer  or library  was downloaded with all of the popular content, the subscriber would have true on-demand access to this content without the need to download the content upon subscriber request. Actual access to the content could still be controlled by use of an access code, for example, such that the subscriber would have to pay for the content (i.e., the electronic book) and receive an authorization code from the content provider in order to view a specific electronic book.","In an alternative embodiment, a selection of electronic books could be broadcast to a requester or subscriber and stored in the viewer . The subscriber could then access one or more of electronic books from the selection of electronic books. By accessing an electronic book from the selection of electronic books, the subscriber may then register an electronic book sales transaction. The transaction is stored in memory in the viewer  until the next time the viewer communicates with the electronic book delivery system, or alternatively, with the billing and collection system . Software in the viewer's microprocessor may then initiate a message that is transmitted to the electronic book delivery system, thereby finalizing the sales transaction.","Although the approach of mass broadcasting may work well from a subscriber's perspective, the approach may require extensive storage capacity in the electronic book viewer  or library .","In an alternate embodiment, the electronic book viewer  could be provided with the first \u201cn\u201d pages of content from each popular electronic book (a \u201cFirst Section\u201d or \u201cAuxiliary Section\u201d rather than the entire electronic book). A subscriber could begin accessing the content immediately, while the remaining content (a \u201cSection Section\u201d or \u201cMain Section\u201d) is queued for transmission (or captured as a cyclical transmission by the viewer ) based on the subscriber's interest in the content.","This alternate embodiment may use the approach of broadcasting the first section of multiple content elements, storage of the first sections in the electronic book viewer  or library , and subsequent queuing and reduced cyclical broadcasting of content in a background mode rather than an on-demand mode. True on-demand broadcasts are then reserved for the first sections of less-popular (i.e., content that does not warrant any cyclical broadcasting) electronic books specifically requested on-demand by electronic book system subscribers or requesters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0271"},"figref":"FIG. 23","i":"a ","b":["1080","266","1083","1081","1081","1086","1087","1081","1082","1084","1082","1088","1089","1081","266","1083","1081","266","266","1083","1081","1087","1083","1081","266","266","266","1081"]},"Upon receiving a request for a main section of an electronic book, the auxiliary module  communicates with the main module  using the communication path .

Also, in an implementation, the three remaining queues ,  and  are serviced in a round-robin fashion with equal priority P=2 among the three queues -. In other implementations, more complex queue servicing algorithms may be employed. For example, the length of each queue may be taken into account in determining priority rather than just the priority of the queue. Similarly, one implementation may combine the three lower-priority queues into a single queue, and the ordering of this single queue would be provided by the content queuing processor  instead of the priority queue server . A time element may be incorporated into the queue servicing algorithm such that a queue will be serviced if a content item has been stored in that queue for a specified maximum time. The specified maximum queue time may be chosen so that service time guarantees are met. In other words, if the system  guarantees a content delivery time for certain content, then the appropriate queue may be service out of order so that the guaranteed content delivery time is met. Several other variations can be used to optimize the balance of performance of the system. For example, as noted above, additional server capacity from non-related activities may be used to bolster delivery capacity during peak demand periods.","Available storage in the viewer  and the library  will constantly be updated with the first sections of popular content titles and\/or those content titles that are being specifically promoted by content suppliers and\/or service providers. The goal is to ensure that any \u201cempty\u201d storage in the viewer  or the library  is filled with the first sections of content that is likely to be viewed by subscribers. More advanced approaches to filling this content and selecting the appropriate first sections can include algorithms based on \u201cbooks viewed\u201d data and content suggestion based on books viewed, geo-demographic data related to subscribers, and other schemes detailed in the related targeted advertising and content suggestion disclosures.","This invention can be applied to the virtual on-demand nature of any content form and any distribution medium. For example, the same invention applies to books, text, images, television, motion picture, multimedia and interactive content. It applies anywhere a balance of on-demand performance and infrastructure efficiency is desired.","In a broadcast model, electronic books, or electronic book first sections, may be queued in the queue  for broadcast delivery to subscribers. For example, the first sections of the top ten New York Times best sellers are placed in the queue  and are subsequently broadcast to all of the subscribers of the system . Alternatively, the first sections are broadcast to a selected group of the subscribers of the system . The selected group of subscribers may be determined by reference to gathered books read data, demographic data or subscribers preferences, for example.","The VBOD delivery system  allows for electronic books to be broadcast to subscribers based on the use of subscriber data, electronic books data, and subscriber-entered data, such as mood indicators entered by the subscribers and used in an electronic book suggestion algorithm. Alternatively, input from subscribers collected through form-based questionnaires may be used to further define a subscriber's preferences. The system  may optimize the electronic book delivery process by ensuring that specific electronic books are provided to the desired subscribers. One method uses electronic book targeting. For example, first sections of electronic books may be broadcast to a group of subscribers based on subscriber profile data. Specifically, electronic books, electronic magazines and periodicals, and electronic newspapers, or first sections of the same, can be sent to those subscribers most likely to buy the electronic content.","Electronic books and other electronic media can be broadcast in a variety of formats.

Referring to , a menu  may be in the form of a full screen textual, textual with audio background, graphical, graphical with audio background, or video image. To view, or read, a broadcast first section of an electronic book, the subscriber uses a remote control or other control feature to highlight a desired selection, and then operates a select button. Upon operation of the select button, a first page of the selected first section is displayed on the viewer . Subsequent pages are displayed when the next page button , for example, is used.","To order a second section of an electronic book, the subscriber returns to the main menu screen  and indicates a purchase option by selecting an appropriate box next to the desired selection. The electronic book order is then relayed to the system  (see ), and the second section is processed for delivery to the subscriber. Alternatively, if the first section is read or is open for a specified time, or if a specified page or an electronic link in the first section is displayed, a request for a corresponding section or remaining section of the electronic book may be generated in the viewer . The request is then transmitted to the system  automatically and immediately or may be transmitted the next time the viewer  is coupled to the system . An order for a section may be indicated to the subscriber using a notice menu that informs the subscriber that an order has been placed. Alternatively, a confirmation menu may be used to prevent automatic ordering and to allow the subscriber to initiate the order. Finally, a book delivered menu may be displayed on the viewer  to indicate delivery of the second section. The book delivered menu may persist until acknowledged by the subscriber.","In a second format, the system  may broadcast entire electronic books to subscribers. In this alternative arrangement, the entire electronic book could include a first section that could be viewed by the subscriber at no cost. A second section would then be available for viewing provided the subscriber executed an appropriate purchase option. For example, the subscriber could order one of the broadcasted electronic books. The system  would then return a code or encryption key that would allow the subscriber to access the second portion of the electronic book.

The electronic book order will include an identity of the subscriber requesting the second section or the complete electronic book. The processor  then uses order analysis module  to determine the type and identity of the ordered electronic book. For example, the processor  determines if the electronic book is for a second section of a book already transmitted to the subscriber. The type and identity of the ordered electronic book determine in which queue of the system  the electronic book is to be placed. For example, if the electronic book order is for a second section of a popular book, the processor  determines to place the second section in the popular content second sections queue . In response to the electronic book order, the processor , executing packet assembly module  will assemble a data packet including the electronic book content, targeted advertisements and header information that may include the electronic address of the subscriber who originated the electronic book order and appropriate decryption and access codes, for example. The processor  will then execute a routine using a queue selection module  that causes the data packet to be placed in the appropriate queue. In the example described above, the data packet is placed in the popular content second sections queue .","In queue servicing module , the priority queue server  determines if any of the queues - is currently storing any content for delivery.

When all the queues are empty, and no other electronic book orders are in the system , the processor  ends the processing functions associated with near on-demand electronic book order and delivery.","The queue servicing module  may include a timing module . The timing module  may monitor a length of a queue, or alternatively, an amount of time a packet resides in the queue. In either event, the timing module  may be used to signify that a data packet has resided in the queue longer than a desired time, that may be linked to a service guarantee. In this case, the data packet may be delivered out of the normal sequence. That is, the priority model may include an override function that advances the delivery of a particular data packet in order to meet service guarantees.","The priority queue server  or another processor (not shown in ) in the system  may monitor multiple requests for a same electronic book or for a same second or remaining section of an electronic book. The processor may then determine if any orders are for the same electronic book or the same second section, process all such orders at one time and, using broadcast distribution and addressing, the system  could deliver the electronic books or the second sections to the multiple requesting subscribers.","VIII. Electronic Book Link System","Electronic book links allow the subscriber to use the electronic book viewer  to traverse pre-defined paths between content in their currently viewed electronic book to related information contained either elsewhere in the electronic book, elsewhere on the viewer , or external to the viewer , including in the library  or in a connected Internet web site. These links provide an organized and methodical method for the subscriber to quickly access related topic areas or seek clarification of the currently viewed material.","An electronic book includes first locations, or components, such as words, phrases, sentences, sections of text, paragraphs, pages, chapters, figures, drawings, maps, video clips, and audio clips. Links to second and subsequent locations, or components, contained in the same electronic document or in another related electronic document, file, or database can be associated with each of these first components. First components with underlying links can be highlighted and displayed on the viewer display  or on the connected television  or a personal computer  (see ). First components that have underlying links associated with them may be identified by assigning them a unique identifier. The unique identifier can be a word or phrase, an alpha-numeric value, a coordinate point, or other unique identifier. In an embodiment, each such first location may be assigned an identifying index value.","Second components can include second sections, main sections, or remaining portions of electronic books that correspond to first sections or auxiliary sections delivered by a virtual book-on-demand system such as the system  shown in FIG. . A link in the first section of the electronic book links to the second component, or second section of the electronic book. Accessing the link may cause an electronic book order to be placed with the system  and the content to be delivered automatically or upon request.","The use of the index value allows the first components to maintain links with other components, even if the electronic book is altered. For example, a subscriber may use a cut and paste edit feature to move a block of text containing a first component. Cutting and pasting will not affect the status of the first component and its links to other components. Similarly, changing font style or font size will not affect the status of the links.","In the creation of an electronic book, or subsequently, the electronic book may undergo a process that maps identifying index values to each of the first components. These index values can then be accessed by software directives that drive the presentation of alternative or linked material (e.g., material at one of the second locations) once a selection is made. For each electronic book, these index values may be contained in a hidden table that maps the identifying index values of all first components with underlying links to the location of the linked material (the second location). Moreover, each such first component may be linked to one or many linked material locations. That is, the first component may be linked to a second component, a third component and so on. An example of a hidden table is presented below.","As shown in the table, a first location \u201cCezzanne\u201d has an identifying index value 135. \u201cCezzanne\u201d has three links. A link to a first location is to an art encyclopedia. A link to a second location is to an electronic dictionary that provides a pronunciation guide. A link to a third location is to an audio file that plays a short biography of the artist. Each of the first, second and third locations have their own index values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0299","num":"0306"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Linked Material Location"]},{"entry":["Identifying",{},{},"Linked","Linked","(file location\/file name\/"]},{"entry":["Index","Component","Link","Material","Material","corresponding "]},{"entry":["Value(s)","Identifier","Number","Identifier","Description","index value)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["135","\u201cCezzanne\u201d","1","More on","Reference material ","Art-Encyclopedia.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Cezzanne","on Cezzanne","FrenchArtists\/Index Value = 1"]},{"entry":["135","\u201cCezzanne\u201d","2","Pronunciation","Pronunciation of ","Websters.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"the word","Websters E-"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Dictionary\/Index "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Value = 56221"]},{"entry":["135","\u201cCezzanne\u201d","3","Audio Clip","Audio file providing","Viewer\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"condensed Cezzanne's","Current file\/Index "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"biography","Value = 199384"]},{"entry":["133-135","\u201cPorchScene by","1","Graphic File","JPEG file presenting","Viewer\/"]},{"entry":[{},"Cezzanne\u201d",{},{},"Cezzanne's PorchScene","Current file\/Index "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"painting","Value = 9382"]},{"entry":["5673","\u201creactivism\u201d","1","Definition","Definition of the word","Websters.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Websters E-"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Dictionary\/Index "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Value = 564"]},{"entry":["4948-4950","\u201cOrder Little","1","Book Order","Order the book Little","Discovery.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},"Women\u201d menu",{},{},"Women","Little Women"]},{"entry":[{},"item",{},{},{},"Order\/Index Value = 672"]},{"entry":["4949-4950","\u201cLittle Women\u201d","1","Book review","Review of the book \u201cLittle","LiteraryWorks.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Women\u201d","Little Women\/Index"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Value = 1"]},{"entry":["90462","\u201cDental diseases\u201d","1","TOC link to","Link from Table of","Viewer\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Document Body","Contents to desired chapter ","Current file\/Index "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Value = 69980"]},{"entry":["1342","\u201cDental diseases\u201d","2","Related","Access to Web discussion","NoMoreCavities.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"discussion group","group on gum diseases","Index Value = 1"]},{"entry":["572","\u201cVegieMaster\u201d","1","Product Order","Order the product","HomePurchases.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"\u201cVegieMaster\u201d","KitchenProducts\/Index"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Value = 1"]},{"entry":["14","\u201cChesapeake\u201d","1","Video","Video clip of interview","Viewer\/"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"with J.

The source location will provide the delivery system  the necessary information to contact the operations center , the Internet web site  (see ) or another electronic database and request the appropriate material for retrieval and download if it currently does not reside on the viewer  or the home system . In the case that the linked material resides on the Internet web site  or on another electronic database, the location information in the hidden table allows the operations center  or home system  to retrieve the desired material from the Internet web site  or from the electronic database. Linking of a first section of an electronic book to a corresponding second or remaining section of the electronic book may initiate an electronic book order.","If the second component, or linked material, is located at the viewer , the processor in the viewer  can cause the linked material to be displayed without any communications with an outside source. For example, if the first component is the name \u201cCezzanne\u201d and the linked material, or second location, is in an electronic dictionary stored in the viewer , the viewer  can display the electronic dictionary entry for \u201cCezzanne.\u201d This linked material may be displayed full screen, in a picture-in-picture window, or as an overlay, for example. The entry can also remain hidden, until a subscriber of the viewer  commands the entry to be displayed.","Upon selection of a component with underlying links, the software directive determines the identifying index values associated with the selected component, searches the table for the index values of the selection made, looks up the corresponding linked location, accesses the location, and displays the linked material on the viewer . The linked material can be displayed on the viewer  in place of the original source material, or simultaneously with the original source material by displaying the linked material in a picture-in-picture window, via a split screen, or via a screen overlay.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0303","num":"0310"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 13","FIG. 27"],"b":["602","606","612","606","971","266","606","745","743","745","266"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0304","num":"0311"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 27","FIG. 27","FIG. 27","FIG. 27"],"b":["266","971","612","614","614","614","606","971"]},"Once a link is selected, an on-screen return button  allows the subscriber to return from the linked material back to the originally viewed text. The show links button  (see ) can be displayed on the viewer  either at all times that an electronic book is open, any time an underlying link exists, or only when commanded to do so from the viewer's menu system .","When linked material is displayed (for example, in an overlay fashion) the subscriber can command the linked material to be placed in a hidden state by operating the hide active link button  or by use of the menu system . When an active link is hidden, the restore active link button  is displayed. Operation of the restore active link button  will display the material linked by the active link.","Alternatively, the on screen \u201cHelp\u201d menu  (see ) provides access to further assistance when selecting links. The Help menu  is accessed by operation of the on-screen help button . Related link options will be available for display on the viewer  by selecting the Help menu , using the cursor  to do so.

Alternatively, by selecting a range of content in an electronic book that may have multiple underlying links, only links associated with the components within the selected range will be presented on the viewer  for the subscriber to select the specific link desired. Alternatively, a fixed number of links may be selected to be displayed on the screen at a time. Alternatively, only a certain type of link may be selected to be displayed. The types of links that are available for display may be listed in a pop-up menu. The subscriber can choose from this pop-up menu which of the links to display.

A biography of Cezzanne could include a link to the JPEG file showing PorchScene. The JPEG file PorchScene could be one of several still videos of the artist's work. This JPEG file could be linked to an appropriate section of the Cezznne biography. Then, if the subscriber were viewing the JPEG file for PorchScene, the subscriber could display the link to the biography and, upon activating the link, have displayed that portion of the biography that discusses PorchScene. In this example, the same link is used to display either the JPEG file or text from the biography. The same hidden table can be used with the two electronic files (i.e., the biography and the JPEG file). Alternately, each electronic file may have its own hidden table. In this alternative, the same link may be referenced in each of the hidden tables.","In the discussion above, each first component is linked to one or more other components. However, the other components (i.e., the second and third components, for example) may also be linked together. In addition, other components linked to one first component may be crossed-linked to other components that are linked to a second first component (identifying secondary or tertiary cross-links). For example, the JPEG file of PorchScene referred to in  may be cross-linked to the audio file-biography shown in . Displaying the JPEG file will result in a cross-link being identified that links the JPEG file to the audio file.","The cross-link may be indicated by highlighting, underlining, outlining, using a bold or an italics typeface, using a different font, and using different color text. If the cross-linked material is selected, that material will then be displayed. In the example described above, the JPEG video file that shows the painting PorchScene can be cross-linked with Cezzanne and its identity would be displayed on the viewer . The video file could be displayed full screen or in a picture-in-picture format. The video file could also be displayed on the attached television  or the personal computer  (see ). Finally, the video file could be printed by sending the video data and a print command to a printer  attached to the home unit  or to the personal computer .","In the table previously shown, all the links for a number of electronic books were provided in one hidden table. In an alternate arrangement, many hidden tables may be provided. For example, each electronic book may be provided with a hidden table. In this alternative, the many hidden tables could form a relational database of linked material. As an example, several different electronic medical text books could each be provided with its own hidden table. An electronic general medical encyclopedia could also be provided with a hidden table. Terms that are listed in one of the several medical electronic text books could then be linked, in a relational fashion to the electronic medical encyclopedia. The several electronic medical text books could also be relationally linked to each other, to on-line databases and to other electronic files. For example, an electronic medical text book could be electronically linked to electronic books, databases and other electronic files maintained at a medical school's library.","The hidden table (either for many electronic books, or individually for each electronic book) may be provided by the central provider or distributor as an additional feature that is paid for separately from purchasing an electronic book. The distributor may offer many different levels of service, such as only linking material (components) stored on a viewer, only linking material within a particular electronic book, or linking one or more electronic books to electronic files outside the home system  (e.g., linking an electronic book to a database maintained by the distributor at an Internet web site).","Downloading the most current links table for an electronic book from the operations center  or the Internet web site  refreshes the hidden links table, that is, any new links that have been generated by the operations center , for example, are added to the hidden links table. The current links table may be downloaded in conjunction with downloading a new electronic book. Alternately, the current links table may be provided periodically by the operations center .","Subscribers can create their own links by adding new entries to the hidden links table, using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or other standard programming language or by using a simple graphical subscriber interface, for example. In an embodiment, an on-screen, software-based, menu-driven facility is provided, accessible through the menu system  (see ), that allows the subscriber to select the desired source components to define an underlying link, to select the desired linked components and define their location, and to create the remaining table entries. Creation of table entries can be supported via either an on-screen, simulated keyboard, the attached keyboard , or the remote keyboard  (see ). To ease creation of links, default table entry items may be offered to the subscriber by the menu system  where ever possible. The desired linked components can be accessed and displayed simultaneously with the desired source components via the use of a picture-in-picture window, via a split screen, or via a screen overlay. Alternatively, if the material to be linked is to be created by the subscriber, the subscriber can create a new content file on the viewer  and link directly to components in that newly created file. This allows the subscriber to create customized annotations and notes that are directly associated with the specific components of an electronic book. Text entry into the newly created file is handled via either the on-screen, simulated keyboard, the attached keyboard , or the remote keyboard .","As noted above, links within electronic books may be self-contained in nature, where all the material to be linked to is resident within the same electronic book file. Additionally, links may also be provided between material residing on the viewer . Also, links may be provided to material that currently resides on the home system , if separate from the viewer . Finally, links may be provided to material that must be accessed through a communications network. For example, material that is ordered or must be downloaded from the operations center  or the Internet web site  may be linked to an electronic book or to a first section of the electronic book. On screen menus can also be supported on the viewer  in the form of electronic book files, serving as a book or product catalog or service catalog that allows the subscriber to link to the operations center  or the Internet web site  to order additional electronic books or products and services at any time by selecting the desired component from the text.","If the content that is to be linked to is currently not available on the electronic book viewer , the viewer  may prompt the subscriber to decide whether to: 1) retrieve the corresponding material immediately from the home system , the operations center , or the Internet web site ; 2) wait until the next communication opportunity with the home system  or operations center  to retrieve the material; 3) commence direct outside communications with another communications system (e.g., a telephone in a PSTN); or 4) stop.","In one embodiment, the first components on the viewer  are a Table of Contents and List of Figures for a book. Making a selection from the Table of Contents and List of Figures automatically links to and displays the selected page within the electronic book file. In another embodiment, the first components on the viewer  may be an Index of an electronic book. Selecting the desired topic and associated page will cause that page to be displayed on the viewer . In yet another embodiment, the first component is a footnote or endnote. When the footnote is selected, the viewer  provides a display of material that further addresses the reference. In another embodiment, the first component is a word or phrase that has a further definition or clarification associated with it. By selecting the first component, the corresponding dictionary definition, foreign translation, or glossary entry will be displayed on the viewer . The dictionary definition or foreign translation may also be provided via an audio file. In this embodiment, electronic books can be bundled with other standard reference material or alternatively, stand-alone reference material like dictionaries or encyclopedias may be accessed from within multiple electronic book files.","In another embodiment, the first component is a reference to another electronic book altogether. By selecting the first component, the selected book is displayed on the viewer . In another embodiment, on-screen menu buttons will be displayed on the viewer screen  that allow for a quick link to the Table of Contents, Index, glossary, and other key electronic book sections by simply selecting the item on the viewer screen  with the cursor . In yet another embodiment, the selected first component links the subscriber to a book review or series of book reviews, providing additional information to assist in the decision of selecting a new electronic book. In another embodiment, the selected first component is a book title, chapter title, or text in the body of a book that is linked to an audio file that serves as an audio narration of the selection that is played on the viewer . In yet another embodiment, the selected first component links to a video file (JPEG or MPEG) that can be displayed on the viewer screen . Another embodiment is a first component that links to textual annotations and notes that have been created by the subscriber.","One embodiment includes first or subsequent components that are electronic book titles that, when selected, links the subscriber to the operations center  or the Internet web site  to allow for the ordering of the selected electronic book or sections of the electronic book. In a similar embodiment, the selected component consists of a product that, when selected, link the subscriber to the operations center  site or an Internet web site to allow for the ordering of the selected product. Lastly, in another embodiment, the selected component is a topic on which there is a link to an Internet-based discussion group that addresses the topic in more detail.","When a link is provided to link a word or phrase to a foreign language dictionary, the viewer  may display a foreign language selection feature. The subscriber may then indicate which language to use when activating the link. For example, an English word or phrase in the electronic book may be linked to a French, Spanish or German dictionary. The subscriber may specify which of these foreign language dictionaries to link to.","While this invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiment outlined above, it is evident that many alterations, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
