title: Biomarkers for theranostics
abstract: Biomarkers can be assessed for diagnostic, therapy-related or prognostic methods to identify phenotypes, such as a condition or disease, or the stage or progression of a disease. Circulating biomarkers from a bodily fluid can be used in profiling of physiological states or determining phenotypes. These include nucleic acids, protein, and circulating structures such as vesicles. Biomarkers can be used for theranostic purposes to select candidate treatment regimens for diseases, conditions, disease stages, and stages of a condition, and can also be used to determine treatment efficacy. The biomarkers can be circulating biomarkers, including vesicles and microRNA.

The vesicles are analyzed  by characterizing surface antigens associated with the vesicles and\/or determining the presence or levels of components present within the vesicles (\u201cpayload\u201d). Unless specified otherwise, the term \u201cantigen\u201d as used herein refers generally to a biomarker that can be bound by a binding agent, whether the binding agent is an antibody, aptamer, lectin, or other binding agent for the biomarker and regardless of whether such biomarker illicits an immune response in a host. Vesicle payload may be protein, including peptides and polypeptides, and\/or nucleic acids such as DNA and RNAs. RNA payload includes messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (also referred to herein as miRNA or miR). A phenotype is characterized based on the biosignature of the vesicles . In another illustrative method of the invention, schemes A and B are performed together to characterize a phenotype. In such a scheme, vesicles and nucleic acids, e.g., microRNA, are assessed, thereby characterizing the phenotype.","In a related aspect, methods are provided herein for the discovery of biomarkers comprising assessing vesicle surface markers or payload markers in one sample and comparing the markers to another sample. Markers that distinguish between the samples can be used as biomarkers according to the invention. Such samples can be from a subject or group of subjects. For example, the groups can be, e.g., known responders and non-responders to a given treatment for a given disease or disorder. Biomarkers discovered to distinguish the known responders and non-responders provide a biosignature of whether a subject is likely to respond to a treatment such as a therapeutic agent, e.g., a drug or biologic.","Phenotypes","Disclosed herein are products and processes for characterizing a phenotype of an individual by analyzing a vesicle such as a membrane vesicle. A phenotype can be any observable characteristic or trait of a subject, such as a disease or condition, a disease stage or condition stage, susceptibility to a disease or condition, prognosis of a disease stage or condition, a physiological state, or response to therapeutics. A phenotype can result from a subject's gene expression as well as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between the two, as well as from epigenetic modifications to nucleic acid sequences.","A phenotype in a subject can be characterized by obtaining a biological sample from a subject and analyzing one or more vesicles from the sample. For example, characterizing a phenotype for a subject or individual may include detecting a disease or condition (including pre-symptomatic early stage detecting), determining the prognosis, diagnosis, or theranosis of a disease or condition, or determining the stage or progression of a disease or condition. Characterizing a phenotype can also include identifying appropriate treatments or treatment efficacy for specific diseases, conditions, disease stages and condition stages, predictions and likelihood analysis of disease progression, particularly disease recurrence, metastatic spread or disease relapse. A phenotype can also be a clinically distinct type or subtype of a condition or disease, such as a cancer or tumor. Phenotype determination can also be a determination of a physiological condition, or an assessment of organ distress or organ rejection, such as post-transplantation. The products and processes described herein allow assessment of a subject on an individual basis, which can provide benefits of more efficient and economical decisions in treatment.","In an aspect, the invention relates to the analysis of vesicles to provide a biosignature to predict whether a subject is likely to respond to a treatment for a disease or disorder. Characterizating a phenotype includes predicting the responder\/non-responder status of the subject, wherein a responder responds to a treatment for a disease and a non-responder does not respond to the treatment. Vesicles can be analyzed in the subject and compared to vesicle analysis of previous subjects that were known to respond or not to a treatment. If the vesicle biosignature in a subject more closely aligns with that of previous subjects that were known to respond to the treatment, the subject can be characterized, or predicted, as a responder to the treatment. Similarly, if the vesicle biosignature in the subject more closely aligns with that of previous subjects that did not respond to the treatment, the subject can be characterized, or predicted as a non-responder to the treatment. The treatment can be for any appropriate disease, disorder or other condition. The method can be used in any disease setting where a vesicle biosignature that correlates with responder\/non-responder status is known.","The term \u201cphenotype\u201d as used herein can mean any trait or characteristic that is attributed to a vesicle biosignature that is identified utilizing methods of the invention. For example, a phenotype can be the identification of a subject as likely to respond to a treatment, or more broadly, it can be a diagnostic, prognostic or theranostic determination based on a characterized biosignature for a sample obtained from a subject.","In some embodiments, the phenotype comprises a disease or condition such as those listed in Table 1.

internal membrane. Vesicles can be released into the extracellular environment from cells. Cells releasing vesicles include without limitation cells that originate from, or are derived from, the ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm. The cells may have undergone genetic, environmental, and\/or any other variations or alterations. For example, the cell can be tumor cells. A vesicle can reflect any changes in the source cell, and thereby reflect changes in the originating cells, e.g., cells having various genetic mutations. In one mechanism, a vesicle is generated intracellularly when a segment of the cell membrane spontaneously invaginates and is ultimately exocytosed (see for example, Keller et al., 107 (2): 102-8 (2006)). Vesicles also include cell-derived structures bounded by a lipid bilayer membrane arising from both herniated evagination (blebbing) separation and sealing of portions of the plasma membrane or from the export of any intracellular membrane-bounded vesicular structure containing various membrane-associated proteins of tumor origin, including surface-bound molecules derived from the host circulation that bind selectively to the tumor-derived proteins together with molecules contained in the vesicle lumen, including but not limited to tumor-derived microRNAs or intracellular proteins. Blebs and blebbing are further described in Charras et al., Vol. 9, No. 11, p. 730-736 (2008). A vesicle shed into circulation or bodily fluids from tumor cells may be referred to as a \u201ccirculating tumor-derived vesicle.\u201d When such vesicle is an exosome, it may be referred to as a circulating-tumor derived exosome (CTE). In some instances, a vesicle can be derived from a specific cell of origin. CTE, as with a cell-of-origin specific vesicle, typically have one or more unique biomarkers that permit isolation of the CTE or cell-of-origin specific vesicle, e.g., from a bodily fluid and sometimes in a specific manner. For example, a cell or tissue specific markers are utilized to identify the cell of origin. Examples of such cell or tissue specific markers are disclosed herein and can further be accessed in the Tissue-specific Gene Expression and Regulation (TiGER) Database, available at bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu\/tiger\/; Liu et al. (2008) TiGER: a database for tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. BMC Bioinformatics. 9:271; TissueDistributionDBs, available at genome.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/tissue_db\/index.html.","A vesicle can have a diameter of greater than about 10 nm, 20 nm, or 30 nm. A vesicle can have a diameter of greater than 40 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, 500 nm, 1000 nm or greater than 10,000 nm. A vesicle can have a diameter of about 30-1000 nm, about 30-800 nm, about 30-200 nm, or about 30-100 nm. In some embodiments, the vesicle has a diameter of less than 10,000 nm, 1000 nm, 800 nm, 500 nm, 200 nm, 100 nm, 50 nm, 40 nm, 30 nm, 20 nm or less than 10 nm. As used herein the term \u201cabout\u201d in reference to a numerical value means that variations of 10% above or below the numerical value are within the range ascribed to the specified value. Typical sizes for various types of vesicles are shown in Table 2. Vesicles can be assessed to measure the diameter of a single vesicle or any number of vesicles. For example, the range of diameters of a vesicle population or an average diameter of a vesicle population can be determined. Vesicle diameter can be assessed using methods known in the art, e.g., imaging technologies such as electron microscopy. In an embodiment, a diameter of one or more vesicles is determined using optical particle detection. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,751,053, entitled \u201cOptical Detection and Analysis of Particles\u201d and issued Jul. 6, 2010; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,600, entitled \u201cOptical Detection and Analysis of Particles\u201d and issued Jul. 15, 2010.","In some embodiments, vesicles are directly assayed from a biological sample without prior isolation, purification, or concentration from the biological sample. For example, the amount of vesicles in the sample can by itself provide a biosignature that provides a diagnostic, prognostic or theranostic determination. Alternatively, the vesicle in the sample may be isolated, captured, purified, or concentrated from a sample prior to analysis. As noted, isolation, capture or purification as used herein comprises partial isolation, partial capture or partial purification apart from other components in the sample. Vesicle isolation can be performed using various techniques as described herein, e.g., chromatography, filtration, centrifugation, flow cytometry, affinity capture (e.g., to a planar surface or bead), and\/or using microfluidics.","Vesicles such as exosomes can be assessed to provide a phenotypic characterization by comparing vesicle characteristics to a reference. In some embodiments, surface antigens on a vesicle are assessed. The surface antigens can provide an indication of the anatomical origin and\/or cellular of the vesicles and other phenotypic information, e.g., tumor status. For example, wherein vesicles found in a patient sample, e.g., a bodily fluid such as blood, serum or plasma, are assessed for surface antigens indicative of colorectal origin and the presence of cancer. The surface antigens may comprise any informative biological entity that can be detected on the vesicle membrane surface, including without limitation surface proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other membrane components. For example, positive detection of colon derived vesicles expressing tumor antigens can indicate that the patient has colorectal cancer. As such, methods of the invention can be used to characterize any disease or condition associated with an anatomical or cellular origin, by assessing, for example, disease-specific and cell-specific biomarkers of one or more vesicles obtained from a subject.","In another embodiment, one or more vesicle payloads are assessed to provide a phenotypic characterization. The payload with a vesicle comprises any informative biological entity that can be detected as encapsulated within the vesicle, including without limitation proteins and nucleic acids, e.g., genomic or cDNA, mRNA, or functional fragments thereof, as well as microRNAs (miRs). In addition, methods of the invention are directed to detecting vesicle surface antigens (in addition or exclusive to vesicle payload) to provide a phenotypic characterization. For example, vesicles can be characterized by using binding agents (e.g., antibodies or aptamers) that are specific to vesicle surface antigens, and the bound vesicles can be further assessed to identify one or more payload components disclosed therein. As described herein, the levels of vesicles with surface antigens of interest or with payload of interest can be compared to a reference to characterize a phenotype. For example, overexpression in a sample of cancer-related surface antigens or vesicle payload, e.g., a tumor associated mRNA or microRNA, as compared to a reference, can indicate the presence of cancer in the sample. The biomarkers assessed can be present or absent, increased or reduced based on the selection of the desired target sample and comparison of the target sample to the desired reference sample. Non-limiting examples of target samples include: disease; treated\/not-treated; different time points, such as a in a longitudinal study; and non-limiting examples of reference sample: non-disease; normal; different time points; and sensitive or resistant to candidate treatment(s).","MicroRNA","Various biomarker molecules can be assessed in biological samples or vesicles obtained from such biological samples. MicroRNAs comprise one class biomarkers assessed via methods of the invention. MicroRNAs, also referred to herein as miRNAs or miRs, are short RNA strands approximately 21-23 nucleotides in length. MiRNAs are encoded by genes that are transcribed from DNA but are not translated into protein and thus comprise non-coding RNA. The miRs are processed from primary transcripts known as pri-miRNA to short stem-loop structures called pre-miRNA and finally to the resulting single strand miRNA. The pre-miRNA typically forms a structure that folds back on itself in self-complementary regions. These structures are then processed by the nuclease Dicer in animals or DCL1 in plants. Mature miRNA molecules are partially complementary to one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and can function to regulate translation of proteins. Identified sequences of miRNA can be accessed at publicly available databases, such as www.microRNA.org, www.mirbase.org, or www.mirz.unibas.ch\/cgi\/miRNA.cgi.","miRNAs are generally assigned a number according to the naming convention \u201cmir-[number].\u201d The number of a miRNA is assigned according to its order of discovery relative to previously identified miRNA species. For example, if the last published miRNA was mir-121, the next discovered miRNA will be named mir-122, etc. When a miRNA is discovered that is homologous to a known miRNA from a different organism, the name can be given an optional organism identifier, of the form [organism identifier]-mir-[number]. Identifiers include hsa for and mmu for . For example, a human homolog to mir-121 might be referred to as hsa-mir-121 whereas the mouse homolog can be referred to as mmu-mir-121.","Mature microRNA is commonly designated with the prefix \u201cmiR\u201d whereas the gene or precursor miRNA is designated with the prefix \u201cmir.\u201d For example, mir-121 is a precursor for miR-121. When differing miRNA genes or precursors are processed into identical mature miRNAs, the genes\/precursors can be delineated by a numbered suffix. For example, mir-121-1 and mir-121-2 can refer to distinct genes or precursors that are processed into miR-121. Lettered suffixes are used to indicate closely related mature sequences. For example, mir-121a and mir-121b can be processed to closely related miRNAs miR-121a and miR-121b, respectively. In the context of the invention, any microRNA (miRNA or miR) designated herein with the prefix mir-*or miR-*is understood to encompass both the precursor and\/or mature species, unless otherwise explicitly stated otherwise.","Sometimes it is observed that two mature miRNA sequences originate from the same precursor. When one of the sequences is more abundant that the other, a \u201c*\u201d suffix can be used to designate the less common variant. For example, miR-121 would be the predominant product whereas miR-121*is the less common variant found on the opposite arm of the precursor. If the predominant variant is not identified, the miRs can be distinguished by the suffix \u201c5p\u201d for the variant from the 5\u2032 arm of the precursor and the suffix \u201c3p\u201d for the variant from the 3\u2032 arm. For example, miR-121-5p originates from the 5\u2032 arm of the precursor whereas miR-121-3p originates from the 3\u2032 arm. Less commonly, the 5p and 3p variants are referred to as the sense (\u201cs\u201d) and anti-sense (\u201cas\u201d) forms, respectively. For example, miR-121-5p may be referred to as miR-121-s whereas miR-121-3p may be referred to as miR-121-as.","The above naming conventions have evolved over time and are general guidelines rather than absolute rules. For example, the let- and lin-families of miRNAs continue to be referred to by these monikers. The mir\/miR convention for precursor\/mature forms is also a guideline and context should be taken into account to determine which form is referred to. Further details of miR naming can be found at www.mirbase.org or Ambros et al., A uniform system for microRNA annotation, RNA 9:277-279 (2003).","Plant miRNAs follow a different naming convention as described in Meyers et al., Plant Cell. 2008 20(12):3186-3190.","A number of miRNAs are involved in gene regulation, and miRNAs are part of a growing class of non-coding RNAs that is now recognized as a major tier of gene control. In some cases, miRNAs can interrupt translation by binding to regulatory sites embedded in the 3\u2032-UTRs of their target mRNAs, leading to the repression of translation. Target recognition involves complementary base pairing of the target site with the miRNA's seed region (positions 2-8 at the miRNA's 5\u2032 end), although the exact extent of seed complementarity is not precisely determined and can be modified by 3\u2032 pairing. In other cases, miRNAs function like small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and bind to perfectly complementary mRNA sequences to destroy the target transcript.","Characterization of a number of miRNAs indicates that they influence a variety of processes, including early development, cell proliferation and cell death, apoptosis and fat metabolism. For example, some miRNAs, such as lin-4, let-7, mir-14, mir-23, and bantam, have been shown to play critical roles in cell differentiation and tissue development. Others are believed to have similarly important roles because of their differential spatial and temporal expression patterns.","The miRNA database available at miRBase (www.mirbase.org) comprises a searchable database of published miRNA sequences and annotation.

Examples of circulating cancer biomarkers include cardiac troponin T (cTnT), prostate specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer and CA 125 for ovarian cancer. Circulating biomarkers according to the invention include any appropriate biomarker that can be detected in bodily fluid, including without limitation protein, nucleic acids, e.g., DNA, mRNA and microRNA, lipids, carbohydrates and metabolites. Circulating biomarkers can include biomarkers that are not associated with cells, such as biomarkers that are membrane associated, embedded in membrane fragments, part of a biological complex, or free in solution. In one embodiment, circulating biomarkers are biomarkers that are associated with one or more vesicles present in the biological fluid of a subject.","Circulating biomarkers have been identified for use in characterization of various phenotypes.

Analysis of a vesicle can include quantitiating the amount one or more vesicle populations of a biological sample. For example, a heterogeneous population of vesicles can be quantitated, or a homogeneous population of vesicles, such as a population of vesicles with a particular biomarker profile, a particular biosignature, or derived from a particular cell type can be isolated from a heterogeneous population of vesicles and quantitated. Analysis of a vesicle can also include detecting, quantitatively or qualitatively, one or more particular biomarker profile or biosignature of a vesicle, as described herein.","A vesicle can be stored and archived, such as in a bio-fluid bank and retrieved for analysis as necessary. A vesicle may also be isolated from a biological sample that has been previously harvested and stored from a living or deceased subject. In addition, a vesicle may be isolated from a biological sample which has been collected as described in King et al., 7(5): 198-204 (2005). A vesicle can be isolated from an archived or stored sample. Alternatively, a vesicle may be isolated from a biological sample and analyzed without storing or archiving of the sample. Furthermore, a third party may obtain or store the biological sample, or obtain or store the vesicle for analysis.","An enriched population of vesicles can be obtained from a biological sample. For example, vesicles may be concentrated or isolated from a biological sample using size exclusion chromatography, density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation, nanomembrane ultrafiltration, immunoabsorbent capture, affinity purification, microfluidic separation, or combinations thereof.","Size exclusion chromatography, such as gel permeation columns, centrifugation or density gradient centrifugation, and filtration methods can be used. For example, a vesicle can be isolated by differential centrifugation, anion exchange and\/or gel permeation chromatography (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,899,863 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,812,023), sucrose density gradients, organelle electrophoresis (for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,198,923), magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), or with a nanomembrane ultrafiltration concentrator. Various combinations of isolation or concentration methods can be used.","Highly abundant proteins, such as albumin and immunoglobulin, may hinder isolation of vesicles from a biological sample. For example, a vesicle can be isolated from a biological sample using a system that utilizes multiple antibodies that are specific to the most abundant proteins found in a biological sample, such as blood. Such a system can remove up to several proteins at once, thus unveiling the lower abundance species such as cell-of-origin specific vesicles.","This type of system can be used for isolation of vesicles from biological samples such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid or urine. The isolation of vesicles from a biological sample may also be enhanced by high abundant protein removal methods as described in Chromy et al. 2004; 3:1120-1127. In another embodiment, the isolation of vesicles from a biological sample may also be enhanced by removing serum proteins using glycopeptide capture as described in Zhang et al, 2005; 4:144-155. In addition, vesicles from a biological sample such as urine may be isolated by differential centrifugation followed by contact with antibodies directed to cytoplasmic or anti-cytoplasmic epitopes as described in Pisitkun et al., 2004; 101:13368-13373.","Isolation or enrichment of a vesicle from a biological sample can also be enhanced by use of sonication (for example, by applying ultrasound), detergents, other membrane-activating agents, or any combination thereof. For example, ultrasonic energy can be applied to a potential tumor site, and without being bound by theory, release of vesicles from a tissue can be increased, allowing an enriched population of vesicles that can be analyzed or assessed from a biological sample using one or more methods disclosed herein.","Filters","A vesicle can be isolated from a biological sample by filtering a biological sample from a subject through a filtration module and collecting from the filtration module a retentate comprising the vesicle, thereby isolating the vesicle from the biological sample. The method can comprise filtering a biological sample from a subject through a filtration module comprising a filter; and collecting from the filtration module a retentate comprising the vesicle, thereby isolating the vesicle from the biological sample. In one embodiment, the filter retains molecules greater than about 100 kiloDaltons.","The method can further comprise determining a biosignature of the vesicle. The method can also further comprise applying the retentate to a plurality of substrates, wherein each substrate is coupled to one or more capture agents, and each subset of the plurality of substrates comprises a different capture agent or combination of capture agents than another subset of the plurality of substrates.","Also provided herein is a method of determining a biosignature of a vesicle in a sample comprising: filtering a biological sample from a subject with a disorder through a filtration module, collecting from the filtration module a retentate comprising one or more vesicles, and determining a biosignature of the one or more vesicles. In one embodiment, the filtration module comprises a filter that retains molecules greater than about 100 or 150 kiloDaltons.","The method disclosed herein can further comprise characterizing a phenotype in a subject by filtering a biological sample from a subject through a filtration module, collecting from the filtration module a retentate comprising one or more vesicles; detecting a biosignature of the one or more vesicles; and characterizing a phenotype in the subject based on the biosignature, wherein characterizing is with at least 70% sensitivity. In some embodiments, characterizing comprises determining an amount of one or more vesicle having the biosignature. Furthermore, the characterizing can be from about 80% to 100% sensitivity.","Also provided herein is a method for multiplex analysis of a plurality of vesicles. In some embodiments, the method comprises filtering a biological sample from a subject through a filtration module; collecting from the filtration module a retentate comprising the plurality of vesicles, applying the plurality of vesicles to a plurality of capture agents, wherein the plurality of capture agents is coupled to a plurality of substrates, and each subset of the plurality of substrates is differentially labeled from another subset of the plurality of substrates; capturing at least a subset of the plurality of vesicles; and determining a biosignature for at least a subset of the captured vesicles. In one embodiment, each substrate is coupled to one or more capture agents, and each subset of the plurality of substrates comprises a different capture agent or combination of capture agents as compared to another subset of the plurality of substrates. In some embodiments, at least a subset of the plurality of substrates is intrinsically labeled, such as comprising one or more labels. The substrate can be a particle or bead, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the filtration module comprises a filter that retains molecules greater than about 100 or 150 kiloDaltons.","In some embodiments, the method for multiplex analysis of a plurality of vesicles comprises filtering a biological sample from a subject through a filtration module, wherein the filtration module comprises a filter that retains molecules greater than about 100 kiloDaltons; collecting from the filtration module a retentate comprising the plurality of vesicles; applying the plurality of vesicles to a plurality of capture agents, wherein the plurality of capture agents is coupled to a microarray; capturing at least a subset of the plurality of vesicles on the microarray; and determining a biosignature for at least a subset of the captured vesicles. In one embodiment, the filtration module comprises a filter that retains molecules greater than about 100 or 150 kiloDaltons.","The biological sample can be clarified prior to isolation by filtration. For example, non-vesicle components such as cellular debris can be removed. The clarification can be by low-speed centrifugation, such as at about 5,000\u00d7g, 4,000\u00d7g, 3,000\u00d7g, 2,000\u00d7g, 1,000\u00d7g, or less. The supernatant, or clarified biological sample, containing the vesicle can then be collected and filtered to isolate the vesicle from the clarified biological sample. In some embodiments, the biological sample is not clarified prior to isolation of a vesicle by filtration.","In some embodiments, isolation of a vesicle from a sample does not use high-speed centrifugation, such as ultracentrifugation. For example, isolation may not require the use of centrifugal speeds, such as about 100,000\u00d7g or more. In some embodiments, isolation of a vesicle from a sample uses speeds of less than 50,000\u00d7g, 40,000\u00d7g, 30,000\u00d7g, 20,000\u00d7g, 15,000\u00d7g, 12,000\u00d7g, or 10,000\u00d7g.","The filtration module utilized to isolate the vesicle from the biological sample can be a fiber-based filtration cartridge. For example, the fiber can be a hollow polymeric fiber, such as a polypropylene hollow fiber. A biological sample can be introduced into the filtration module by pumping the sample fluid, such as a biological fluid as disclosed herein, into the module with a pump device, such as a peristaltic pump. The pump flow rate can vary, such as at about 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 mL\/minute.","The filtration module can be a membrane filtration module. For example, the membrane filtration module can comprise a filter disc membrane, such as a hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter disc membrane housed in a stirred cell apparatus (e.g., comprising a magnetic stirrer). In some embodiments, the sample moves through the filter as a result of a pressure gradient established on either side of the filter membrane.","The filter can comprise a material having low hydrophobic absorptivity and\/or high hydrophilic properties. For example, the filter can have an average pore size for vesicle retention and permeation of most proteins as well as a surface that is hydrophilic, thereby limiting protein adsorption. For example, the filter can comprise a material selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, PVDF, polyethylene, polyfluoroethylene, cellulose, secondary cellulose acetate, polyvinylalcohol, and ethylenevinyl alcohol (EVAL\u00ae, Kuraray Co., Okayama, Japan). Additional materials that can be utilized in a filter include, but are not limited to, polysulfone and polyethersulfone.","The filtration module can have a filter that retains molecules greater than about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, or 500 kiloDaltons (kDa), such as a filter that has a MWCO (molecular weight cut off) of about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, or 500. In some embodiments, the filter within the filtration module has an average pore diameter of about 0.01 \u03bcm to about 0.15 \u03bcm, and in some embodiments from about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 0.12 gm. In some embodiments, the filter has an average pore diameter of about 0.06 \u03bcm, 0.07. \u03bcm, 0.08 \u03bcm, 0.09 \u03bcm, 0.1 \u03bcm, or 0.11 \u03bcm.","The filtration module can be a commerically available column, such as a column typically used for concentrating proteins or for isoatling proteins. Examples include, but are not limited to, columns from Millpore (Billerica, Mass.), such as Amicon\u00ae centrifugal filters, or from Pierce\u00ae (Rockford, Ill.), such as Pierce Concentrator filter devices. The filters can be as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,957 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,357,601, both of which applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.","The retentate comprising the isolated vesicle can be collected from the filtration module. The retentate can be collected by flushing the retentate from the filter. Selection of a filter composition having hydrophilic surface properties, thereby limiting protein adsorption, can be used, without being bound by theory, for easier collection of the retentate and minimize use of harsh or time-consuming collection techniques.","The collected retentate can then be used subsequent analysis, such as assessing a biosignature of one or more vesicles in the retentate, as further described herein. The analysis can be directly performed on the collected retentate. Alternatively, the collected retentate can be further concentrated or purified, prior to analysis of one or more vesicles. For example, the retentate can be further concentrated or vesicles further isolated from the retentate using size exclusion chromatography, density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation, immunoabsorbent capture, affinity purification, microfluidic separation, or combinations thereof, such as described herein. In some embodiments, the retentate can undergo another step of filtration. Alternatively, prior to isolation of a vesicle using a filter, the vesicle is concentrated or isolated using size exclusion chromatography, density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation, immunoabsorbent capture, affinity purification, microfluidic separation, or combinations thereof","For example, prior to filtering a biological sample through a filtration module with a filter that retains molecules greater than about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, or 500 kiloDaltons (kDa), such as a filter that has a MWCO (molecular weight cut off) of about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, or 500, the biological sample may first be filtered through a filter having a porosity or pore size of between about 0.01 \u03bcm to about 2 \u03bcm, about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 1.5 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the filter has a pore size of about 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 or 2.0 \u03bcm. The filter may be a syringe filter. Thus, in one embodiment, the method comprises filtering the biological sample through a filter, such as a syringe filter, wherein the syringe filter has a porosity of greater than about 1 \u03bcm, prior to filtering the sample through a filtration module comprising a filter that retains molecules greater than about 100 or 150 kiloDaltons.","The filtration module can be a component of a microfluidic device. Microfluidic devices, which may also be referred to as \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d systems, biomedical micro-electro-mechanical systems (bioMEMs), or multicomponent integrated systems, can be used for isolating, and analyzing, vesicles. Such systems miniaturize and compartmentalize processes that allow for binding of vesicles, detection of biomarkers, and other processes, such as further described herein","A microfluidic device can also be used for isolation of a vesicle by comprising a filtration module. For example, a microfluidic device can use one more channels for isolating a vesicle from a biological sample based on size from a biological sample. A biological sample can be introduced into one or more microfluidic channels, which selectively allows the passage of vesicles. The microfluidic device can further comprise binding agents, or more than one filtration module to select vesicles based on a property of the vesicles, for example, size, shape, deformability, biomarker profile, or biosignature.","Binding Agents","A binding agent is an agent that binds to a circulating biomarker, such as a vesicle or a component of a vesicle. The binding agent can be used as a capture agent and\/or a detection agent. A capture agent can bind and capture a circulating biomarker, such as by binding a component or biomarker of a vesicle. For example, the capture agent can be a capture antibody or capture antigen that binds to an antigen on a vesicle. A detection agent can bind to a circulating biomarker thereby facilitating detection of the biomarker. For example, a capture agent comprising an antigen or aptamer that is sequestered to a substrate can be used to capture a vesicle in a sample, and a detection agent comprising an antigen or aptamer that carries a label can be used to detect the captured vesicle via detection of the detection agent's label. In some embodiments, a vesicle is assessed using capture and detection agents that recognize the same vesicle biomarkers. For example, a vesicle population can be captured using a tetraspanin such as by using an anti-CD9 antibody bound to a substrate, and the captured vesicles can be detected using a fluorescently labeled anti-CD9 antibody to label the captured vesicles. In other embodiments, a vesicle is assessed using capture and detection agents that recognize different vesicle biomarkers. For example, a vesicle population can be captured using a cell-specific marker such as by using an anti-PCSA antibody bound to a substrate, and the captured vesicles can be detected using a fluorescently labeled anti-CD9 antibody to label the captured vesicles. Similarly, the vesicle population can be captured using a general vesicle marker such as by using an anti-CD9 antibody bound to a substate, and the captured vesicles can be detected using a fluorescently labeled antibody to a cell-specific or disease specific marker to label the captured vesicles.","In one embodiment, a vesicle is captured using a capture agent that binds to a biomarker on a vesicle. The capture agent can be coupled to a substrate and used to isolate a vesicle, as further described herein. In one embodiment, a capture agent is used for affinity capture or isolation of a vesicle present in a substance or sample.","A binding agent can be used after a vesicle is concentrated or isolated from a biological sample. For example, a vesicle can first be isolated from a biological sample before a vesicle with a specific biosignature is isolated or detected. The vesicle with a specific biosignature can be isolated or detected using a binding agent for the biomarker. A vesicle with the specific biomarker can be isolated or detected from a heterogeneous population of vesicles. Alternatively, a binding agent may be used on a biological sample comprising vesicles without a prior isolation or concentration step. For example, a binding agent is used to isolate or detect a vesicle with a specific biosignature directly from a biological sample.","A binding agent can be a nucleic acid, protein, or other molecule that can bind to a component of a vesicle. The binding agent can comprise DNA, RNA, monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, Fabs, Fab\u2032, single chain antibodies, synthetic antibodies, aptamers (DNA\/RNA), peptoids, zDNA, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs), lectins, synthetic or naturally occurring chemical compounds (including but not limited to drugs, labeling reagents), dendrimers, or a combination thereof. For example, the binding agent can be a capture antibody. In embodiments of the invention, the binding agent is membrane protein labeling agent. See, e.g., the membrane protein labeling agents disclosed in Alroy et al., US. Patent Publication US 2005\/0158708. In an embodiment, vesicles are isolated or captured as described herein, and one or more membrane protein labeling agent is used to detect the vesicles.","In some instances, a single binding agent can be employed to isolate or detect a vesicle. In other instances, a combination of different binding agents may be employed to isolate or detect a vesicle. For example, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75 or 100 different binding agents may be used to isolate or detect a vesicle from a biological sample. Furthermore, the one or more different binding agents for a vesicle can form a biosignature of a vesicle, as further described below.","Different binding agents can also be used for multiplexing. For example, isolation or detection of more than one population of vesicles can be performed by isolating or detecting each vesicle population with a different binding agent. Different binding agents can be bound to different particles, wherein the different particles are labeled. In another embodiment, an array comprising different binding agents can be used for multiplex analysis, wherein the different binding agents are differentially labeled or can be ascertained based on the location of the binding agent on the array. Multiplexing can be accomplished up to the resolution capability of the labels or detection method, such as described below. The binding agents can be used to detect the vesicles, such as for detecting cell-of-origin specific vesicles. A binding agent or multiple binding agents can themselves form a binding agent profile that provides a biosignature for a vesicle. One or more binding agents can be selected from . For example, if a vesicle population is detected or isolated using two, three, four or more binding agents in a differential detection or isolation of a vesicle from a heterogeneous population of vesicles, the particular binding agent profile for the vesicle population provides a biosignature for the particular vesicle population. The vesicle can be detected using any number of binding agents in a multiplex fashion. Thus, the binding agent can also be used to form a biosignature for a vesicle. The biosignature can be used to characterize a phenotype.","The binding agent can be a lectin. Lectins are proteins that bind selectively to polysaccharides and glycoproteins and are widely distributed in plants and animals. For example, lectins such as those derived from in the form of agglutinin (\u201cGNA\u201d), in the form of agglutinin (\u201cNPA\u201d) and the blue green algae called \u201ccyanovirin\u201d (Boyd et al. 41(7): 1521 1530, 1997; Hammar et al. 724: 166 169, 1994; Kaku et al. 279(2): 298 304, 1990) can be used to isolate a vesicle. These lectins can bind to glycoproteins having a high mannose content (Chervenak et al. 34(16): 5685 5695, 1995). High mannose glycoprotein refers to glycoproteins having mannose-mannose linkages in the form of \u03b1-1\u21923 or \u03b1-1\u2192+6 mannose-mannose linkages.","The binding agent can be an agent that binds one or more lectins. Lectin capture can be applied to the isolation of the biomarker cathepsin D since it is a glycosylated protein capable of binding the lectins agglutinin (GNA) and concanavalin A (ConA).","Methods and devices for using lectins to capture vesicles are described in International Patent Applications PCT\/US2010\/058461, entitled \u201cMETHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR ISOLATING, STORING, AND ANALYZING VESICLES\u201d and filed Nov. 30, 2010; PCT\/US2009\/066626, entitled \u201cAFFINITY CAPTURE OF CIRCULATING BIOMARKERS\u201d and filed Dec. 3, 2009; PCT\/US2010\/037467, entitled \u201cMETHODS AND MATERIALS FOR ISOLATING EXOSOMES\u201d and filed Jun. 4, 2010; and PCT\/US2007\/006101, entitled \u201cEXTRACORPOREAL REMOVAL OF MICROVESICULAR PARTICLES\u201d and filed Mar. 9, 2007, each of which applications is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The binding agent can be an antibody. For example, a vesicle may be isolated using one or more antibodies specific for one or more antigens present on the vesicle. For example, a vesicle can have CD63 on its surface, and an antibody, or capture antibody, for CD63 can be used to isolate the vesicle. Alternatively, a vesicle derived from a tumor cell can express EpCam, the vesicle can be isolated using an antibody for EpCam and CD63. Other antibodies for isolating vesicles can include an antibody, or capture antibody, to CD9, PSCA, TNFR, CD63, B7H3, MFG-E8, EpCam, Rab, CD81, STEAP, PCSA, PSMA, or 5T4. Other antibodies for isolating vesicles can include an antibody, or capture antibody, to DR3, STEAP, epha2, TMEM211, MFG-E8, Tissue Factor (TF), unc93A, A33, CD24, NGAL, EpCam, MUC17, TROP2, or TETS.","In some embodiments, the capture agent is an antibody to CD9, CD63, CD81, PSMA, PCSA, B7H3, EpCam, PSCA, ICAM, STEAP, or EGFR. The capture agent can also be used to identify a biomarker of a vesicle. For example, a capture agent such as an antibody to CD9 would identify CD9 as a biomarker of the vesicle. In some embodiments, a plurality of capture agents can be used, such as in multiplex analysis. The plurality of captures agents can comprise binding agents to one or more of: CD9, CD63, CD81, PSMA, PCSA, B7H3, EpCam, PSCA, ICAM, STEAP, and EGFR. In some embodiments, the plurality of capture agents comprise binding agents to CD9, CD63, CD81, PSMA, PCSA, B7H3, MFG-E8, and\/or EpCam. In yet other embodiments, the plurality of capture agents comprises binding agents to CD9, CD63, CD81, PSMA, PCSA, B7H3, EpCam, PSCA, ICAM, STEAP, and\/or EGFR. The plurality of capture agents comprises binding agents to TMEM211, MFG-E8, Tissue Factor (TF), and\/or CD24.","The antibodies referenced herein can be immunoglobulin molecules or immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds an antigen and synthetic antibodies. The immunoglobulin molecules can be of any class (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD or IgA) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. Antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, bispecific, synthetic, humanized and chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments and F(ab\u2032)fragments, Fv or Fv\u2032 portions, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, or epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. An antibody, or generally any molecule, \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to an antigen (or other molecule) if the antibody binds preferentially to the antigen, and, e.g., has less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or 1% cross-reactivity with another molecule.","The binding agent can also be a polypeptide or peptide. Polypeptide is used in its broadest sense and may include a sequence of subunit amino acids, amino acid analogs, or peptidomimetics. The subunits may be linked by peptide bonds. The polypeptides may be naturally occurring, processed forms of naturally occurring polypeptides (such as by enzymatic digestion), chemically synthesized or recombinantly expressed. The polypeptides for use in the methods of the present invention may be chemically synthesized using standard techniques. The polypeptides may comprise D-amino acids (which are resistant to L-amino acid-specific proteases), a combination of D- and L-amino acids, \u03b2 amino acids, or various other designer or non-naturally occurring amino acids (e.g., \u03b2-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, and Na-methyl amino acids, etc.) to convey special properties. Synthetic amino acids may include ornithine for lysine, and norleucine for leucine or isoleucine. In addition, the polypeptides can have peptidomimetic bonds, such as ester bonds, to prepare polypeptides with novel properties. For example, a polypeptide may be generated that incorporates a reduced peptide bond, i.e., R\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014R, where Rand Rare amino acid residues or sequences. A reduced peptide bond may be introduced as a dipeptide subunit. Such a polypeptide would be resistant to protease activity, and would possess an extended half-live in vivo. Polypeptides can also include peptoids (N-substituted glycines), in which the side chains are appended to nitrogen atoms along the molecule's backbone, rather than to the a-carbons, as in amino acids. Polypeptides and peptides are intended to be used interchangeably throughout this application, i.e. where the term peptide is used, it may also include polypeptides and where the term polypeptides is used, it may also include peptides.","A vesicle may be isolated, captured or detected using a binding agent. The binding agent can be an agent that binds a vesicle \u201chousekeeping protein,\u201d or general vesicle biomarker. The biomarker can be CD63, CD9, CD81, CD82, CD37, CD53, or Rab-5b. Tetraspanins, a family of membrane proteins with four transmembrane domains, can be used as general vesicle markers. The tetraspanins include CD151, CD53, CD37, CD82, CD81, CD9 and CD63. There have been over 30 tetraspanins identified in mammals, including the TSPAN1 (TSP-1), TSPAN2 (TSP-2), TSPAN3 (TSP-3), TSPAN4 (TSP-4, NAG-2), TSPAN5 (TSP-5), TSPAN6 (TSP-6), TSPAN7 (CD231, TALLA-1, A15), TSPAN8 (CO-029), TSPAN9 (NET-5), TSPAN10 (Oculospanin), TSPAN11 (CD151-like), TSPAN12 (NET-2), TSPAN13 (NET-6), TSPAN14, TSPAN15 (NET-7), TSPAN16 (TM4-B), TSPAN17, TSPAN18, TSPAN19, TSPAN20 (UP1b, UPK1B), TSPAN21 (UP1a, UPK1A), TSPAN22 (RDS, PRPH2), TSPAN23 (ROM1), TSPAN24 (CD151), TSPAN25 (CD53), TSPAN26 (CD37), TSPAN27 (CD82), TSPAN28 (CD81), TSPAN29 (CD9), TSPAN30 (CD63), TSPAN31 (SAS), TSPAN32 (TSSC6), TSPAN33, and TSPAN34.

The binding agent used to isolate or detect a vesicle can be a binding agent for an antigen selected from . The binding agent for a vesicle can also be selected from those listed in . The binding agent can be for an antigen such as a tetraspanin, MFG-E8, Annexin V, 5T4, B7H3, caveolin, CD63, CD9, E-Cadherin, Tissue factor, MFG-E8, TMEM211, CD24, PSCA, PCSA, PSMA, Rab-5B, STEAP, TNFR1, CD81, EpCam, CD59, CD81, ICAM, EGFR, or CD66. One or more binding agents, such as one or more binding agents for two or more of the antigens, can be used for isolating or detecting a vesicle. The binding agent used can be selected based on the desire of isolating or detecting a vesicle derived from a particular cell type or cell-of-origin specific vesicle.","A binding agent can also be linked directly or indirectly to a solid surface or substrate. A solid surface or substrate can be any physically separable solid to which a binding agent can be directly or indirectly attached including, but not limited to, surfaces provided by microarrays and wells, particles such as beads, columns, optical fibers, wipes, glass and modified or functionalized glass, quartz, mica, diazotized membranes (paper or nylon), polyformaldehyde, cellulose, cellulose acetate, paper, ceramics, metals, metalloids, semiconductive materials, quantum dots, coated beads or particles, other chromatographic materials, magnetic particles; plastics (including acrylics, polystyrene, copolymers of styrene or other materials, polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutylene, polyurethanes, TEFLON\u2122, etc.), polysaccharides, nylon or nitrocellulose, resins, silica or silica-based materials including silicon and modified silicon, carbon, metals, inorganic glasses, plastics, ceramics, conducting polymers (including polymers such as polypyrole and polyindole); micro or nanostructured surfaces such as nucleic acid tiling arrays, nanotube, nanowire, or nanoparticulate decorated surfaces; or porous surfaces or gels such as methacrylates, acrylamides, sugar polymers, cellulose, silicates, or other fibrous or stranded polymers. In addition, as is known the art, the substrate may be coated using passive or chemically-derivatized coatings with any number of materials, including polymers, such as dextrans, acrylamides, gelatins or agarose. Such coatings can facilitate the use of the array with a biological sample.","For example, an antibody used to isolate a vesicle can be bound to a solid substrate such as a well, such as commercially available plates (e.g. from Nunc, Milan Italy). Each well can be coated with the antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody used to isolate a vesicle is bound to a solid substrate such as an array. The array can have a predetermined spatial arrangement of molecule interactions, binding islands, biomolecules, zones, domains or spatial arrangements of binding islands or binding agents deposited within discrete boundaries. Further, the term array may be used herein to refer to multiple arrays arranged on a surface, such as would be the case where a surface bore multiple copies of an array. Such surfaces bearing multiple arrays may also be referred to as multiple arrays or repeating arrays.","A binding agent can also be bound to particles such as beads or microspheres. For example, an antibody specific for a component of a vesicle can be bound to a particle, and the antibody-bound particle is used to isolate a vesicle from a biological sample. In some embodiments, the microspheres may be magnetic or fluorescently labeled. In addition, a binding agent for isolating vesicles can be a solid substrate itself. For example, latex beads, such as aldehyde\/sulfate beads (Interfacial Dynamics, Portland, Oreg.) can be used.","A binding agent bound to a magnetic bead can also be used to isolate a vesicle. For example, a biological sample such as serum from a patient can be collected for colon cancer screening. The sample can be incubated with anti-CCSA-3 (Colon Cancer\u2014Specific Antigen) coupled to magnetic microbeads. A low-density microcolumn can be placed in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator and the column is then washed with a buffer solution such as Tris-buffered saline. The magnetic immune complexes can then be applied to the column and unbound, non-specific material can be discarded. The CCSA-3 selected vesicle can be recovered by removing the column from the separator and placing it on a collection tube. A buffer can be added to the column and the magnetically labeled vesicle can be released by applying the plunger supplied with the column. The isolated vesicle can be diluted in IgG elution buffer and the complex can then be centrifuged to separate the microbeads from the vesicle. The pelleted isolated cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be resuspended in buffer such as phosphate-buffered saline and quantitated. Alternatively, due to the strong adhesion force between the antibody captured cell-of-origin specific vesicle and the magnetic microbeads, a proteolytic enzyme such as trypsin can be used for the release of captured vesicles without the need for centrifugation. The proteolytic enzyme can be incubated with the antibody captured cell-of-origin specific vesicles for at least a time sufficient to release the vesicles.","A binding agent, such as an antibody, for isolating vesicles is preferably contacted with the biological sample comprising the vesicles of interest for at least a time sufficient for the binding agent to bind to a component of the vesicle. For example, an antibody may be contacted with a biological sample for various intervals ranging from seconds days, including but not limited to, about 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, 7 hours, 10 hours, 15 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days or 10 days.","A binding agent, such as an antibody specific to an antigen listed in , or a binding agent listed in , can be labeled with, including but not limited to, a magnetic label, a fluorescent moiety, an enzyme, a chemiluminescent probe, a metal particle, a non-metal colloidal particle, a polymeric dye particle, a pigment molecule, a pigment particle, an electrochemically active species, semiconductor nanocrystal or other nanoparticles including quantum dots or gold particles. The label can be, but not be limited to, fluorophores, quantum dots, or radioactive labels. For example, the label can be a radioisotope (radionuclides), such as H, C, C, F, P, S, Cu, Ga, Y, Tc, In, I, I, I, I, Xe, Lu, At, or Bi. The label can be a fluorescent label, such as a rare earth chelate (europium chelate), fluorescein type, such as, but not limited to, FITC, 5-carboxyfluorescein, 6-carboxy fluorescein; a rhodamine type, such as, but not limited to, TAMRA; dansyl; Lissamine; cyanines; phycoerythrins; Texas Red; and analogs thereof. The fluorescent label can be one or more of FAM, dRHO, 5-FAM, 6FAM, dR6G, JOE, HEX, VIC, TET, dTAMRA, TAMRA, NED, dROX, PET, BHQ, Gold540 and LIZ.","A binding agent can be directly or indirectly labeled, e.g., the label is attached to the antibody through biotin-streptavidin. Alternatively, an antibody is not labeled, but is later contacted with a second antibody that is labeled after the first antibody is bound to an antigen of interest.","For example, various enzyme-substrate labels are available or disclosed (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149). The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of a chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), \u03b2-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Examples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, but are not limited to, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride (TMB)); alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and \u03b2-D-galactosidase ((\u03b2-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-galactosidase.","Depending on the method of isolation or detection used, the binding agent may be linked to a solid surface or substrate, such as arrays, particles, wells and other substrates described above. Methods for direct chemical coupling of antibodies, to the cell surface are known in the art, and may include, for example, coupling using glutaraldehyde or maleimide activated antibodies. Methods for chemical coupling using multiple step procedures include biotinylation, coupling of trinitrophenol (TNP) or digoxigenin using for example succinimide esters of these compounds. Biotinylation can be accomplished by, for example, the use of D-biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide. Succinimide groups react effectively with amino groups at pH values above 7, and preferentially between about pH 8.0 and about pH 8.5. Biotinylation can be accomplished by, for example, treating the cells with dithiothreitol followed by the addition of biotin maleimide.","Flow Cytometry","Isolation or detection of a vesicle using a particle such as a bead or microsphere can also be performed using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry can be used for sorting microscopic particles suspended in a stream of fluid. As particles pass through they can be selectively charged and on their exit can be deflected into separate paths of flow. It is therefore possible to separate populations from an original mix, such as a biological sample, with a high degree of accuracy and speed. Flow cytometry allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and\/or chemical characteristics of single cells flowing through an optical\/electronic detection apparatus. A beam of light, usually laser light, of a single frequency (color) is directed onto a hydrodynamically focused stream of fluid. A number of detectors are aimed at the point where the stream passes through the light beam; one in line with the light beam (Forward Scatter or FSC) and several perpendicular to it (Side Scatter or SSC) and one or more fluorescent detectors.","Each suspended particle passing through the beam scatters the light in some way, and fluorescent chemicals in the particle may be excited into emitting light at a lower frequency than the light source. This combination of scattered and fluorescent light is picked up by the detectors, and by analyzing fluctuations in brightness at each detector (one for each fluorescent emission peak), it is possible to deduce various facts about the physical and chemical structure of each individual particle. FSC correlates with the cell size and SSC depends on the inner complexity of the particle, such as shape of the nucleus, the amount and type of cytoplasmic granules or the membrane roughness. Some flow cytometers have eliminated the need for fluorescence and use only light scatter for measurement.","Flow cytometers can analyze several thousand particles every second in \u201creal time\u201d and can actively separate out and isolate particles having specified properties. They offer high-throughput automated quantification, and separation, of the set parameters for a high number of single cells during each analysis session. Flow cytomers can have multiple lasers and fluorescence detectors, allowing multiple labels to be used to more precisely specify a target population by their phenotype. Thus, a flow cytometer, such as a multicolor flow cytometer, can be used to detect one or more vesicles with multiple fluorescent labels or colors. In some embodiments, the flow cytometer can also sort or isolate different vesicle populations, such as by size or by different markers.","The flow cytometer may have one or more lasers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more lasers. In some embodiments, the flow cytometer can detect more than one color or fluorescent label, such as at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 different colors or fluorescent labels. For example, the flow cytometer can have at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 fluorescence detectors.","Examples of commerically available flow cytometers that can be used to detect or analyze one or more vesicles, to sort or separate different populations of vesicles, include, but are not limited to the MoFlo\u2122 XDP Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.), MoFlo\u2122 Legacy Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.), BD FACSAria\u2122 Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.), BD\u2122 LSRII (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.), and BD FACSCalibur\u2122 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). Use of multicolor or multi-fluor cytometers can be used in multiplex analysis of vesicles, as further described below. In some embodiments, the flow cytometer can sort, and thereby collect or sort more than one population of vesicles based one or more characteristics. For example, two populations of vesicles differ in size, such that the vesicles within each population have a similar size range and can be differentially detected or sorted. In another embodiment, two different populations of vesicles are differentially labeled.","The data resulting from flow-cytometers can be plotted in 1 dimension to produce histograms or seen in 2 dimensions as dot plots or in 3 dimensions with newer software. The regions on these plots can be sequentially separated by a series of subset extractions which are termed gates. Specific gating protocols exist for diagnostic and clinical purposes especially in relation to hematology. The plots are often made on logarithmic scales. Because different fluorescent dye's emission spectra overlap, signals at the detectors have to be compensated electronically as well as computationally. Fluorophores for labeling biomarkers may include those described in Ormerod, 2nd ed, Springer-Verlag, New York (1999), and in Nida et al., 2005; 4 889-894 which is incorporated herein by reference.","Multiplexing","Multiplex experiments comprise experiments that can simultaneously measure multiple analytes in a single assay. Vesicles and associated biomarkers can be assessed in a multiplex fashion. Different binding agents can be used for multiplexing different vesicle populations. Different vesicle populations can be isolated or detected using different binding agents. Each population in a biological sample can be labeled with a different signaling label, such as a fluorophore, quantum dot, or radioactive label, such as described above. The label can be directly conjugated to a binding agent or indirectly used to detect a binding agent that binds a vesicle. The number of populations detected in a multiplexing assay is dependent on the resolution capability of the labels and the summation of signals, as more than two differentially labeled vesicle populations that bind two or more affinity elements can produce summed signals.","Multiplexing of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75 or 100 different vesicle populations may be performed. For example, one population of vesicles specific to a cell-of-origin can be assayed along with a second population of vesicles specific to a different cell-of-origin, where each population is labeled with a different label. Alternatively, a population of vesicles with a particular biomarker or biosignature can be assayed along with a second population of vesicles with a different biomarker or biosignature. In some cases, hundreds or thousands of vesicles are assessed in a single assay.","In one embodiment, multiplex analysis is performed by applying a plurality of vesicles comprising more than one population of vesicles to a plurality of substrates, such as beads. Each bead is coupled to one or more capture agents. The plurality of beads is divided into subsets, where beads with the same capture agent or combination of capture agents form a subset of beads, such that each subset of beads has a different capture agent or combination of capture agents than another subset of beads. The beads can then be used to capture vesicles that comprise a component that binds to the capture agent. The different subsets can be used to capture different populations of vesicles. The captured vesicles can then be analyzed by detecting one or more biomarkers.","Flow cytometry can be used in combination with a particle-based or bead based assay. Multiparametric immunoassays or other high throughput detection assays using bead coatings with cognate ligands and reporter molecules with specific activities consistent with high sensitivity automation can be used. For example, beads in each subset can be differentially labeled from another subset. In a particle based assay system, a binding agent or capture agent for a vesicle, such as a capture antibody, can be immobilized on addressable beads or microspheres. Each binding agent for each individual binding assay (such as an immunoassay when the binding agent is an antibody) can be coupled to a distinct type of microsphere (i.e., microbead) and the binding assay reaction takes place on the surface of the microspheres. Microspheres can be distinguished by different labels, for example, a microsphere with a specific capture agent would have a different signaling label as compared to another microsphere with a different capture agent. For example, microspheres can be dyed with discrete fluorescence intensities such that the fluorescence intensity of a microsphere with a specific binding agent is different than that of another microsphere with a different binding agent.","The microsphere can be labeled or dyed with at least 2 different labels or dyes. In some embodiments, the microsphere is labeled with at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 different labels. Different microspheres in a plurality of microspheres can have more than one label or dye, wherein various subsets of the microspheres have various ratios and combinations of the labels or dyes permitting detection of different microspheres with different binding agents. For example, the various ratios and combinations of labels and dyes can permit different fluorescent intensities. Alternatively, the various ratios and combinations maybe used to generate different detection patters to identify the binding agent. The microspheres can be labeled or dyed externally or may have intrinsic fluorescence or signaling labels. Beads can be loaded separately with their appropriate binding agents and thus, different vesicle populations can be isolated based on the different binding agents on the differentially labeled microspheres to which the different binding agents are coupled.","In another embodiment, multiplex analysis can be performed using a planar substrate, wherein the the substrate comprises a plurality of capture agents. The plurality of capture agents can capture one or more populations of vesicles, and one or more biomarkers of the captured vesicles detected. The planar substrate can be a microarray or other substrate as further described herein.","Novel Binding Agents","A vesicle may be isolated or detected using a binding agent for a novel component of a vesicle, such as an antibody for a novel antigen specific to a vesicle of interest. Novel antigens that are specific to a vesicle of interest may be isolated or identified using different test compounds of known composition bound to a substrate, such as an array or a plurality of particles, which can allow a large amount of chemical\/structural space to be adequately sampled using only a small fraction of the space. The novel antigen identified can also serve as a biomarker for the vesicle. For example, a novel antigen identified for a cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be a useful biomarker.","A binding agent can be identified by screening either a homogeneous or heterogeneous vesicle population against test compounds. Since the composition of each test compound on the substrate surface is known, this constitutes a screen for affinity elements. For example, a test compound array comprises test compounds at specific locations on the substrate addressable locations, and can be used to identify one or more binding agents for a vesicle. The test compounds can all be unrelated or related based on minor variations of a core sequence or structure. The different test compounds may include variants of a given test compound (such as polypeptide isoforms), test compounds that are structurally or compositionally unrelated, or a combination thereof.","A test compound can be a peptoid, polysaccharide, organic compound, inorganic compound, polymer, lipids, nucleic acid, polypeptide, antibody, protein, polysaccharide, or other compound. The test compound can be natural or synthetic. The test compound can comprise or consist of linear or branched heteropolymeric compounds based on any of a number of linkages or combinations of linkages (e.g., amide, ester, ether, thiol, radical additions, metal coordination, etc.), dendritic structures, circular structures, cavity structures or other structures with multiple nearby sites of attachment that serve as scaffolds upon which specific additions are made. The test compound can be spotted on a substrate or synthesized in situ, using standard methods in the art. In addition, the test compound can be spotted or synthesized in situ in combinations in order to detect useful interactions, such as cooperative binding.","The test compound can be a polypeptide with known amino acid sequence, thus, detection of a test compound binding with a vesicle can lead to identification of a polypeptide of known amino sequence that can be used as a binding agent. For example, a homogenous population of vesicles can be applied to a spotted array on a slide containing between a few and 1,000,000 test polypeptides having a length of variable amino acids. The polypeptides can be attached to the surface through the C-terminus. The sequence of the polypeptides can be generated randomly from 19 amino acids, excluding cysteine. The binding reaction can include a non-specific competitor, such as excess bacterial proteins labeled with another dye such that the specificity ratio for each polypeptide binding target can be determined. The polypeptides with the highest specificity and binding can be selected. The identity of the polypeptide on each spot is known, and thus can be readily identified. Once the novel antigens specific to the homogeneous vesicle population, such as a cell-of-origin specific vesicle is identified, such cell-of-origin specific vesicles may subsequently be isolated using such antigens in methods described hereafter.","An array can also be used for identifying an antibody as a binding agent for a vesicle. Test antibodies can be attached to an array and screened against a heterogeneous population of vesicles to identify antibodies that can be used to isolate or identify a vesicle. A homogeneous population of vesicles such as cell-of-origin specific vesicles can also be screened with an antibody array. Other than identifying antibodies to isolate or detect a homogeneous population of vesicles, one or more protein biomarkers specific to the homogenous population can be identified. Commercially available platforms with test antibodies pre-selected or custom selection of test antibodies attached to the array can be used. For example, an antibody array from Full Moon Biosystems can be screened using prostate cancer cell derived vesicles identifying antibodies to Bcl-XL, ERCC1, Keratin 15, CD81\/TAPA-1, CD9, Epithelial Specific Antigen (ESA), and Mast Cell Chymase as binding agents (see for example, ), and the proteins identified can be used as biomarkers for the vesicles.","An antibody or synthetic antibody to be used as a binding agent can also be identified through a peptide array. Another method is the use of synthetic antibody generation through antibody phage display. M13 bacteriophage libraries of antibodies (e.g. Fabs) are displayed on the surfaces of phage particles as fusions to a coat protein. Each phage particle displays a unique antibody and also encapsulates a vector that contains the encoding DNA. Highly diverse libraries can be constructed and represented as phage pools, which can be used in antibody selection for binding to immobilized antigens. Antigen-binding phages are retained by the immobilized antigen, and the nonbinding phages are removed by washing. The retained phage pool can be amplified by infection of an host and the amplified pool can be used for additional rounds of selection to eventually obtain a population that is dominated by antigen-binding clones. At this stage, individual phase clones can be isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing to decode the sequences of the displayed antibodies. Through the use of phase display and other methods known in the art, high affinity designer antibodies for vesicles can be generated.","Bead-based assays can also be used to identify novel binding agents to isolate or detect a vesicle. A test antibody or peptide can be conjugated to a particle. For example, a bead can be conjugated to an antibody or peptide and used to detect and quantify the proteins expressed on the surface of a population of vesicles in order to discover and specifically select for novel antibodies that can target vesicles from specific tissue or tumor types. Any molecule of organic origin can be successfully conjugated to a polystyrene bead through use of a commercially available kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Each bead set can be colored a certain detectable wavelength and each can be linked to a known antibody or peptide which can be used to specifically measure which beads are linked to exosomal proteins matching the epitope of previously conjugated antibodies or peptides. The beads can be dyed with discrete fluorescence intensities such that each bead with a different intensity has a different binding agent as described above.","For example, a purified vesicle preparation can be diluted in assay buffer to an appropriate concentration according to empirically determined dynamic range of assay. A sufficient volume of coupled beads can be prepared and approximately 1 \u03bcl of the antibody-coupled beads can be aliqouted into a well and adjusted to a final volume of approximately 50 \u03bcl. Once the antibody-conjugated beads have been added to a vacuum compatible plate, the beads can be washed to ensure proper binding conditions. An appropriate volume of vesicle preparation can then be added to each well being tested and the mixture incubated, such as for 15-18 hours. A sufficient volume of detection antibodies using detection antibody diluent solution can be prepared and incubated with the mixture for 1 hour or for as long as necessary. The beads can then be washed before the addition of detection antibody (biotin expressing) mixture composed of streptavidin phycoereythin. The beads can then be washed and vacuum aspirated several times before analysis on a suspension array system using software provided with an instrument. The identity of antigens that can be used to selectively extract the vesicles can then be elucidated from the analysis.","Assays using imaging systems can be utilized to detect and quantify proteins expressed on the surface of a vesicle in order to discover and specifically select for and enrich vesicles from specific tissue, cell or tumor types. Antibodies, peptides or cells conjugated to multiple well multiplex carbon coated plates can be used. Simultaneous measurement of many analytes in a well can be achieved through the use of capture antibodies arrayed on the patterned carbon working surface. Analytes can then be detected with antibodies labeled with reagents in electrode wells with an enhanced electro-chemiluminescent plate. Any molecule of organic origin can be successfully conjugated to the carbon coated plate. Proteins expressed on the surface of vesicles can be identified from this assay and can be used as targets to specifically select for and enrich vesicles from specific tissue or tumor types.","The binding agent can also be an aptamer, which refers to nucleic acids that can bond molecules other than their complementary sequence. An aptamer typically contains 30-80 nucleic acids and can have a high affinity towards a certain target molecule (IQ's reported are between 10-10mole\/1). An aptamer for a target can be identified using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (Tuerk & Gold, 249:505-510, 1990; Ellington & Szostak, Nature 346:818-822, 1990), such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,163, 6,482, 594, 6,291, 184, 6,376, 190 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,458,539. A library of nucleic acids can be contacted with a target vesicle, and those nucleic acids specifically bound to the target are partitioned from the remainder of nucleic acids in the library which do not specifically bind the target. The partitioned nucleic acids are amplified to yield a ligand-enriched pool. Multiple cycles of binding, partitioning, and amplifying (i.e., selection) result in identification of one or more aptamers with the desired activity. Another method for identifying an aptamer to isolate vesicles is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,190, which describes increasing or decreasing frequency of nucleic acids in a library by their binding to a chemically synthesized peptide. Modified methods, such as Laser SELEX or deSELEX as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20090264508 can also be used.","Microfluidics","The methods for isolating or identifying vesicles can be used in combination with microfluidic devices. The methods of isolating or detecting a vesicle, such as described herien, can be performed using a microfluidic device. Microfluidic devices, which may also be referred to as \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d systems, biomedical micro-electro-mechanical systems (bioMEMs), or multicomponent integrated systems, can be used for isolating and analyzing a vesicle. Such systems miniaturize and compartmentalize processes that allow for binding of vesicles, detection of biosignatures, and other processes.","A microfluidic device can also be used for isolation of a vesicle through size differential or affinity selection. For example, a microfluidic device can use one more channels for isolating a vesicle from a biological sample based on size or by using one or more binding agents for isolating a vesicle from a biological sample. A biological sample can be introduced into one or more microfluidic channels, which selectively allows the passage of a vesicle. The selection can be based on a property of the vesicle, such as the size, shape, deformability, or biosignature of the vesicle.","In one embodiment, a heterogeneous population of vesicles can be introduced into a microfluidic device, and one or more different homogeneous populations of vesicles can be obtained. For example, different channels can have different size selections or binding agents to select for different vesicle populations. Thus, a microfluidic device can isolate a plurality of vesicles wherein at least a subset of the plurality of vesicles comprises a different biosignature from another subset of the plurality of vesicles. For example, the microfluidic device can isolate at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 different subsets of vesicles, wherein each subset of vesicles comprises a different biosignature.","In some embodiments, the microfluidic device can comprise one or more channels that permit further enrichment or selection of a vesicle. A population of vesicles that has been enriched after passage through a first channel can be introduced into a second channel, which allows the passage of the desired vesicle or vesicle population to be further enriched, such as through one or more binding agents present in the second channel.","Array-based assays and bead-based assays can be used with microfluidic device. For example, the binding agent can be coupled to beads and the binding reaction between the beads and vesicle can be performed in a microfluidic device. Multiplexing can also be performed using a microfluidic device. Different compartments can comprise different binding agents for different populations of vesicles, where each population is of a different cell-of-origin specific vesicle population. In one embodiment, each population has a different biosignature. The hybridization reaction between the microsphere and vesicle can be performed in a microfluidic device and the reaction mixture can be delivered to a detection device. The detection device, such as a dual or multiple laser detection system can be part of the microfluidic system and can use a laser to identify each bead or microsphere by its color-coding, and another laser can detect the hybridization signal associated with each bead.","Examples of microfluidic devices that may be used, or adapted for use with vesicles, include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,591,936, 7,581,429, 7,579,136, 7,575,722, 7,568,399, 7,552,741, 7,544,506, 7,541,578, 7,518,726, 7,488,596, 7,485,214, 7,467,928, 7,452,713, 7,452,509, 7,449,096, 7,431,887, 7,422,725, 7,422,669, 7,419,822, 7,419,639, 7,413,709, 7,411,184, 7,402,229, 7,390,463, 7,381,471, 7,357,864, 7,351,592, 7,351,380, 7,338,637, 7,329,391, 7,323,140, 7,261,824, 7,258,837, 7,253,003, 7,238,324, 7,238,255, 7,233,865, 7,229,538, 7,201,881, 7,195,986, 7,189,581, 7,189,580, 7,189,368, 7,141,978, 7,138,062, 7,135,147, 7,125,711, 7,118,910, 7,118,661, 7,640,947, 7,666,361, 7,704,735; and International Patent Publication WO 2010\/072410; each of which patents or applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Another example for use with methods disclosed herein is described in Chen et al., 8, 2009 10.1039\/6916199","In one embodiment, a microfluidic device for isolating or detecting a vesicle comprises a channel of less than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, of 60 mm in width, or between about 2-60, 3-50, 3-40, 3-30, 3-20, or 4-20 mm in width. The microchannel can have a depth of less than about 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or 70 \u03bcm, or between about 10-70, 10-40, 15-35, or 20-30 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the microchannel can have a length of less than about 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 or 10 cm. The microfluidic device can have grooves on its ceiling that are less than about 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 6, 65, 70, 75, or 80 \u03bcm wide, or between about 40-80, 40-70, 40-60 or 45-55 \u03bcm wide. The grooves can be less than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 \u03bcm deep, such as between about 1-50, 5-40, 5-30, 3-20 or 5-15 \u03bcm.","The microfluidic device can have one or more binding agents attached to a surface in a channel, or present in a channel. For example, the microchannel can have one or more capture agents, such as a capture agent for EpCam, CD9, PCSA, CD63, CD81, PSMA, B7H3, PSCA, ICAM, STEAP, and EGFR. In one embodiment, a microchannel surface is treated with avidin and a capture agent, such as an antibody, that is biotinylated can be injected into the channel to bind the avidin.","A biological sample can be flowed into the microfluidic device, or a microchannel, at rates such as at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 \u03bcl per minute, such as between about 1-50, 5-40, 5-30, 3-20 or 5-15 \u03bcl per minute. One or more vesicles can be captured and directly detected in the microfludic device. Alternatively, the captured vesicle may be released and exit the microfluidic device prior to analysis. In another embodiment, one or more captured vesicles are lysed in the microchannel and the lysate can be analyzed. Lysis buffer can be flowed through the channel and lyse the captured vesicles. For example, the lysis buffer can be flowed into the device or microchannel at rates such as at least about a, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 \u03bcl per minute, such as between about 1-50, 5-40, 10-30, 5-30 or 10-35 \u03bcl per minute. The lysate can be collected and analyzed, such as performing RT-PCR, PCR, mass spectrometry, Western blotting, or other assays, to detect one or more biomarkers of the vesicle.","With methods of detecting isolated vesicles as described here, e.g., antibody affinity isolation, the consistency of the results can be optimized as necessary using various concentration or isolation procedures. Such steps can include agitation such as shaking or vortexing, different isolation techniques such as polymer based isolation, e.g., with PEG, and concentration to different levels during filtration or other steps. It will be understood by those in the art that such treatments can be applied at various stages of testing the vesicle containing sample. In one embodiment, the sample itself, e.g., a bodily fluid such as plasma or serum, is vortexed. In some embodiments, the sample is vortexed after one or more sample treatment step, e.g., vesicle isolation, has occurred. Agitation can occur at some or all appropriate sample treatment steps as desired.","The results can also be optimized as desirable by treating the vesicle-containing sample with various agents. Such agents include additives to control aggregation and\/or additives to adjust pH or ionic strength. Additives that control aggregation include blocking agents such as bovine serum albumen (BSA) and milk, chaotropic agents such as guanidium hydro chloride, and detergents or surfactants. Useful ionic detergents include sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)), sodium laureth sulfate (SLS, sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES)), ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), cetrimonium bromide, cetrimonium chloride, cetrimonium stearate, and the like. Useful non-ionic (zwitterionic) detergents include polyoxyethylene glycols, polysorbate 20 (also known as Tween 20), other polysorbates (e.g., 40, 60, 65, 80, etc), Triton-X (e.g., X100, X114), 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), CHAPSO, deoxycholic acid, sodium deoxycholate, NP-40, glycosides, octyl-thio-glucosides, maltosides, and the like. In some embodiments, Pluronic F-68, a surfactant shown to reduce platelet aggregation, is used to treat samples containing vesicles during isolation and\/or detection. F68 can be used from a 0.1% to 10% concentration, e.g., a 1%, 2.5% or 5% concentration. The pH and\/or ionic strength of the solution can be adjusted with various acids, bases, buffers or salts, including without limitation sodium chloride (NaCl), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), tris-buffered saline (TBS), sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate and saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer. In some embodiments, NaCl is added at a concentration of 0.1% to 10%, e.g., 1%, 2.5% or 5% final concentration. In some embodiments, Tween 20 is added to 0.005 to 2% concentration, e.g., 0.05%, 0.25% or 0.5% final concentration. In some embodiments, BSA is added to 0.1% to 10% concentration, e.g., 3%, 3.5% or 7% concentration. In some embodiments, SSC\/detergent (e.g., 20\u00d7SSC with 0.5% Tween 20 or 0.1% Triton-X 100) is added to 0.1% to 10% concentration, e.g., at 1.0% or 5.0% concentration.","It will be understood that the methods of detecting vesicles can be optimized as desired with various combinations of protocols and treatments as described herein. A detection protocol can be optimized by various combinations of agitation, isolation methods, and additives. In some embodiments, the patient sample is vortexed before and after isolation steps, and the sample is treated with blocking agents including BSA and F68. Such treatments may reduce the formation of large aggregates or protein or other biological debris and thus provide a more consistent detection reading.","Cell-of-Origin and Disease-Specific Vesicles","The bindings agent disclosed herein can be used to isolate or detect a vesicle, such as a cell-of-origin vesicle or vesicle with a specific biosignature. The beinding agent can be used to isolate or detect a heterogeneous population of vesicles from a sample or can be used to isolate or detect a homogeneous population of vesicles, such as cell-of-origin specific vesicles with specific biosignatures, from a heterogeneous population of vesicles.","A homogeneous population of vesicles, such as cell-of-origin specific vesicles, can be analyzed and used to characterize a phenotype for a subject. Cell-of-origin specific vesicles are esicles derived from specific cell types, which can include, but are not limited to, cells of a specific tissue, cells from a specific tumor of interest or a diseased tissue of interest, circulating tumor cells, or cells of maternal or fetal origin. The vesicles may be derived from tumor cells or lung, pancreas, stomach, intestine, bladder, kidney, ovary, testis, skin, colorectal, breast, prostate, brain, esophagus, liver, placenta, or fetal cells. The isolated vesicle can also be from a particular sample type, such as urinary vesicle.","A cell-of-origin specific vesicle from a biological sample can be isolated using one or more binding agents that are specific to a cell-of-origin. Vesicles for analysis of a disease or condition can be isolated using one or more binding agent specific for biomarkers for that disease or condition.","A vesicle can be concentrated prior to isolation or detection of a cell-of-origin specific vesicle, such as through centrifugation, chromatography, or filtration, as described above, to produce a heterogeneous population of vesicles prior to isolation of cell-of-origin specific vesicles. Alternatively, the vesicle is not concentrated, or the biological sample is not enriched for a vesicle, prior to isolation of a cell-of-origin vesicle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0276","num":"0275"},"figref":"FIG. 61","b":["100","102","104","106","108","104"]},"A cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be isolated from a biological sample of a subject by employing one or more binding agents that bind with high specificity to the cell-of-origin specific vesicle. In some instances, a single binding agent can be employed to isolate a cell-of-origin specific vesicle. In other instances, a combination of binding agents may be employed to isolate a cell-of-origin specific vesicle. For example, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75, or 100 different binding agents may be used to isolate a cell-of-origin vesicle. Therefore, a vesicle population (e.g., vesicles having the same binding agent profile) can be identified by utilizing a single or a plurality of binding agents.","One or more binding agents can be selected based on their specificity for a target antigen(s) that is specific to a cell-of-origin, e.g., a cell-of-origin that is related to a tumor, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, infection or other disease or disorder. The cell-of-origin can be from a cell that is informative for a diagnosis, prognosis, disease stratification, theranosis, prediction of responder\/non-responder status, disease monitoring, treatment monitoring and the like as related to such diseases and disorders. The cell-of-origin can also be from a cell useful to discover biomarkers for use thereto. Non-limiting examples of antigens which may be used singularly, or in combination, to isolate a cell-of-origin specific vesicle, disease specific vesicle, or tumor specific vesicle, are shown in  and are also described herein. The antigen can comprise membrane bound antigens which are accessible to binding agents. The antigen can be a biomarker related to characterizing a phenotype.","One of skill will appreciate that any applicable antigen that can be used to isolate an informative vesicle is contemplated by the invention. Binding agents, e.g., antibodies, aptamers and lectins, can be chosen that recognize surface antigens and\/or fragments thereof, as outlined herein. The binding agents can recognize antigens specific to the desired cell type or location and\/or recognize biomarkers associated with the desired cells. The cells can be, e.g., tumor cells, other diseased cells, cells that serve as markers of disease such as activated immune cells, etc. One of skill will appreciate that binding agents for any cells of interest can be useful for isolating vesicles associated with those cells. One of skill will further appreciate that the binding agents disclosed herein can be used for detecting vesicles of interest. As a non-limiting example, a binding agent to a vesicle biomarker can be labeled directly or indirectly in order to detect vesicles bound by one of more of the same or different binding agents.","A number of targets for binding agents useful for binding to vesicles associated with cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, infection or other disease or disorders are presented in Table 4. A vesicle derived from a cell associated with one of the listed disorders can be characterized using one of the antigens in the table. The binding agent, e.g., an antibody or aptamer, can recognize an epitope of the listed antigens, a fragment thereof, or binding agents can be used against any appropriate combination. Other antigens associated with the disease or disorder can be recognized as well in order to characterize the vesicle. One of skill will appreciate that any applicable antigen that can be used to assess an informative vesicle is contemplated by the invention for isolation, capture or detection in order to characterize a

Furthermore, a cell-of-origin specific vesicle can also be isolated from a biological sample using isolation methods based on cellular binding partners or binding agents of such vesicles. Such cellular binding partners can include but are not limited to peptides, proteins, RNA, DNA, apatmers, cells or serum-associated proteins that only bind to such vesicles when one or more specific biomarkers are present. Isolation or deteciton of a cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be carried out with a single binding partner or binding agent, or a combination of binding partners or binding agents whose singular application or combined application results in cell-of-origin specific isolation or detection. Non-limiting examples of such binding agents are provided in . For example, a vesicle for characterizing breast cancer can be isolated with one or more binding agents including, but not limited to, estrogen, progesterone, Herceptin (Trastuzumab), CCND1, MYC PNA, IGF-1 PNA, MYC PNA, SC4 aptamer (Ku), AII-7 aptamer (ERB2), Galectin-3, mucin-type 0-glycans, L-PHA, Galectin-9, or any combination thereof.","A binding agent may also be used for isolating or detecting a cell-of-origin specific vesicle based on: i) the presence of antigens specific for cell-of-origin specific vesicles; ii) the absence of markers specific for cell-of-origin specific vesicles; or iii) expression levels of biomarkers specific for cell-of-origin specific vesicles. A heterogeneous population of vesicles can be applied to a surface coated with specific binding agents designed to rule out or identify the cell-of-origin characteristics of the vesicles. Various binding agents, such as antibodies, can be arrayed on a solid surface or substrate and the heterogeneous population of vesicles is allowed to contact the solid surface or substrate for a sufficient time to allow interactions to take place. Specific binding or non-binding to given antibody locations on the array surface or substrate can then serve to identify antigen specific characteristics of the vesicle population that are specific to a given cell-of-origin.","A cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be enriched or isolated using one or more binding agents using a magnetic capture method, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or laser cytometry as described above. Magnetic capture methods can include, but are not limited to, the use of magnetically activated cell sorter (MACS) microbeads or magnetic columns. Examples of immunoaffinity and magnetic particle methods that can be used are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,551,435, 4,795,698, 4,925,788, 5,108,933, 5,186,827, 5,200,084 or 5,158,871. A cell-of-origin specific vesicle can also be isolated following the general methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,632, by using combination of antigens specific to a vesicle.","Any other appropriate method for isolating or otherwise enriching the cell-of-origin specific vesicles with respect to a biological sample may also be used in combination with the present invention. For example, size exclusion chromatography such as gel permeation columns, centrifugation or density gradient centrifugation, and filtration methods can be used in combination with the antigen selection methods described herein. The cell-of-origin specific vesicles may also be isolated following the methods described in Koga et al., 25:3703-3708 (2005), Taylor et al., 110:13-21 (2008), Nanjee et al., 2000; 46:207-223 or U.S. Pat. No. 7,232,653.","Accordingly, vesicles can be isolated that are isolated from cells derived from a tumor, or site of autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, infection or other disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the isolated vesicles are derived from cells related to such diseases and disorders, e.g., immune cells that play a role in the etiology of the disease and whose analysis is informative for a diagnosis, prognosis, disease stratification, theranosis, prediction of responder\/non-responder status, disease monitoring, treatment monitoring and the like as relates to such diseases and disorders. The vesicles are further useful to discover biomarkers. The isolated vesicles can then be assessed for characterizing a phenotype as described herein.","Vesicle Assessment","A phenotype can be characterized for a subject by analyzing a biological sample from the subject and determining the level, amount, or concentration of one or more populations of vesicles in the sample. A vesicle can be purified or concentrated prior to determining the amount of vesicles. Alternatively, the amount of vesicles can be directly assayed from a sample, without prior purification or concentration. The vesicles can be cell-of-origin specific vesicles or vesicles with a specific biosignature. The amount of vesicles can be used when characterizing a phenotype, such as a diagnosis, prognosis, theranosis, or prediction of responder\/non-responder status. In some embodiments, the amount is used to determine a physiological or biological state, such as pregnancy or the stage of pregnancy. The amount of vesicles can also be used to determine treatment efficacy, stage of a disease or condition, or progression of a disease or condition. For example, the amount of vesicles can be proportional or inversely proportional to an increase in disease stage or progression. The amount of vesicles can also be used to monitor progression of a disease or condition or to monitor a subject's response to a treatment.","The vesicles can be evaluated by comparing the level of vesicles with a reference level or value of vesicles. The reference value can be particular to physical or temporal endpoint. For example, the reference value can be from the same subject from whom a sample is assessed, or the reference value can be from a representative population of samples (e.g., samples from normal subjects not exhibiting a symptom of disease). Therefore, a reference value can provide a threshold measurement which is compared to a subject sample's readout for a vesicle population assayed in a given sample. Such reference values may be set according to data pooled from groups of sample corresponding to a particular cohort, including but not limited to age (e.g., newborns, infants, adolescents, young, middle-aged adults, seniors and adults of varied ages), racial\/ethnic groups, normal versus diseased subjects, smoker v. non-smoker, subject receiving therapy versus untreated subject, different time points of treatment for a particular individual or group of subjects similarly diagnosed or treated or combinations thereof. Furthermore, by determining vesicle levels at different timepoints of treatment for a particular individual, the individual's response to the treatment or progression of a disease or condition for which the individual is being treated for, can be monitored.","A reference value may be based on samples assessed from the same subject so to provide individualized tracking. Frequent testing of a patient may provide better comparisons to the reference values previously established for a particular patient and would allow a physician to more accurately assess the patient's disease stage or progression, and to inform a better decision for treatment. The reduced intraindividual variance of vesicle levels can allow a more specific and individualized threshold to be defined for the patient. Temporal intrasubject variation allows each individual to serve as a longitudinal control for optimum analysis of disease or physiological state.","Reference values can be established for unaffected individuals (of varying ages, ethnic backgrounds and sexes) without a particular phenotype by determining the amount of vesicles in an unaffected individual. For example, a reference value for a reference population can be used as a baseline for detection of one or more vesicle populations in a test subject. If a sample from a subject has a level or value that is similar to the reference, the subject can be identified to not have the disease, or of having a low likelihood of developing a disease.","Alternatively, reference values or levels can be established for individuals with a particular phenotype by determining the amount of one or more populations of vesicles in an individual with the phenotype. In addition, an index of values can be generated for a particular phenotype. For example, different disease stages can have different values, such as obtained from individuals with the different disease stages. A subject's value can be compared to the index and a diagnosis or prognosis of the disease can be determined, such as the disease stage or progression. In other embodiments, an index of values is generated for therapeutic efficacies. For example, the level of vesicles of individuals with a particular disease can be generated and noted what treatments were effective for the individual. The levels can be used to generate values of which is a subject's value is compared, and a treatment or therapy can be selected for the individual, e.g., by predicting from the levels whether the subject is likely to be a responder or non-responder for a treatment.","In some embodiments, a reference value is determined for individuals unaffected with a particular cancer, by isolating or detecting vesicles with an antigen that specifically targets biomarkers for the particular cancer. As a non-limiting example, individuals with varying stages of colorectal cancer and noncancerous polyps can be surveyed using the same techniques described for unaffected individuals and the levels of circulating vesicles for each group can be determined. In some embodiments, the levels are defined as means\u00b1standard deviations from at least two separate experiments performed in at least triplicate. Comparisons between these groups can be made using statistical tests to determine statistical significance of distinguishing biomarkers observed. In some embodiments, statistical significance is determined using a parametric statistical test. The parametric statistical test can comprise, without limitation, a fractional factorial design, analysis of variance (ANOVA), a t-test, least squares, a Pearson correlation, simple linear regression, nonlinear regression, multiple linear regression, or multiple nonlinear regression. Alternatively, the parametric statistical test can comprise a one-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, or repeated measures analysis of variance. In other embodiments, statistical significance is determined using a nonparametric statistical test. Examples include, but are not limited to, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a Mann-Whitney test, a Kruskal-Wallis test, a Friedman test, a Spearman ranked order correlation coefficient, a Kendall Tau analysis, and a nonparametric regression test. In some embodiments, statistical significance is determined at a p-value of less than 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, or 0.0001. The p-values can also be corrected for multiple comparisons, e.g., using a Bonferroni correction, a modification thereof, or other technique known to those in the art, e.g., the Hochberg correction, Holm-Bonferroni correction, {hacek over (S)}id\u00e1k correction, Dunnett's correction or Tukey's multiple comparisons. In some embodiments, an ANOVA is followed by Tukey's correction for post-test comparing of the biomarkers from each population.","Reference values can also be established for disease recurrence monitoring (or exacerbation phase in MS), for therapeutic response monitoring, or for predicting responder\/non-responder status.","In some embodiments, a reference value for microRNA obtained from vesicles is determined using an artificial vesicle, also referred to herein as a synthetic vesicle. Methods for manufacturing artificial vesicles are known to those of skill in the art, e.g., using liposomes. Artificial vesicles can be manufactured using methods disclosed in US20060222654 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,448,765, which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Artificial vesicles can be constructed with known markers to facilitate capture and\/or detection. In some embodiments, artificial vesicles are spiked into a bodily sample prior to processing. The level of intact synthetic vesicle can be tracked during processing, e.g., using filtration or other isolation methods disclosed herein, to provide a control for the amount of vesicles in the initial versus processed sample. Similarly, artificial vesicles can be spiked into a sample before or after any processing steps. In some embodiments, artificial vesicles are used to calibrate equipment used for isolation and detection of vesicles.","Artificial vesicles can be produced and used a control to test the viability of an assay, such as a bead-based assay. The artificial vesicle can bind to both the beads and to the detection antibodies. Thus, the artificial vesicle contains the amino acid sequence\/conformation that each of the antibodies binds. The artificial vesicle can comprise a purified protein or a synthetic peptide sequence to which the antibody binds. The artificial vesicle could be a bead, e.g., a polystyrene bead, that is capable of having biological molecules attached thereto. If the bead has an available carboxyl group, then the protein or peptide could be attached to the bead via an available amine group, such as using carbodiimide coupling.","In another embodiment, the artificial vesicle can be a polystyrene bead coated with avidin and a biotin is placed on the protein or peptide of choice either at the time of synthesis or via a biotin-maleimide chemistry. The proteins\/peptides to be on the bead can be mixed together in ratio specific to the application the artificial vesicle is being used for, and then conjugated to the bead. These artificial vesicles can then serve as a link between the capture beads and the detection antibodies, thereby providing a control to show that the components of the assay are working properly.","The value can be a quantitative or qualitative value. The value can be a direct measurement of the level of vesicles (example, mass per volume), or an indirect measure, such as the amount of a specific biomarker. The value can be a quantitative, such as a numerical value. In other embodiments, the value is qualitiative, such as no vesicles, low level of vesicles, medium level, high level of vesicles, or variations thereof.","The reference value can be stored in a database and used as a reference for the diagnosis, prognosis, theranosis, disease stratification, disease monitoring, treatment monitoring or prediction of non-responder\/responder status of a disease or condition based on the level or amount of microRNA, such as total amount of microRNA, or the amount of a specific population of microRNA, such as cell-of-origin specific microRNA or microRNA from vesicles with a specific biosignature. In an illustrative example, consider a method of determining a diagnosis for a cancer. MicroRNA from reference subjects with and without the cancer are assessed and stored in the database. The reference subjects provide biosignature indicative of the cancer or of another state, e.g., a healthy state. A sample from a test subject is then assayed and the microRNA biosignature is compared against those in the database. If the subject's biosignature correlates more closely with reference values indicative of cancer, a diagnosis of cancer may be made. Conversely, if the subject's biosignature correlates more closely with reference values indicative of a healthy state, the subject may be determined to not have the disease. One of skill will appreciate that this example is non-limiting and can be expanded for assessing other phenotypes, e.g., other diseases, prognosis, theranosis, disease stratification, disease monitoring, treatment monitoring or prediction of non-responder\/responder status, and the like.","A biosignature for characterizing a phenotype can be determined by detecting microRNA and\/or vesicles. The microRNA can be assessed within a vesicle. Alternately, the microRNA and vesicles in a sample are analyzed to characterize the phenotype without isolating the microRNA from the vesicles. Many analytical techniques are available to assess vesicles. In some embodiments, vesicle levels are characterized using mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, immunocytochemical staining, Western blotting, electrophoresis, chromatography or x-ray crystallography in accordance with procedures known in the art. For example, vesicles can be characterized and quantitatively measured using flow cytometry as described in Clayton et al., 2001; 163-174, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Vesicle levels may be determined using binding agents as described above. For example, a binding agent to vesicles can be labeled and the label detected and used to determine the amount of vesicles in a sample. The binding agent can be bound to a substrate, such as arrays or particles, such as described above. Alternatively, the vesicles may be labeled directly.","Electrophoretic tags or eTags can be used to determine the amount of vesicles. eTags are small fluorescent molecules linked to nucleic acids or antibodies and are designed to bind one specific nucleic acid sequence or protein, respectively. After the eTag binds its target, an enzyme is used to cleave the bound eTag from the target. The signal generated from the released eTag, called a \u201creporter,\u201d is proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid or protein in the sample. The eTag reporters can be identified by capillary electrophoresis. The unique charge-to-mass ratio of each eTag reporter\u2014that is, its electrical charge divided by its molecular weight\u2014makes it show up as a specific peak on the capillary electrophoresis readout Thus by targeting a specific biomarker of a vesicle with an eTag, the amount or level of vesicles can be determined.","The vesicle level can determined from a heterogeneous population of vesicles, such as the total population of vesicles in a sample. Alternatively, the vesicles level is determined from a homogenous population, or substantially homogenous population of vesicles, such as the level of specific cell-of-origin vesicles, such as vesicles from prostate cancer cells. In yet other embodiments, the level is determined for vesicles with a particular biomarker or combination of biomarkers, such as a biomarker specific for prostate cancer. Determining the level vesicles can be performed in conjunction with determining the biomarker or combination of biomarkers of a vesicle. Alternatively, determining the amount of vesicle may be performed prior to or subsequent to determining the biomarker or combination of biomarkers of the vesicles.","Determining the amount of vesicles can be assayed in a multiplexed manner. For example, determining the amount of more than one population of vesicles, such as different cell-of-origin specific vesicles with different biomarkers or combination of biomarkers, can be performed, such as those disclosed herein.","Performance of a diagnostic or related test is typically assessed using statistical measures. The performance of the characterization can be assessed by measuring sensitivity, specificity and related measures. For example, a level of microRNAs of interest can be assayed to characterize a phenotype, such as detecting a disease. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay to detect the disease is determined.","A true positive is a subject with a characteristic, e.g., a disease or disorder, correctly identified as having the characteristic. A false positive is a subject without the characteristic that the test improperly identifies as having the characteristic. A true negative is a subject without the characteristic that the test correctly identifies as not having the characteristic. A false negative is a person with the characteristic that the test improperly identifies as not having the characteristic. The ability of the test to distinguish between these classes provides a measure of test performance.","The specificity of a test is defined as the number of true negatives divided by the number of actual negatives (i.e., sum of true negatives and false positives). Specificity is a measure of how many subjects are correctly identified as negatives. A specificity of 100% means that the test recognizes all actual negatives\u2014for example, all healthy people will be recognized as healthy. A lower specificity indicates that more negatives will be determined as positive.","The sensitivity of a test is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of actual positives (i.e., sum of true positives and false negatives). Specificity is a measure of how many subjects are correctly identified as positives. A sensitivity of 100% means that the test recognizes all actual positives\u2014for example, all sick people will be recognized as sick. A lower sensitivity indicates that more positives will be missed by being determined as negative.","The accuracy of a test is defined as the number of true positives and true negatives divided by the sum of all true and false positives and all true and false negatives. It provides one number that combines sensitivity and specificity measurements.","Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are determined at a particular discrimination threshold value. For example, a common threshold for prostate cancer (PCa) detection is 4 ng\/mL of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in serum. A level of PSA equal to or above the threshold is considered positive for PCa and any level below is considered negative. As the threshold is varied, the sensitivity and specificity will also vary. For example, as the threshold for detecting cancer is increased, the specificity will increase because it is harder to call a subject positive, resulting in fewer false positives. At the same time, the sensitivity will decrease. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) is a graphical plot of the true positive rate (i.e., sensitivity) versus the false positive rate (i.e., 1\u2014specificity) for a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve shows how sensitivity and specificity change as the threshold is varied. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of an ROC curve provides a summary value indicative of a test's performance over the entire range of thresholds. The AUC is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive sample higher than a randomly chosen negative sample. An AUC of 0.5 indicates that the test has a 50% chance of proper ranking, which is equivalent to no discriminatory power (a coin flip also has a 50% chance of proper ranking). An AUC of 1.0 means that the test properly ranks (classifies) all subjects. The AUC is equivalent to the Wilcoxon test of ranks.","A biosignature according to the invention can be used to characterize a phenotype with at least 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, or 70% sensitivity, such as with at least 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, or 87% sensitivity.

Such measures can also be used to gauge test performance according to the methods of the invention.","Classification","Biosignature according to the invention can be used to classify a sample. Techniques for discriminate analysis are known to those of skill in the art. For example, a sample can be classified as, or predicted to be, a responder or non-responder to a given treatment for a given disease or disorder. Many statistical classification techniques are known to those of skill in the art. In supervised learning approaches, a group of samples from two or more groups are analyzed with a statistical classification method. Biomarkers can be discovered that can be used to build a classifier that differentiates between the two or more groups. A new sample can then be analyzed so that the classifier can associate the new with one of the two or more groups. Commonly used supervised classifiers include without limitation the neural network (multi-layer perceptron), support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, Gaussian mixture model, Gaussian, naive Bayes, decision tree and radial basis function (RBF) classifiers. Linear classification methods include Fisher's linear discriminant, logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier, perceptron, and support vector machines (SVMs). Other classifiers for use with the invention include quadratic classifiers, k-nearest neighbor, boosting, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, pattern recognition, Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov models. One of skill will appreciate that these or other classifiers, including improvements of any of these, are contemplated within the scope of the invention.","Classification using supervised methods is generally performed by the following methodology:","In order to solve a given problem of supervised learning (e.g. learning to recognize handwriting) one has to consider various steps:","1. Gather a training set. These can include, for example, samples that are from a subject with or without a disease or disorder, subjects that are known to respond or not respond to a treatment, subjects whose disease progresses or does not progress, etc. The training samples are used to \u201ctrain\u201d the classifier.","2. Determine the input \u201cfeature\u201d representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector, which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should be large enough to accurately predict the output. The features might include a set of biomarkers such as those derived from vesicles as described herein.","3. Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. A learning algorithm is chosen, e.g., artificial neural networks, decision trees, Bayes classifiers or support vector machines. The learning algorithm is used to build the classifier.","4. Build the classifier. The learning algorithm is run the gathered training set. Parameters of the learning algorithm may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a validation set) of the training set, or via cross-validation. After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the algorithm may be measured on a test set of naive samples that is separate from the training set.","Once the classifier is determined as described above, it can be used to classify a sample, e.g., that of a subject who is being analyzed by the methods of the invention. As an example, a classifier can be built using data for levels of microRNA of interest in reference subjects with and without a disease as the training and test sets. MicroRNA levels found in a sample from a test subject are assessed and the classifier is used to classify the subject as with or without the disease. As another example, a classifier can be built using data for levels of vesicle biomarkers of interest in reference subjects that have been found to respond or not respond to certain diseases as the training and test sets. The vesicle biomarker levels found in a sample from a test subject are assessed and the classifier is used to classify the subject as with or without the disease.","Unsupervised learning approaches can also be used with the invention. Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach wherein a clustering algorithm correlates a series of samples without the use the labels. The most similar samples are sorted into \u201cclusters.\u201d A new sample could be sorted into a cluster and thereby classified with other members that it most closely associates. Many clustering algorithms well known to those of skill in the art can be used with the invention, such as hierarchical clustering.","Biosignatures","A biosignature can be obtained according to the invention by assessing a vesicle population, including surface and payload vesicle associated biomarkers, and\/or circulating biomarkers including microRNA and protein. A biosignature derived from a subject can be used to characterize a phenotype of the subject. A biosignature can further include the level of one or more additional biomarkers, e.g., circulating biomarkers or biomarkers associated with a vesicle of interest. A biosignature of a vesicle of interest can include particular antigens or biomarkers that are present on the vesicle. The biosignature can also include one or more antigens or biomarkers that are carried as payload within the vesicle, including the microRNA under examination. The biosignature can comprise a combination of one or more antigens or biomarkers that are present on the vesicle with one or more biomarkers that are detected in the vesicle. The biosignature can further comprise other information about a vesicle aside from its biomarkers. Such information can include vesicle size, circulating half-life, metabolic half-life, and specific activity in vivo or in vitro. The biosignature can comprise the biomarkers or other characteristics used to build a classifier.","In some embodiments, the microRNA is detected directly in a biological sample. For example, RNA in a bodily fluid can be isolated using commercially available kits such as mirVana kits (Applied Biosystems\/Ambion, Austin, Tex.), MagMAX\u2122 RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems\/Ambion, Austin, Tex.), and QIAzol Lysis Reagent and RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia Calif.). Particular species of microRNAs can be determined using array or PCR techniques as described below.","In some embodiments, the microRNA payload with vesicles is assessed in order to characterize a phenotype. The vesicles can be purified or concentrated prior to determining the biosignature. For example, a cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be isolated and its biosignature determined. Alternatively, the biosignature of the vesicle can be directly assayed from a sample, without prior purification or concentration. The biosignature of the invention can be used to determine a diagnosis, prognosis, or theranosis of a disease or condition or similar measures described herein. A biosignature can also be used to determine treatment efficacy, stage of a disease or condition, or progression of a disease or condition, or responder\/non-responder status. Furthermore, a biosignature may be used to determine a physiological state, such as pregnancy.","A characteristic of a vesicle in and of itself can be assessed to determine a biosignature. The characteristic can be used to diagnose, detect or determine a disease stage or progression, the therapeutic implications of a disease or condition, or characterize a physiological state. Such characteristics include without limitation the level or amount of vesicles, vesicle size, temporal evaluation of the variation in vesicle half-life, circulating vesicle half-life, metabolic half-life of a vesicle, or activity of a vesicle.","Biomarkers that can be included in a biosignature include one or more proteins or peptides (e.g., providing a protein signature), nucleic acids (e.g. RNA signature as described, or a DNA signature), lipids (e.g. lipid signature), or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the biosignature can also comprise the type or amount of drug or drug metabolite present in a vesicle, (e.g., providing a drug signature), as such drug may be taken by a subject from which the biological sample is obtained, resulting in a vesicle carrying the drug or metabolites of the drug.","A biosignature can also include an expression level, presence, absence, mutation, variant, copy number variation, truncation, duplication, modification, or molecular association of one or more biomarkers. A genetic variant, or nucleotide variant, refers to changes or alterations to a gene or cDNA sequence at a particular locus, including, but not limited to, nucleotide base deletions, insertions, inversions, and substitutions in the coding and non-coding regions. Deletions may be of a single nucleotide base, a portion or a region of the nucleotide sequence of the gene, or of the entire gene sequence. Insertions may be of one or more nucleotide bases. The genetic variant may occur in transcriptional regulatory regions, untranslated regions of mRNA, exons, introns, or exon\/intron junctions. The genetic variant may or may not result in stop codons, frame shifts, deletions of amino acids, altered gene transcript splice forms or altered amino acid sequence.","In an embodiment, nucleic acid biomarkers, including nucleic acid payload within a vesicle, is assessed for nucleotide variants. The nucleic acid biomarker may comprise one or more RNA species, e.g., mRNA, miRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, rRNAs, tRNAs, siRNA, hnRNA, shRNA, or a combination thereof. Similarly, DNA payload can be assessed to form a DNA signature.","An RNA signature or DNA signature can also include a mutational, epigenetic modification, or genetic variant analysis of the RNA or DNA present in the vesicle. Epigenetic modifications include patterns of DNA methylation. See, e.g., Lesche R. and Eckhardt F., DNA methylation markers: a versatile diagnostic tool for routine clinical use. Curr Opin Mol Ther. 2007 June; 9(3):222-30, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus, a biomarker can be the methylation status of a segment of DNA.","A biosignature can comprise one or more miRNA signatures combined with one or more additional signatures including, but not limited to, an mRNA signature, DNA signature, protein signature, peptide signature, antigen signature, or any combination thereof. For example, the biosignature can comprise one or more miRNA biomarkers with one or more DNA biomarkers, one or more mRNA biomarkers, one or more snoRNA biomarkers, one or more protein biomarkers, one or more peptide biomarkers, one or more antigen biomarkers, one or more antigen biomarkers, one or more lipid biomarkers, or any combination thereof.","A biosignature can comprise a combination of one or more antigens or binding agents (such as ability to bind one or more binding agents), such as listed in , respectively, or those described elsewhere herein. The biosignature can further comprise one or more other biomarkers, such as, but not limited to, miRNA, DNA (e.g. single stranded DNA, complementary DNA, or noncoding DNA), or mRNA.","The biosignature of a vesicle can comprise a combination of one or more antigens, such as shown in , one or more binding agents, such as shown in , and one or more biomarkers for a condition or disease, such as listed in . The biosignature can comprise one or more biomarkers, for example miRNA, with one or more antigens specific for a cancer cell (for example, as shown in ).","In some embodiments, a vesicle used in the subject methods has a biosignature that is specific to the cell-of-origin and is used to derive disease-specific or biological state specific diagnostic, prognostic or therapy-related biosignatures representative of the cell-of-origin. In other embodiments, a vesicle has a biosignature that is specific to a given disease or physiological condition that is different from the biosignature of the cell-of-origin for use in the diagnosis, prognosis, staging, therapy-related determinations or physiological state characterization. Biosignatures can also comprise a combination of cell-of-origin specific and non-specific vesicles.","Biosignatures can be used to evaluate diagnostic criteria such as presence of disease, disease staging, disease monitoring, disease stratification, or surveillance for detection, metastasis or recurrence or progression of disease. A biosignature can also be used clinically in making decisions concerning treatment modalities including therapeutic intervention. A biosignature can further be used clinically to make treatment decisions, including whether to perform surgery or what treatment standards should be utilized along with surgery (e.g., either pre-surgery or post-surgery). As an illustrative example, a microRNA (miRNA) biosignature that indicates an aggressive form of cancer may call for a more aggressive surgical procedure and\/or more aggressive therapeutic regimen to treat the patient.","A biosignature can be used in therapy related diagnostics to provide tests useful to diagnose a disease or choose the correct treatment regimen, such as provide a theranosis. Theranostics includes diagnostic testing that provides the ability to affect therapy or treatment of a diseased state. Theranostics testing provides a theranosis in a similar manner that diagnostics or prognostic testing provides a diagnosis or prognosis, respectively. As used herein, theranostics encompasses any desired form of therapy related testing, including predictive medicine, personalized medicine, integrated medicine, pharmacodiagnostics and Dx\/Rx partnering. Therapy related tests can be used to predict and assess drug response in individual subjects, i.e., to provide personalized medicine. Predicting a drug response can be determining whether a subject is a likely responder or a likely non-responder to a candidate therapeutic agent, e.g., before the subject has been exposed or otherwise treated with the treatment. Assessing a drug response can be monitoring a response to a drug, e.g., monitoring the subject's improvement or lack thereof over a time course after initiating the treatment. Therapy related tests are useful to select a subject for treatment who is particularly likely to benefit from the treatment or to provide an early and objective indication of treatment efficacy in an individual subject. Thus, a biosignature as disclosed herein may indicate that treatment should be altered to select a more promising treatment, thereby avoiding the great expense of delaying beneficial treatment and avoiding the financial and morbidity costs of administering an ineffective drug(s).","Therapy related diagnostics are also useful in clinical diagnosis and management of a variety of diseases and disorders, which include, but are not limited to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infectious diseases, sepsis, neurological diseases, central nervous system related diseases, endovascular related diseases, and autoimmune related diseases. Therapy related diagnostics also aid in the prediction of drug toxicity, drug resistance or drug response. Therapy related tests may be developed in any suitable diagnostic testing format, which include, but are not limited to, e.g., immunohistochemical tests, clinical chemistry, immunoassay, cell-based technologies, nucleic acid tests or body imaging methods. Therapy related tests can further include but are not limited to, testing that aids in the determination of therapy, testing that monitors for therapeutic toxicity, or response to therapy testing. Thus, a biosignature can be used to predict or monitor a subject's response to a treatment. A biosignature can be determined at different time points for a subject after initiating, removing, or altering a particular treatment.","In some embodiments, a determination or prediction as to whether a subject is responding to a treatment is made based on a change in the amount of one or more components of a biosignature (i.e., the microRNA, vesicles and\/or biomarkers of interest), an amount of one or more components of a particular biosignature, or the biosignature detected for the components. In another embodiment, a subject's condition is monitored by determining a biosignature at different time points. The progression, regression, or recurrence of a condition is determined. Response to therapy can also be measured over a time course. Thus, the invention provides a method of monitoring a status of a disease or other medical condition in a subject, comprising isolating or detecting a biosignature from a biological sample from the subject, detecting the overall amount of the components of a particular biosignature, or detecting the biosignature of one or more components (such as the presence, absence, or expression level of a biomarker). The biosignatures are used to monitor the status of the disease or condition.","In some embodiments, a biosignature is used to determine whether a particular disease or condition is resistant to a drug. If a subject is drug resistant, a physician need not waste valuable time with such drug treatment. To obtain early validation of a drug choice or treatment regimen, a biosignature is determined for a sample obtained from a subject. The biosignature is used to assess whether the particular subject's disease has the biomarker associated with drug resistance. Such a determination enables doctors to devote critical time as well as the patient's financial resources to effective treatments.","Moreover, biosignature may be used to assess whether a subject is afflicted with disease, is at risk for developing disease or to assess the stage or progression of the disease. For example, a biosignature can be used to assess whether a subject has prostate cancer (for example, , ) or colon cancer (for example, , ). Furthermore, a biosignature can be used to determine a stage of a disease or condition, such as colon cancer (for example, , ).","Furthermore, determining the amount of vesicles, such a heterogeneous population of vesicles, and the amount of one or more homogeneous population of vesicles, such as a population of vesicles with the same biosignature, can be used to characterize a phenotype. For example, determination of the total amount of vesicles in a sample (i.e. not cell-type specific) and determining the presence of one or more different cell-of-origin specific vesicles can be used to characterize a phenotype. Threshold values, or reference values or amounts can be determined based on comparisons of normal subjects and subjects with the phenotype of interest, as further described below, and criteria based on the threshold or reference values determined. The different criteria can be used to characterize a phenotype.","One criterion can be based on the amount of a heterogeneous population of vesicles in a sample. In one embodiment, general vesicle markers, such as CD9, CD81, and CD63 can be used to determine the amount of vesicles in a sample. The expression level of CD9, CD81, CD63, or a combination thereof can be detected and if the level is greater than a threshold level, the criterion is met. In another embodiment, the criterion is met if level of CD9, CD81, CD63, or a combination thereof is lower than a threshold value or reference value. In another embodiment, the criterion can be based on whether the amount of vesicles is higher than a threshold or reference value. Another criterion can be based on the amount of vesicles with a specific biosignature. If the amount of vesicles with the specific biosignature is lower than a threshold or reference value, the criterion is met. In another embodiment, if the amount of vesicles with the specific biosignature is higher than a threshold or reference value, the criterion is met. A criterion can also be based on the amount of vesicles derived from a particular cell type. If the amount is lower than a threshold or reference value, the criterion is met. In another embodiment, if the amount is higher than a threshold value, the criterion is met.","In a non-limiting example, consider that vesicles from prostate cells are determined by detecting the biomarker PCSA or PSCA, and that a criterion is met if the level of detected PCSA or PSCA is greater than a threshold level. The threshold can be the level of the same markers in a sample from a control cell line or control subject. Another criterion can be based on whether the amount of vesicles derived from a cancer cell or comprising one or more cancer specific biomarkers. For example, the biomarkers B7H3, EpCam, or both, can be determined and a criterion met if the level of detected B7H3 and\/or EpCam is greater than a threshold level or within a pre-determined range. If the amount is lower, or higher, than a threshold or reference value, the criterion is met. A criterion can also be the reliability of the result, such as meeting a quality control measure or value. A detected amount of B7H3 and\/or EpCam in a test sample that is above the amount of these markers in a control sample may indicate the presence of a cancer in the test sample.","As described, analysis of multiple markers can be combined to assess whether a criterion is met. In an illustrative example, a biosignature is used to assess whether a subject has prostate cancer by detecting one or more of the general vesicle markers CD9, CD63 and CD81; one or more prostate epithelial markers including PCSA or PSMA; and one or more cancer markers such as B7H3 and\/or EpCam. Higher levels of the markers in a sample from a subject than in a control individual without prostate cancer indicates the presence of the prostate cancer in the subject. In some embodiments, the multiple markers are assessed in a multiplex fashion.","One of skill will understand that such rules based on meeting criterion as described can be applied to any appropriate biomarker. For example, the criterion can be applied to vesicle characteristics such as amount of vesicles present, amount of vesicles with a particular biosignature present, amount of vesicle payload biomarkers present, amount of microRNA or other circulating biomarkers present, and the like. The ratios of appropriate biomarkers can be determined. As illustrative examples, the criterion could be a ratio of an vesicle surface protein to another vesicle surface protein, a ratio of an vesicle surface protein to a microRNA, a ratio of one vesicle population to another vesicle population, a ratio of one circulating biomarker to another circulating biomarker, etc.","A phenotype for a subject can be characterized based on meeting any number of useful criteria. In some embodiments, at least one criterion is used for each biomarker. In some embodiments, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or at least 100 criteria are used. For example, for the characterizing of a cancer, a number of different criteria can be used when the subject is diagnosed with a cancer: 1) if the amount of microRNA in a sample from a subject is higher than a reference value; 2) if the amount of a microRNA within cell type specific vesicles (i.e. vesicles derived from a specific tissue or organ) is higher than a reference value; or 3) if the amount of microRNA within vesicles with one or more cancer specific biomarkers is higher than a reference value. Similar rules can apply if the amount of microRNA is less than or the same as the reference. The method can further include a quality control measure, such that the results are provided for the subject if the samples meet the quality control measure. In some embodiments, if the criteria are met but the quality control is questionable, the subject is reassessed.","In other embodiments, a single measure is determined for assessment of multiple biomarkers, and the measure is compared to a reference. For illustration, a test for prostate cancer might comprise multiplying the level of PSA against the level of miR-141 in a blood sample. The criterion is met if the product of the levels is above a threshold, indicating the presense of the cancer. As another illustration, a number of binding agents to general vesicle markers can carry the same label, e.g., the same fluorophore. The level of the detected label can be compared to a threshold.","Criterion can be applied to multiple types of biomarkers in addition to multiple biomarkers of the same type. For example, the levels of one or more circulating biomarkers (e.g., RNA, DNA, peptides), vesicles, mutations, etc, can be compared to a reference. Different components of a biosignature can have different criteria. As a non-limiting example, a biosignature used to diagnose a cancer can include overexpression of one miR species as compared to a reference and underexpression of a vesicle surface antigen as compared to another reference.","A biosignature can be determined by comparing the amount of vesicles, the structure of a vesicle, or any other informative characteristic of a vesicle. Vesicle structure can be assessed using transmission electron microscopy, see for example, Hansen et al., 311: 134-134(1) (1998), or scanning electron microscopy. Various combinations of methods and techniques or analyzing one or more vesicles can be used to determine a phenotype for a subject.","A biosignature can include without limitation the presence or absence, copy number, expression level, or activity level of a biomarker. Other useful components of a biosignature include the presence of a mutation (e.g., mutations which affect activity of a transcription or translation product, such as substitution, deletion, or insertion mutations), variant, or post-translation modification of a biomarker. Post-translational modification of a protein biomarker include without limitation acylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, deacetylation, alkylation, methylation, amidation, biotinylation, gamma-carboxylation, glutamylation, glycosylation, glycyation, hydroxylation, covalent attachment of heme moiety, iodination, isoprenylation, lipoylation, prenylation, GPI anchor formation, myristoylation, farnesylation, geranylgeranylation, covalent attachment of nucleotides or derivatives thereof, ADP-ribosylation, flavin attachment, oxidation, palmitoylation, pegylation, covalent attachment of phosphatidylinositol, phosphopantetheinylation, polysialylation, pyroglutamate formation, racemization of proline by prolyl isomerase, tRNA-mediation addition of amino acids such as arginylation, sulfation, the addition of a sulfate group to a tyrosine, or selenoylation of the biomarker.","The methods described herein can be used to identify a biosignature that is associated with a disease, condition or physiological state. The biosignature can also be utilized to determine if a subject is afflicted with cancer or is at risk for developing cancer. A subject at risk of developing cancer can include those who may be predisposed or who have pre-symptomatic early stage disease.","A biosignature can also be utilized to provide a diagnostic or theranostic determination for other diseases including but not limited to autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, sepsis or pancreatitis or any disease, conditions or symptoms listed in .","The biosignature can also be used to identify a given pregnancy state from the peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, or amniotic fluid (e.g. miRNA signature specific to Downs Syndrome) or adverse pregnancy outcome such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction or recurrent pregnancy loss. The biosignature can also be used to indicate the health of the mother, the fetus at all developmental stages, the pre-implantation embryo or a newborn.","A biosignature can be utilized for pre-symptomatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the biosignature can be utilized to detect disease, determine disease stage or progression, determine the recurrence of disease, identify treatment protocols, determine efficacy of treatment protocols or evaluate the physiological status of individuals related to age and environmental exposure.","Monitoring a biosignature of a vesicle can also be used to identify toxic exposures in a subject including, but not limited to, situations of early exposure or exposure to an unknown or unidentified toxic agent. Without being bound by any one specific theory for mechanism of action, vesicles can shed from damaged cells and in the process compartmentalize specific contents of the cell including both membrane components and engulfed cytoplasmic contents. Cells exposed to toxic agents\/chemicals may increase vesicle shedding to expel toxic agents or metabolites thereof, thus resulting in increased vesicle levels. Thus, monitoring vesicle levels, vesicle biosignature, or both, allows assessment of an individual's response to potential toxic agent(s).","A vesicle and\/or other biomarkers of the invention can be used to identify states of drug-induced toxicity or the organ injured, by detecting one or more specific antigen, binding agent, biomarker, or any combination thereof. The level of vesicles, changes in the biosignature of a vesicle, or both, can be used to monitor an individual for acute, chronic, or occupational exposures to any number of toxic agents including, but not limited to, drugs, antibiotics, industrial chemicals, toxic antibiotic metabolites, herbs, household chemicals, and chemicals produced by other organisms, either naturally occurring or synthetic in nature. In addition, a biosignature can be used to identify conditions or diseases, including cancers of unknown origin, also known as cancers of unknown primary (CUP).","A vesicle may be isolated from a biological sample as previously described to arrive at a heterogeneous population of vesicles. The heterogeneous population of vesicles can then be contacted with substrates coated with specific binding agents designed to rule out or identify antigen specific characteristics of the vesicle population that are specific to a given cell-of-origin. Further, as described above, the biosignature of a vesicle can correlate with the cancerous state of cells. Compounds that inhibit cancer in a subject may cause a change, e.g., a change in biosignature of a vesicle, which can be monitored by serial isolation of vesicles over time and treatment course. The level of vesicles or changes in the level of vesicles with a specific biosignature can be monitored.","In one aspect, the present invention relates to biomarker discovery and biosignature discovery. In an embodiment, one or more subjects that respond to a therapy (responders) and one or more subjects that do not respond to the same therapy (non-responders) can have their vesicles interrogated. Interrogation can be performed to identify the presence of one or more biomarkers, including any of the biomarkers described herein. In one aspect, the presence, quantity, and payload of a miR are assayed. The payload of a miR can be, for example, and surface or internal protein, nucleic acid, lipid or carbohydrate.","The presence or absence of a biosignature in responders but not in the non-responders can be used for theranosis. A sample from responders may be analyzed for one or more of the following: amount of vesicles, amount of a unique subset or species of vesicles, biomarkers in such vesicles, biosignature of such vesicles, etc. In one instance, vesicles such as microvesicles or exosomes from responders and non-responders are analyzed for the presence and\/or quantity of one or more miRNAs, such as miRNA 122, miR-548c-5p, miR-362-3p, miR-422a, miR-597, miR-429, miR-200a, and\/or miR-200b. A difference in biosignatures between responders and non-responders can be used for theranosis. In another embodiment, vesicles are obtained from subjects having a disease or condition. Vesicles are also obtained from subjects free of such disease or condition. The vesicles from both groups of subjects are assayed for unique biosignatures that are associated with all subjects in that group but not in subjects from the other group. Such biosignatures or biomarkers can then used as a diagnostic for the presence or absence of the condition or disease, or to classify the subject as belonging on one of the groups (those with\/without disease, aggressive\/non-aggressive disease, responder\/non-responder, etc).","In a further example, vesicles are assayed from patients having a stage I cancer and patients having stage II or III of the same cancer. A difference in biosignatures or biomarkers between vesicles from each group of patient is identified (e.g., vesicles from stage III cancer may have an increased expression of one or more genes or miR's), thereby identifying a biosignature or biomarker that distinguishes different stages of a disease. Such biosignature can then be used to prognose patients having the disease.","In some instances, a biosignature is determined by assaying vesicles from a subject over a period of time (e.g., every day, week, month, or year). Thus, responders and non-responders or patients in phase I and phase II\/III can have their vesicles interrogated over time (e.g., every month). The payload or physical attributes of the vesicles in each point in time can be compared. A temporal pattern can thus form a biosignature that can then be used for theranosis, diagnosis, prognosis, disease stratification, treatment monitoring, disease monitoring or making a prediction of responder\/non-responder status. As a non-limiting example, an increasing amount of a biomarker (e.g., miR 122) in vesiscles over a time course can be associated with metastatic cancer, as opposed to a stagnant amounts of the biomarker in vesiscles over the time course can be associated with non-metastatic cancer. A time course may last over at least 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 2 months, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or at least 12 months.","The level of vesicles, level of vesicles with a specific biosignature, or a biosignature of a vesicle can also be used to assess the efficacy of a therapy for a condition. For example, the level of vesicles, level of vesicles with a specific biosignature, or a biosignature of a vesicle can be used to assess the efficacy of a cancer treatment, e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or any other therapeutic approach useful for inhibiting cancer in a subject. In addition, a biosignature can be used in a screening assay to identify candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids, small molecules or other drugs) that have a modulatory effect on the biosignature of a vesicle. Compounds identified via such screening assays may be useful, for example, for modulating, e.g., inhibiting, ameliorating, treating, or preventing conditions or diseases.","For example, a biosignature for a vesicle can be obtained from a patient who is undergoing successful treatment for a particular cancer. Cells from a cancer patient not being treated with the same drug can be cultured and vesicles from the cultures obtained for determining biosignatures. The cells can be treated with test compounds and the biosignature of the vesicles from the cultures can be compared to the biosignature of the vesicles obtained from the patient undergoing successful treatment. The test compounds that results in biosignatures that are similar to those of the patient undergoing successful treatment can be selected for further studies.","The biosignature of a vesicle can also be used to monitor the influence of an agent (e.g., drug compounds) on the biosignature in clinical trials. Monitoring the level of vesicles, changes in the biosignature of a vesicle, or both, can also be used in a method of assessing the efficacy of a test compound, such as a test compound for inhibiting cancer cells.","The level of vesicles, the biosignature of a vesicle, or both, can also be used to determine the effectiveness of a particular therapeutic intervention (pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical) and to alter the intervention to 1) reduce the risk of developing adverse outcomes, 2) enhance the effectiveness of the intervention or 3) identify resistant states. Thus, in addition to diagnosing or confirming the presence of or risk for developing a disease, condition or a syndrome, the methods and compositions disclosed herein also provide a system for optimizing the treatment of a subject having such a disease, condition or syndrome. For example, a therapy-related approach to treating a disease, condition or syndrome by integrating diagnostics and therapeutics to improve the real-time treatment of a subject can be determined by identifying the biosignature of a vesicle.","Tests that identify the level of vesicles, the biosignature of a vesicle, or both, can be used to identify which patients are most suited to a particular therapy, and provide feedback on how well a drug is working, so as to optimize treatment regimens. For example, in pregnancy-induced hypertension and associated conditions, therapy-related diagnostics can flexibly monitor changes in important parameters (e.g., cytokine and\/or growth factor levels) over time, to optimize treatment.","Within the clinical trial setting of investigational agents as defined by the FDA, MDA, EMA, USDA, and EMEA, therapy-related diagnostics as determined by a biosignature disclosed herein, can provide key information to optimize trial design, monitor efficacy, and enhance drug safety. For instance, for trial design, therapy-related diagnostics can be used for patient stratification, determination of patient eligibility (inclusion\/exclusion), creation of homogeneous treatment groups, and selection of patient samples that are optimized to a matched case control cohort. Such therapy-related diagnostic can therefore provide the means for patient efficacy enrichment, thereby minimizing the number of individuals needed for trial recruitment. For example, for efficacy, therapy-related diagnostics are useful for monitoring therapy and assessing efficacy criteria. Alternatively, for safety, therapy-related diagnostics can be used to prevent adverse drug reactions or avoid medication error and monitor compliance with the therapeutic regimen.","In some embodiments, the invention provides a method of identifying responder and non-responders to a treatment undergoing clinical trials, comprising detecting biosignatures comprising microRNA in subjects enrolled in the clinical trial, and identifying biosignatures that distinguish between responders and non-responders. In a further embodiment, the biosignatures are measured in a drug naive subject and used to predict whether the subject will be a responder or non-responder. The prediction can be based upon whether the biosignatures of the drug naive subject correlate more closely with the clinical trial subjects identified as responders, thereby predicting that the drug naive subject will be a responder. Conversely, if the biosignatures of the drug naive subject correlate more closely with the clinical trial subjects identified as non-responders, the methods of the invention can predict that the drug naive subject will be a non-responder. The prediction can therefore be used to stratify potential responders and non-responders to the treatment. In some embodiments, the prediction is used to guide a course of treatment, e.g., by helping treating physicians decide whether to administer the drug. In some embodiments, the prediction is used to guide selection of patients for enrollment in further clinical trials. In a non-limiting example, biosignatures that predict responder\/non-responder status in Phase II trials can be used to select patients for a Phase III trial, thereby increasing the likelihood of response in the Phase III patient population. One of skill will appreciate that the method can be adapted to identify biosignatures to stratify subjects on criteria other than responder\/non-responder status. In one embodiment, the criterion is treatment safety. Therefore the method is followed as above to identify subjects who are likely or not to have adverse events to the treatment. In a non-limiting example, biosignatures that predict safety profile in Phase II trials can be used to select patients for a Phase III trial, thereby increasing the treatment safety profile in the Phase III patient population.","Therefore, the level of vesicles, the biosignature of a vesicle, or both, can be used to monitor drug efficacy, determine response or resistance to a given drug, or both, thereby enhancing drug safety. For example, in colon cancer, vesicles are typically shed from colon cancer cells and can be isolated from the peripheral blood and used to isolate one or more biomarkers e.g., KRAS mRNA which can then be sequenced to detect KRAS mutations. In the case of mRNA biomarkers, the mRNA can be reverse transcribed into cDNA and sequenced (e.g., by Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, NextGen sequencing, RT-PCR assays) to determine if there are mutations present that confer resistance to a drug (e.g., cetuximab or panitumimab). In another example, vesicles that are specifically shed from lung cancer cells are isolated from a biological sample and used to isolate a lung cancer biomarker, e.g., EGFR mRNA. The EGFR mRNA is processed to cDNA and sequenced to determine if there are EGFR mutations present that show resistance or response to specific drugs or treatments for lung cancer.","One or more biosignatures can be grouped so that information obtained about the set of biosignatures in a particular group provides a reasonable basis for making a clinically relevant decision, such as but not limited to a diagnosis, prognosis, or management of treatment, such as treatment selection.","As with most diagnostic markers, it is often desirable to use the fewest number of markers sufficient to make a correct medical judgment. This prevents a delay in treatment pending further analysis as well inappropriate use of time and resources.","Also disclosed herein are methods of conducting retrospective analysis on samples (e.g., serum and tissue biobanks) for the purpose of correlating qualitative and quantitative properties, such as biosignatures of vesicles, with clinical outcomes in terms of disease state, disease stage, progression, prognosis; therapeutic efficacy or selection; or physiological conditions. Furthermore, methods and compositions disclosed herein are utilized for conducting prospective analysis on a sample (e.g., serum and\/or tissue collected from individuals in a clinical trial) for the purpose of correlating qualitative and quantitative biosignatures of vesicleswith clinical outcomes in terms of disease state, disease stage, progression, prognosis; therapeutic efficacy or selection; or physiological conditions can also be performed. As used herein, a biosignature for a vesicle can be used to identify a cell-of-origin specific vesicle. Furthermore, a biosignature can be determined based on a surface marker profile of a vesicle or contents of a vesicle.","The biosignatures used to characterize a phenotype according to the invention can comprise multiple components (e.g., microRNA, vesicles or other biomarkers) or characteristics (e.g., vesicle size or morphology). The biosignatures can comprise at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100 components or characteristics. A biosignature with more than one component or characteristic, such as at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100 components, may provide higher sensitivity and\/or specificity in characterizing a phenotype. In some embodiments, assessing a plurality of components or characteristics provides increased sensitivity and\/or specificity as compared to assessing fewer components or characteristics. On the other hand, it is often desirable to use the fewest number of components or characteristics sufficient to make a correct medical judgment. Fewer markers can avoid statistical overfitting of a classifier and can prevent a delay in treatment pending further analysis as well inappropriate use of time and resources. Thus, the methods of the invention comprise determining an optimal number of components or characteristics.","A biosignature according to the invention can be used to characterize a phenotype with a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, or similar performance metric as described above. The biosignatures can also be used to build a classifier to classify a sample as belonging to a group, such as belonging to a group having a disease or not, a group having an aggressive disease or not, or a group of responders or non-responders. In one embodiment, a classifier is used to determine whether a subject has an aggressive or non-aggressive cancer. In the illustrative case of prostate cancer, this can help a physician to determine whether to watch the cancer, i.e., prescribe \u201cwatchful waiting,\u201d or perform a prostatectomy. In another embodiment, a classifier is used to determine whether a breast cancer patient is likely to respond or not to tamoxifen, thereby helping the physician to determine whether or not to treat the patient with tamoxifen or another drug.","Biomarkers","A biosignature used to characterize a phenotype can comprise one or more biomarkers. The biomarker can be a circulating marker, a membrane associated marker, or a component present within a vesicle or on a vesicle's surface. These biomarkers include without limitation a nucleic acid (e.g. RNA (mRNA, miRNA, etc.) or DNA), protein, peptide, polypeptide, antigen, lipid, carbohydrate, or proteoglycan.","The biosignature can include the presence or absence, expression level, mutational state, genetic variant state, or any modification (such as epigentic modification, post-translation modification) of a biomarker (e.g. any one or more biomarker listed in , -). The expression level of a biomarker can be compared to a control or reference, to determine the overexpression or underexpression (or upregulation or downregulation) of a biomarker in a sample. In some embodiments, the control or reference level comprises the amount of a same biomarker, such as a miRNA, in a control sample from a subject that does not have or exhibit the condition or disease. In another embodiment, the control of reference levels comprises that of a housekeeping marker whose level is minimally affected, if at all, in different biological settings such as diseased versus non-diseased states. In yet another embodiment, the control or reference level comprises that of the level of the same marker in the same subject but in a sample taken at a different time point. Other types of controls are described herein.","Nucleic acid biomarkers include various RNA or DNA species. For example, the biomarker can be mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA), small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), ribosomal RNAS (rRNA), siRNA, transfer RNAs (tRNA), or shRNA. The DNA can be double-stranded DNA, single stranded DNA, complementary DNA, or noncoding DNA. miRNAs are short ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules which average about 22 nucleotides long. miRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences in the three prime untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTRs) of target messenger RNA transcripts (mRNAs), which can result in gene silencing. One miRNA may act upon 1000s of mRNAs. miRNAs play multiple roles in negative regulation, e.g., transcript degradation and sequestering, translational suppression, and may also have a role in positive regulation, e.g., transcriptional and translational activation. By affecting gene regulation, miRNAs can influence many biologic processes. Different sets of expressed miRNAs are found in different cell types and tissues.","Biomarkers for use with the invention further include peptides, polypeptides, or proteins, which terms are used interchangeably throughout unless otherwise noted. In some embodiments, the protein biomarker comprises its modification state, truncations, mutations, expression level (such as overexpression or underexpression as compared to a reference level), and\/or post-translational modifications, such as described above. In a non-limiting example, a biosignature for a disease can include a protein having a certain post-translational modification that is more prevalent in a sample associated with the disease than without.","A biosignature may include a number of the same type of biomarkers (e.g., two different microRNA species) or one or more of different types of biomarkers (e.g. mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, peptides, ligands, and antigens).","One or more biosignatures can comprise at least one biomarker selected from those listed in , -. A specific cell-of-origin biosignature may include one or more biomarkers.  depict tables which lists a number of disease or condition specific biomarkers that can be derived and analyzed from a vesicle. The biomarker can also be CD24, midkine, hepcidin, TMPRSS2-ERG, PCA-3, PSA, EGFR, EGFRvIII, BRAF variant, MET, cKit, PDGFR, Wnt, beta-catenin, K-ras, H-ras, N-ras, Raf, N-myc, c-myc, IGFR, PI3K, Akt, BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1, Tie-2, TEM-1, CD276, HER-2, HER-3, or HER-4. The biomarker can also be annexin V, CD63, Rab-5b, or caveolin, or a miRNA, such as let-7a; miR-15b; miR-16; miR-19b; miR-21; miR-26a; miR-27a; miR-92; miR-93; miR-320 or miR-20. The biomarker can also be of any gene or fragment thereof as disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO2009\/100029, such as those listed in Tables 3-15 therein.","Other biomarkers useful for assessment in methods and compositions disclosed herein include those associated with conditions or physiological states as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

A fusion gene is a hybrid gene created by the juxtaposition of two previously separate genes. This can occur by chromosomal translocation or inversion, deletion or via trans-splicing. The resulting fusion gene can cause abnormal temporal and spatial expression of genes, such as leading to abnormal expression of cell growth factors, angiogenesis factors, tumor promoters or other factors contributing to the neoplastic transformation of the cell and the creation of a tumor. Such fusion genes can be oncogenic due to the juxtaposition of: 1) a strong promoter region of one gene next to the coding region of a cell growth factor, tumor promoter or other gene promoting oncogenesis leading to elevated gene expression, or 2) due to the fusion of coding regions of two different genes, giving rise to a chimeric gene and thus a chimeric protein with abnormal activity.","An example of a fusion gene is BCR-ABL, a characteristic molecular aberration in \u02dc90% of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and in a subset of acute leukemias (Kurzrock et al., 2003; 138(10):819-830). The BCR-ABL results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The translocation brings together the 5\u2032 region of the BCR gene and the 3\u2032 region of ABL1, generating a chimeric BCR-ABL1 gene, which encodes a protein with constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity (Mittleman et al., Nature 2007; 7(4):233-245). The aberrant tyrosine kinase activity leads to de-regulated cell signaling, cell growth and cell survival, apoptosis resistance and growth factor independence, all of which contribute to the pathophysiology of leukemia (Kurzrock et al., 2003; 138(10):819-830).","Another fusion gene is IGH-MYC, a defining feature of \u02dc80% of Burkitt's lymphoma (Ferry et al. 2006; 11(4):375-83). The causal event for this is a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14, bringing the c-Myc oncogene adjacent to the strong promoter of the immunoglobin heavy chain gene, causing c-myc overexpression (Mittleman et al., 2007; 7(4):233-245). The c-myc rearrangement is a pivotal event in lymphomagenesis as it results in a perpetually proliferative state. It has wide ranging effects on progression through the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion (Ferry et al. 2006; 11(4):375-83).","A number of recurrent fusion genes have been catalogued in the Mittleman database (cgap.nci.nih.gov\/Chromosomes\/Mitelman) and can be assessed in a vesicle, and used to characterize a phenotype. The gene fusion can be used to characterize a hematological malignancy or epithelial tumor. For example, TMPRSS2-ERG, TMPRSS2-ETV and SLC45A3-ELK4 fusions can be detected and used to characterize prostate cancer; and ETV6-NTRK3 and ODZ4-NRG1 for breast cancer.","Furthermore, assessing the presence or absence, or expression level of a fusion gene can be used to diagnosis a phenotype such as a cancer as well as a monitoring a therapeutic response to selecting a treatment. For example, the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene is a characteristic not only for the diagnosis of CML, but is also the target of the Novartis drug Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of CML. Imatinib treatment has led to molecular responses (disappearance of BCR-ABL+ blood cells) and improved progression-free survival in BCR-ABL+CML patients (Kantarjian et al., 2007; 13(4): 1089-1097).","Assessing a vesicle for the presence, absence, or expression level of a gene fusion can be of by assessing a heterogeneous population of vesicles for the presence, absence, or expression level of a gene fusion. Alternatively, the vesicle that is assessed can be derived from a specific cell type, such as cell-of-origin specific vesicle, as described above.

For example, one or more of the following miRs: miR-21, miR-17-5p, miR-191, miR-29b-2, miR-223, miR-128b, miR-199a-1, miR-24-1, miR-24-2, miR-146, miR-155, miR-181b-1, miR-20a, miR-107, miR-32, miR-92-2, miR-214, miR-30c, miR-25, miR-221, and miR-106a, can be detected in a vesicle and used to characterize a solid cancer.","Other examples of microRNAs that can be detected in a vesicle are disclosed in PCT Publication Nos. WO2006126040, WO2006033020, WO2005116250, and WO2005111211, US Publications Nos. US20070042982 and US20080318210; and EP Publication Nos. EP1784501A2 and EP1751311A2, each of which is incorporated by reference.","Biomarker Detection","A biosignature can be detected qualitatively or quantitatively by detecting a presence, level or concentration of a microRNA, vesicle or other biomarkers, as disclosed herein. These biosignature components can be detected using a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, a biomarker can be detected by microarray analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (including PCR-based methods such as real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR\/qPCR) and the like), hybridization with allele-specific probes, enzymatic mutation detection, ligation chain reaction (LCR), oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), flow-cytometric heteroduplex analysis, chemical cleavage of mismatches, mass spectrometry, nucleic acid sequencing, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), restriction fragment polymorphisms, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), or combinations thereof. A biomarker, such as a nucleic acid, can be amplified prior to detection. A biomarker can also be detected by immunoassay, immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), flow cytometry, or electron microscopy (EM).","Biosignatures can be detected using capture agents and detection agents, as described herein. A capture agent can comprise an antibody, aptamer or other entity which recognizes a biomarker and can be used for capturing the biomarker. Biomarkers that can be captured include circulating biomarkers, e.g., a protein, nucleic acid, lipid or biological complex in solution in a bodily fluid. Similarly, the capture agent can be used for capturing a vesicle. A detection agent can comprise an antibody or other entity which recognizes a biomarker and can be used for detecting the biomarker vesicle, or which recognizes a vesicle and is useful for detecting a vesicle. In some embodiments, the detection agent is labeled and the label is detected, thereby detecting the biomarker or vesicle. The detection agent can be a binding agent, e.g., an antibody or aptamer. In other embodiments, the detection agent comprises a small molecule such as a membrane protein labeling agent. See, e.g., the membrane protein labeling agents disclosed in Alroy et al., US. Patent Publication US 2005\/0158708. In an embodiment, vesicles are isolated or captured as described herein, and one or more membrane protein labeling agent is used to detect the vesicles. In many cases, the antigen or other vesicle-moiety that is recognized by the capture and detection agents are interchangeable. As a non-limiting example, consider a vesicle having a cell-of-origin specific antigen on its surface and a cancer-specific antigen on its surface. In one instance, the vesicle can be captured using an antibody to the cell-of-origin specific antigen, e.g., by tethering the capture antibody to a substrate, and then the vesicle is detected using an antibody to the cancer-specific antigen, e.g., by labeling the detection antibody with a fluorescent dye and detecting the fluorescent radiation emitted by the dye. In another instance, the vesicle can be captured using an antibody to the cancer specific antigen, e.g., by tethering the capture antibody to a substrate, and then the vesicle is detected using an antibody to the cell-of-origin specific antigen, e.g., by labeling the detection antibody with a fluorescent dye and detecting the fluorescent radiation emitted by the dye.","In some embodiments, a same biomarker is recognized by both a capture agent and a detection agent. This scheme can be used depending on the setting. In one embodiment, the biomarker is sufficient to detect a vesicle of interest, e.g., to capture cell-of-origin specific vesicles. In other embodiments, the biomarker is multifunctional, e.g., having both cell-of-origin specific and cancer specific properties. The biomarker can be used in concert with other biomarkers for capture and detection as well.","One method of detecting a biomarker comprises purifying or isolating a heterogeneous population of vesicles from a biological sample, as described above, and performing a sandwich assay. A vesicle in the population can be captured with a capture agent. The capture agent can be a capture antibody, such as a primary antibody. The capture antibody can be bound to a substrate, for example an array, well, or particle. The captured or bound vesicle can be detected with a detection agent, such as a detection antibody. For example, the detection antibody can be for an antigen of the vesicle. The detection antibody can be directly labeled and detected. Alternatively, the detection agent can be indirectly labeled and detected, such as through an enzyme linked secondary antibody that can react with the detection agent. A detection reagent or detection substrate can be added and the reaction detected, such as described in PCT Publication No. WO2009092386. In an illustrative example wherein the capture agent binds Rab-5b and the detection agent binds or detects CD63 or caveolin-1, the capture agent can be an anti-Rab 5b antibody and the detection agent can be an anti-CD63 or anti-caveolin-1 antibody. In some embodiments, the capture agent binds CD9, PSCA, TNFR, CD63, B7H3, MFG-E8, EpCam, Rab, CD81, STEAP, PCSA, PSMA, or 5T4. For example, the capture agent can be an antibody to CD9, PSCA, TNFR, CD63, B7H3, MFG-E8, EpCam, Rab, CD81, STEAP, PCSA, PSMA, or 5T4. The capture agent can also be an antibody to MFG-E8, Annexin V, Tissue Factor, DR3, STEAP, epha2, TMEM211, unc93A, A33, CD24, NGAL, EpCam, MUC17, TROP2, or TETS. The detection agent can be an agent that binds or detects CD63, CD9, CD81, B7H3, or EpCam, such as a detection antibody to CD63, CD9, CD81, B7H3, or EpCam. Various combinations of capture and\/or detection agents can be used in concert. In an embodiment, the capture agents comprise PCSA, PSMA, B7H3 and optionally EpCam, and the detection agents comprise one or more tetraspanin such as CD9, CD63 and CD81. In another embodiment, the capture agents comprise TMEM211 and CD24, and the detection agents comprise one or more tetraspanin such as CD9, CD63 and CD81. In another embodiment, the capture agents comprise CD66 and EpCam, and the detection agents comprise one or more tetraspanin such as CD9, CD63 and CD81. Increasing numbers of such tetraspanins and\/or other general vesicle markers can improve the detection signal in some cases. Proteins or other circulating biomarkers can also be detected using sandwich approaches. The captured vesicles can be collected and used to analyze the payload contained therein, e.g., mRNA, microRNAs, DNA and soluble protein.","In some embodiments, the capture agent binds or targets EpCam, B7H3 or CD24, and the one or more biomarkers detected on the vesicle are CD9 and\/or CD63. In one embodiment, the capture agent binds or targets EpCam, and the one or more biomarkers detected on the vesicle are CD9, EpCam and\/or CD81. The single capture agent can be selected from CD9, PSCA, TNFR, CD63, B7H3, MFG-E8, EpCam, Rab, CD81, STEAP, PCSA, PSMA, or 5T4. The single capture agent can also be an antibody to DR3, STEAP, epha2, TMEM211, unc93A, A33, CD24, NGAL, EpCam, MUC17, TROP2, MFG-E8, TF, Annexin V or TETS. In some embodiments, the single capture agent is selected from PCSA, PSMA, B7H3, CD81, CD9 and CD63.","In other embodiments, the capture agent targets PCSA, and the one or more biomarkers detected on the captured vesicle are B7H3 and\/or PSMA. In other embodiments, the capture agent targets PSMA, and the one or more biomarkers detected on the captured vesicle are B7H3 and\/or PCSA. In other embodiments, the capture agent targets B7H3, and the one or more biomarkers detected on the captured vesicle are PSMA and\/or PCSA. In yet other embodiments, the capture agent targets CD63 and the one or more biomarkers detected on the vesicle are CD81, CD83, CD9 and\/or CD63. The different capture agent and biomarker combinations disclosed herein can be used to characterize a phenotype, such as detecting, diagnosing or prognosing a disease, e.g., a cancer. In some embodiments, vesicles are analyzed to characterize prostate cancer using a capture agent targeting EpCam and detection of CD9 and CD63; a capture agent targeting PCSA and detection of B7H3 and PSMA; or a capture agent of CD63 and detection of CD81. In other embodiments, vesicles are used to characterize colon cancer using capture agent targeting CD63 and detection of CD63, or a capture agent targeting CD9 coupled with detection of CD63. One of skill will appreciate that targets of capture agents and detection agents can be used interchangeably. In an illustrative example, consider a capture agent targeting PCSA and detection agents targeting B7H3 and PSMA. Because all of these markers are useful for detecting PCa derived vesicles, B7H3 or PSMA could be targeted by the capture agent and PCSA could be recognized by a detection agent. For example, in some embodiments, the detection agent targets PCSA, and one or more biomarkers used to capture the vesicle comprise B7H3 and\/or PSMA. In other embodiments, the detection agent targets PSMA, and the one or more biomarkers used to capture the vesicle comprise B7H3 and\/or PCSA. In other embodiments, the detection agent targets B7H3, and the one or more biomarkers used to capture the vesicle comprise PSMA and\/or PCSA. In some embodiments, the invention provides a method of detecting prostate cancer cells in bodily fluid using capture agents and\/or detection agents to PSMA, B7H3 and\/or PCSA. The bodily fluid can comprise blood, including serum or plasma. The bodily fluid can comprise ejaculate or sperm. In further embodiments, the methods of detecting prostate cancer further use capture agents and\/or detection agents to CD81, CD83, CD9 and\/or CD63. The method further provides a method of characterizing a GI disorder, comprising capturing vesicles with one or more of DR3, STEAP, epha2, TMEM211, unc93A, A33, CD24, NGAL, EpCam, MUC17, TROP2, and TETS, and detecting the captured vesicles with one or more general vesicle antigen, such as CD81, CD63 and\/or CD9. Additional agents can improve the test performance, e.g., improving test accuracy or AUC, either by providing additional biological discriminatory power and\/or by reducing experimental noise.","Techniques of detecting biomarkers for use with the invention include the use of a planar substrate such as an array (e.g., biochip or microarray), with molecules immobilized to the substrate as capture agents that facilitate the detection of a particular biosignature. The array can be provided as part of a kit for assaying one or more biomarkers or vesicles. A molecule that identifies the biomarkers described above and shown in , as well as antigens in , can be included in an array for detection and diagnosis of diseases including presymptomatic diseases. In some embodiments, an array comprises a custom array comprising biomolecules selected to specifically identify biomarkers of interest. Customized arrays can be modified to detect biomarkers that increase statistical performance, e.g., additional biomolecules that identifies a biosignature which lead to improved cross-validated error rates in multivariate prediction models (e.g., logistic regression, discriminant analysis, or regression tree models). In some embodiments, customized array(s) are constructed to study the biology of a disease, condition or syndrome and profile biosignatures in defined physiological states. Markers for inclusion on the customized array be chosen based upon statistical criteria, e.g., having a desired level of statistical significance in differentiating between phenotypes or physiological states. In some embodiments, standard significance of p-value=0.05 is chosen to exclude or include biomolecules on the microarray. The p-values can be corrected for multiple comparisons. As an illustrative example, nucleic acids extracted from samples from a subject with or without a disease can be hybridized to a high density microarray that binds to thousands of gene sequences. Nucleic acids whose levels are significantly different between the samples with or without the disease can be selected as biomarkers to distinguish samples as having the disease or not. A customized array can be constructed to detect the selected biomarkers. In some embodiments, customized arrays comprise low density microarrays, which refer to arrays with lower number of addressable binding agents, e.g., tens or hundreds instead of thousands. Low density arrays can be formed on a substrate. In some embodiments, customizable low density arrays use PCR amplification in plate wells, e.g., TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.).","A planar array generally contains addressable locations (e.g., pads, addresses, or micro-locations) of biomolecules in an array format. The size of the array will depend on the composition and end use of the array. Arrays can be made containing from 2 different molecules to many thousands. Generally, the array comprises from two to as many as 100,000 or more molecules, depending on the end use of the array and the method of manufacture. A microarray for use with the invention comprises at least one biomolecule that identifies or captures a biomarker present in a biosignature of interest, e.g., a microRNA or other biomolecule or vesicle that makes up the biosignature. In some arrays, multiple substrates are used, either of different or identical compositions. Accordingly, planar arrays may comprise a plurality of smaller substrates.","The present invention can make use of many types of arrays for detecting a biomarker, e.g., a biomarker associated with a biosignature of interest. Useful arrays or microarrays include without limitation DNA microarrays, such as cDNA microarrays, oligonucleotide microarrays and SNP microarrays, microRNA arrays, protein microarrays, antibody microarrays, tissue microarrays, cellular microarrays (also called transfection microarrays), chemical compound microarrays, and carbohydrate arrays (glycoarrays). These arrays are described in more detail above. In some embodiments, microarrays comprise biochips that provide high-density immobilized arrays of recognition molecules (e.g., antibodies), where biomarker binding is monitored indirectly (e.g., via fluorescence).  shows an illustrative configuration in which capture antibodies against a vesicle antigen of interest are tethered to a surface. The captured vesicles are then detected using detector antibodies against the same or different vesicle antigens of interest. The capture antibodies can be substituted with tethered aptamers as available and desirable. Fluorescent detectors are shown. Other detectors can be used similarly, e.g., enzymatic reaction, detectable nanoparticles, radiolabels, and the like. In other embodiments, an array comprises a format that involves the capture of proteins by biochemical or intermolecular interaction, coupled with detection by mass spectrometry (MS). The vesicles can be eluted from the surface and the payload therein, e.g., microRNA, can be analyzed.","An array or microarray that can be used to detect one or more biomarkers of a biosignature can be made according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,329,209; 6,365,418; 6,406,921; 6,475,808; and 6,475,809, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/884,269, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Custom arrays to detect specific selections of sets of biomarkers described herein can be made using the methods described in these patents. Commercially available microarrays can also be used to carry out the methods of the invention, including without limitation those from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, Calif.), Illumina (San Diego, Calif.), Agilent (Santa Clara, Calif.), Exiqon (Denmark), or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.). Custom and\/or commercial arrays include arrays for detection proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological molecules and entities (e.g., cells, vesicles, virii) as described herein.","In some embodiments, molecules to be immobilized on an array comprise proteins or peptides. One or more types of proteins may be immobilized on a surface. In certain embodiments, the proteins are immobilized using methods and materials that minimize the denaturing of the proteins, that minimize alterations in the activity of the proteins, or that minimize interactions between the protein and the surface on which they are immobilized.","Array surfaces useful may be of any desired shape, form, or size. Non-limiting examples of surfaces include chips, continuous surfaces, curved surfaces, flexible surfaces, films, plates, sheets, or tubes. Surfaces can have areas ranging from approximately a square micron to approximately 500 cm. The area, length, and width of surfaces may be varied according to the requirements of the assay to be performed. Considerations may include, for example, ease of handling, limitations of the material(s) of which the surface is formed, requirements of detection systems, requirements of deposition systems (e.g., arrayers), or the like.","In certain embodiments, it is desirable to employ a physical means for separating groups or arrays of binding islands or immobilized biomolecules: such physical separation facilitates exposure of different groups or arrays to different solutions of interest. Therefore, in certain embodiments, arrays are situated within microwell plates having any number of wells. In such embodiments, the bottoms of the wells may serve as surfaces for the formation of arrays, or arrays may be formed on other surfaces and then placed into wells. In certain embodiments, such as where a surface without wells is used, binding islands may be formed or molecules may be immobilized on a surface and a gasket having holes spatially arranged so that they correspond to the islands or biomolecules may be placed on the surface. Such a gasket is preferably liquid tight. A gasket may be placed on a surface at any time during the process of making the array and may be removed if separation of groups or arrays is no longer necessary.","In some embodiments, the immobilized molecules can bind to one or more biomarkers or vesicles present in a biological sample contacting the immobilized molecules. In some embodiments, the immobilized molecules modify or are modified by molecules present in the one or more vesicles contacting the immobilized molecules. Contacting the sample typically comprises overlaying the sample upon the array.","Modifications or binding of molecules in solution or immobilized on an array can be detected using detection techniques known in the art. Examples of such techniques include immunological techniques such as competitive binding assays and sandwich assays; fluorescence detection using instruments such as confocal scanners, confocal microscopes, or CCD-based systems and techniques such as fluorescence, fluorescence polarization (FP), fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS); colorimetric\/spectrometric techniques; surface plasmon resonance, by which changes in mass of materials adsorbed at surfaces are measured; techniques using radioisotopes, including conventional radioisotope binding and scintillation proximity assays (SPA); mass spectroscopy, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI) and MALDI-time of flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy; ellipsometry, which is an optical method of measuring thickness of protein films; quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), a very sensitive method for measuring mass of materials adsorbing to surfaces; scanning probe microscopies, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning force microscopy (SFM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM); and techniques such as electrochemical, impedance, acoustic, microwave, and IR\/Raman detection. See, e.g., Mere L, et al., \u201c--4(8):363-369 (1999), and references cited therein; Lakowicz J R, 2(1999), or Jain K K: 12007, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Microarray technology can be combined with mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis and other tools. Electrospray interface to a mass spectrometer can be integrated with a capillary in a microfluidics device. For example, one commercially available system contains eTag reporters that are fluorescent labels with unique and well-defined electrophoretic mobilities; each label is coupled to biological or chemical probes via cleavable linkages. The distinct mobility address of each eTag reporter allows mixtures of these tags to be rapidly deconvoluted and quantitated by capillary electrophoresis. This system allows concurrent gene expression, protein expression, and protein function analyses from the same sample Jain K K: 12007, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","A biochip can include components for a microfluidic or nanofluidic assay. A microfluidic device can be used for isolating or analyzing biomarkers, such as determining a biosignature. Microfluidic systems allow for the miniaturization and compartmentalization of one or more processes for isolating, capturing or detecting a vesicle, detecting a microRNA, detecting a circulating biomarker, detecting a biosignature, and other processes. The microfluidic devices can use one or more detection reagents in at least one aspect of the system, and such a detection reagent can be used to detect one or more biomarkers. In one embodiment, the device detects a biomarker on an isolated or bound vesicle. Various probes, antibodies, proteins, or other binding agents can be used to detect a biomarker within the microfluidic system. The detection agents may be immobilized in different compartments of the microfluidic device or be entered into a hybridization or detection reaction through various channels of the device.","A vesicle in a microfluidic device can be lysed and its contents detected within the microfluidic device, such as proteins or nucleic acids, e.g., DNA or RNA such as miRNA or mRNA. The nucleic acid may be amplified prior to detection, or directly detected, within the microfluidic device. Thus microfluidic system can also be used for multiplexing detection of various biomarkers. In an embodiment, vesicles are captured within the microfluidic device, the captured vesicles are lysed, and a biosignature of microRNA from the vesicle payload is determined. The biosignature can further comprise the capture agent used to capture the vesicle.","Novel nanofabrication techniques are opening up the possibilities for biosensing applications that rely on fabrication of high-density, precision arrays, e.g., nucleotide-based chips and protein arrays otherwise know as heterogeneous nanoarrays. Nanofluidics allows a further reduction in the quantity of fluid analyte in a microchip to nanoliter levels, and the chips used here are referred to as nanochips. (See, e.g., Unger M et al., 1999; 27(5):1008-14, Kartalov E P et al., 2006; 40(1):85-90, each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.) Commercially available nanochips currently provide simple one step assays such as total cholesterol, total protein or glucose assays that can be run by combining sample and reagents, mixing and monitoring of the reaction. Gel-free analytical approaches based on liquid chromatography (LC) and nanoLC separations (2005; 5:101-112 and 2005; 4:1038-1051, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) can be used in combination with the nanochips.","Further provided herein is a rapid detection device that facilitates the detection of a particular biosignature in a biological sample. The device can integrate biological sample preparation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a chip. The device can facilitate the detection of a particular biosignature of a vesicle in a biological sample, and an example is provided as described in 47(21), p. 3900-3904 (2008), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A biosignature can be incorporated using micro-\/nano-electrochemical system (MEMS\/NEMS) sensors and oral fluid for diagnostic applications as described in Li et al., 18(1): 3-5 (2005), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","As an alternative to planar arrays, assays using particles, such as bead based assays as described herein, can be used in combination with flow cytometry. Multiparametric assays or other high throughput detection assays using bead coatings with cognate ligands and reporter molecules with specific activities consistent with high sensitivity automation can be used. In a bead based assay system, a binding agent for a biomarker or vesicle, such as a capture agent (e.g. capture antibody), can be immobilized on an addressable microsphere. Each binding agent for each individual binding assay can be coupled to a distinct type of microsphere (i.e., microbead) and the assay reaction takes place on the surface of the microsphere, such as depicted in . A binding agent for a vesicle can be a capture antibody coupled to a bead. Dyed microspheres with discrete fluorescence intensities are loaded separately with their appropriate binding agent or capture probes. The different bead sets carrying different binding agents can be pooled as necessary to generate custom bead arrays. Bead arrays are then incubated with the sample in a single reaction vessel to perform the assay. Examples of microfluidic devices that may be used, or adapted for use with the invention, include but are not limited to those described herein.","Product formation of the biomarker with an immobilized capture molecule or binding agent can be detected with a fluorescence based reporter system (see for example, ). The biomarker can either be labeled directly by a fluorophore or detected by a second fluorescently labeled capture biomolecule. The signal intensities derived from captured biomarkers can be measured in a flow cytometer. The flow cytometer can first identify each microsphere by its individual color code. For example, distinct beads can be dyed with discrete fluorescence intensities such that each bead with a different intensity has a different binding agent. The beads can be labeled or dyed with at least 2 different labels or dyes. In some embodiments, the beads are labeled with at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 different labels. The beads with more than one label or dye can also have various ratios and combinations of the labels or dyes. The beads can be labeled or dyed externally or may have intrinsic fluorescence or signaling labels.","The amount of captured biomarkers on each individual bead can be measured by the second color fluorescence specific for the bound target. This allows multiplexed quantitation of multiple targets from a single sample within the same experiment. Sensitivity, reliability and accuracy are compared or can be improved to standard microtiter ELISA procedures. An advantage of a bead-based system is the individual coupling of the capture biomolecule or binding agent for a vesicle to distinct microspheres provides multiplexing capabilities. For example, as depicted in , a combination of 5 different biomarkers to be detected (detected by antibodies to antigens such as CD63, CD9, CD81, B7H3, and EpCam) and 20 biomarkers for which to capture a vesicle, (using capture antibodies, such as antibodies to CD9, PSCA, TNFR, CD63, B7H3, MFG-E8, EpCam, Rab, CD81, STEAP, PCSA, PSMA, 5T4, and\/or CD24) can result in approximately 100 combinations to be detected. As shown in  as \u201cEpCam 2x,\u201d \u201cCD63 2X,\u201d multiple antibodies to a single target can be used to probe detection against various epitopes. In another example, multiplex analysis comprises capturing a vesicle using a binding agent to CD24 and detecting the captured vesicle using a binding agent for CD9, CD63, and\/or CD81. The captured vesicles can be detected using a detection agent such as an antibody. The detection agents can be labeled directly or indirectly, as described herein.","Multiplexing of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75 or 100 different biomarkers may be performed. For example, an assay of a heterogeneous population of vesicles can be performed with a plurality of particles that are differentially labeled. There can be at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75 or 100 differentially labeled particles. The particles may be externally labeled, such as with a tag, or they may be intrinsically labeled. Each differentially labeled particle can be coupled to a capture agent, such as a binding agent, for a vesicle, resulting in capture of a vesicle. The multiple capture agents can be selected to characterize a phenotype of interest, including capture agents against general vesicle biomarkers, cell-of-origin specific biomarkers, and disease biomarkers. One or more biomarkers of the captured vesicle can then be detected by a plurality of binding agents. The binding agent can be directly labeled to facilitate detection. Alternatively, the binding agent is labeled by a secondary agent. For example, the binding agent may be an antibody for a biomarker on the vesicle. The binding agent is linked to biotin. A secondary agent comprises streptavidin linked to a reporter and can be added to detect the biomarker. In some embodiments, the captured vesicle is assayed for at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75 or 100 different biomarkers. For example, multiple detectors, i.e., detection of multiple biomarkers of a captured vesicle or population of vesicles, can increase the signal obtained, permitted increased sensitivity, specificity, or both, and the use of smaller amounts of samples. For example, detection with more than one general vesicle marker can improve the signal as compared to using a lesser number of detection markers, such as a single marker. To illustrate, detection of vesicles with labeled binding agents to two or three of CD9, CD63 and CD81 can improve the signal compared to detection with any one of the tetraspanins individually.","An immunoassay based method or sandwich assay can also be used to detect a biomarker of a vesicle. An example includes ELISA. A binding agent or capture agent can be bound to a well. For example an antibody to an antigen of a vesicle can be attached to a well. A biomarker on the captured vesicle can be detected based on the methods described herein.  shows an illustrative schematic for a sandwich-type of immunoassay. The capture antibody can be against a vesicle antigen of interest, e.g., a general vesicle biomarker, a cell-of-origin marker, or a disease marker. In the figure, the captured vesicles are detected using fluorescently labeled antibodies against vesicle antigens of interest. Multiple capture antibodies can be used, e.g., in distinguishable addresses on an array or different wells of an immunoassay plate. The detection antibodies can be against the same antigen as the capture antibody, or can be directed against other markers. The capture antibodies can be substituted with alternate binding agents, such as tethered aptamers or lectins, and\/or the detector antibodies can be similarly substituted, e.g., with detectable (e.g., labeled) aptamers, lectins or other binding proteins or entities. In an embodiment, one or more capture agents to a general vesicle biomarker, a cell-of-origin marker, and\/or a disease marker are used along with detection agents against general vesicle biomarker, such as tetraspanin molecules including without limitation one or more of CD9, CD63 and CD81.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0780","num":"0779"},"figref":["FIG. 64D","FIG. 64D"],"b":["6400","6401","6402","6401","6403","6400","6401","6402","6403","6400","6402","6401","6402","6403","6400","6401","6402"]},"In the scheme shown in  ii), a population of vesicles is captured with one or more capture agents against cell-of-origin biomarkers () and\/or disease biomarkers ().

In some embodiments of the invention, the payload is analyzed in addition to detecting vesicle surface antigens. Specific populations of vesicles can be captured as described above then the payload in the captured vesicles can be used to characterize a phenotype. For example, vesicles captured on a substrate can be further isolated to assess the payload therein. Alternately, the vesicles in a sample are detected and sorted without capture. The vesicles so detected can be further isolated to assess the payload therein. In an embodiment, vesicle populations are sorted by flow cytometry and the payload in the sorted vesicles is analyzed. In the scheme shown in  iii), a population of vesicles is captured and\/or detected () using one or more of cell-of-origin biomarkers (), disease biomarkers (), and general vesicle markers (). The payload of the isolated vesicles is assessed (). A biosignature detected within the payload can be used to characterize a phenotype (). In a non-limiting example, a vesicle population can be analyzed in a plasma sample from a patient using antibodies against one or more vesicle antigens of interest. The antibodies can be capture antibodies which are tethered to a substrate to isolate a desired vesicle population. Alternately, the antibodies can be directly labeled and the labeled vesicles isolated by sorting with flow cytometry. The presence or level of microRNA or mRNA extracted from the isolated vesicle population can be used to detect a biosignature. The biosignature is then used to diagnose, prognose or theranose the patient.","In other embodiments, vesicle payload is analyzed in a vesicle population without first capturing or detected subpopulations of vesicles. For example, vesicles can be generally isolated from a sample using centrifugation, filtration, chromatography, or other techniques as described herein. The payload of the isolated vesicles can be analyzed thereafter to detect a biosignature and characterize a phenotype. In the scheme shown in  iv), a population of vesicles is isolated () and the payload of the isolated vesicles is assessed (). A biosignature detected within the payload can be used to characterize a phenotype (). In a non-limiting example, a vesicle population is isolated from a plasma sample from a patient using size exclusion and membrane filtration. The presence or level of microRNA or mRNA extracted from the vesicle population is used to detect a biosignature. The biosignature is then used to diagnose, prognose or theranose the patient.","A peptide or protein biomarker can be analyzed by mass spectrometry or flow cytometry. Proteomic analysis of a vesicle may be carried out by immunocytochemical staining, Western blotting, electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, chromatography, x-ray crystallography or other protein analysis techniques in accordance with procedures well known in the art. In other embodiments, the protein biosignature of a vesicle may be analyzed using 2 D differential gel electrophoresis as described in, Chromy et al. , 2004; 3: 1120-1127, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, or with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry as described in Zhang et al. 2005; 4:144-155, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A vesicle may be subjected to activity-based protein profiling described for example, in Berger et al., 2004; 4:371-381, which is in incorporated by reference in its entirety. In other embodiments, a vesicle may be profiled using nanospray liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as described in Pisitkun et al., 2004; 101: 13368-13373, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment, the vesicle may be profiled using tandem mass spectrometry (MS) such as liquid chromatography\/MS\/MS (LC-MS\/MS) using for example a LTQ and LTQ-FT ion trap mass spectrometer. Protein identification can be determined and relative quantitation can be assessed by comparing spectral counts as described in Smalley et al., 2008; 7:2088-2096, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The expression of circulating protein biomarkers or protein payload within a vesicle can also be identified. The latter analysis can optionally follow the isolation of specific vesicles using capture agents to capture populations of interest. In an embodiment, immunocytochemical staining is used to analyze protein expression. The sample can be resuspended in buffer, centrifuged at 100\u00d7g for example, for 3 minutes using a cytocentrifuge on adhesive slides in preparation for immunocytochemical staining. The cytospins can be air-dried overnight and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until staining. Slides can then be fixed and blocked with serum-free blocking reagent. The slides can then be incubated with a specific antibody to detect the expression of a protein of interest. In some embodiments, the vesicles are not purified, isolated or concentrated prior to protein expression analysis.","Biosignatures comprising vesicle payload can be characterized by analysis of a metabolite marker or metabolite within the vesicle. Various metabolite-oriented approaches have been described such as metabolite target analyses, metabolite profiling, or metabolic fingerprinting, see for example, Denkert et al., 2008; 7: 4598-4617, Ellis et al., 2006; 8: 875-885, Kuhn et al., 2007; 24: 7401-7406, Fiehn 02001; 2:155-168, Fancy et al., 20(15): 2271-80 (2006), Lindon et al., 23(6): 1075-88 (2006), Holmes et al., 2007 April 1; 79(7):2629-402007 February 272008 August 1; 80(15):6142-3, Stanley et al., 2005 August 15; 343(2): 195-202., Lehtimaki et al., 2003 November 14; 278(46):45915-23, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Peptides can be analyzed by systems described in Jain K K: 12007, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Other methods are described in U.S. Patent Application No. 20050208510, 20050277121, 20070238118, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In one embodiment, mRNA expression analysis can be carried out on mRNAs from a vesicle isolated from a sample. In some embodiments, the vesicle is a cell-of-origin specific vesicle. An expression pattern generated from a vesicle can be indicative of a given disease state, disease stage, therapy related signature, or physiological condition.","In one embodiment, once the total RNA has been isolated, cDNA can be synthesized and either qRT-PCR assays (e.g. Applied Biosystem's Taqman\u00ae assays) for specific mRNA targets can be performed according to manufacturer's protocol, or an expression microarray can be performed to look at highly multiplexed sets of expression markers in one experiment. Methods for establishing gene expression profiles include determining the amount of RNA that is produced by a gene that can code for a protein or peptide. This can be accomplished by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), competitive RT-PCR, real time RT-PCR, differential display RT-PCR, Northern Blot analysis or other related tests. While it is possible to conduct these techniques using individual PCR reactions, it is also possible to amplify complementary DNA (cDNA) or complementary RNA (cRNA) produced from mRNA and analyze it via microarray.","The level of a miRNA product in a sample can be measured using any appropriate technique that is suitable for detecting mRNA expression levels in a biological sample, including but not limited to Northern blot analysis, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization or microarray analysis. For example, using gene specific primers and target cDNA, qRT-PCR enables sensitive and quantitative miRNA measurements of either a small number of target miRNAs (via singleplex and multiplex analysis) or the platform can be adopted to conduct high throughput measurements using 96-well or 384-well plate formats. See for example, Ross J S et al, Oncologist. 2008 May; 13(5):477-93, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A number of different array configurations and methods for microarray production are known to those of skill in the art and are described in U.S. patents such as: U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, arrays of microRNA panels are use to simultaneously query the expression of multiple miRs. The Exiqon mIRCURY LNA microRNA PCR system panel (Exiqon, Inc., Woburn, Mass.) or the TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Assays and Arrays systems from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) can be used for such purposes.","Microarray technology allows for the measurement of the steady-state mRNA or miRNA levels of thousands of transcripts or miRNAs simultaneously thereby presenting a powerful tool for identifying effects such as the onset, arrest, or modulation of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Two microarray technologies, such as cDNA arrays and oligonucleotide arrays can be used. The product of these analyses are typically measurements of the intensity of the signal received from a labeled probe used to detect a cDNA sequence from the sample that hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence at a known location on the microarray. Typically, the intensity of the signal is proportional to the quantity of cDNA, and thus mRNA or miRNA, expressed in the sample cells. A large number of such techniques are available and useful. Methods for determining gene expression can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,002 to Linsley, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,122 to Friend, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,114 to Peck et al.; or U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,755 to Wang, et al., each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Analysis of an expression level can be conducted by comparing such intensities. This can be performed by generating a ratio matrix of the expression intensities of genes in a test sample versus those in a control sample. The control sample may be used as a reference, and different references to account for age, ethnicity and sex may be used. Different references can be used for different conditions or diseases, as well as different stages of diseases or conditions, as well as for determining therapeutic efficacy.","For instance, the gene expression intensities of mRNA or miRNAs derived from a diseased tissue, including those isolated from vesicles, can be compared with the expression intensities of the same entities in normal tissue of the same type (e.g., diseased breast tissue sample versus normal breast tissue sample). A ratio of these expression intensities indicates the fold-change in gene expression between the test and control samples. Alternatively, if vesicles are not normally present in from normal tissues (e.g. breast) then absolute quantitation methods, as is known in the art, can be used to define the number of miRNA molecules present without the requirement of miRNA or mRNA isolated from vesicles derived from normal tissue.","Gene expression profiles can also be displayed in a number of ways. A common method is to arrange raw fluorescence intensities or ratio matrix into a graphical dendogram where columns indicate test samples and rows indicate genes. The data is arranged so genes that have similar expression profiles are proximal to each other. The expression ratio for each gene is visualized as a color. For example, a ratio less than one (indicating down-regulation) may appear in the blue portion of the spectrum while a ratio greater than one (indicating up-regulation) may appear as a color in the red portion of the spectrum. Commercially available computer software programs are available to display such data.","mRNAs or miRNAs that are considered differentially expressed can be either over expressed or under expressed in patients with a disease relative to disease free individuals. Over and under expression are relative terms meaning that a detectable difference (beyond the contribution of noise in the system used to measure it) is found in the amount of expression of the mRNAs or miRNAs relative to some baseline. In this case, the baseline is the measured mRNA\/miRNA expression of a non-diseased individual. The mRNA\/miRNA of interest in the diseased cells can then be either over or under expressed relative to the baseline level using the same measurement method. Diseased, in this context, refers to an alteration of the state of a body that interrupts or disturbs, or has the potential to disturb, proper performance of bodily functions as occurs with the uncontrolled proliferation of cells. Someone is diagnosed with a disease when some aspect of that person's genotype or phenotype is consistent with the presence of the disease. However, the act of conducting a diagnosis or prognosis includes the determination of disease\/status issues such as determining the likelihood of relapse or metastasis and therapy monitoring. In therapy monitoring, clinical judgments are made regarding the effect of a given course of therapy by comparing the expression of genes over time to determine whether the mRNA\/miRNA expression profiles have changed or are changing to patterns more consistent with normal tissue.","Levels of over and under expression are distinguished based on fold changes of the intensity measurements of hybridized microarray probes. A 2X difference is preferred for making such distinctions or a p-value less than 0.05. That is, before an mRNA\/miRNA is the to be differentially expressed in diseased\/relapsing versus normal\/non-relapsing cells, the diseased cell is found to yield at least 2 times more, or 2 times less intensity than the normal cells. The greater the fold difference, the more preferred is use of the gene as a diagnostic or prognostic tool. mRNA\/miRNAs selected for the expression profiles of the instant invention have expression levels that result in the generation of a signal that is distinguishable from those of the normal or non-modulated genes by an amount that exceeds background using clinical laboratory instrumentation.","Statistical values can be used to confidently distinguish modulated from non-modulated mRNA\/miRNA and noise. Statistical tests find the mRNA\/miRNA most significantly different between diverse groups of samples. The Student's t-test is an example of a robust statistical test that can be used to find significant differences between two groups. The lower the p-value, the more compelling the evidence that the gene shows a difference between the different groups. Nevertheless, since microarrays measure more than one mRNA\/miRNA at a time, tens of thousands of statistical tests may be performed at one time. Because of this, one is unlikely to see small p-values just by chance and adjustments for this using a Sidak correction as well as a randomization\/permutation experiment can be made. A p-value less than 0.05 by the t-test is evidence that the gene is significantly different. More compelling evidence is a p-value less then 0.05 after the Sidak correction is factored in. For a large number of samples in each group, a p-value less than 0.05 after the randomization\/permutation test is the most compelling evidence of a significant difference.","In one embodiment, a method of generating a posterior probability score to enable diagnostic, prognostic, therapy-related, or physiological state specific biosignature scores can be arrived at by obtaining mRNA or miRNA (biomarker) expression data from a statistically significant number of patients; applying linear discrimination analysis to the data to obtain selected biomarkers; and applying weighted expression levels to the selected biomarkers with discriminate function factor to obtain a prediction model that can be applied as a posterior probability score. Other analytical tools can also be used to answer the same question such as, logistic regression and neural network approaches.","For instance, the following can be used for linear discriminant analysis:","where,","I(pi)=The log base 2 intensity of the probe set enclosed in parenthesis. d(cp)=The discriminant function for the disease positive class d(C)=The discriminant function for the disease negative class","P()=The posterior p-value for the disease positive class","P()=The posterior p-value for the disease negative class","Numerous other well-known methods of pattern recognition are available. The following references provide some examples: : Golub et al. (1999); : Su et al. (2001); and Ramaswamy et al. (2001); -: Ramaswamy (2001); and : van't Veer et al. (2002), all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","A biosignature portfolio, further described below, can be established such that the combination of biomarkers in the portfolio exhibit improved sensitivity and specificity relative to individual biomarkers or randomly selected combinations of biomarkers. In one embodiment, the sensitivity of the biosignature portfolio can be reflected in the fold differences, for example, exhibited by a transcript's expression in the diseased state relative to the normal state. Specificity can be reflected in statistical measurements of the correlation of the signaling of transcript expression with the condition of interest. For example, standard deviation can be a used as such a measurement. In considering a group of biomarkers for inclusion in a biosignature portfolio, a small standard deviation in expression measurements correlates with greater specificity. Other measurements of variation such as correlation coefficients can also be used in this capacity.","Another parameter that can be used to select mRNA\/miRNA that generate a signal that is greater than that of the non-modulated mRNA\/miRNA or noise is the use of a measurement of absolute signal difference. The signal generated by the modulated mRNA\/miRNA expression is at least 20% different than those of the normal or non-modulated gene (on an absolute basis). It is even more preferred that such mRNA\/miRNA produce expression patterns that are at least 30% different than those of normal or non-modulated mRNA\/miRNA.","MiRNA can also be detected and measured by amplification from a biological sample and measured using methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,250,496, U.S. Application Publication Nos. 20070292878, 20070042380 or 20050222399 and references cited therein, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The microRNA can be assessed as in U.S. Pat. No. 7,888,035, entitled \u201cMETHODS FOR ASSESSING RNA PATTERNS,\u201d issued Feb. 15, 2011, which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) which are a new class of synthetic nucleic acid analogs in which the phosphate\u2014sugar polynucleotide backbone is replaced by a flexible pseudo-peptide polymer may be utilized in analysis of a biosignature. PNAs are capable of hybridizing with high affinity and specificity to complementary RNA and DNA sequences and are highly resistant to degradation by nucleases and proteinases. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are an attractive new class of probes with applications in cytogenetics for the rapid in situ identification of human chromosomes and the detection of copy number variation (CNV). Multicolor peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) protocols have been described for the identification of several human CNV-related disorders and infectious diseases. PNAs can also be utilized as molecular diagnostic tools to non-invasively measure oncogene mRNAs with tumor targeted radionuclide-PNA-peptide chimeras. Methods of using PNAs are described further in Pellestor F et al, 2008; 14(24):2439-44, Tian X et al, 2005 November; 1059: 106-44, Paulasova P and Pellestor F, , 47 (2004) 349-358, Stender H. 2003 September; 3(5):649-55, Vigneault et al., 5(9), 777-779 (2008), each reference is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. These methods can be used to screen the genetic materials isolated from a vesicle. When applying these techniques to a cell-of-origin specific vesicle, they can be used to identify a given molecular signal that directly pertains to the cell of origin.","Mutational analysis may be carried out for mRNAs and DNA, including those that are identified from a vesicle. For mutational analysis of a target or biomarker that is of RNA origin, the RNA (mRNA, miRNA or other) can be reverse transcribed into cDNA and subsequently sequenced or assayed, such as for known SNPs (by Taqman SNP assays, for example) or single nucleotide mutations, as well as using sequencing to look for insertions or deletions to determine mutations present in the cell-of-origin. Multiplexed ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) could alternatively be used for the purpose of identifying CNV in small and specific areas of interest. For example, once the total RNA has been obtained from isolated colon cancer-specific vesicles, cDNA can be synthesized and primers specific for exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene can be used to amplify these two exons containing codons 12, 13 and 61 of the KRAS gene. The same primers used for PCR amplification can be used for Big Dye Terminator sequence analysis on the ABI 3730 to identify mutations in exons 2 and 3 of KRAS. Mutations in these codons are known to confer resistance to drugs such as Cetuximab and Panitumimab. Methods of conducting mutational analysis are described in Maheswaran S et al, Jul. 2, 2008 (10.1056\/NEJMoa0800668) and Orita, M et al, 1989, (86): 2766-70, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Other methods of conducting mutational analysis include miRNA sequencing. Applications for identifying and profiling miRNAs can be done by cloning techniques and the use of capillary DNA sequencing or \u201cnext-generation\u201d sequencing technologies. The new sequencing technologies currently available allow the identification of low-abundance miRNAs or those exhibiting modest expression differences between samples, which may not be detected by hybridization-based methods. Such new sequencing technologies include the massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) methodology described in Nakano et al. 20062006; 34:D731-D735. doi: 10.1093\/nar\/gkj077, the Roche\/454 platform described in Margulies et al. 2005, Nature. 2005; 437:376-380 or the Illumina sequencing platform described in Berezikov et al.

DNA and RNA aptamers are short oligonucleotide sequences that can be selected from random pools based on their ability to bind a particular molecule with high affinity. Methods of using aptamers are described in Ulrich H et al, 2006 September; 9(8):619-32, Ferreira C S et al, 2008 February; 390(4):1039-50, Ferreira C S et al, 2006; 27(6):289-301, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Biomarkers can also be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Methods of using FISH to detect and localize specific DNA sequences, localize specific mRNAs within tissue samples or identify chromosomal abnormalities are described in Shaffer D R et al, Clin Cancer Res. 2007 April 1; 13(7):2023-9, Cappuzo F et al, 25, May 2007, Moroni M et al, 2005 May; 6(5):279-86, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","An illustrative schematic for analyzing a population of vesicles for their payload is presented in . In an embodiment, the methods of the invention include characterizing a phenotype by capturing vesicles () and determining a level of microRNA species contained therein (), thereby characterizing the phenotype ().","A biosignature comprising a circulating biomarker or vesicle can comprise a binding agent thereto. The binding agent can be a DNA, RNA, aptamer, monoclonal antibody, polyclonal antibody, Fabs, Fab\u2032, single chain antibody, synthetic antibody, aptamer (DNA\/RNA), peptoid, zDNA, peptide nucleic acid (PNA), locked nucleic acid (LNA), lectin, synthetic or naturally occurring chemical compounds (including but not limited to drugs and labeling reagents).","A binding agent can used to isolate or detect a vesicle by binding to a component of the vesicle, as described above. The binding agent can be used to detect a vesicle, such as for detecting a cell-of-origin specific vesicle. A binding agent or multiple binding agents can themselves form a binding agent profile that provides a biosignature for a vesicle. One or more binding agents can be selected from . For example, if a vesicle population is detected or isolated using two, three or four binding agents in a differential detection or isolation of a vesicle from a heterogeneous population of vesicles, the particular binding agent profile for the vesicle population provides a biosignature for the particular vesicle population.","As an illustrative example, a vesicle for characterizing a cancer can be detected with one or more binding agents including, but not limited to, PSA, PSMA, PCSA, PSCA, B7H3, EpCam, TMPRSS2, mAB 5D4, XPSM-A9, XPSM-A10, Galectin-3, E-selectin, Galectin-1, or E4 (IgG2a kappa), or any combination thereof.","The binding agent can also be for a general vesicle biomarker, such as a \u201chousekeeping protein\u201d or antigen. The biomarker can be CD9, CD63, or CD81. For example, the binding agent can be an antibody for CD9, CD63, or CD81. The binding agent can also be for other proteins, such as for tissue specific or cancer specific vesicles. The binding agent can be for PCSA, PSMA, EpCam, B7H3, or STEAP. The binding agent can be for DR3, STEAP, epha2, TMEM211, MFG-E8, Annexin V, TF, unc93A, A33, CD24, NGAL, EpCam, MUC17, TROP2, or TETS. For example, the binding agent can be an antibody or aptamer for PCSA, PSMA, EpCam, B7H3, DR3, STEAP, epha2, TMEM211, MFG-E8, Annexin V, TF, unc93A, A33, CD24, NGAL, EpCam, MUC17, TROP2, or TETS.","Various proteins are not typically distributed evenly or uniformly on a vesicle shell. See, e.g., , which illustrates a schematic of protein expression patterns. Vesicle-specific proteins are typically more common, while cancer-specific proteins are less common. In some embodiments, capture of a vesicle is accomplished using a more common, less cancer-specific protein, such as one or more housekeeping proteins or antigen or general vesicle antigen (e.g., a tetraspanin), and one or more cancer-specific biomarkers and\/or one or more cell-of-origin specific biomarkers is used in the detection phase. In another embodiment, one or more cancer-specific biomarkers and\/or one or more cell-of-origin specific biomarkers are used for capture, and one or more housekeeping proteins or antigen or general vesicle antigen (e.g., a tetraspanin) is used for detection.

For example, a cell or tissue-specific vesicle can be isolated using one or more binding agents specific for a particular organ. The cell-of-origin specific vesicle can be assessed for one or more molecular features, such as one or more biomarkers associated with organ distress or organ transplant rejection. The presence, absence or levels of one or more biomarkers present, can be assessed to monitor organ rejection or success.","One or more vesicles can be analyzed for the assessment, detection or diagnosis of the rejection of a tissue or organ transplant by a subject.

The biomarkers can be assessed using methods for multiplexed analysis of vesicle biomarkers disclosed herein. Characterizing a phenotype can include providing a theranosis for a subject, such as determining if a subject is predicted to respond to a treatment or is predicted to be non-responsive to a treatment. A subject that responds to a treatment can be termed a responder whereas a subject that does not respond can be termed a non-responder. A subject suffering from a condition can be considered to be a responder for a treatment based on, but not limited to, an improvement of one or more symptoms of the condition; a decrease in one or more side effects of an existing treatment; an increased improvement, or rate of improvement, in one or more symptoms as compared to a previous or other treatment; or prolonged survival as compared to without treatment or a previous or other treatment. For example, a subject suffering from a condition can be considered to be a responder to a treatment based on the beneficial or desired clinical results including, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, preventing spread of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment also includes prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment or if receiving a different treatment.","The systems and methods disclosed herein can be used to select a candidate treatment for a subject in need thereof. Selection of a therapy can be based on one or more characteristics of a vesicle, such as the biosignature of a vesicle, the amount of vesicles, or both. Vesicle typing or profiling, such as the identification of the biosignature of a vesicle, the amount of vesicles, or both, can be used to identify one or more candidate therapeutic agents for an individual suffering from a condition. For example, vesicle profiling can be used to determine if a subject is a non-responder or responder to a particular therapeutic, such as a cancer therapeutic if the subject is suffering from a cancer.","Vesicle profiling can be used to provide a diagnosis or prognosis for a subject, and a therapy can be selected based on the diagnosis or prognosis. Alternatively, therapy selection can be directly based on a subject's vesicle profile. Furthermore, a subject's vesicle profile can be used to follow the evolution of a disease, to evaluate the efficacy of a medication, adapt an existing treatment for a subject suffering from a disease or condition, or select a new treatment for a subject suffering from a disease or condition.","A subject's response to a treatment can be assessed using biomarkers, including vesicles, microRNA, and other circulating biomarkers. In one embodiment, a subject is determined, classified, or identified as a non-responder or responder based on the subject's vesicle profile assessed prior to any treatment. During pretreatment, a subject can be classifed as a non-responder or responder, thereby reducing unnecessary treatment options, and avoidance of possible side effects from ineffective therapeutics. Furthermore, the subject can be identified as a responder to a particular treatment, and thus vesicle profiling can be used to prolong survival of a subject, improve the subject's symptoms or condition, or both, by providing personalized treatment options. Thus, a subject suffering from a condition can have a biosignature generated from vesicles and other circulating biomarkers using one or more systems and methods disclosed herein, and the profile can then be used to determine whether a subject is a likely non-responder or responder to a particular treatment for the condition. Based on use of the biosignature to predict whether the subject is a non-responder or responder to the initially contemplated treatment, a particular treatment contemplated for treating the subject's condition can be selected for the subject, or another potentially more optimal treatment can be selected.","In one embodiment, a subject suffering from a condition is currently being treated with a therapeutic. A sample can be obtained from the subject before treatment and at one or more timepoints during treatment. A biosignature including vesicles or other biomarkers from the samples can be assessed and used to determine the subject's response to the drug, such as based on a change in the biosignature over time. If the subject is not responding to the treatment, e.g., the biosignature does not indicate that the patient is responding, the subject can be classified as being non-responsive to the treatment, or a non-responder. Similarly, one or more biomarkers associated with a worsening condition may be detected such that the biosignature is indicative of patient's failure to respond favorably to the treatment. In another example, one or more biomarkers associated with the condition remain the same despite treatment, indicating that the condition is not improving. Thus, based on the biosignature, a treatment regimen for the subject can be changed or adapted, including selection of a different therapeutic.","Alternatively, the subject can be determined to be responding to the treatment, and the subject can be classified as being responsive to the treatment, or a responder. For example, one or more biomarkers associated with an improvement in the condition or disorder may be detected. In another example, one or more biomarkers associated with the condition changes, thus indicating an improvement. Thus, the existing treatment can be continued. In another embodiment, even when there is an indication of improvement, the existing treatment may be adapted or changed if the biosignature indicates that another line of treatment may be more effective. The existing treatment may be combined with another therapeutic, the dosage of the current therapeutic may be increased, or a different candidate treatment or therapeutic may be selected. Criteria for selecting the different candidate treatment can depend on the setting. In one embodiment, the candidate treatment may have been known to be effective for subjects with success on the existing treatment. In another embodiment, the candidate treatment may have been known to be effective for other subjects with a similar biosignature.","In some embodiments, the subject is undergoing a second, third or more line of treatment, such as cancer treatment. A biosignature according to the invention can be determined for the subject prior to a second, third or more line of treatment, to determine whether a subject would be a responder or non-resonder to the second, third or more line of treatment. In another embodiment, a biosignature is determined for the subject during the second, third or more line of treatment, to determine if the subject is responding to the second, third or more line of treatment.","The methods and systems described herein for assessing one or more vesicles can be used to determine if a subject suffering from a condition is responsive to a treatment, and thus can be used to select a treatment that improves one or more symptoms of the condition; decreases one or more side effects of an existing treatment; increases the improvement, or rate of improvement, in one or more symptoms as compared to a previous or other treatment; or prolongs survival as compared to without treatment or a previous or other treatment. Thus, the methods described herein can be used to prolong survival of a subject by providing personalized treatment options, and\/or may reduce unnecessary treatment options and unnecessary side effects for a subject.","The prolonged survival can be an increased progression-free survival (PFS), which denotes the chances of staying free of disease progression for an individual or a group of individuals suffering from a disease, e.g., a cancer, after initiating a course of treatment. It can refer to the percentage of individuals in the group whose disease is likely to remain stable (e.g., not show signs of progression) after a specified duration of time. Progression-free survival rates are an indication of the effectiveness of a particular treatment. In other embodiments, the prolonged survival is disease-free survival (DFS), which denotes the chances of staying free of disease after initiating a particular treatment for an individual or a group of individuals suffering from a cancer. It can refer to the percentage of individuals in the group who are likely to be free of disease after a specified duration of time. Disease-free survival rates are an indication of the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Two treatment strategies can be compared on the basis of the disease-free survival that is achieved in similar groups of patients. Disease-free survival is often used with the term overall survival when cancer survival is described.","The candidate treatment selected by vesicle profiling as described herein can be compared to a non-vesicle profiling selected treatment by comparing the progression free survival (PFS) using therapy selected by vesicle profiling (period B) with PFS for the most recent therapy on which the subject has just progressed (period A). In one setting, a PFSB\/PFSA ratio >1.3 is used to indicate that the vesicle profiling selected therapy provides benefit for subject (see for example, Robert Temple, . Edited by Wu Ningano and G. T. Thicker John Wiley and Sons Ltd. 1995; Von Hoff D. D. 4: 1079, 1999: Dhani et al. 15: 118-123, 2009).","Other methods of comparing the treatment selected by vesicle profiling can be compared to a non-vesicle profiling selected treatment by determine response rate (RECIST) and percent of subjects without progression or death at 4 months. The term \u201cabout\u201d as used in the context of a numerical value for PFS means a variation of +\/\u2212 ten percent (10%) relative to the numerical value. The PFS from a treatment selected by vesicle profiling can be extended by at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or at least 90% as compared to a non-vesicle profiling selected treatment. In some embodiments, the PFS from a treatment selected by vesicle profiling can be extended by at least 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, or at least about 1000% as compared to a non-vesicle profiling selected treatment. In yet other embodiments, the PFS ratio (PFS on vesicle profiling selected therapy or new treatment\/PFS on prior therapy or treatment) is at least about 1.3. In yet other embodiments, the PFS ratio is at least about 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, or 2.0. In yet other embodiments, the PFS ratio is at least about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9 or 10.","Similarly, the DFS can be compared in subjects whose treatment is selected with or without determining a biosignature according to the invention. The DFS from a treatment selected by vesicle profiling can be extended by at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or at least 90% as compared to a non-vesicle profiling selected treatment. In some embodiments, the DFS from a treatment selected by vesicle profiling can be extended by at least 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, or at least about 1000% as compared to a non-vesicle profiling selected treatment. In yet other embodiments, the DFS ratio (DFS on vesicle profiling selected therapy or new treatment\/DFS on prior therapy or treatment) is at least about 1.3. In yet other embodiments, the DFS ratio is at least about 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, or 2.0. In yet other embodiments, the DFS ratio is at least about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 9, or 10.","In some embodiments, the candidate treatment selected by microvescile profiling does not increase the PFS ratio or the DFS ratio in the subject; nevertheless vesicle profiling provides subject benefit. For example, in some embodiments no known treatment is available for the subject. In such cases, vesicle profiling provides a method to identify a candidate treatment where none is currently identified. The vesicle profiling may extend PFS, DFS or lifespan by at least 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 2 months, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks, 12 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 12 months, 13 months, 14 months, 15 months, 16 months, 17 months, 18 months, 19 months, 20 months, 21 months, 22 months, 23 months, 24 months or 2 years. The vesicle profiling may extend PFS, DFS or lifespan by at least 2\u00bd years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, or more. In some embodiments, the methods of the invention improve outcome so that subject is in remission.","The effectiveness of a treatment can be monitored by other measures. A complete response (CR) comprises a complete disappearance of the disease: no disease is evident on examination, scans or other tests. A partial response (PR) refers to some disease remaining in the body, but there has been a decrease in size or number of the lesions by 30% or more. Stable disease (SD) refers to a disease that has remained relatively unchanged in size and number of lesions. Generally, less than a 50% decrease or a slight increase in size would be described as stable disease. Progressive disease (PD) means that the disease has increased in size or number on treatment. In some embodiments, vesicle profiling according to the invention results in a complete response or partial response. In some embodiments, the methods of the invention result in stable disease. In some embodiments, the invention is able to achieve stable disease where non-vesicle profiling results in progressive disease.","The theranosis based on a biosignature of the invention can be for a phenotype including without limitation those listed herein. Characterizing a phenotype includes determining a theranosis for a subject, such as predicting whether a subject is likely to respond to a treatment (\u201cresponder\u201d) or be non-responsive to a treatment (\u201cnon-responder\u201d). As used herein, identifying a subject as a \u201cresponder\u201d to a treatment or as a \u201cnon-responder\u201d to the treatment comprises identifying the subject as either likely to respond to the treatment or likely to not respond to the treatment, respectively, and does not require determining a definitive prediction of the subject's response. One or more vesicles, or populations of vesicles, obtained from subject are used to determine if a subject is a non-responder or responder to a particular therapeutic, by assessing biomarkers disclosed herein, e.g., those listed in Table 5. Detection of a high or low expression level of a biomarker, or a mutation of a biomarker, can be used to select a candidate treatment, such as a pharmaceutical intervention, for a subject with a condition.

can be detected, and treatment agents that can be selected or possibly avoided are listed in Table 6. For example, a biosignature is identified for a subject with a prostate cancer, wherein the biosignature comprises levels of androgen receptor (AR). Overexpression or overproduction of AR, such as high levels of mRNA levels or protein levels in a vesicle, provides an identification of candidate treatments for the subject. Such treatments include agents for treating the subject such as Bicalutamide, Flutamide, Leuprolide, or Goserelin. The subject is accordingly identified as a responder to Bicalutamide, Flutamide, Leuprolide, or Goserelin. In another illustrative example, BCRP mRNA, protein, or both is detected at high levels in a vesicle from a subject suffering from NSCLC. The subject may then be classified as a non-responder to the agents Cisplatin and Carboplatin, or the agents are considered to be less effective than other agents for treating NSCLC in the subject and not selected for use in treating the subject. Any of the following biomarkers can be assessed in a vesicle obtained from a subject, and the biomarker can be in the form including but not limited to one or more of a nucleic acid, polypeptide, peptide or peptide mimetic. In yet another illustrative example, a mutation in one or more of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and\/or c-kit can be used to select a candidate treatment. For example, a mutation in KRAS or BRAF in a patient may indicate that cetuximab and\/or panitumumab are likely to be less effective in treating the patient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0936","num":"0935"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"350pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

See, e.g., \u201cTable 4: Rules Summary for Treatment Selection\u201d of PCT\/US2010\/54366.","Any drug-associated target can be part of a biosignature for providing a theranosis. A \u201cdruggable target\u201d comprising a target that can be modulated with a therapeutic agent such as a small molecule or biologic, is a candidate for inclusion in the biosignature of the invention. Drug-associated targets also include biomarkers that can confer resistance to a treatment, such as shown in Tables 6 and 7. The biosignature can be based on either the gene, e.g., DNA sequence, and\/or gene product, e.g., mRNA or protein, or the drug-associated target. Such nucleic acid and\/or polypeptide can be profiled as applicable as to presence or absence, level or amount, activity, mutation, sequence, haplotype, rearrangement, copy number, or other measurable characteristic. The gene or gene product can be associated with a vesicle population, e.g., as a vesicle surface marker or as vesicle payload. In an embodiment, the invention provides a method of theranosing a cancer, comprising identifying a biosignature that comprises a presence or level of one or more drug-associated target, and selecting a candidate therapeutic based on the biosignature. The drug-associated target can be a circulating biomarker, a vesicle, or a vesicle associated biomarker.","The drug-associated targets assessed using the methods of the invention comprise without limitation ABCC1, ABCG2, ACE2, ADA, ADH1C, ADH4, AGT, AR, AREG, ASNS, BCL2, BCRP, BDCA1, beta III tubulin, BIRC5, B-RAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, CA2, caveolin, CD20, CD25, CD33, CD52, CDA, CDKN2A, CDKNIA, CDKN1B, CDK2, CDW52, CES2, CK 14, CK 17, CK 5\/6, c-KIT, c-Met, c-Myc, COX-2, Cyclin D1, DCK, DHFR, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, E-Cadherin, ECGF1, EGFR, EML4-ALK fusion, EPHA2, Epiregulin, ER, ERBR2, ERCC1, ERCC3, EREG, ESR1, FLT1, folate receptor, FOLR1, FOLR2, FSHB, FSHPRH1, FSHR, FYN, GART, GNRH1, GNRHR1, GSTP1, HCK, HDAC1, hENT-1, Her2\/Neu, HGF, HIF1A, HIG1, HSP90, HSP9OAA1, HSPCA, IGF-1R, IGFRBP, IGFRBP3, IGFRBP4, IGFRBP5, IL13RA1, IL2RA, KDR, Ki67, KIT, K-RAS, LCK, LTB, Lymphotoxin Beta Receptor, LYN, MET, MGMT, MLH1, MMR, MRP1, MS4A1, MSH2, MSH5, Myc, NFKB1, NFKB2, NFKB1A, ODC1, OGFR, p16, p21, p27, p53, p95, PARP-1, PDGFC, PDGFR, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PGP, PGR, PI3K, POLA, POLA1, PPARG, PPARGC1, PR, PTEN, PTGS2, RAF1, RARA, RRM1, RRM2, RRM2B, RXRB, RXRG, SPARC, SRC, SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR4, SSTR5, Survivin, TK1, TLE3, TNF, TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, TS, TXN, TXNRD1, TYMS, VDR, VEGF, VEGFA, VEGFC, VHL, YES1, ZAP70, or any combination thereof. A biosignature including one or combination of these markers can be used to characterize a phenotype according to the invention, such as providing a theranosis. These markers are known to play a role in the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents against proliferative diseases. Accordingly, the markers can be assessed to select a candidate treatment for the cancer independent of the origin or type of cancer. In an embodiment, the invention provides a method of selecting a candidate therapeutic for a cancer, comprising identifying a biosignature comprising a level or presence of one or more drug associated target, and selecting the candidate therapeutic based on its predicted efficacy for a patient with the biosignature. The one or more drug-associated target can be one of the targets listed above, or in Tables 6-8. In some embodiments, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or at least 50 of the one or more drug-associated targets are assessed. The one or more drug-associated target can be associated with a vesicle, e.g., as a vesicle surface marker or as vesicle payload as either nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, mRNA) or protein. In some embodiments, the presence or level of a microRNA known to interact with the one or more drug-associated target is assessed, wherein a high level of microRNA known to suppress the one or more drug-associated target can indicate a lower expression of the one or more drug-associated target and thus a lower likelihood of response to a treatment against the drug-associated target. The one or more drug-associated target can be circulating biomarkers. The one or more drug-associated target can be assessed in a tissue sample. The predicted efficacy can be determined by comparing the presence or level of the one or more drug-associated target to a reference value, wherein a higher level that the reference indicates that the subject is a likely responder. The predicted efficacy can be determined using a classifier algorithm, wherein the classifier was trained by comparing the biosignature of the one or more drug-associated target in subjects that are known to be responders or non-responders to the candidate treatment. Molecular associations of the one or more drug-associated target with appropriate candidate targets are displayed in Table 6-7 herein and U.S. patent application Ser.

In one embodiment, one or more vesicles can be isolated from a subject with a phenotype and a biosignature of the one or more vesicles determined. The biosignature can be compared to a subject without the phenotype. Differences between the two biosignatures can be determined and used to form a novel biosignature. The novel biosignature can then be used for identifying another subject as having the phenotype or not having the phenotype.","Differences between the biosignature from a subject with a particular phenotype can be compared to the biosignature from a subject without the particular phenotype. The one or more differences can be a difference in any characteristic of the vesicle. For example, the level or amount of vesicles in the sample, the half-life of the vesicle, the circulating half-life of the vesicle, the metabolic half-life of the vesicle, or the activity of the vesicle, or any combination thereof, can differ between the biosignature from the subject with a particular phenotype and the biosignature from the subject without the particular phenotype.","In some embodiments, one or more biomarkers differ between the biosignature from from the subject with a particular phenotype and the biosignature from the subject without the particular phenotype. For example, the expression level, presence, absence, mutation, variant, copy number variation, truncation, duplication, modification, molecular association of one or more biomarkers, or any combination thereof, may differ between the biosignature from from the subject with a particular phenotype and the biosignature from the subject without the particular phenotype. The biomarker can be any biomarker disclosed herein or that can be used to characterize a biological entity, including a circulating biomarker, such as protein or microRNA, a vesicle, or a component present in a vesicle or on the vesicle, such as any nucleic acid (e.g. RNA or DNA), protein, peptide, polypeptide, antigen, lipid, carbohydrate, or proteoglycan.","In an aspect, the invention provides a method of discovering a novel biosignature comprising comparing the biomarkers between two or more sample groups to identify biomarkers that show a difference between the sample groups. Multiple markers can be assessed in a panel format to potentially improve the performance of individual markers. In some embodiments, the multiple markers are assessed in a multiplex fashion. The ability of the individual markers and groups of markers to distinguish the groups can be assessed using statistical discriminate analysis or classification methods as used herein. Optimal panels of markers can be used as a biosignature to characterize the phenotype under analysis, such as to provide a diagnosis, prognosis or theranosis of a disease or condition. Optimization can be based on various criteria, including without limitation maximizing ROC AUC, accuracy, sensitivity at a certain specificity, or specificity at a certain sensitivity. The panels can include biomarkers from multiple types. For example, the biosignature can comprise vesicle antigens useful for capturing a vesicle population of interest, and the biosignature can further comprise payload markers within the vesicle population, including without limitation microRNAs, mRNAs, or soluble proteins. Optimal combinations can be identified as those vesicle antigens and payload markers with the greatest ROC AUC value when comparing two settings. As another example, the biosignature can be determined by assessing a vesicle population in addition to assessing circulating biomarkers that are not obtained by isolating exosomes, such as circulating proteins and\/or microRNAs.","The phenotype can be any of those listed herein, e.g., in the \u201cPhenotype\u201d section above. For example, the phenotype can be a proliferative disorder such as a cancer or non-malignant growth, a perinatal or pregnancy related condition, an infectious disease, a neurological disorder, a cardiovascular disease, an inflammatory disease, an immune disease, or an autoimmune disease. The cancer includes without limitation lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer (including small cell carcinoma (oat cell cancer), mixed small cell\/large cell carcinoma, and combined small cell carcinoma), colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, glioma, gliobastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, papillary renal carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, or other solid tumors.","Any of the types of biomarkers or specific biomarkers described herein can be assessed to discover a novel biosignature.

The novel biosignature can then be used to identify the phenotype in other subjects. The biosignature of a vesicle for a new subject can be determined and compared to the novel signature to determine if the subject has the particular phenotype for which the novel biosignature was identified from.","For example, the biosignature of a subject with cancer can be compared to another subject without cancer. Any differences can be used to form a novel biosignature for the diagnosis of the cancer. In another embodiment, the biosignature of a subject with an advanced stage of cancer can be compared to another subject with a less advanced stage of cancer.

The difference can also be in the half-life of the drug or drug metabolite. A difference in the amount or half-life of the drug or drug metabolite can be used to form a novel biosignature for identifying non-responders and responders.","A vesicle useful for methods and compositions described herein can be discovered by taking advantage of its physicochemical characteristics. For example, a vesicle can be discovered by its size, e.g., by filtering biological matter in a known range from 30-120 nm in diameter. Size-based discovery methods, such as differential centrifugation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, or filtration have been used for isolation of a vesicle.","A vesicle can be discovered by its molecular components. Molecular property-based discovery methods include, but are not limited to, immunological isolation using antibodies recognizing molecules associated with vesicle. For example, a surface molecule associated with a vesicle includes, but not limited to, a MHC-II molecule, CD63, CD81, LAMP-1, Rab7 or Rab5.","Various techniques known in the art are applicable for validation and characterization of a vesicle.

For example U.S. Pat. No. 2009\/0148460 describes use of an ELISA method to characterize a vesicle. U.S. Pat. No. 2009\/0258379 describes isolation of membrane vesicles from biological fluids.","Vesicles can be further analyzed for one or more nucleic acids, lipids, proteins or polypeptides, such as surface proteins or peptides, or proteins or peptides within a vesicle. Candidate peptides can be identified by various techniques including mass spectrometry coupled with purification methods such as liquid chromatography. A peptide can then be isolated and its sequence can be identified by sequencing. A computer program that predicts a sequence based on exact mass of a peptide can also be used to reveal the sequence of a peptide isolated from a vesicle. For example, LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry can be used for high sensitivity and high accuracy peptide sequencing. LTQ-Orbitrap method has been described (Simpson et al, Expert Rev. Proteomics 6:267-283, 2009), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Vesicle Compositions","Also provided herein is an isolated vesicle with a particular biosignature.

The composition can comprise one or more isolated vesicles. For example, the composition can comprise a plurality of vesicles, or one or more populations of vesicles.","The composition can be substantially enriched for vesicles. For example, the composition can be substantially absent of cellular debris, cells, or non-exosomal proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids (such as biological molecules not contained within the vesicles). The cellular debris, cells, or non-exosomal proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids, can be present in a biological sample along with vesicles. A composition can be substantially absent of cellular debris, cells, or non-exosomal proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids (such as biological molecules not contained within the vesicles), can be obtained by any method disclosed herein, such as through the use of one or more binding agents or capture agents for one or more vesicles. The vesicles can comprise at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 99% of the total composition, by weight or by mass. The vesicles of the composition can be a heterogeneous or homogeneous population of vesicles. For example, a homogeneous population of vesicles comprises vesicles that are homogeneous as to one or more properties or characteristics. For example, the one or more characteristics can be selected from a group consisting of: one or more of the same biomarkers, a substantially similar or identical biosignature, derived from the same cell type, vesicles of a particular size, and a combination thereof.","Thus, in some embodiments, the composition comprises a substantially enriched population of vesicles. The composition can be enriched for a population of vesicles that are at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 99% homogeneous as to one or more properties or characteristics. For example, the one or more characteristics can be selected from a group consisting of: one or more of the same biomarkers, a substantially similar or identical biosignature, derived from the same cell type, vesicles of a particular size, and a combination thereof. For example, the population of vesicles can be homogeneous by all having a particular biosignature, having the same biomarker, having the same biomarker combination, or derived from the same cell type. In some embodients, the composition comprises a substantially homogeneous population of vesicles, such as a population with a specific biosignature, derived from a specific cell, or both.","The population of vesicles can comprise one or more of the same biomarkers. The biomarker can be any component such as any nucleic acid (e.g. RNA or DNA), protein, peptide, polypeptide, antigen, lipid, carbohydrate, or proteoglycan.

In some embodiments, each vesicle comprises the same 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 50, 75 or 100 biomarkers. The one or more biomarkers can be selected from , -.","The vesicle population comprising the same or identical biomarker can refer to each vesicle in the population having the same presence or absence, expression level, mutational state, or modification of the biomarker. For example, an enriched population of vesicle can comprise vesicles wherein each vesicle has the same biomarker present, the same biomarker absent, the same expression level of a biomarker, the same modification of a biomarker, or the same mutation of a biomarker. The same expression level of a biomarker can refer to a quantitative or qualitive measurement, such as the vesicles in the population underexpress, overexpress, or have the same expression level of a biomarker as compared to a reference level.","Alternatively, the same expression level of a biomarker can be a numerical value representing the expression of a biomarker that is similar for each vesicle in a population.

For example, a biosignature of a vesicle in an enriched population can be the presence of a first biomarker, the presence of a second biomarker, and the underexpression of a third biomarker. Another vesicle in the same population can be 100% identical, having the same first and second biomarkers present and underexpression of the third biomarker. Alternatively, a vesicle in the same population can have the same first and second biomarkers, but not have underexpression of the third biomarker.","In some embodiments, the composition comprises a substantially enriched population of vesicles, wherein the vesicles are derived from the same cell type. For example, the vesicles can all be derived from cells of a specific tissue, cells from a specific tumor of interest or a diseased tissue of interest, circulating tumor cells, or cells of maternal or fetal origin.

In some embodiments, the substantially enriched vesicle population comprises at least about 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99% of the composition, by weight or by mass.","A substantially enriched population of vesicles can be obtained by using one or more methods, processes, or systems as disclosed herein. For example, isolation of a population of vesicles from a sample can be performed by using one or more binding agents for one or more biomarkers of a vesicle, such as using two or more binding agents that target two or more biomarkers of a vesicle. One or more capture agents can be used to obtain a substantially enriched population of vesicles. One or more detection agents can be used to identify a substantially enriched population of vesicles.","In one embodiment, a population of vesicles with a particular biosignature is obtained by using one or more binding agents for the biomarkers of the biosignature. The vesicles can be isolated resulting in a composition comprising a substantially enriched population of vesicles with the particular biosignature. In another embodiment, a population of vesicles with a particular biosignature of interest can be obtained by using one or more binding agents for biomarkers that are not a component of the biosignature of interest. Thus, the binding agents can be used to remove the vesicles that do not have the biosignature of interest and the resulting composition is substantially enriched for the population of vesicles with the particular biosignature of interest. The resulting composition can be substantially absent of the vesicles comprising a biomarker for the binding agent.","Detection System and Kits","Also provided is a detection system configured to determine one or more biosignatures for a vesicle.

In the context of the instant invention, the sensitivity of the portfolio can be reflected in the fold differences exhibited by a biosignature's expression in the diseased state relative to the normal state. Specificity can be reflected in statistical measurements of the correlation of the signaling of gene expression, for example, with the condition of interest (e.g. standard deviation can be a used as such a measurement). In considering a group of biosignature for inclusion in a portfolio, a small standard deviation in measurements correlates with greater specificity. Other measurements of variation such as correlation coefficients can also be used in this capacity.","When combining biomarkers or biosignatures in this invention In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays (IVDMIAs) guidelines and regulations may apply. IVDMIAs can apply to biosignatures as defined as a set of 2 or more markers composed of any combination of genes, gene alterations, mutations, amplifications, deletions, polymorphisms or methylations, or proteins, peptides, polypeptides or RNA molecules, miRNAs, mRNAs, snoRNAs, hnRNAs or RNA that can be grouped so that information obtained about the set of biosignatures in the group provides a sound basis for making a clinically relevant judgment such as a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment choice. These sets of biosignatures make up various portfolios of the invention. As with most diagnostic markers, it is often desirable to use the fewest number of markers sufficient to make a correct medical judgment. This prevents a delay in treatment pending further analysis as well inappropriate use of time and resources. Preferably, portfolios are established such that the combination of biosignatures in the portfolio exhibit improved sensitivity and specificity relative to individual biosignatures or randomly selected combinations of biosignatures. In the context of the instant invention, the sensitivity of the portfolio can be reflected in the fold differences exhibited by a biosignature's expression in the diseased state relative to the normal state. Specificity can be reflected in statistical measurements of the correlation of the signaling of gene expression, for example, with the condition of interest. In considering a group of markers in a biosignature for inclusion in a portfolio, standard deviations, variances, co-variances, correlation coefficients, weighted averages, arithmetic sums, means, multiplicative values, weighted or balanced values or any mathematical manipulation of the values of 2 or more markers that can together be used to calculate a value or score that taken as a whole can be shown to produce greater sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value or accuracy can also be used in this capacity and are within the scope of this invention.","In another embodiment pattern recognition methods can be used. One example involves comparing biomarker expression profiles for various biomarkers (or biosignature portfolios) to ascribe diagnoses. The expression profiles of each of the biomarker comprising the biosignature portfolio are fixed in a medium such as a computer readable medium.","In one example, a table can be established into which the range of signals (e.g., intensity measurements) indicative of disease or physiological state is input. Actual patient data can then be compared to the values in the table to determine whether the patient samples are normal, benign, diseased, or represent a specific physiological state. In a more sophisticated embodiment, patterns of the expression signals (e.g., fluorescent intensity) are recorded digitally or graphically. In the example of RNA expression patterns from the biomarker portfolios used in conjunction with patient samples are then compared to the expression patterns. Pattern comparison software can then be used to determine whether the patient samples have a pattern indicative of the disease, a given prognosis, a pattern that indicates likeliness to respond to therapy, or a pattern that is indicative of a particular physiological state. The expression profiles of the samples are then compared to the portfolio of a control cell. If the sample expression patterns are consistent with the expression pattern(s) for disease, prognosis, or therapy-related response then (in the absence of countervailing medical considerations) the patient is diagnosed as meeting the conditions that relate to these various circumstances. If the sample expression patterns are consistent with the expression pattern derived from the normal\/control vesicle population then the patient is diagnosed negative for these conditions.","In another exemplary embodiment, a method for establishing biomarker expression portfolios is through the use of optimization algorithms such as the mean variance algorithm widely used in establishing stock portfolios. This method is described in detail in the U.S. Application Publication No. 20030194734, incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, measured DNA alterations, changes in mRNA, protein, or metabolites to phenotypic readouts of efficacy and toxicity may be modeled and analyzed using algorithms, systems and methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,089,168, 7,415,359 and U.S. Application Publication Nos. 20080208784, 20040243354, or 20040088116, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","An exemplary process of biosignature portfolio selection and characterization of an unknown is summarized as follows:","(1) Choose baseline class.","(2) Calculate mean, and standard deviation of each biomarker for baseline class samples.","(3) Calculate (X*Standard Deviation+Mean) for each biomarker. This is the baseline reading from which all other samples will be compared. X is a stringency variable with higher values of X being more stringent than lower.","(4) Calculate ratio between each Experimental sample versus baseline reading calculated in step 3.","(5) Transform ratios such that ratios less than 1 are negative (eg. using Log base 10). (Under expressed biomarkers now correctly have negative values necessary for MV optimization).","(6) These transformed ratios are used as inputs in place of the asset returns that are normally used in the software application.","(7) The software will plot the efficient frontier and return an optimized portfolio at any point along the efficient frontier.","(8) Choose a desired return or variance on the efficient frontier.","(9) Calculate the Portfolio's Value for each sample by summing the multiples of each gene's intensity value by the weight generated by the portfolio selection algorithm.","(10) Calculate a boundary value by adding the mean Biosignature Portfolio Value for Baseline groups to the multiple of Y and the Standard Deviation of the Baseline's Biosignature Portfolio Values. Values greater than this boundary value shall be classified as the Experimental Class.","(11) Optionally one can reiterate this process until best prediction.","The process of selecting a biosignature portfolio can also include the application of heuristic rules. Preferably, such rules are formulated based on biology and an understanding of the technology used to produce clinical results. More preferably, they are applied to output from the optimization method. For example, the mean variance method of biosignature portfolio selection can be applied to microarray data for a number of biomarkers differentially expressed in subjects with a specific disease. Output from the method would be an optimized set of biomarkers that could include those that are expressed in vesicles as well as in diseased tissue. If samples used in the testing method are obtained from vesicles and certain biomarkers differentially expressed in instances of disease or physiological state could also be differentially expressed in vesicles, then a heuristic rule can be applied in which a biosignature portfolio is selected from the efficient frontier excluding those that are differentially expressed in vesicles. Of course, the rule can be applied prior to the formation of the efficient frontier by, for example, applying the rule during data pre-selection.","Other statistical, mathematical and computational algorithms for the analysis of linear and non-linear feature subspaces, feature extraction and signal deconvolution in large scale datasets to identify vesicle-derived multiplex analyte profiles for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy selection and\/or characterization of define physiological states can be done using any combination of unsupervised analysis methods, including but not limited to: principal component analysis (PCA) and linear and non-linear independent component analysis (ICA); blind source separation, nongaussinity analysis, natural gradient maximum likelihood estimation; joint-approximate diagonalization; eigenmatrices; Gaussian radical basis function, kernel and polynominal kernel analysis sequential floating forward selection.","Computer Systems","A vesicle can be assayed for molecular features, for example, by determining an amount, presence or absence of one or more biomarkers such as listed , -. The data generated can be used to produce a biosignature, which can be stored and analyzed by a computer system, such as shown in . The assaying or correlating of the biosignature with one or more phenotypes can also be performed by computer systems, such as by using computer executable logic.","A computer system, such as shown in , can be used to transmit data and results following analysis. Accordingly,  is a block diagram showing a representative example logic device through which results from a vesicle can be analyzed and the analysis reported or generated.  shows a computer system (or digital device)  to receive and store data generated from a vesicle, analyze of the data to generate one or more biosignatures, and produce a report of the one or more biosignatures or phenotype characterization. The computer system can also perform comparisons and analyses of biosignatures generated, and transmit the results. Alternatively, the computer system can receive raw data of vesicle analysis, such as through transmission of the data over a network, and perform the analysis.","The computer system  may be understood as a logical apparatus that can read instructions from media  and\/or network port , which can optionally be connected to server  having fixed media . The system shown in  includes CPU , disk drives , optional input devices such as keyboard  and\/or mouse  and optional monitor . Data communication can be achieved through the indicated communication medium to a server  at a local or a remote location. The communication medium can include any means of transmitting and\/or receiving data. For example, the communication medium can be a network connection, a wireless connection or an internet connection. Such a connection can provide for communication over the World Wide Web. It is envisioned that data relating to the present invention can be transmitted over such networks or connections for reception and\/or review by a party . The receiving party  can be but is not limited to an individual, a health care provider or a health care manager. Thus, the information and data on a test result can be produced anywhere in the world and transmitted to a different location. For example, when an assay is conducted in a differing building, city, state, country, continent or offshore, the information and data on a test result may be generated and cast in a transmittable form as described above. The test result in a transmittable form thus can be imported into the U.S. to receiving party . Accordingly, the present invention also encompasses a method for producing a transmittable form of information on the diagnosis of one or more samples from an individual. The method comprises the steps of (1) determining a diagnosis, prognosis, theranosis or the like from the samples according to methods of the invention; and (2) embodying the result of the determining step into a transmittable form. The transmittable form is the product of the production method. In one embodiment, a computer-readable medium includes a medium suitable for transmission of a result of an analysis of a biological sample, such as biosignatures. The medium can include a result regarding a vesicle, such as a biosignature of a subject, wherein such a result is derived using the methods described herein.","Ex Vivo Harvesting of Vesicles","A vesicle for analysis and determination of a phenotype can also be from ex vivo harvesting. Cells can be cultured and vesicles released from cells of interest in culture either result spontaneously or can be stimulated to release vesicles into the medium. (see for example, Zitvogel, et al. 19984: 594-600; Chaput, et al. 2004172: 2137-214631: 2892-2900; Escudier, et al. 20053: 10; Morse, et al. 20053: 9; Peche, et al. 20066: 1541-1550; Kim, et al. 2005. J Immunol. 174: 6440-6448, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). Cell lines or tissue samples can be grown to 80% confluence before being cultured in fresh DMEM for 72 h. Subsequent vesicle production can be stimulated (see, for example, heat shock treatment of melanoma cells as described by Dressel, et al. 200363: 8212-8220, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The supernatant can then be harvested and vesicles prepared as described herein.","A vesicle produced ex vivo can, in one example, be cultured from a cell-of-origin or cell line of interest, vesicles can be isolated from the cell culture medium and subsequently labeled with a magnetic label, a fluorescent moiety, a radioisotope, an enzyme, a chemiluminescent probe, a metal particle, a non-metal colloidal particle, a polymeric dye particle, a pigment molecule, a pigment particle, an electrochemically active species, semiconductor nanocrystal or other nanoparticles including quantum dots or gold particles to be reintroduced in vivo as a label for imaging analysis. Ex vivo cultured vesicles can alternatively be used to identify novel biosignatures by setting up culturing conditions for a given cell-of-origin with characteristics of interest, for example a culture of lung cancer cells or cell line with a known EGFR mutation that confers resistant to or susceptibility to gefitinib, then exposing the cell culture to gefitinib, isolating vesicles that arise from the culture and subsequently analyzing them on a discovery array to look for novel antigens or binding agents expressed on the outside of vesicles that could be used as a biosignature to capture this species of vesicle. Additionally, it would be possible to isolate any other biomarkers or biosignatures found within these vesicles for discovery of novel signatures (including but not limited to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or combinations thereof) that may have clinical diagnostic, prognostic or therapy related implication.","Cells of interest can also be first isolated and cultured from tissues of interest. For example, human hair follicles in the growing phase, anagen, can be plucked individually from a patient's scalp using sterile equipment and plasticware, taking care not to damage the follicle. Each sample can be transferred to a Petri dish containing sterile PBS for tissue culture. Isolated human anagen hair follicles can be carefully transferred to an individual well of a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of William's E medium. Follicles can be maintained free-floating at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere of 5% COand 95% air in a humidified incubator. Medium can be changed every 3 days, taking care not to damage the follicles. Cells can then be collected and spun down from the media. Vesicles may then be isolated using antigens or cellular binding partners that are specific to such cell-of-origin specific vesicles using methods as previously described. Biomarkers and biosignatures can then be isolated and characterized by methods known to those skilled in the art.","Cells of interest may also be cultured under microgravity or zero-gravity conditions or under a free-fall environment. For example, NASA's bioreactor technology will allow such cells to be grown at much faster rate and in much greater quantities. Vesicles may then be isolated using antigens or cellular binding partners that are specific to such cell-of-origin specific vesicles using methods as previously described.","Rotating wall vessels or RWVersus are a class of bioreactors developed by and for NASA that are designed to grow suspension cultures of cells in a quiescent environment that simulates microgravity can also be used.

Each assay used a different capture antibody. The first used a CD9 capture antibody, the second a CD81 capture antibody, and the third a CD63 antibody. The same combination of detection antibodies was used for each assay, antibodies for CD9, CD81, and CD63. If the average value obtained for the three assays was greater than 3000, the sample was categorized as having overexpressed vesicles (, Exosome).","Prostate Vesicle Overexpression","The MFIs for a sample in two assays were averaged to determine a value for the sample.","Each assay used a different capture antibody. The first used a PCSA capture antibody and the second used a PSMA capture antibody. The same combination of detection antibodies was used for each assay, antibodies for CD9, CD81, and CD63.

Cancer-Associated MV markers: EpCam and B7H3","Samples were required to pass a quality test as follows: if multiplexed fluorescence intensity (MFI) PSCA+MFI B7H3+MFI EpCam<200 then sample fails due to lack of signal above background. In the training set, six samples (three normals and three prostate cancers) did not achieve an adequate quality score and were excluded.

Compared to PSA and PCA3 testing, the PCa Test presented in this Example can result in saving 220 men without PCa in every 1000 normal men screened from having an unnecessary biopsy.","BPH is a common cause of elevated PSA levels. PSA can only indicated whether there is something wrong with the prostate, but it cannot effectively differentiate between BPH and PCa. PCA3, a transcript found to be overexpressed by prostate cancer cells, is thought to be slightly more specific for PCa, but this depends on the cutoffs used for PSA and PCA3, as well as the populations studied.","BPH can be characterized by vesicle (MV) analysis. Examining the samples described in Example 19, ten out of the 15 BPH samples (67%) have higher levels of CD63+ vesicles than the PCa samples, including the stage Ills. See . Also, 14 out of 15 BPH (93%) have higher levels of CD63+ vesicles than the normals. This indicates that an inflammation-specific signature that differs from cancer may be used in differentiating BPH from PCa.","The PCa test from Example 19 was repeated including the 15 BPH samples. Using all 99 samples, the test was 98% sensitive and 84% specific. See . Thus, the test provides a 15% improvement over PSA. Performance values for PSA and PCA3 are commonly reported for settings without BPH in their cohorts, nevertheless, the vesicle test of the invention still outperforms conventional testing even when BPH was included. See . In this setting, the PCa test of the invention results in saving 110 men in every 1000 men without PCa screened from having an unnecessary biopsy as compared to PSA testing. And of those men biopsied due to a positive result from the assay, most will have something wrong with their prostate because the test performs well at identifying normal men (i.e., 95% specific in that population, see Example 19).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1180","num":"1179"},"figref":["FIG. 96","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1181","num":"1180"},"figref":"FIG. 97"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1182","num":"1181"},"figref":["FIG. 98","FIG. 98A","FIG. 98B","FIG. 98C","FIG. 98D"]},"In this example, the vesicle PCa test is a microsphere based immunoassay for the detection of a set of protein biomarkers present on the vesicles from plasma of patients with prostate cancer.

A sample that passes validation is called positive if the prostate-specific marker (PSMA) is considered positive and the joint signal of the cancer markers (B7-H3 and EpCam) is also considered positive.  shows a decision tree using the MFI obtained with PCSA, PSMA, B7-H3, CD9, CD81 and CD63. A sample is classified as indeterminate if the MFI is within the standard deviation of the predetermined threshold (TH). In this case, a second patient sample can be obtained. For validation, the sample must have sufficient signal when capturing vesicles with the individual tetraspanins and labeling with all tetraspanins. A sample that passes validation is called positive if either of the prostate-specific markers (PSMA or PCSA) is considered positive, and the cancer marker (B7-H3) is also considered positive.","In this example, the vesicle PCa test is performed using a protein array, more specifically an antibody array, for the detection of a set of protein biomarkers present on the vesicles from plasma of patients with prostate cancer. The array comprises capture antibodies specific to the following protein biomarkers: CD9, CD59, CD63, CD81, PSMA, PCSA, B7H3 and EpCAM. Vesicles are isolated as described herein. After filtration and isolation of the vesicles from plasma of men at risk for PCa (those over the age of 50), the plasma samples are incubated with an array harboring the various capture antibodies. Depending on the level of binding of fluorescently labeled detection antibodies to general vesicle markers (CD9, CD81 and\/or CD63) that bind to the vesicles from a patient's plasma that hybridize to the array, a determination of the presence or absence of prostate cancer is made.

For samples in which RNA is isolated from a 400-\u03bcl plasma or serum sample, for example, 1.67 \u03bcl of RNA solution represents the RNA corresponding to (1.67\/80)\u00d7400=8.3 \u03bcl plasma or serum. For generation of standard curves of chemically synthesized RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to known miRNAs, varying dilutions of each oligonucleotide are made in water such that the final input into the RT reaction has a volume of 1.67 \u03bcl.

Data is analyzed with SDS Relative Quantification Software version 2.2.2 (Applied BioSystems.), with the automatic Ct setting for assigning baseline and threshold for Ct determination.","The protocol can also be modified to include a preamplification step, such as for detecting miRNA. A 1.25-\u03bcl aliquot of undiluted RT product is combined with 3.75 \u03bcl of Preamplification PCR reagents [comprised, per reaction, of 2.5 \u03bcl of TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (2\u00d7) and 1.25 \u03bcl of 0.2\u00d7 TaqMan miRNA Assay (diluted in TE)] to generate a 5.0 \u03bcl preamplification PCR, which is carried out on a Tetrad2 Peltier Thermal Cycler (BioRad) by heating to 95\u00b0 C. for 10 min, followed by 14 cycles of 95\u00b0 C. for 15 s and 60\u00b0 C. for 4 min. The preamplification PCR product is diluted (by adding 20 \u03bcl of H2O to the 5-\u03bcl preamplification reaction product), following which 2.25 \u03bcl of the diluted material is introduced into the real-time PCR and carried forward as described.","Synthetic single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the mature miRNA sequence (miRBase Release v.10.1) are purchased from Sigma. Synthetic miRNAs are input into the RT reaction over an empirically-derived range of copies to generate standard curves for each of the miRNA TaqMan assays listed above. In general, the lower limit of accurate quantification for each assay is designated based on the minimal number of copies input into an RT reaction that results in a Ct value within the linear range of the standard curve and that is also not equivalent to or higher than a Ct obtained from an RT input of lower copy number. A line is fit to data from each dilution series using Ct values within the linear range, from which y=m1n(x)+b equations are derived for quantification of absolute miRNA copies (x) from each sample Ct (y). Absolute copies of miRNA input into the RT reaction are converted to copies of miRNA per microliter plasma (or serum) based on the knowledge that the material input into the RT reaction corresponds to RNA from 2.1% of the total starting volume of plasma [i.e., 1.67 \u03bcl of the total RNA eluate volume (80 \u03bcl on average) is input into the RT reaction]. An example of a synthetic miRNA sequence is for miR-141 which can be obtained commercially such as from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.).","MicroRNA is extracted from vesicles isolated from patient samples.

ability to assay multiple vesicle biomarkers in a single multiplexed experiment can be used to create a biosignature for lung cancer and for discovery of optimal target biomarkers for additional biosignatures. The same techniques can be applied in various settings (e.g., different diseases, different cancers, different target biomarkers, diagnosis, prognosis, theranosis, etc.) to identify novel biomarkers for subsequent assay development.","Tissue factor is a blood clot-related protein whose expression has been noted in association with cancer. There are several biologic processes related to tumorigenesis or cancer progression that is tied to TF expression. These processes include angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion, immune evasion and circulating tumor cell survival. The fibrin clot that forms with TF expression coats cancer cells providing a protective coating for these cells. It is known that circulating TF is increased in the serum of cancer patients. Pathologic fibrotic events such as thromboembolism and stroke are major causes of cancer-associated deaths in patients and the existence of TF-expressing circulating microvesicles (cMVs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1262","num":"1261"},"figref":"FIG. 104"},"The methods of the invention can be used to identify a biosignature for theranosing a cancer. The biosignature can include any number of useful biomarkers, which can be assessed as described herein. The biosignature can be determined in a sample of bodily fluid, preferably a blood sample, such as plasma or serum. Vesicles are obtained from sample of bodily fluid from a patient with a cancer using methodology presented herein. See, e.g., Example 3. For determining a biosignature for different settings, the appropriate biomarkers to include in the biosignature can be discovered as described above. See, e.g., section on Biosignature Discovery. The vesicles can be isolated, captured and\/or assessed for surface antigens using a binding agent bound to a microsphere, such as described in Example 21. The vesicles can also be isolated, captured and\/or assessed for surface antigens using an array as in Example 22, or FACS as in Example 23. Immunoassay techniques can also be used to capture vesicles. Biomarker payload within the isolated\/captured vesicles can be analyzed as desired. Examples 30-32 further describe identification of vesicle biomarkers for theranosing cancers. The vesicles can be assessed for size using laser detection techniques.","The biosignature can further comprise additional biomarkers, such as microRNA. MicroRNA can be assessed directly from a bodily fluid or can be first isolated from a vesicle population. See, e.g., Example 24 (obtaining serum); Example 25 (RNA isolation from serum or plasma); Example 28 (extracting microRNA from vesicles). The microRNA can be assessed using RT-PCR (see Examples 26, 27) and\/or using array analysis (see Example 29). The microRNA can be analyzed using microfluidics to perform nucleic acid amplification.","The methods of identifying a biosignature can be performed in a single assay. For example, a number of biomarkers can be assessed using a multiplexed approach. In addition, some of the biomarkers can be assessed in a single assay while one or more other biomarkers are assessed in a different assay, which can also be a multiplexed assay. As an example, multiple vesicle surface biomarkers can be assessed in a first multiplex assay, and multiple microRNAs can be assessed in a second multiplex assay. The results of the first and second multiplex assays can be combined to identify a biosignature comprising the vesicle surface biomarkers and the microRNAs.","The biosignature can comprise any useful biomarker, including without limitation those presented herein in the context of various diseases and disorders, including without limitation markers for prostate cancer in Examples 6, 9, 19-22; markers for colorectal cancer in Examples 7, 14, 30 and 31; markers for breast cancer in Example 31 and markers for lung cancer in Example 32.","The cancer is theranosed by identifying a biosignature including drug associated targets.

No. 12\/658,770, filed Feb. 12, 2010; International PCT Patent Application PCT\/US2010\/000407, filed Feb. 11, 2010; International PCT Patent Application PCT\/US2010\/54366, filed Oct. 27, 2010; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61\/427,788, filed Dec. 28, 2010; all of which applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. See, e.g., \u201cTable 4: Rules Summary for Treatment Selection\u201d of PCT\/US2010\/54366. The treating physician is presented a report comprising the expression levels of the biomarkers assessed and the list of drug indications. The physician uses the report to aid in selection of a candidate treatment.","Vesicles are obtained from sample of bodily fluid from a patient with a lung cancer. The sample may comprise plasma. A panel of capture antibodies bound to a substrate is used to assess the vesicle population for the presence or level of drug associated biomarkers using methodology as described herein. The markers comprise ABCC1, ABCG2, ACE2, ADA, ADH1C, ADH4, AGT, AR, AREG, ASNS, BCL2, BCRP, BDCA1, beta III tubulin, BIRC5, B-RAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, CA2, caveolin, CD20, CD25, CD33, CD52, CDA, CDKN2A, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDK2, CDW52, CES2, CK 14, CK 17, CK 5\/6, c-KIT, c-Met, c-Myc, COX-2, Cyclin D1, DCK, DHFR, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, E-Cadherin, ECGF1, EGFR, EML4-ALK fusion, EPHA2, Epiregulin, ER, ERBR2, ERCC1, ERCC3, EREG, ESR1, FLT1, folate receptor, FOLR1, FOLR2, FSHB, FSHPRH1, FSHR, FYN, GART, GNRH1, GNRHR1, GSTP1, HCK, HDAC1, hENT-1, Her2\/Neu, HGF, HIF1A, HIG1, HSP90, HSP9OAA1, HSPCA, IGF-1R, IGFRBP, IGFRBP3, IGFRBP4, IGFRBP5, IL13RA1, IL2RA, KDR, Ki67, KIT, K-RAS, LCK, LTB, Lymphotoxin Beta Receptor, LYN, MET, MGMT, MLH1, MMR, MRP1, MS4A1, MSH2, MSH5, Myc, NFKB1, NFKB2, NFKB1A, ODC1, OGFR, p16, p21, p27, p53, p95, PARP-1, PDGFC, PDGFR, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PGP, PGR, P13K, POLA, POLA1, PPARG, PPARGC1, PR, PTEN, PTGS2, RAF1, RARA, RRM1, RRM2, RRM2B, RXRB, RXRG, SPARC, SRC, SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR4, SSTR5, Survivin, TK1, TLE3, TNF, TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, TS, TXN, TXNRD1, TYMS, VDR, VEGF, VEGFA, VEGFC, VHL, YES1, and ZAP70. These markers are known to play a role in the efficacy of various chemotherapeutic agents against proliferative diseases. Accordingly, the markers can be assessed to select a candidate treatment for the lung cancer based on the molecular profile of the cancer itself independent of its origin, although the treating physician can take into account any other relevant information when selecting the candidate treatment, e.g., patient history, prior treatments, other testing results, cancer characteristics (e.g., stage, origin), physician experience, and the like. Preferably the markers comprise one or more of ASPH, BRCA 1, EGFR, EPHA2, ErbB2, HIF, KRAS, MS4A1, P27, P53, ADH, PGP9, PGP9.5, and VEGF. Other markers that are included in the biosignature to assess sensitivity to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor comprise miR-497, miR-21, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-29b, hsa-miR-029 a, hsa-let-7d, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-1260, hsa-miR-025, hsa-let-7i, hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-594-Pre, hsa-miR-024, FGFR1, MET, RAB25, EGFR, KIT, VEGFR2, FGF1, HOXC10 and\/or LHFP.","The presence or level of each marker is compared to the presence or level of the same markers observed in a group of reference samples without the cancer. Biomarkers that are overexpressed or underexpressed in the patient sample compared to the reference samples are identified. A list is assembled of candidate therapeutic agents are that known to be effective against cancers that overexpress or underexpress the biomarkers are identified using drug-target association rules as presented in Tables 6-8, and U.S. patent application Ser.
