title: Communication apparatus provided with network interfaces, control method therefor, and storage medium storing control program therefor
abstract: A communication apparatus is provided with network interfaces. A control unit provides an application programming interface for an application that runs on the communication apparatus. A transmission unit transmits a search packet via the respective network interfaces in response to a request from the application. A reception unit receives a response packet in response to the search packet that the transmission unit transmits. A first determination unit determines whether the information showing a transmitting source of the response packet that the reception unit received is stored in a storage unit. The control unit stores the information showing the transmitting source of the response packet received into the storage unit and transfers the response packet received to the application, when the first determination unit determines that the information showing the transmitting source of the response packet received is not stored in the storage unit.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a communication apparatus provided with a plurality of network interfaces, a control method therefor, and a storage medium storing a control program therefor.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, a communication apparatus that can search for other devices on a network is developed in order to provide a service while devices such as image forming apparatuses cooperate mutually. The communication apparatus generally uses a method using a multicast packet or a broadcast packet (for example, see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2000-181849 (JP 2000-181849A)).","The multicast packet is an IP (Internet Protocol) packet used when transmitting the same data to specific devices that stand on a network. One of the features of the multicast packet is that a TTL (TimeToLive) value is included in a packet. The TTL value expresses life time of the IP packet, and the value decreases one by one when passing through a router. That is, when the TTL value is set to \u201c1\u201d or more at a transmitting source of the multicast packet, it becomes possible to transmit the same multicast packet to networks (subnets) in a wide area beyond a router.","On the other hand, the broadcast packet is an IP packet used when transmitting the same data to many and unspecified devices that stand on a network. The broadcast packet cannot exceed a router, but can be transmitted only to devices on the network (subnet) that is formed by the router. As compared with this, a packet that specifies a single device that stands on a network and is transmitted to an IP address of the device is called a unicast packet.","Conventionally, a multi-home device that has a plurality of network interfaces (I\/F) sends out a multicast packet or a broadcast packet from the network interfaces when searching for other devices on a network. In this case, the multi-home device of which the network interfaces belong to the same subnet has a problem in that device-search responses are received in duplication from devices that stand on the subnet.","Since the multi-home device of which the network interfaces connect with different subnets becomes possible to search beyond a subnet when searching with the multicast packet of which the TTL value is set to \u201c1\u201d or more, the same problem occurs.","The present invention provides a communication apparatus, a control method therefor, and a storage medium storing a control program therefor that are capable of searching a necessary device when the communication apparatus provided with a plurality of network interfaces searches a device without correcting an application running on the apparatus concerned.","Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a communication apparatus provided with network interfaces comprising a control unit configured to provide an application programming interface for an application that runs on the communication apparatus, a transmission unit configured to transmit a search packet via the respective network interfaces in response to a request from the application, a reception unit configured to receive a response packet in response to the search packet that the transmission unit transmits, and a first determination unit configured to determine whether the information showing a transmitting source of the response packet that the reception unit received is stored in a storage unit, wherein the control unit stores the information showing the transmitting source of the response packet received into the storage unit and transfers the response packet received to the application, when the first determination unit determines that the information showing the transmitting source of the response packet received is not stored in the storage unit.","Accordingly, a second aspect of the present invention provides a control method for a communication apparatus provided with network interfaces and a control unit that provides an application programming interface for an application that runs on the apparatus itself, the control method comprising a transmission step of transmitting a search packet via the respective network interfaces in response to a request from the application, a reception step of receiving a response packet in response to the search packet that is transmitted in the transmission step, a first determination step of determining whether the information showing a transmitting source of the response packet that is received in the reception step is stored in a storage unit, and a control step of storing the information showing the transmitting source of the response packet received into the storage unit and of transferring the response packet received to the application, when it is determined that the information showing the transmitting source of the response packet received is not stored in the storage unit in the first determination step.","Accordingly, a third aspect of the present invention provides a computer-readable storage medium storing a program causing a computer to execute the above-mentioned control method for the communication apparatus.","According to the present invention, the problem in that unnecessary devices are retrieved when the communication apparatus that is provided with a plurality of network interfaces searches a device can be solved without correcting the application running on the communication apparatus concerned.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Hereafter, embodiments according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The first multifunctional peripheral device  is an image forming apparatus provided with a print function, a scanner function, etc., is provided with two network interfaces (network I\/Fs), and is connected to mutually different networks (subnets  and ).

The TCP and the UDP belong to the fourth layer (transport layer) in the OSI reference model, and act as a bridge between the protocol belonging to the IP layer and the protocol belonging to the fifth layer (session layer). A TCP header and a UDP header include port numbers that are used to identify higher-level protocols. For example, the port number \u201c427\u201d of the TCP header is used to identify the SLP.","The protocol stack  is used from another software module (application). An interface part between the protocol stack  and an application is called a socket, and an identifier (socket identifier) that uniquely identifies a socket is assigned to each socket.","A socket API  is an API (Application Programming Interface) provided in order that a higher-level protocol uses the protocol stack . In recent years, the API is uniformly standardized by a POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX (registered trademark)) etc., and has a common format in various systems. The socket API  has a socket identifier as an argument that the protocol stack  uses to identify an application that uses the protocol stack .","A socket API wrapper  is a wrapper for using the socket API , and is used from an apparatus search control unit . Since the socket API wrapper  is provided in the same format as the socket API , an application is able to use the socket API wrapper  without changing the format used when calling the socket API  directly.","A first network I\/F driver  transfers data between the first network I\/F control unit  connected to the subnet  and the protocol stack . A second network I\/F driver  transfers data between the second network I\/F control unit  connected to the subnet  and the protocol stack .","The apparatus search control unit  is a module that controls an apparatus search. The apparatus search control unit  receives a trigger of the apparatus search, and processes an apparatus search result.

The apparatus search control unit  displays an apparatus search result on the operation panel  via the panel control unit  to notify a user.","When receiving the trigger of the apparatus search, the apparatus search control unit  forms an SLP apparatus search packet for performing an apparatus search, and transmits the packet using the socket API wrapper . Then, the apparatus search control unit  receives a SLP search response packet using the socket API wrapper , and obtains an apparatus search result (see RFC2165 for the details of the SLP apparatus search packet).","An apparatus search response unit  receives an SLP apparatus search packet from another apparatus on the network using the socket API .

The socket identifier  and the destination port number  serve as identification information about search data, for example.","The IP address of the destination that receives the response when performing the apparatus search to the socket identifier  and the destination port number  is set to a search response received address .","The relationship among the socket identifier , the destination port number , and the search response received address  is 1:1:n (n is an integer larger than 1). In the illustrated example, \u201c172.24.24.244\u201d and \u201c172.24.24.245\u201d are set up to the search response received address that uses the socket identifier \u201c6\u201d and the destination port number \u201c427\u201d (SLP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["402","402","401","101"]},"In , the socket API wrapper  refers to the port number of the data passed from the apparatus search control unit , and determines whether the protocol deduced from the port number is the apparatus search protocol (step S). For example, since the port number is \u201c427\u201d when the SLP apparatus search packet is passed from the apparatus search control unit , the socket API wrapper  determines that the protocol is the apparatus search protocol.","When it is determined that the protocol according to the port number is not the apparatus search protocol as a result of the determination in the step S, the socket API wrapper  passes the data to the socket API  as-is (step S), and finishes this process.

The reason why the set-up information is deleted in the step S is to avoid being treated as an already responded address, when the apparatus search is continuously executed from the same application.","On the other hand, when it is determined that the applicable information is not registered in the step S, the socket API wrapper  newly registers a socket identifier and a destination port number into the apparatus search management table  (step S), and proceeds with the process to step S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["402","402","401","101"]},"In , the socket API wrapper  passes a socket identifier to the protocol stack  via the socket API , and acquires the data corresponding to the socket identifier (step S).","As shown by the reference numeral  in , the second network I\/F control unit  of the first multifunctional peripheral device  receives the SLP apparatus search packet of which the source address matches the address held by the first network I\/F control unit .
