{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to social networking systems, and more specifically relates to connecting users of a social networking systems that are accessing third party websites.","A social network, in general, is a social structure made up of entities, such as individuals or organizations, that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge, or prestige. In more recent years, social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social-networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social-networking websites. A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.","The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interests. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. The social networking system may also create and store user preferences.","A social networking system may support application programming interfaces and associated functionality that allows third-party systems to access user profile data of its users. Such third party websites can use the user profile data can use the identity and account of a user for purposes of identifying users and maintaining their accounts at such third party websites. These third party websites may also access user profile data in order to personalize or customize the user experience on the site.","The advent of social networking, instant messaging, and ubiquitous wireless data networks allows individuals to select from a plurality of methods to communicate with their contacts. In the past, communications between individuals were limited to physical mail, wired telephones, fax, and wireless telephones. However, with the expansion of the Internet, coupled with mobile devices capable of maintaining a data connection to the Internet, users may select from a plethora of communications means, such as: cellular phone calls, e-mail to multiple accounts, multiple instant messaging protocols, twitter messages, voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls, video chats, SMS and MMS messages, social networking messages, voicemail, push-to-talk (PTT), and dedicated notification-based message clients such as the Blackberry Messenger and Kik Messenger.","The present disclosure generally relates to social networking systems, and more specifically relates to connecting users of a social networking systems that are accessing third party websites.","In particular embodiments, a method comprising, by one or more computing devices, communicating, from a client device, to a remote host a resource locator of a content object being currently accessed by a first user at the client device, receiving from the remote host an indication that one or more second users have accessed the content object or a domain hosting the content object, and responsive to the indication, displaying a chat messaging interface to the first user at the client device, wherein the chat messaging interface includes identifiers for the one or more second users and messaging controls operative to establish a chat session with the one or more second users.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","The present disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","Social Network Systems and Accessible User Profile Data","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other, through the system. Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter, the registered user may login to the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.","When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a \u201cuser profile,\u201d in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user. For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example, if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends). Connections may be added explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.","The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information. Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile. Again, such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user's most-recent activities. Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile. For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or remove the user as a friend). A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages\u2014typically known as wall-posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.","A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.","In particular embodiments, an edge may be one of a plurality of edge types based at least in part on the types of nodes that the edge connects in the social graph. In particular embodiments, for example, each edge from a first edge type defines a connection between a pair of user nodes from the first set, while each edge from a second edge type defines a connection between a user node from the first set and a concept node from the second set. Furthermore, each edge from a third edge type may define a connection between a pair of concept nodes from the second set. In particular embodiments, the edge itself may store, or be stored with, data that defines a type of connection between the pair of nodes the edge connects. In particular embodiments, each edge may simply define or represent a connection between nodes regardless of the types of nodes the edge connects; that is, the edge itself may store, or be stored with, identifiers of the nodes the edge connects but may not store, or be stored with, data that describes a type of connection between the pair of nodes the edge connects. Furthermore, in any of these or other particular embodiments, data that may indicate the type of connection or relationship between nodes connected by an edge may be stored with the nodes themselves. Additional information on automatic edge generation in an integrated social graph is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,145, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.","Similar to user profile pages, concept profile pages (\u201chubs\u201d) share information related to the concept associated with the corresponding hub node. In particular embodiments, any registered user logged in to social networking system and viewing a hub may add content to the hub similar to a wiki-site. A hub may also generally include a basic information section, a detailed info section, as well as, potentially, other sections, any and all of which may generally be filled in by any user viewing the hub. In particular embodiments, wall (or news feed\/activities feed) section, or other feed or activities section of the hub, displays comments, status updates, wall posts and other user activities associated with the user and friends of the user that are viewing the hub. The wall (or news feed\/activities feed) section, or other feed or activities section of the hub may also display comments, status updates, wall posts and other user activities and user generated content that are related to the concept for which the hub was created. A hub may also include a photo or picture section under photos tab allowing users to upload images in or related to the concept, one of which may be selected as a profile picture for the hub.","In particular embodiments, user nodes and hub nodes stored in the social graph database may be connected with one another via edges. In particular embodiments, each edge may be classified or characterized by an edge type of a plurality of edge types that define, indicate, or characterize the connection between the pair of nodes connected by the edge. In particular embodiments, edges define friendship or other social relationship connections between users (e.g., friends) associated with the respective user nodes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120","130","150","110","120","110","130","120","130"]},"Client device  is generally a computer or computing device including functionality for communicating over a computer network (e.g., remotely).

In particular embodiments, social networking system  further includes a chat server  operative to maintain presence information for one or more users and to provide chat functionality allowing users to communicate messages in a chat or instant messaging session.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system  stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection database . Particular embodiments of the connection database  may store connection information for users who have indicated similar or common work experience, group memberships, hobbies, or educational history. In particular embodiments, the social networking system  may also include user-defined connections between different users and those connections may be stored in connection database  as well. Particular embodiments of connection database  may allow users to specify their relationships with other users. In particular embodiments, for example, these user defined connections allows users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, relatives, co-workers, partners, and so forth. In particular embodiments, users may select from predefined types of connections, or define their own connection types, as needed.","In particular embodiments, the web server  links the social networking system  via the network  to one or more client devices . Network  generally represents a network or collection of networks (such as the Internet or a corporate intranet, or a combination of both) over which client devices  may access the external website  and the social network system . In particular embodiments, the web server  serves web pages, as well as other web-related content, such as Java, Flash, XML, and so forth. Particular embodiments of the web server  may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system  and the client devices . In particular embodiments, the messages may be instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text and SMS messages, or any other suitable messaging technique.","In particular embodiments, the action logger  is capable of receiving communications from the web server  about user actions on and\/or off the social networking system . In particular embodiments, the action logger  populates the action log  with information about user actions in order to track them. More specifically, any action that a particular user takes with respect to another user is associated with each user's profile through information maintained in a database or other data repository, such as the action log . In particular embodiments, the actions taken by the members that are recorded in the action log  may be actions taken by the members on the social networking system  or actions taken by the members on the external website . In particular embodiments, the actions taken by the members on an external website  are communicated to the web server  and the web server  sends a request to the action logger  to record the actions in the action log . In particular embodiments, such actions may include, for example, adding a connection to the other user, sending a message to the other user, reading a message from the other user, viewing content associated with the other user, attending an event posted by another user, among others. Additionally, in particular embodiments, actions in connection with other objects may be directed at particular users, and these actions may be associated with those users as well.","In particular embodiments, when a user takes an action on the social networking system , the action is recorded in an action log . In particular embodiments, the social networking system  maintains the action log  as a database of entries. In particular embodiments, when an action is taken on the social networking system , the social networking system  adds an entry for that action to the action log .","In particular embodiments, a user of the social networking system may share media hosted by external websites with the social networking system and this action may be received by action logger  and stored in action log . In particular embodiments, external websites may have \u201cshare\u201d buttons that are operative to transmit links to the content to the social networking system and post the links as wall post entries for a user profile. In particular embodiments, the buttons are operative to transmit activity stream entries to the social networking system, which will post the entry in a news feed. In particular embodiments, for example, a user can access a photo, a photo album, a video clip, or other media from a client device  and post links to that content on the wall associated with a user profile on social networking system.","In particular embodiments, presence server  maintains data pertaining to user presence received by external website  and social networking system . In particular embodiments, when users of the social networking system  are accessing one or more external websites , a social browser extension may continuously send asynchronous messages to the social networking system , notifying the social networking system that the user is present and accessing one or more external websites . In particular embodiments, once these messages are received by social networking system , they are then stored in presence server . In particular embodiments, the social browser may continuously send asynchronous messages to the social networking system  at particular time intervals, such as every 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, and so on. In particular embodiments, the user may specify that they are \u201conline.\u201d In particular embodiments, the user may select preferences for whether their presence information is transmitted to the social networking system. In particular embodiments, one or more aspects of the user's privacy settings may be stored locally (and\/or synchronized with privacy controls database ) at the browser application in the client device to obviate the need for remote access.","In particular embodiments, privacy controls database  may store a user's privacy data for a user's settings for each user datum associated with the user and the user's settings for third party applications. For example, a user may have selected default privacy settings or a user may have specifically excluded certain entities from viewing a user datum or particular type of user data, and all of that privacy data for all users and friends of users may be stored in the privacy controls database . In particular embodiments, a user's privacy data may comprise privacy settings associated with any aspect of the user profile, including changes that the user makes to the user profile, events, locations, media, activities, connections between one or more users, the news feed associated with the user or any other action that the user takes in the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the privacy settings associated with the privacy controls database  may be provided and stored at different levels of granularity. In particular embodiments, for example, the information to be shared may be specific information, such as, work phone number, or a set of related information, such as, personal information including several pieces of related information including profile photo, home phone number, and status. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the privacy settings associated with the privacy controls database  may apply to all the information associated with the user in the social networking system.","In particular embodiments, the specification of the set of entities that may access particular user information may also be specified at various levels of granularity. In particular embodiments, the user may specify any number of entities with which information may be shared. In particular embodiments, sets of entities with which information may be shared may include, for example, specified friends of the user, all friends of the user, all friends of friends, all applications, and all external systems. In particular embodiments, for example, the user may provide a list of external systems that may access certain information as well. In particular embodiments, may specify a set of entities that includes exceptions that are not allowed to access the user's information. In particular embodiments, for example, the user of the social networking system may allow all external systems to access the user's work information but specify a list of external systems that are not allowed to access the work information. In particular embodiments, the list of exceptions that are not allowed to access certain information of the user may be a \u201cblock list.\u201d In particular embodiments, external systems belonging to a block list specified by a user of the social networking system are blocked from accessing the information specified in the privacy setting stored in privacy controls database . Particular embodiments contemplate various combinations of granularity of permitted access or denial of access depending on the type of user information and sets of entities with which information may be shared or accessed by the sets of entities, as specified by the user and stored in the privacy controls database .","In particular embodiments, an authorization server may enforce the privacy settings of the users of the social networking system, such as described above with respect to the privacy policy. In particular embodiments, the privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user may be shared. In particular embodiments, as described above, the privacy controls database  comprises the privacy data for a user's settings for each user datum associated with the user and the user's settings for third party applications. More specifically, the privacy data for a user's settings may specify particular information associated with a user and the entity or entities with whom the information may be shared. In particular embodiments, the entities with which information may be shared, may include users, third party applications, external websites, or any other entity that can potentially access the information. In particular embodiments, the information that may be shared by a user may comprise any aspect of the user profile, events, locations, media, activities, or the news feed associated with the user. Privacy settings may also be configured to allow users to control the extent to which information concerning a user's browsing activities may be shared with other users. In particular embodiments, for example, a user may configure the user's privacy settings to limit sharing of the user's browsing activity information to first-degree contacts of the user, or a custom-defined group of users. In particular embodiments, a user may also limit the sharing of browsing activity information by excluding a user's browsing activity relative to certain domains, times of day, and the like.","Particular embodiments relate to a plug-in software application (hereinafter referred to as \u201csocial browser extension\u201d) that operates or executes in the context of a browser (e.g., a web browser) or other application client that consumes structured documents. In particular embodiments, the functionality described herein may be incorporated directly into a browser client application, as opposed to being a plug-in. In either embodiment, the social browser extension may be implemented as one or more software modules that are operative to cause a processor and computing device to perform the operations recited herein.","Dynamic Chat Box","Particular embodiments describe a dynamically generated chat box that facilitates communication between two or more users of a social networking system who are concurrently accessing a structured document. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension records click-stream activity for users that have accessed a structured document and transmits data representing the click-stream activity to the social networking system. This click-stream activity and social graph information may be used to enhance the user's browsing experience by dynamically suggesting a chat between a first user and other users that may be concurrently accessing (or who may have recently accessed) a particular document and\/or the same web domain. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension corresponding to a first user may also query the social networking system based on the currently accessed domain and\/or URL (and optionally, the references and objects identified in the page), to determine whether there are other users concurrently accessing a particular content object, or who have accessed a particular content object within a threshold window of time. In particular embodiments, if one or more other users has been identified, a chat messaging interface may be displayed to the first user. In particular embodiments, the chat messaging interface displayed to the first user has controls that allow the first user to establish a chat session with a second user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"210"},"In particular embodiments, when a user accesses a structured document of external website  through a client device , the social browser extension may record click-stream activity for the user accessing the structured document and communicates the click-stream data to social networking system  where social networking data stores the data in data store  and the data is added to the social graph. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension transmits click-stream data for users accessing the structured document.","In particular embodiments, for example, social browser extension communicates click-stream data to social networking system  in real time as the user is accessing the structured document. In particular embodiments, the click events taking place on external website  may indicate relationships between various objects, such as a user interacting with a structured document. In particular embodiments, data store  may store the URL of the structured document that a user is accessing, the userID of the user interacting with the structured document who is also a user of the social networking system , and a time stamp representing when the structured document was accessed.","In particular embodiments, if a user interacts with the same structured document at a later time, the old time stamp may be updated to the current time to represent that the user is currently interacting with the structured document. In particular embodiments, for example, data store  may store the real time click-stream data in a hash table or any other optimized method for storing large amounts of real time click-stream data. In particular embodiments, for example social networking system  may index the real time click-stream data using relationships in the social graph. In particular embodiments, the indices enable the social networking system  to efficiently process the real time click-stream data. In particular embodiments, data store  stores real time click-stream data for all time.","In particular embodiments, for example, one or more users may be accessing the an article on the New York Times' website at http:\/\/www.nytimes.com, such as http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/04\/13\/science\/space\/13shuttle.html?hp. In particular embodiments, for each user accessing this structured document at the New York Times' website, click-stream data comprising each userID, the URL of the structured document, and a time stamp representing the current time may be sent to the social networking system.","Particular embodiments may receive from the remote host an indication that one or more second users have accessed the content object, as illustrated in step . Particular embodiments of the social browser extension may query the social networking system to determine if any second users have accessed or are concurrently interacting with the displayed structured document. In particular embodiments, the second user may be any one of the first user's first (and possibly second degree) contacts or associations. In particular embodiments, for example, the current user ID and the URL of the currently loaded page may be queried. And particular embodiments, for example, may query the social networking system for the presence of the second user at the currently loaded URL of the displayed structured document.","In particular embodiments, the social browser extension queries the social networking system for the user ID of the first user who have viewed a structured document. In particular embodiments for example, the query may be, for example, a userID, a URL, and t, where t=T\u2212T; Where T=Current Time and T=30 s, 1 min, 5 min, or any other particular interval of time to infinity. In particular embodiments, the userID queried may be an exact match of the current userID or a partial match of the current userID. In particular embodiments, the query string for the URL may be the entirety of the URL currently being viewed, such as the scheme, host, and path. In particular embodiments, the query string for the URL may be only the scheme and host for the URL currently being viewed. In particular embodiments, t indicates a particular time in the past as a method of restricting the amount of click-stream data that is returned. In particular embodiments, for example, if a user is currently viewing a structured document, the click-stream data farther back in time, for example 30 min in the past, may be less relevant to the user than click-stream data going back 5 min. In particular embodiments, for example, click-stream data may be returned for second users concurrently viewing the structured document.","In particular embodiments, the social browser extension may receive from the social networking system an indication that one or more second users are currently present. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension may query the social networking system to determine presence of the one or more second users. As described above, in particular embodiments, the presence server  may have data for the presence information for the one or more users. In particular embodiments, the social networking system may then transmit the presence information for the one or more second users to the social browser extension.","In particular embodiments, once the click-stream data has been recorded, queried, and results are returned to the social browser application, the social browser extension may modify the web page to display a chat messaging interface to the first user at the client device. Particular embodiments, responsive to the indication, display a chat messaging interface to the first user at the client device, as illustrated in step . In particular embodiments, the chat messaging interface includes identifiers for the one or more second users and messaging controls operative to establish a chat session with the one or more second users. In particular embodiments, the chat interface may be a pop-up or an overlay.","In particular embodiments, in order to modify the structured document, the social browser extension accesses the Document Object Model (DOM) (or other suitable) representation of the currently rendered structured document generated by the web browser. In particular embodiments, the social browser extension may modify, or cause to be modified the DOM representation of the target webpage (without necessarily modifying the native HTML or other markup language cone or content transmitted to the browser for rendering the target webpage (which is generally stored separately)) to indicate that the objects within the structured document have been accessed by one or more second users. In particular embodiments, the modified DOM representation may display the chat messaging interface as a sidebar or as an overlay panel. In particular embodiments, the chat messaging interface may display the one or more second users or the messaging controls as highlighted, colored, bolded, or any other such modification that would indicate that the one or more second users are concurrently accessing the content object. In particular embodiments, the chat messaging interface may display second users who have accessed the current URL or are currently accessing the current URL.
