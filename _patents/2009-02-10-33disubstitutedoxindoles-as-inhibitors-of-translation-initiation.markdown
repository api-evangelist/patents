No. 11\/463,421, filed Aug. 9, 2006; which is a continuation of PCT application no. PCT\/US2005\/004373, designating the United States and filed Feb. 11, 2005; which claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional application No. 60\/544,384, filed Feb. 13, 2004; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with Government support under Grant Number 5 U19 CA87427 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit translation initiation, pharmaceutical compositions of the novel compounds, and methods of treating medical disorders.","Translation, the mRNA-directed synthesis of proteins, occurs in three distinct steps: initiation, elongation and termination. Translation initiation is a complex process in which the two ribosomal subunits and methionyl tRNA (met-tRNA) assemble on a properly aligned mRNA to commence chain elongation at the AUG initiation codon. The established scanning mechanism for initiation involves the formation of a ternary complex among eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP and met-tRNA. The ternary complex recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S pre-initiation complex. This complex recruits mRNA in cooperation with other initiation factors such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which recognizes the 7-methyl-guanidine cap (m-GTP cap) in an mRNA molecule and forms the 48S pre-initiation complex. Cap recognition facilitates the 43S complex entry at the 5\u2032 end of a capped mRNA. Subsequently, this complex migrates linearly until it reaches the first AUG codon, where a 60S ribosomal subunit joins the complex, and the first peptide bond is formed (Pain (1996) 236:747-771).","Several features of the mRNA structure influence the efficiency of its translation. These include the m-GTP cap, the primary sequence surrounding the AUG codon and the length and secondary structure of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR). Indeed, a moderately long, unstructured 5\u2032 UTR with a low G and C base content seems to be optimal to ensure high translational efficiency. Surprisingly, sequence analysis of a large number of vertebrate cDNAs has shown that although most transcripts have features that ensure translational fidelity, many do not appear to be designed for efficient translation (Kozak (1991) 115:887-903). Many vertebrate mRNAs contain 5\u2032 UTRs that are hundreds of nucleotides long with a remarkably high GC content, indicating that they are highly structured because G and C bases tend to form highly stable bonds. Because highly structured and stable 5\u2032 UTRs are the major barrier to translation, mRNAs with stable secondary structure in their 5\u2032 UTR are translated inefficiently and their translation is highly dependent on the activity of translation initiation factors.","mRNAs with complex, highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs include a disproportionately high number of proto-oncogenes such as the G1 cyclins, transcription and growth factors, cytokines and other critical regulatory proteins. In contrast, mRNAs that encode globins, albumins, histones and other housekeeping proteins rarely have highly structured, GC-rich 5\u2032 UTRs (Kozak (1994) 76; 815-21; Kozak (1999) 234:187-208). The fact that genes encoding for regulatory but not for housekeeping proteins frequently produce transcripts with highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs indicates that extensive control of the expression of regulatory genes occurs at the level of translation. In other words, low efficiency of translation is a control mechanism which modulates the yield of proteins such as cyclins, mos, c-myc, VEGF, TNF, among others, that could be harmful if overproduced.","Translation initiation is a critical step in the regulation of cell growth because the expression of most oncogenes and cell growth regulatory proteins is translationally regulated. One approach to inhibiting translation initiation has recently been identified using small molecule known as translation initiation inhibitors. Without intending to be bound by theory,  sets forth a summary of the anti-cancer mechanism of action of translation initiation inhibitors such as clotrimazole (CLT) and the diaryloxindole (DAO) compounds of the present invention. CLT inhibits translation initiation by sustained depletion of intracellular Castores. Depletion of intracellular Castores activates \u201cinterferon-inducible\u201d \u201cdouble-stranded RNA activated\u201d protein kinase (PKR) which phosphorylates and thereby inhibits the \u03b1 subunit of eIF2. Since the activity of eIF2 is required for translation initiation, its inhibition by compounds such as CLT reduces the overall rate of protein synthesis. Because most cell regulatory proteins are encoded for by mRNAs containing highly structured 5\u2032 UTRs, they are poorly translated and their translation depends heavily on translation initiation factors such as eIF2 and eIF4. Therefore, inhibition of translation initiation preferentially affects the synthesis and expression of growth regulatory proteins such as G1 cyclins. Sequential synthesis and expression of G1 cyclins (D1, E and A) is necessary to drive the cell cycle beyond the restriction point in late G1. Thus, the decreased synthesis and expression of G1 cyclins resulting from CLT-induced inhibition of translation initiation causes cell cycle arrest in G1 and inhibits cancer cell and tumor growth (Aktas et al. (1998) 95:8280-8285, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).","Like CLT, the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) depletes internal calcium stores, and exhibits anti-carcinogenic activity. Unlike CLT, however, EPA is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), a fatty acid-activated transcription factor. Although EPA and other ligands of PPAR\u03b3, such as troglitazone and ciglitazone, inhibit cell proliferation, they do so in a PPAR\u03b3-independent manner (Palakurthi et al. (2000) 60:2919; and Palakurthi et al. (2001) 61:6213, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes).","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to compounds that inhibit translation initiation, and the use of such compounds for treating (1) proliferative disorders, (2) non-proliferative, degenerative disorders, (3) viral infections, and\/or (4) disorders associated with viral infections are disclosed. Certain examples are directed to the use of a combination of the compounds described herein for treating (1) proliferative disorders, (2) non-proliferative, degenerative disorders, (3) viral infections, and\/or (4) disorders associated with viral infections.","In at least certain examples, DAO compounds are provided. The terms \u201cdiaryloxindole\u201d AND \u201cDAO\u201d are intended to include substituted diphenyloxindole compounds such as, for example, 3-(5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one-type compounds.

The iterative approach involved an initial selection of compounds which were subjected to one or more bioassays, such as those described in Example III. Additional compounds were then synthesized based on bioassay and\/or structural (e.g., electronic and steric nature of various diaryloxindole compound substituents) data. The compounds synthesized addressed the electronics and the sterics by substituting the three phenyl rings and the nitrogen with various functional groups. The symmetric diphenyl compounds were obtained using triflic acid (TfOH) following previously reported procedures (Klumpp et al. (1998) 63:4481, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes), while the unsymmetrical compounds were synthesized using a two step procedure. The first step involved a Grignard addition to isatin using appropriately substituted starting materials, and the key second step involved the generation of a quaternary center at the three position of the oxindole ring. This was accomplished by an acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts type condensation of step B with the appropriate aromatic ring to generate diaryloxindoles (Hewawasam et al. (2002) & 12:1023, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes). For activated ring systems that contained an electron-donating group, p-toluene sulfonic acid in dichloroethane allowed the condensation to occur smoothly, while the unactivated ring systems required the use of triflic acid, which is much stronger than p-toluene sulfonic acid.","As a non-limiting example, compounds 1272 and 1273 (set forth in Table 1) were synthesized starting from 3-bromoaniline, which upon condensation with hydroxylamine and chloral hydrate followed by concentrated sulfuric acid yielded an inseparable regioisomeric mixture of 4- and 6-bromo isatins. The addition of the two phenyl groups to the three position of the oxindole allowed easy chromatographic separation of the 4- and 6-bromo-3,3-diphenyloxindoles 1272 and 1273. Table 1 sets forth biological data for diaryloxindole compounds including, but not limited to 1272 and 1273.

(NMR) and liquid-chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS).","As a non-limiting example, isatins and substituted isatins (intermediates set forth in Tables 1, 3, 5 and 7) were synthesized by heating a solution of appropriately protected aniline (0.1 moles), chloral hydrate (0.11 moles), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.2 moles) in concentrated HSO(12.5 g) and water (700 mL) to 95\u00b0 C. for ten minutes. The solution was then kept at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The cream colored isonitroso intermediate was filtered off, washed with water and dried. This compound was ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle, and added, with stirring, in portions over 30 minutes to concentrated HSO(40 g) maintained at 60-65\u00b0 C. The mixture was then heated at 95\u00b0 C. for one hour and poured onto ice (300 g). The resulting solid was filtered to give the appropriate substituted isatin.","As another non-limiting example, 3-Aryl-3-hydroxy-substituted-oxindoles (intermediates set forth in tables 2-7 and 9-14) were synthesized by adding dropwise a 1 M solution of alkyl or aryl magnesium halide (0.33 mole) to an appropriately substituted isatin (0.1 mole) in 60 mL THF at 0\u00b0 C. The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and let spin at room temperature for twelve hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with a saturated solution of NHCl (100 mL) and diluted with 100 mL of dichloromethane. The layers were separated, the organic layer was washed with water followed by brine, dried over NaSOand filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to yield the product.","As another non-limiting example, symmetric substituted di-aryloxindoles (final compounds set forth in Tables 1 and 8) were synthesized by adding two mL of substituted benzene to a mixture of appropriately substituted isatins (1 mmol) combined with three mL of freshly distilled triflic acid. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for eight hours. The product mixture was poured over 25 g of ice and extracted into either chloroform or toluene. The organic solution was washed with water and then brine and dried over NaSO. Concentration in vacuo yielded the 3,3-diphenyl-substituted oxindoles.","As another non-limiting example, unsymmetrically substituted di-aryloxindoles (final compounds set forth in Tables 2-7 and 9-13) were synthesized by adding freshly distilled triflic acid (1 mmol) in 1 mL dichloromethane to a mixture of appropriately substituted 3-aryl-3-hydroxy-oxindole (0.1 mmol) and appropriately substituted benzene dissolved in 1 mL dichloromethane. The reaction was maintained at room temperature and monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Upon completion, the mixture was poured over ice (25 g) and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried and concentrated in vacuo to yield the desired product.","As another non-limiting example, unsymmetrically substituted di-aryloxindoles (final compounds set forth in Tables 2-7 and 9-13) were also synthesized by adding p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.3 mmol) in 5 mL dichloromethane to a mixture of appropriately substituted 3-Aryl-3-hydroxy-oxindole (0.1 mmol) and appropriately substituted benzene dissolved in 10 mL dichloroethane. The reaction was heated to 95\u00b0 C. and monitored by TLC and LCMS, upon completion the reaction mixture was cooled and filtered to remove the p-toluenesulfonic acid. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and purified to yield the desired product.","As another non-limiting example, 3-(5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (compound 1181) was synthesized by adding dropwise a 1 M solution of phenylmagnesiumbromide (0.33 mole) to isatin (15 g, 0.1 mole) in 60 mL THF at 0\u00b0 C. The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and let stir at room temperature for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with a saturated solution of NHCl (100 mL) and diluted with 100 mL of dichloromethane. The layers were separated, the organic layer was washed with water followed by brine, dried over NaSO, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to yield 20.1 g (90%) of 3-hydroxy-3-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one. A mixture of the above solid (2.5 g, 10 mmole), p-t-Bu-phenol (1.5 g, 10 mmol), p-toluenesulfonic acid (3 g) in 40 mL dichloroethane, was heated to 95\u00b0 C. for six hours. The mixture was cooled and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to yield 2.4 g (66%) of the desired product (compound 1181).","As another non-limiting example, 4-tert-butyl-N-[5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(2-oxo-3-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl)-phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide (compound 1430) was synthesized by adding dropwise 4-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonyl chloride (8 g, 34 mmol) in 5 mL dichloromethane to a stirring solution of 5-Amino-2-methyl-phenol (4 g, 32 mmol) in 20 mL pyridine and letting the mixture spin overnight at room temperature. The resulting mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the product was purified by column chromatography to yield 8 g (78%) of 4-tert-butyl-N-(3-hydroxy-4-methyl-phenyl)-benzenesulfonamide. A mixture of 3-hydroxy-3-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (3.9 g, 17 mmol), 4-tert-butyl-N-(3-hydroxy-4-methyl-phenyl)-benzenesulfonamide (7 g, 22 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (6.5 g, 32 mmol) in dichloroethane was refluxed for 12 hours. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature to yield a colorless solid. The solid was filtered and purified using column chromatography to yield 8 g (88%) of the desired product (compound 1430).","Without intending to be bound by theory, the mechanism of action of translation initiation inhibitors is set forth in , and includes the depletion (complete or partial depletion) of intracellular calcium (Ca) stores and phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Compounds synthesized using the approaches described herein were screened for their ability to partially deplete intracellular Castores using FURA-2AM loaded cells (Benzaquen et al. (1995) 1:534, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes). A limited subset of compounds were further screened for their ability to deplete endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca. The Cacontent of the ER was monitored using ER-targeted, Casensitive, recombinant proteins. These recombinant proteins emitted light by fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a function of the Cacontent of the medium. Such assays are previously described (Miyawaki, A.; Mizuno, H.; Llopis, J.; Tsien, R. Y.; Jalink, K. , Oxford University Press: Oxford, London, 2001; pp 3-16, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes). Compounds that depleted Cawere further evaluated for their ability to phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis using the phospho-specific anti-eIF2\u03b1 antibody, as previously described (Aktas et al. (1998) 95:8280, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes). Compounds that both depleted ER Caand phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 were tested in a lung cancer cell line (A549) for cell growth inhibition as previously described (Palakurthi et al. (2000) 60:2919, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).","Compound 1181 (set forth in Table 2) was determined to be a Cadepleting translation initiation inhibitor, as it depleted ER-Ca, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, inhibited growth of a cancer cell line (A549), and decreased squamous cell carcinoma tumor mass in mice (, A-C and ). Using compound 1181 for comparison, additional compounds were screened for their ability to inhibit translation initiation in a Cadepletion-dependent manner (Tables 1 to 14).","One set of compounds (Table 1) had a variation of the functional groups at the positions Rand Ron the oxindole phenyl ring. Substitutions including, but not limited to, 5-Br, 4-Cl, 5-OCFand 6-Et groups, resulted in compounds that depleted intracellular Ca. Compound 1392, which has 4-Cl and 7-COH substitutions, showed improved eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which correlated with improved growth inhibition of cancer cells. Compound 1398 (a negative control) exhibited reduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation relative to compound 1392, with a concomitant reduced potency of tumor cell growth inhibition.","The positional effect of a bromo group was next investigated by placing a bromo group at 4, 5, 6 and 7 positions on the phenyl ring of the oxindole to generate compounds 1272, 1205, 1273 and 1207, respectively. The 7-substitution abrogated Cadepletion activity, and none of the compounds exhibited an increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation relative to compound 1392.","Compound 1430 (Table 7) released calcium and showed a 5-fold increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation over DMSO at 5 \u03bcM. Ternary complex assay was 8-fold over DMSO at 20 \u03bcM, and cell growth was inhibited at <1 \u03bcM. The plasma levels for this in mice were estimated using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Compound 1430 was orally administered at 160 mg\/kg, 240 mg\/kg, and 320 mg\/kg to DBA\/2J mice and the plasma concentration was measured at three time points, one hour, three hours, and six hours, and is set forth in Table 15. The plasma was isolated from the mice by heart-lung puncture and the samples were processed and analyzed by LC-MS. The concentrations at each time and dose are in nmoles\/mL of plasma (n.d.=not detected; X=not determined).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"168pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 15"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Dose"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Time","320 mg\/kg","240 mg\/kg","160 mg\/kg"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1 hour","14.0","6.8","5.7"]},{"entry":[{},"3 hours","3.8","4.0","3.8"]},{"entry":[{},"6 hours","2.8","n.d.","X"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Other embodiments will be evident to those of skill in the art.
