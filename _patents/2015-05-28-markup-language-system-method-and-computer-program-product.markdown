RMML brings to spreadsheet manipulation routines the economic and productivity benefits of (1) standardization, (2) interchangeable parts, (3) specialization and assembly-line techniques in creation, and (4) economies of scale in creation and deployment. In addition, RMML brings to spreadsheet macros and numerical programming, some of the benefits of the World Wide Web: (1) widespread accessibility on demand, (2) ability to search for documents (in this case, search for capabilities and behavior of routines instead of text or data), and (3) the ability to hyperlink documents (including the ability of macros to call each other remotely).","In accordance with an implementation of the present invention, a data processing system method is provided that receives a macro defined to perform an operation on a series of numerical values and receives a series of numerical values having tags indicating characteristics of the numerical values.

Generally, RDML permits the browsing and manipulation of numbers, and allows the viewer to act as a combination Web browser and spreadsheet\/analytic application that may automatically read numbers from multiple online sources, understand their meaning, and manipulate them without human intervention. The RDML data viewer may use the Internet to obtain requested sets of numbers like HTML does for text. Using RDML, it is possible to form a search on the Internet that is a true query of numbers. One such request is the creation of a list of quarterly revenues from 1996 to 1997 pertaining to companies with sales growth greater than 10 percent and no taxable income. After receiving any requested sets of numerical data, the data viewer may automatically transform and combine them even if they are in different formats (i.e., one in thousands of U.S. dollars and another in hundreds of French francs) on a single graphical display without requiring the user to make manual adjustments. The user may then make single-click adjustments to the display (e.g., adjust for inflation, currencies, time periods, number precision, etc.) to see different aspects of the received information. RDML generally facilitates numerical browsing by associating numbers with attributes describing the meaning of the numbers.","Although the preferred embodiment of RDML is a markup language that is a fully compliant implementation of XML version 1.0, other implementations are possible. XML is described in detail in \u201cXML Bible,\u201d Elliotte Rusty Harold, IDG Books Worldwide, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference. The RDML data viewer is a data browser, data manipulator, data viewer (in the form of charts, spreadsheets, etc.) and general user interface for data documents. It greatly extends the capabilities provided by current spreadsheet and database management programs. In addition to extended capabilities, it lowers costs to businesses by permitting efficient reuse of data, functions, and report formats.","The RDML data viewer works with RDML-formatted data documents, which are files that may be stored locally, over a network, including the Internet, or in any combination of sources. The structure of the RDML data files allows the RDML data viewer to act as a combination browser and analytic program, such as a spreadsheet, which can automatically read, interpret and manipulate numbers in its integrated analytic program. The RDML data viewer also provides a \u201cmacro\u201d development and management scheme which allows users to create custom routines for the manipulation, transformation and display of RDML-formatted data. Macros and related aspects are described in greater detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","102","102","102","102","100","108","108","100"]},"Analysis routines can be developed for data and placed in their own documents referred to as Reusable Macro Markup Language (\u201cRMML\u201d) Macro Documents  which are another input to the data viewer  and are optional. These routines are reusable; they can be applied to virtually any data document meeting the requirements set forth in the RMML document . For example, an RMML document  may contain routines for converting RDML data to different currencies, and any data denominated in currency can use the RMML currency conversion macro. The preferred embodiment of RMML is also a fully compliant implementation of XML version 1.0, although other embodiments are possible.","Similarly, Reusable Data Style Language (\u201cRDSL\u201d) style sheets , another optional input to the data viewer , can be applied to data documents to create specially-formatted output reports. A RDSL is a fully compliant implementation of Extensible Style Language (\u201cXSL\u201d) which is described in detail in \u201cXML Bible,\u201d Elliotte Rusty Harold, IDG Books Worldwide, 1999. These RDSL documents  are XSL-compliant style sheets which essentially act as report writers for RDML data documents . A typical use would be for data documents containing corporate financial statements. A single RDML data document  may contain a set of financial statements, but several different style sheets could be applied: one to show the data in annual columns, one to show it in a quarterly breakdown, one to show it in European format, and so forth. The RDML data viewer  automatically combines data documents  and style documents  to create reports.","RDML dramatically reduces the expense, time, and complexity of data manipulation by addressing the aforementioned problems of documentation of data, non-standardization of analytic routines, and low conceptual-level calculations of data. RDML addresses the problem of the separation of data and its documentation by encapsulating data and its documentation together in machine-readable form that can be used interactively. This differs from the approach of conventional relational databases in which data is kept in the computer and the documentation typically kept in a three-ring binder or other printed document. The separation of data and its documentation often ensures the need for high-priced database programmers every time the data must be accessed, used or transferred. Documentation in RDML also differs from that of spreadsheets, which tend to be personal in that the documentation is in the head and personal notes of the creator. Iii one implementation consistent with the present invention, RDML encapsulates machine-readable documentation with the data. The data and its documentation (metadata) are used together by the data viewer  to interpret what the numbers mean, how they are to be used, and how they are to be displayed. The small up-front investment in refining the raw data pays off in the lessened need for human labor to access and reuse the data in the future. RDML incorporates several important types of metadata: sources, contacts, license requirements, expirations and update information, data types, data classes, handling instructions (e.g., what to do with nulls, missing values, etc.), units and measurements, and other information needed to produce the various presentations.","Use of RDML addresses the problem of non-standardization by defining standards for both data characteristics and analytic routine interfaces. Standardization leads to component reuse, automation of production, and more rapid development of product enhancements. While the computer industry has developed standards for file formats and function-level interfaces, it has not developed general data format or content-analysis standards. For example, once data is input to an application (whether spreadsheet, database or other), the user may want to manipulate the data and see basic statistics for the different line items (sums, averages, % changes, variances, and so forth), adjustments for standard changes (adjustments for inflation, conformance to industry indexes, % of stock market averages, etc.), or standard ratios (debt\/equity, price\/earnings, etc.) Because there is neither a standard general data format, nor a standard analytic routine interface, users currently create each of these manipulation routines from primitive coding. In spreadsheets, they must input formulas and conversion factors number by number, and in databases, they must write SQL queries or other programming routines to manipulate the data.","RDML provides both the data standard and the function interface for manipulation routines. This means that a routine can be written to apply to any line item that meets the conditions it imposes, and these routines are reusable. Currently, conventional spreadsheet macros (one analogue to RDML macros ) are typically only used in the spreadsheet for which they were designed. The macros cannot typically be used in another spreadsheet where the numbers may be in different cells or in different units. RDML macros  are not dependent on cell position, or human intervention to conform data: they can be directly used by others for other data sets. If a user writes a routine which, for instance, calculates and graphs a moving average of a time series, it can be used by any time series in any RDML document .","While solving documentation and standardization problems, use of RDML also addresses the problem of calculations occurring at too low a conceptual level by creating data \u201cobjects\u201d at the line item and document levels, whereas conventional spreadsheets operate only at the cell (single number) level. For instance, calculations that may be common to a set of data, i.e., a line item, may operate more efficiently because they can be applied once, as opposed to being applied individually to many different single numbers or cells. Furthermore, analytic routines (macros) can be combined, applied successively, or used by inheritance to create new routines. The line item orientation dramatically reduces the number of formulas that need to be written (one per line instead of one per number). It also increases the readability of program code, because the user can review the logic at a higher level of abstraction.","In addition to solving these problems, RDML reduces costs, time, and complexity for operations on the side of the data consumer, the data publisher and the program developer. To utilize and manipulate data, typically, a user retrieving data over the Internet views a text version of the data, prints the data (in HTML, ASCII or PDF format), and then types the numbers into a spreadsheet or database program. The RDML data viewer  automates this process by making the data immediately available to other programs as interpretable data: the user does not need to retype it. Upon locating numerical sets of data from multiple online sources, the data viewer  automatically normalizes, collates, transforms, and formats the data.","Some conventional systems make data available for download as data in either a common spreadsheet format (such as Lotus or Excel), or in a comma-delimited or other common text format. This at least saves the user the necessity of retyping certain numbers, but creates a new problem of manipulating the data to get it into a more usable form (e.g., normalized, standardized).","As such, RDML (and its related data viewer) \u201cnormalizes\u201d data for added efficiency. Normalizing data is primarily a matter of conforming key fields, including matching dissimilar fields, resolving conflicts in categories, resolving the handling of duplicates, etc. In order to be useful, data should be conformed to a format that can be read by an application (such as a graphing routine, or calculation routine). For example, the application may expect data aggregated by year, whereas the incoming data may be aggregated by month. The user must manipulate the input to make it conform to the form expected by the application. RDML performs these tasks automatically, using embedded documentation regarding the input data to make any necessary conforming changes to the input. In the time series example above, RDML would aggregate the monthly data into yearly data, using embedded documentation to determine whether the aggregation should be a sum, an average, etc.","Additionally, comparing data is a primary use of spreadsheets. Examples include comparing the financial statements of different companies, comparing the statistics from different states, and comparing different economic time series. When these data categories come from different sources, they are usually not directly compatible: the user must lay out the data items on a spreadsheet or similar program in a manner similar to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. As with normalization, RDML uses documentation embedded in the various input files to determine how different line items and values should be collated.","Once data is normalized and collated, the RDML data viewer  transforms the data automatically. Conventionally, users typically make a series of adjustments to the numbers in the data set. The input data may be, for example, denominated in \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d while output is desired in \u201cbillions of yen.\u201d RDML provides a set of indicators for the most common transformations, permitting automatic machine translation of the numbers from their input state to the state desired by the user.","A conventional method of formatting data for output on a PC is to cut-and-paste the data to a formatting application (word processor, graph generator, spreadsheet or other), and then mark up the data to change the format to the desired output. This is time consuming and not repeatable\u2014if the data is input again with a slight change, the whole formatting process must be repeated. The RDML data viewer  avoids the cut-and-paste approach by saving the original data in a central storage object (described below) in the data viewer  and applying separate formatting instructions to create different views . The user can switch among views  with a single mouse click and the program handles all format and numerical conversions for the user.","In some of the more advanced database management systems, a \u201creport-writer\u201d approach is used. Like the RDML data viewer , this approach applies a template to a centrally stored dataset. The problem is that the data sets are not standardized; a report writer template written for one dataset cannot typically be used for another. RDML, however, provides for reuse of style sheets in the same manner it provides reuse of data and macros.","In addition to the above-mentioned problems, RDML solves problems relating to \u201clive\u201d connections of numerical data involving multiple sources that typically require programming expertise. Whether the aim is to draw numbers from multiple sources over a wide area network (e.g., the Internet) or over a corporate LAN, incorporating remote data is complicated by many issues: connection protocols, programming language dependencies, data type inconsistencies, error handling, data transformations, etc. Programmers can surmount these problems at a certain expense, but not in a flexible way that permits reuse, and users again rely on custom programming. In response to the cost, time requirements, and inflexibility of the custom programming approaches, casual users resort to labor-based solutions. In a typical case, a financial spreadsheet is created with, for example, ten assumptions related to interest rates. Every time the spreadsheet is used, the creator looks the numbers up in the newspaper and types the results into the appropriate cells, and any necessary transformations are made by hand. RDML removes the need for custom programming and manual input by providing a way to include numbers from remote RDML documents  in normal formulas. The RDML data viewer  automatically looks to the specified address on the web to retrieve the numbers, makes any necessary transformations (for example, from yen to current dollars) and places the result in the correct formula. In this way, an RDML document  or macro  can draw on multiple documents at once. Because its documentation is machine-readable, it can be read by multiple systems, none of which need be aware of the physical layout or data types of the others.","Lastly, the use of RDML enables client-side processing using Internet-supplied data thereby realizing a number of advantages. After data is retrieved, analytic routines (macros) are performed on the client side, as opposed to the conventional approach in web-based data analysis, in which the analytic routines are performed on the server side. Whereas sensitive data and calculations can remain local in the RDML data viewer , the user need not fear that sensitive data is being misused by a company running a server, or that data is being misappropriated over the web. Additionally, it increases speed because updates to graphs, reports and spreadsheets can be near instantaneous because there is no need for the round-trip Internet transmission, or the loading and execution of a routine on a busy server. Users may also prefer local copies of data that they control and to which they have immediate access.","I.A. RMML Overview","Methods and systems in accordance with the present invention provide macros and RMML, which allow numerical analysis routines to be written quickly, cheaply, and in a form that is usable by a broad range of data documents in RDML. RMML macros provide reusable user-defined calculations for use in conjunction with RDML that automatically manipulate and display numerical data contained in RDML markup documents. RMML also allows spreadsheet type macros to be posted as web documents, to be searched by search engines, to be combined into more complex programs, and to be reused with many data documents.","For example, a user viewing a chart having a series of data in an RDML data viewer may apply, with one mouse click, a macro to that chart and see an instantaneous (or nearly instantaneous) transformation of the charted series of data. Not only is the data changed, but the titles, legends, footnotes, axis scales and other properties are also changed. As a further example, a user may be looking at a time series trend of automobile sales in millions of dollars. By clicking on a macro entitled \u201c% change\u201d, the chart recalculates itself according the percentage change from period to period. The y-axis title changes from \u201c$ millions\u201d to \u201c% annual change\u201d, etc. Table manipulation macros may perform such functions as combining two tables into one, sorting a table, searching for certain line items and other database-like tasks. Other transformation macros may perform other functions such as word translation, data format translation, and report-writing.","RMML macros are highly reusable because they are made available in a cross-platform, text-based, searchable, XML-compliant format. Because the macros are portable, they have much greater marketability. RMML also builds into its language tags for many types of documentation so that a macro may be reused and understood by the original macro writer as well as other users.","Conventional spreadsheet programs typically base references on physical locations, a problem RMML avoids by referring to numbers by their position in a chart or formula, or by tag names, thus allowing the numbers themselves to be anywhere in a document. RMML macros also use the measurement and the meaning of numbers because RDML tags contain standard vocabularies to identify the measure, magnitude, scale, unit, precision, class, etc. of the numbers, and the RMML interpreter handles differences for the user.","Additionally, RMML builds error handling into its interpreter and makes available automated testing tools to help increase the quality of the code. Users may also graphically change parameters for the macros using check boxes, slider bars, input boxes, and selection lists, and RMML makes it easy for the author of a macro to add those visual components.","Below is a detailed description of RDML, the platform upon which RMML macros run, followed by a detailed description of RMML.","II.

System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["204","201","230","102","102","102"]},"The RDML document formatter  is a graphical tool used by the user to reduce the amount of manual labor required to combine data and its documentation. The contents of an existing database  may not be enough to create an RDML document , because in one system consistent with the present invention, RDML uses documentation of the contents. Such documentation often may be found in a printed volume and hence must be manually input and manually combined with the data. The RDML formatter  allows a user (or data publisher) to map data fields from a relational database, flat file, spreadsheet file or text document to RDML data documents . It also allows a data publisher to add documentation to the data file (RDML data document ) itself.","The RDML image database  is a relatively small database maintained by the RDML formatter  to hold information necessary to recreate an RDML document  should the underlying data change. It eliminates the need for the user to manually input the documentation again because the RDML image database  stores it.","An RDML document server  functions when RDML documents  are being created dynamically. The server  queries the existing database  for the desired line items, queries the image database  for documentation items and instructions for constructing the RDML document , and finally creates a valid, well-formed RDML document.","The RDML document editor  allows users to edit RDML documents  which typically are ASCII text files (which may contain UNICODE data). As such, they may be edited by any text-oriented editor or word processor. This is, however, a time-consuming and error-prone approach to marking up an RDML (or any XML) file. A specialized RDML document editor  allows a user to quickly make changes, check for errors, and view information on the data and metadata. The document editor  may operate over the Internet: users possessing the correct permissions to modify a file can make updates or changes to the underlying RDML data document  by issuing commands from the RDML data viewer .","An RDML document  may be an ASCII\/UNICODE text file used to transmit data and metadata to the RDML Data Viewer . It can be stored locally, or can be transmitted over network  such as a corporate LAN or the Internet (using HTTP, FTP, email, etc.). To be a valid RDML document , the file conforms to the RDML Document Type Definition (\u201cDTD\u201d) which is described in detail below. The DTD describes required and optional data elements, their ordering, syntax, and the controlled vocabulary for use in certain data elements. DTDs in general are also described in \u201cXML: Extensible Markup Language,\u201d Elliotte Rusty Harold, IDG Books Worldwide, 1998.","The RDML data viewer  functions as a combination RDML and HTML browser, object-oriented spreadsheet, report-writer, and application platform. The browser functions read HTML or RDML documents ; HTML documents are rendered immediately in a browser window, while RDML documents are first cached in an internal data object (conforming to the DOM\u2014\u201cDocument Object Model\u201d\u2014standard discussed below) and then rendered in views  selected by the user. The default view is typically a chart and a tree listing, although several other default views are available. The RDML data viewer  uses the cached RDML data objects to create views , employing a variety of transformation and manipulation objects to get the data to match either the form expected by the view, or to match the form of other data objects with which it is being combined.","The RDML Macro Software Development Kit (\u201cSDK\u201d)  allows a function designer to create functions that can be applied generally to any data document that contains the types of data necessary for the function. The SDK is a collection of macro-writing tools, including an IDE (\u201cIntegrated Development Environment\u201d), an editor, an object browser, and a validation tester.","RDML generally separates the form of data from general calculation routines that operate on that data. By separating format from functions, both the data and the functions can be made reusable. In conventional spreadsheets, for example, numbers can be placed in arbitrary cells selected by the creator. If a second developer decides to create an analytic function, that developer must know what row and column each number is in. That routine will then not work with another spreadsheet unless the exact same row and column structure is followed.","Applying functions generally creates one form of software reuse: users need not tell the function where their data is (the approach of \u201cwizards\u201d in traditional spreadsheets). A second form of reuse is that gained by inheritance: function developers can choose the existing function that most closely matches what they are trying to do, and simply make the necessary edits to create the desired new function. The SDK  permits a third type of reuse in the ability to attach to remote data documents and remote macros on the web to take advantage of these extra resources and to provide real-time updating of data and functions.","RMML macro documents  are text documents that contain routines just as RDML data is contained in a text document. This document contains the heart of the calculation: the specification of operations on numbers, such as a formula, an ordered list of other macros to perform, or list of instructions.","RDSL style sheets  act as templates for output reports. The RDML data object (discussed below) in the RDML data viewer  can be placed into a report using one or more different style sheets. RDSL, a fully compliant implementation of XSL, allows a data publisher to provide multiple report formats for its data. They are reusable in that a style sheet written for one RDML data document  can be used for another if the specified restrictions are met. For example, a style sheet for a time-series data set can be used for another time series data set. The style sheet editor  is basically a report-writer because the user can graphically compose a report from a sample document, specify the types of RDML data documents  that this report can apply to, automatically create a style sheet  when the result is acceptable, and then use the resulting style sheet to create a report from any qualifying RDML data document .","The RDML search engine  searches RDML documents  similarly to the way HTML search engines search HTML documents. HTML search engines pick up key words, but can only tell a user that a particular document contains the requested word(s). They cannot, however, provide query services. For example, a user may wish to search the Internet for \u201call financial statements of computer services companies which have revenue growth >10%,\u201d and the RDML search engine  provides this capacity. The RDML Search Engine , however, does not index only keywords like the HTML approach, but also the element names and key attributes. This permits searching for numerical values, or posing complex queries regarding the content and\/or context of the data. The RDML search engine  thus acts as a generalized query processor for RDML data document , RMML macros , and RDSL stylesheets . Some aspects of the search engine  are described in greater detail in co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/183,152, filed on Feb. 17, 2000.","As mentioned earlier, each view  in the RDML data viewer  is essentially a separate application denoted on  as various RDML Plug-in applications . The chart view, for example, is a separate charting application that has been \u201cplugged in\u201d to the RDML data viewer's basic infrastructure of Internet browser, XML parser\/processor, RDML transformation and manipulation objects, internal object management architecture, interfaces to other applications, and graphical user interface (described below). For example, a mapping component can be plugged into the panel in which the chart is seen. Subsequently, when a user clicks on a line item, the colors of the different countries or states will change to show a thematic map, or different dots will appear, etc. The RDML data viewer  may be designed in modular fashion to permit changing or adding component applications to leverage off the common components.","IV. System Details","With further reference to , several of the components (excluding RMML and RDSL components) are described in greater detail below. The existing databases  may be relational databases, object-oriented databases, or any other type of database. RDML tags in RDML documents  add documentation to the types of pure data found in relational databases. Since the data that already exists in relational databases can be used to create RDML documents , the data may be made available to either the RDML formatter  or the RDML server  and be in a flat file format (rows and columns).","For connections, both the RDML formatter  and the RDML server  read Open Database Connectivity (\u201cODBC\u201d) and JDBC database sources. The flat file aspect is based on the idea that RDML documents  effectively model a basic row and column matrix. To produce an RDML document , therefore, the original data source may provide a single table, or create one with a query. Relational linking is possible with RDML documents , through a server to a relational database, or indirectly through hyperlinks to other RDML documents or hyperlinks to RDML document servers . This is similar to many database applications: data is collected from various underlying tables to create a single table or screen to show the user. The data table to be used as a source for an RDML document  may be oriented to have the fields be one of three basic exemplary RDML data table types: time series, category, or X-Y plot described below.","With reference to the RDML formatter , once there is a flat file data table of data points in the existing database , an RDML document  can be created by adding tags that contain documentation regarding the data table. The information contained in these tags are maintained in a separate data table from the original data points. The RDML formatter  is an application that assists a user in selecting the proper documentation tags, saves the tags in a separate database (the RDML image database ), and creates the actual RDML document .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["216","402","402","216","404","402","406","406","216","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["502","216","102","230","504","216","102","216","216","102"]},"The formatter  references a database  (shown on ) specified by the documentation URL .

This table  is referenced by the documentation table name . Similarly, the formatter  stores a list of line item attributes  for the database  in the database which are referenced by the li_data URL .","The RDML image database  contains documentation that relates to a separate set of data records in the existing database . The RDML formatter  creates and maintains the RDML image database . The RDML image database  standardizes the process of documenting data documents, and provides a controlled vocabulary for the metadata. The RDML image database  also performs document management and tracking, update and version control, error checking, input validation, and the creation of status reports.","The image database  contains a list of RDML documents  that it can produce. The original data may be in flat files, relational tables, or a table that results from a query on a relational database. The image database  contains document metadata that references the original document table or flat file in the original database . Documentation information contained in the image database  is added to this data. It further includes line item set metadata for the set of line items, documentation that is typically of a more technical nature and applies to the line item set as a whole. Examples of such information is table types, field definitions (\u201cx values\u201d) and hyperlinks that apply to the line item set as a whole. (A line item set may be generally analogous to a table; it is a collection of line items, which are analogous to records in the database world.)","The image database  also includes line item metadata that references the individual records of the original document table or flat file in the original database . There may be a pointer from each line item's metadata record to the corresponding record in the original data table. Each line item includes the fields of the original record, plus, in one implementation consistent with the present invention, at least 18 additional fields that contain \u201cattribute\u201d documentation: object types, unit designators, hyperlinks, footnotes, and so forth.

The RDML Reader  may be a class that runs in a separate thread and has methods for checking the RDML document  type (Time Series, Category, XY) and handling errors.

The X-value transformer  makes sure that the data values to be graphed against the x-axis are in common units. For example, if document A is an annual time series and document B is a quarterly time series, the X-value transformer  in this case would use the \u201cli_aggregation\u201d attributes of the line items in document B to aggregate four quarters at a time into annual data. As a second example, if document A is a category document with x-values equal to stock ticker symbols (F, IBM, XON, etc.), and document B contains x-values denominated in company names (Ford, International Business Machines, Exxon, etc.), then the x-value transformer  will use the \u201cli_class\u201d attributes in the line items of each document to match them up. The X-value transformer  sends the object to the primary data store  (\u201cPDS\u201d) for storage with other active objects of the same type (step ).

The doc_title is a plain language description of the document that will appear at the top of reports and views for the document for use by a user. The timestamp is typically generated by the application that created the document and may denote the time that the document was created or the time the data was accessed for creation of the document. The version describes which variant of the RDML document  it is and may be named by the creator. The expiration describes the date and time that the data in the document  may no longer be relied upon, typically when the next update is expected to be released. Freq_of update describes how frequently the document is updated and may be used by applications that want to schedule updates to the data.

A<linkset>  is a collection of hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may be either HTML files or RDML files. The individual <link> elements  hold the actual links and attributes. The <linkset> element's two attributes are form, described above, and href, a standard string for URL or web address, and they designate the HTML or RDML page where a page of hyperlinks may be found. This is useful when the creator does not want to list all of the hyperlinks in the document  itself.","The <link> element  describes hyperlinks to other documents and contains, in one implementation, nine attributes: \u201cform,\u201d \u201chref,\u201d \u201cbehavior,\u201d \u201ccontent-role,\u201d \u201ccontent-title,\u201d \u201crole,\u201d \u201ctitle,\u201d \u201cshow,\u201d and \u201cactuate.\u201d These link related attributes are described in the XML IE5 Programmer's Reference, pp 95-97. The title is a string that appears in the application as a hyperlink title. For example, in an HTML browser, it will appear as highlighted, underlined text. Actuate specifies when the link should be traversed\u2014when the resource that the link points to is retrieved or accessed, and show specifies how the target resource will be displayed. Behavior specifies instructions that control the behavior of the link in the way that the content is displayed or the link is traversed, and role describes what role the target resource plays in the link. Content-role and content-title are alternative places for the title and role, but are not specified in Xlink standards.","Finally, <rdmldoc_header>  may have its own <linkset>  having <link> elements . RDML allows users to attach hyperlinks to different elements such as an entire document, a particular line item, or other element in the RDML document . The reason for the multiple places that hyperlinks may be placed is so that the user can view in one place all the links that apply only to the element under consideration. For example, an RDML document  may contain the data for a company's financial statement. The creator of the document may decide that certain links apply to the whole company (links to product lines, competitors, etc.) and that others only apply to single line items (such as a link attached to the \u201cEquipment Leasing\u201d line item that points to the footnote for that line item or an accounting regulation applicable to that account). Even though they are attached to different elements, the links may have the same form. Another reason for multiple linkset elements is to facilitate keeping links together with their logical owners.","Continuing to refer to , on the line item side of the <rdmldoc> , the <line_item_set>  which contains information on the collection of line items in the RDML document  also contains several attributes and several elements. These attributes include: \u201cline_item_set_type,\u201d \u201ctime_period,\u201d \u201ccharacter_set,\u201d \u201cmissing_values,\u201d \u201cnull_values,\u201d \u201czero_values,\u201d \u201cdates_values,\u201d and \u201cpercentages.\u201d","The first attribute, the line_item_set_type, is, in one implementation, an important attribute which classifies the line item set into one of three types: time series, category (or cross tab), and x-y plot. Generally, the \u201ctype\u201d in this context is the characterization of the x-axis values and whether they represent a time series, a categorization, a x-y plot or other. These line item set types are described in detail below in connection with the x-value transformer  which manipulates line items of the same set type. Generally, line item sets of different line item set types may not be actively manipulated together. If the line item is a time series, valid lengths in the time_period attribute may be years, quarter, months, days, etc.","Character_set designates which standard character set is represented, thereby allowing for support for foreign languages. Missing values holds a designator for the numerical value that represents a missing value, because many views of the data, in particular chart views, need to know which numbers represent blanks. Otherwise, a blank might be interpreted as \u201c0.\u201d Null_values designates the character to be treated as null so that it is not confused with \u201cnot applicable,\u201d or \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201c0.\u201d Finally, zero_values designates characters that should be interpreted as \u201c0,\u201d and not \u201cnull,\u201d \u201cmissing,\u201d \u201cnot applicable,\u201d etc.","The <line_item_set>  has, in one implementation, several sub-elements including <data_x> , <li_class_set> , <linkset> , and one or more <line_item> elements . At the line item set level, metadata regarding line items as a set is shared among all the line items so that the data need not be repeated. In particular, the <data_x> element  contains field information common to all line items in the line item set. The <data_x> element  includes the x-values and information regarding the x-values of the line items in the set of line items in the RDML document . For example, if the line item set is a time series, the x-values may represent the years, months or other timelines (e.g., 1990, 1991, etc.) listed across the bottom of a chart with which all of the data is associated. Because this information is the same for each line item in the line item set, it is only included once in the RDML document . In one implementation, in addition to the actual x-values, <data_x>  also contains the following attributes: \u201cx_title,\u201d \u201cformat,\u201d \u201cx_notes,\u201d \u201cx_desc,\u201d \u201cx_prec,\u201d \u201cx_unit,\u201d \u201cx_mag,\u201d \u201cx_mod,\u201d \u201cx_measure,\u201d \u201cx_scale,\u201d \u201cx_adjustment,\u201d and \u201cx_links.\u201d","In <data_x> , x_title is the title displayed on the x-axis as the data is displayed on a chart. Format is a string providing a template for the default representation of the x-axis values. The strings are those familiar from spreadsheet programs (examples may also be seen on ):","#\u2014digit(s), zeros suppressed","0\u2014digit(s), zeros displayed",".\u2014decimal point",",\u2014separator","A\u2014z, other characters\u2014displayed literally.","Other formatting codes can also be used (e.g., codes used in scripting languages). X_notes may contain miscellaneous footnotes regarding x-values of the line item set, while x_desc may describe additional description regarding the x-axis values.","The x_prec attribute describes the precision or number of significant digits for purposes of axis label display. In this attribute, negative numbers cause rounding of amounts greater than zero. For example, a precision of \u201c2\u201d will display a number as \u201c8,254.43\u201d. That same number with a precision of \u201c\u22122\u201d will be displayed as \u201c8,300.\u201d The underlying representation of the number will be the full value; only the formatting and representation on the screen will change. The data viewer  uses this primarily for formatting the axis labels, but the attribute is available for default formatting as well in other uses such as reports, footnotes, etc.","The subsequent attributes, x_unit, x_mag, x_mod, x_measure, x_scale, and x_adjustment, represent the meaning of the x-values and are used by the data viewer  for manipulation, reconciliation and display with other RDML documents . In RDML, numbers are collectively described by these attributes which describe the numbers' units. They are as follows:","Unit: the physical unit of the numerator","Magnitude: the size of the numerator","Modifier: relation of the numerator to the denominator","Scale: the size of the denominator","Measure: the physical unit of the denominator","Adjustment: special qualifier (i.e., inflation adjusted)","For example, a line item reported to represent \u201c$ in thousands per million people\u201d can be represented as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0154"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"$US"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","000"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":","}}}],"mo":"*"},{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"person"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","000","000"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":","},{"mtext":","}]}}],"mo":"*"}]}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0155"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Unit:","$US"]},{"entry":[{},"Magnitude:","1,000"]},{"entry":[{},"Modifier:","\/"]},{"entry":[{},"Measure:","1 person"]},{"entry":[{},"Scale:","1,000,000"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["100","100"]},"A standard vocabulary for units and measures may be used for efficiency, and magnitude and scale may be more simply represented as a power of 10, e.g., 3 for thousands, 6 for millions, etc. This permits more rapid transformations and eliminates potential confusion of variant usages and spellings (e.g., million, mille, MM, etc.)","For an example of the use of these attributes, suppose the RDML data viewer  has plotted the following value\/measurement:\n\n","The user now wants to convert this to:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0161"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["RDML Attribute:","Begin:","End:","Conversion factor:"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Unit","US Dollar","Italian Lira","A* 0.0000234"]},{"entry":["Mag","Thousands","Billions","A* 1,000,000"]},{"entry":["Mod","per","per","A* 1"]},{"entry":["Scale","Hour","Day","A* 24"]},{"entry":["Measure","\u20031","1","A* 1"]},{"entry":["Adjustment","Adjusted for infl.","Not adjusted","A* annual factor"]},{"entry":["Value","426","1.189"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The data viewer  multiplies the conversion factors (or performs any other appropriate mathematical operations) to manipulate the display.

The system stores conversion factors from base units to other units in a unit list XML file, a portion of which is shown at Appendix C. For instance, suppose the base unit used by the system for length is \u201cmeters,\u201d and numerical values are to be converted from \u201cyards\u201d to \u201cmiles.\u201d The viewer  converts the yards to meters using the stored conversion factor, and then from the meters to miles using the appropriate stored conversion factor. In this way, the unit list file need only contain conversion factors from the base unit to various other units, and need not list a conversion factor for every possible combination between various units.","The structure of the unit list file is as follows: a <unitlist> element is the root, and it has one level of child nodes, each of which is a <unit> element. The unit elements each have a number of attributes and elements that describe the characteristics of that unit necessary to convert it into another unit or set of units.","The conversion element contains the attributes necessary for making a conversion where the source unit and the destination unit are both of the same type. For example, converting \u201cmiles\u201d to \u201cinches\u201d is simply a matter of finding the correct multiplier to apply to the number of miles, because both units are measures of type \u201clength.\u201d","The conversion element contains six elements: (1) \u201cconv_target\u201d describes the target unit of measurement that the following conversion factors will bring you to, (2) \u201cconv_factor\u201d is the number to multiply by the source value to arrive at the destination value, (3) \u201cconv_constant\u201d is the constant to be added to the product of the source value and the conversion factor. For example, in the conversion formula for Fahrenheit to Centigrade (F=32+9\/5 C), 32 is the \u201cconv_constant\u201d, (4) similarly, if the conversion involves a logarithmic conversion, the necessary factors are included in \u201cconv_log\u201d, (5) \u201cconv_source\u201d is a description of the standards body that set forth this particular conversion factor, and (6) \u201cconvhref\u2032 contains the URL for the approving standards body.","The type element contains one of the following text strings: (1) Length (base unit=meter), (2) Area (base unit=square meter), (3) Volume (base unit=cubic meter), (4) Mass (base unit=gram), (5) Time (base unit=second), (6) Temperature (base unit=centigrade), (7) Energy (base unit=joule), (8) Currency (base unit=$US), (9) Compound (no base unit), (10) Diverse (no base unit), (11) Collection (no base unit), and (12) Occurrences (no base unit).","The Compound and Diverse types are constructed from one or more of the basic units. Compound types are simple combinations of others. Example: \u201cmiles per hour\u201d is a combination of a length unit and time unit. In order to convert a Compound type into another type, it is necessary to be able to make the necessary conversions of the decomposed units.","Diverse types are those that are constructed of descriptions. For example, an \u201cohm\u201d is an electrical unit described as \u201cthe resistance offered to an unvarying electrical current by a column of mercury at the temperature of melting ice, 14.4521 grams in mass, of a constant cross-sectional area, and 106.3 centimeters in length.\u201d","A Collection type is a collection of persons, places, things, etc. For example, a data series denominated in \u201cpeople in millions\u201d means that one unit of this type is a collection of one million people. Collection types can use any of the conversion elements. For a simple conversion example, suppose there are 2.4 people per family in a sample. Then \u201cpeople\u201d could be converted to \u201cfamilies\u201d by a simple division by the 2.4 conversion factor.","An Occurrence type is a collection of events. \u201cCycle\u201d would be an Occurrence type that could be divided by \u201cseconds\u201d to produce a compound \u201ccycles per second\u201d unit of measurement.","The \u201csubtype\u201d element is for finer distinctions among types. The \u201cplural\u201d element is for constructing new titles, legends and labels at the completion of a conversion operation. An \u201calias\u201d element is provided for enabling conversions where data has been entered in a common, but nonstandard form. For example, tables often use \u201cin\u201d instead of \u201cinches.\u201d The \u201cdesc\u201d element is provided so that a plain language description can be given the user. The \u201cicon\u201d element provides a place for giving the unit an icon to be used in lists, drop-down boxes, etc.","Referring back to the elements and attributes of , in <x_data> , there is an x_links attribute which may be a comma-delimited string of URL's for linking to other sources.","In addition to this element, the <li_class_set>  element represents the set of line item class elements and, in one implementation, has no attributes but has one or more sub-elements representing line item class, <li_class> . These line item class tags specify categories in various classification systems to which the numbers belong, such as \u201c<US Dollars>\u201d or \u201c<Total Revenues>\u201d. The data viewer  uses these class tags to select which macros can apply, to adjust report formats, and to make the correct selections of assumptions in analytic processing. The class designations permit validation and conforming of different data sets, thereby allowing the data viewer  to combine documents from unrelated sources into a single unified source. Class tags may be used by macros that look at the class tag list to see if it qualifies to act on the particular line item. For example, if a line item in a financial statement is tagged as of the class \u201cdebt,\u201d the macro knows that it can use this line in calculating \u201cdebt-to-equity\u201d ratios. But if the line item is tagged \u201cpiano,\u201d for instance, the macro will not be applied. Note that, in this implementation, the element names for the classes are entered as comma-delimited strings.","The <li_class> element , in one implementation, has five attributes. These are \u201cclass_name,\u201d \u201cparent_class,\u201d \u201cform,\u201d \u201chref,\u201d and \u201cdescription.\u201d Class_name is the name of the class to which the line item set belongs, and parent_class denotes the name of the parent class. These attributes may be used by more advanced features of the data viewer  such as the macros.","The <line_item_set> element  further contains a <linkset>  similar to the previously described <linkset>. As before, this <linkset>  further has a <link> element  previously described.","The <line_item>  element may have, in one implementation in accordance with the present invention, four sub-elements and 18 attributes. The elements are <data_x> , which contains the x-values for this line item if they are different from the default x-value in the line_item_set element <data_y>  which contains the y-data values, the data numbers or values of the line item, a <linkset>  having a <link>  as previously described, and a <note_set> element . The <noteset>  contains one or more <note> elements  which have user readable, plain language notes regarding the line item.","The attributes of the line item include: \u201cli_ID,\u201d \u201cli_legend,\u201d \u201cli_title,\u201d \u201cli_cat,\u201d \u201cy_axis_title,\u201d \u201clevel,\u201d \u201cformat,\u201d \u201crelation,\u201d \u201cli_notes,\u201d \u201cli_desc,\u201d \u201cli_prec,\u201d \u201cli_unit,\u201d \u201cli_mag,\u201d \u201cli_mod,\u201d \u201cli_measure,\u201d \u201cli_scale,\u201d \u201cli_adjustment,\u201d and \u201cli_aggregation.\u201d Several of those attributes have the same meaning as attributes previously described except that they specifically describe only the line item and y-values to which they are attached.","The li_ID is a unique identification number for the <line_item> element  and may be numbered from 0 to n (where n is the number of line_item elements). In one implementation consistent with the present invention, the numbers are unique and in order.","The li_legend attribute is a plain language string describing the line item that does not need to be unique. Generally, it appears in the leftmost column of the views. The li_title is a string defining the general subject of the line item. In the data viewer , this may be used as the title of the chart and as titles in reports. Typically, titles are the same for line items grouped together, but they are not required to be.","The li_cat attribute represents a line item category. As opposed to the li_legend and the li_title, which are displayed on the chart in the data viewer , the li_cat is not normally displayed. It is generally a non-printing designator for a category that the line item might belong to. Often, this may be a table name, or a primary key in a database, or some other organizing identifier. It may be used to group line items for reports.","The yaxis_title attribute is a string which will appear on the y-axis as the title of that axis. However, if the user applies a transformation to any variable in the descriptor, this hard-coded y-axis title will be replaced by one generated by the data viewer  using other attributes.","The level attribute and relationship attribute specify hierarchical relationships between line items. Conventional links in relational databases are maintained by matching records on the basis of \u201ckey fields.\u201d One drawback of this approach is that nothing is known about the character of the relationship except that it exists, and there is no way to tell, absent specific documentation elsewhere, that one record is a child or parent of the other, and whether that nature is a containment, a derivation, and inheritance, etc. In RDML, the creator of the data may specify the hierarchical level of each line item and the nature of that hierarchical relationship. The data viewer  uses the level attribute and the relationship attribute to create a hierarchical tree, to place icons representing the relationship in front of each line item to summarize the derivation of numbers and describe their context, and to assist macros and updating data tables. The level attribute specifies how many levels down from the parent node a line item is, while the relationship attribute specifies the nature of the relationship, such as whether the line item is a child of another line item or contained by another. It may also determine whether the line item is an additive or subtractive subcomponent of a parent, or a subtotal that is dependent on other child line items. These previously mentioned attributes and elements make up a DTD  in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the present invention.","Li_aggregation is an attribute useful if a user wants to \u201caggregate\u201d or \u201cdeaggregate\u201d data based on differing x-axis transformations. This attribute explains to the data viewer  how to handle this particular line item when such transformations are attempted. For example, if a line item set presents bank account information, each line item may be a time series and presents quarterly data, but the user may wish to see the data on an annual basis. For some line items in the set, it is simply a matter of summing up four quarters worth of data (e.g., deposits) in which case the attribute value would be \u201csum,\u201d but for other line items (e.g., closing balance), only the last quarter's value need be shown, in which case the attribute value would be \u201clast.\u201d Similarly, if a minimum annual balance is desired for four quarters of minimum balances, only the lowest balance for all four quarters would be needed. Such a line item's li_aggregation attribute value would be \u201cminimum.\u201d Possible accepted values include: \u201csum,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d \u201cminimum,\u201d \u201cmaximum,\u201d \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201clast,\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d","IV.A.2. Reader, Parser and Processor","With reference back to , the RDML reader  may be an object within the RDML data viewer  which manages the process of finding an RDML document  (locally, on a LAN, or on a Wide Area Network such as the Internet), passes it to the XML parser , relays error notices to the user, and coordinates the updating of other components states to reflect a rejected or damaged RDML document . The user of the RDML data viewer  may initiate the download of an RDML document  in many different ways including: clicking on an RDML hyperlink (these are like any other hyperlink, except that the target document may end in \u201c.rdm\u201d), typing a \u201c.rdm\u201d URL into the \u201cAddress\u201d box of RDML data viewer, or requesting the loading of the document in a macro. Also, while conventional HTML browsers have a cache of only HTML documents represented as the \u201chistory\u201d of the browser, the browsers may only display one of these documents at a time. Given an URL address, the RDML reader  reads in Document Object Model (\u201cDOM\u201d) compliant documents (e.g., RDML documents ), discussed below. The XML reader  may be implemented by a third-party set of Java classes, such as the XML4J parser developed and licensed by IBM, but others may also be used. The RDML reader  may cache multiple documents in RAM if they are compatible with the active data set. Not only are these documents immediately available, but sub-elements of the documents are available immediately because the data viewer  may maintain indexes of important data and metadata in the documents. Additionally, macros may be used to find specific elements in the document that is read in by the RDML reader .","The XML parser  takes a serial stream of text characters from the RDML data document , performs basic functions such as eliminating white space, dividing input into words and groups of words and searching for opening and closing characters (primarily \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d). The XML parser  used in the RDML data viewer  may also be a third-party set of Java classes, such as the XML4J parser developed and licensed by IBM, but other parsers may also be used.","The processor  receives the parsed text and creates a tree-shaped data structure of the data elements, matching the structure of the RDML DTD  hierarchy. The hierarchical structure conforms to the DOM Model, meaning that data is available in a standard form, and that a standard library of methods and functions are available for accessing data, editing elements, searching through nodes to find certain elements, and so forth. The XML DOM standard is controlled by the World Wide Web Consortium, and can be found at \u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/REC-DOM-Level-1\/\u201d.","The RDML Processor  generally performs three primary functions on the incoming parsed text to create an internal software object: error checking, structuring, and adding functionality. The error checking functions of the processor  simply compare the output of the parser  against the text expected as defined by the DTD . If the incoming document does not conform, the processor  determines whether the defect is: (1) not critical, in which case a warning is sent to a log and work continues, or (2) critical, in which case work stops and an error message is sent to the routine that called the parser .","The structuring function is a matter of assembling the text into a hierarchical data structure matching the hierarchy described in the DTD . The target data structure may be a vector of vectors, or other collection of collections. When the data structure is created, it is \u201cwrapped\u201d in a software object (an \u201cRDMLDoc\u201d object) that adds an interface to the data so that other software objects can communicate with it. Most of the added functions (\u201cmethods\u201d) provide access to specific subsets of the data or particular elements or attributes.","The functions of the RDML processor  can be performed by the same class as the RDML Reader , where the RDML reader  has been set up on a \u201ccallback\u201d relationship with the XML Parser . In that way, when the parser  gets a new element from the RDML document , it informs the RDML reader  that it found the element and returns it to the reader. In such a way, the RDML reader  acts as a processor as well as reader (even though it may hand off the actual element handling to another class).","IV.A.3. X-value Transformer and Line Item Set Types","Regarding the X-value transformer , the term \u201cX-value\u201d refers to the fact that the fields of the input data records are plotted along the x-axis of the chart view  by default. (The values of each record for each field are plotted on the Y axis.) For example, a time series will, by default, be plotted in the chart year with the time periods plotted on the x-axis. When more than one data document is input, their data fields must be correlated before they can be presented together in a common view. The X-value transformer  determines what adjustments have to be made, and then accomplishes them.","Generally, the RDML data viewer  recognizes three different types of line item sets (i.e., (1) \u201ctime series,\u201d (2) \u201ccategory,\u201d and (3) \u201cX-Y Plot\u201d) which account for the majority of end user tables. The X-value transformer , by recognizing these types, can automatically provide the correct display and transformation routines, saving the user the time and expense of changing a broad range of details. To give an example of this, when a times series table is encountered, the data viewer  can recognize that the x-values must fit the permissible types of dates, check them, conform them, and format them, thus sparing the user the work. In one implementation consistent with the present invention, a line item set type is a required attribute of the line item set element .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0194"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["710","712","710","712","720","724"]},"First, the X-value transformer  receives a new document  (step ). It then determines the type of the active documents in the PDS  (step ). If the newly arrived document is the same line item set type as the active documents (step ), it is added to them in the PDS  (step ). If it is of a different type than the currently active documents in the PDS , the user is notified that it does not match the currently active documents (step ). The user may choose to reject the new document  (step ), in which case the object is not added to the PDS  (step ). If the user chooses to erase the currently active documents (step ), the currently active documents are erased (step ) and the new one is loaded (step ). Otherwise, the new document  is placed in the PDS  as a \u201cstandby\u201d document (step ). Standby documents are available for providing data to scripts and macros, but do not interfere with the active document views. Optionally, if the x-value transformer  need not perform any transformations, the RDML reader  may store the document in the PDS .","If the newly arriving document is of the same line item set type as the active documents, the X-value transformer  matches the data_x fields of the new document to the existing documents. They may be in a different order, may be spelled differently, be in a different form, or otherwise not immediately compatible. The X-value transformer  makes the necessary adjustment according to the type of line item set. For example, time series line item sets have elements which are ordered in time. One obvious incompatibility is that periods may be different. Often, one set of data is in years and the other in, for example, months. The X-value transformer  uses attributes of the line items to handle each correctly. However, monthly data cannot just be added up to produce a yearly value, for example, because the number might represent a non-additive value. For example, a line item might be \u201cEnding Bank Balance,\u201d but adding up 12 monthly ending balances does not produce a year-ending balance. The line item provides a period-length attribute that specifies that it is a \u201cperiod-end\u201d value, and the X-value transformer  uses the last month only to create a yearly value. In another example, monthly \u201cdeposits\u201d would be added together, and monthly \u201caverage interest rate\u201d might be a \u201cperiod-average.\u201d Each line item provides instructions on how it is to be handled in conversion to other periods; this is provided by the li_aggregation attribute.","Another change that might be made is in the date format. Some data sets might simply display the year (\u201cYYYY\u201d), others might use a standard date format (\u201cYYYY-MMDD:HHMMSS.MSS\u201d), or some other variant. The X-value transformer  puts these all into a common form.","The data viewer  additionally provides tags describing how it is to be handled in the event of a period widening\/shortening, or a period shift. Numbers may be tagged as \u201csum,\u201d \u201cmedian,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d \u201clast value,\u201d \u201cfirst value\u201d or a specified formula. The X-value transformer  and the data viewer  may also handle \u201cperiod shifts,\u201d a related type of conformance. For example, a first data source may be based on a calendar year ending on December 31 while a second data source is based on a fiscal year ending on September 30. The RDML data viewer  may use the period_length attribute of the x_data element  to designate the period length of the data, in conjunction with the li_aggregation attribute of the y_data element. The latter attribute is used to estimate a conforming transformation.","Y-values, the data values in a line item, may change when the x-values have been conformed. For instance, if twelve months of \u201caverage interest rate\u201d is aggregated to produce \u201cannual average interest rate,\u201d the updated designation of the number that will appear in legends or axis titles changes. The data viewer  recognizes that the resulting values may possibly undergo a transformation based on unit, magnitude, modifier, scale, measure, and adjustment attributes. These attributes allow efficient and automatic interpretation, translation, manipulation and presenting of data in a line items. They further facilitate the automatic changing of text descriptions in charts and reports to be automatically changed by macros.","Additionally, to conform differing time periods in separate documents, the X-value transformer  and the data viewer  may prompt user assistance if needed. For example, a first data source may be denominated by fields such as \u201cWeek 1,\u201d \u201cWeek 2,\u201d etc., while a second data source is denominated by \u201cApr. 4, 1999,\u201d \u201cApr. 11, 1999,\u201d and so forth. The X-value transformer  recognizes this problem (and a broad set of similar circumstances), and presents a dialog box asking the user for the actual date that \u201cWeek 1\u201d begins on.","The Category line item set type is a common type of line item set that is often referred to as a \u201ccrosstab.\u201d In this line item set type, the x-values are categories. On a chart, for instance, the x-axis may be divided into eight categories for eight companies, with the y-axis showing the values of revenues or profits. Sometimes matching the fields of different source documents by name is too dependent on wording, spelling, or language to permit efficient matching. The challenge for categories line item sets is to handle these differences in usage. For example, company income statements may start with a concept of \u201csales,\u201d but the actual words used may be \u201crevenues,\u201d \u201ctotal revenues,\u201d \u201cgross income,\u201d or any other designation used in different languages, dialects, or industry-specific terms. To handle these line item sets, the X-value transformer  lines up categories from multiple data sets by first matching up any actual matches in spelling (ignoring cases in the default). Second, it looks at the class elements  to see if there are standard vocabulary tags; these standards may be different for different industries or uses. When dealing with companies, for example, the ticker symbol may be used as the matching tag. For instance, one data set may have a category for \u201cFord\u201d another for \u201cFord Motor Company,\u201d and another for \u201cF.\u201d All would be matched by the common presence of a tag <\u201cF\u201d> (Ford's ticker symbol) in the class element . If this fails to provide matches, the data viewer  presents the user with a dialog box with two lists of fields. Using \u201cdrag and drop\u201d techniques, the user can quickly match the two sets of fields, and fields with no match are simply appended as new fields. In addition to creating a mapping dictionary based on text, class sets, and user input, the data viewer  can use a mapping file specified by a user or an input document to combine files automatically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0196","num":"0202"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A","FIG. 12A","FIGS. 12B and 12C"],"b":["12","12","1202","1202","710","720","1202","1204","1202","1206","1204","1202","1206","720"]},"IV.A.4.

Because two (or more) data series may be placed on the chart  from different source documents , they are synchronized for purposes of placing them on the common graph.

It recognizes, for example, when a first series is in \u201cUS Dollars\u201d and a second series is in \u201cFrench Francs\u201d; it makes arrangements automatically to place them on separate axes. There is no need for the user to go through a charting \u201cwizard\u201d or to find, understand, and translate the various units, titles, and adjustments. One click on each of the series' lines in the tree view  (potentially with a modifier key (e.g., the CTRL key) depressed) instructs the chart view  to construct itself given the metadata of the individual elements. The chart manager  and chart data object  consider and take into account the following in updating the chart: the unit type, magnitude, scale, modifier, measure, y-axis title, chart title, chart footnote, precision, number format, chart type (line, bar, etc.), legend and colors of the various components.","The data viewer  also permits the adding of a series to a chart using a single click or command. Adding a series to a chart increases the number of series displayed on the chart. In conventional spreadsheets, charting programs, and data graphical interfaces, this task requires the user to either rebuild the whole chart through the wizard, fill in a dialog box with information on the new series, or add the numbers by custom programming. When the data viewer  adds the new series to the chart with a single mouse click. The existing data is maintained as it was, and any necessary changes to the chart's type, format, scale, etc. is made automatically by the chart manager  and chart view  to accommodate the new series.","Just as a series can be added with one mouse click (or one command from the menu), so can it be removed. There is no need for the user to worry about accidentally deleting something, as no actual information is lost from the data viewer . It can always be added back to the chart  with a simple mouse click.","The chart view  also supplies an expandable legend  as shown on . A significant problem for most users of spreadsheet programs has been the inability of the user to control the size, format, and handling of the legend . The result is that charts usually end up with legends such as \u201cMSFT\u201d and \u201cSUNW,\u201d rather than longer descriptions with multiple colors and fonts, word-wrapping and other readability enhancements. The chart view  chart provides legends that (1) can grow to unlimited sizes, (2) support word-wrapping, (3) can contain multiple fonts, (4) can contain multiple font types (bold, italics, normal), and (5) can contain varying colors for emphasis. If the legend information (typically stored in the li_legend attribute) for a line item is too long for the legend box on the chart, the information may word-wrap and scroll to accommodate the additional information.","The chart view  permits further convenience by automatically specifying the y-axis title . Current spreadsheet and charting programs require the user to provide a y-axis title, usually through a chart wizard or by specifying a location to look up a title. The RDML shifts this burden to the data originator, who is in a better position to accurately specify the description of the y-axis values. The y-axis title  specified by the data originator is placed in an attribute field (y_axis_title) of the line item element tag and is used by the chart view  as the default y-axis title  when the line item is added to the chart view .","Often, however, the user wants to make a change to the numbers and display the transformed series on the chart . In this case, the default y-axis title  may no longer be correct. Rather than require the user to manually figure out what the new value description is (a process that could take several minutes or longer with current analytic programs), the chart manager  and chart view  data automatically generates a new y-axis title  upon transformation of values using the information provided in the modified unit, magnitude, modifier, scale, measurement, and adjustment attributes of the line item .","For example, suppose a first series is charted as \u201c$ in Millions,\u201d and the user applies a macro that divides every number in the series by 1,000. The chart manager  automatically creates a new y-axis title  of \u201c$ in Billions.\u201d Number transformations can lead to quite complicated transformations of the y-axis title . A user may multiply a first series (\u201cGallons in Millions\u201d) by a second series (\u201cUS $ per Gallon\u201d); the result will be a series of numbers, a third series (\u201cUS $ in Millions\u201d). If there are ambiguities, the data viewer  presents the user with a dialog box displaying all the known information regarding the quantities involved and requests that the user supply a title.","Similarly, the chart manager  and chart view  can automatically generate the x-axis title and chart titles  using the metadata attributes. In addition to generating y-axis and x-axis titles, the data viewer  automatically performs the task of creating a new chart title  when the charted series are changed or when multiple series are added to the same chart. For example, a first series has a default chart title of \u201cTotal Sales,\u201d a second series has a default chart title of \u201cTotal Expenses,\u201d and a third series has a default chart title of \u201cTotal Sales.\u201d The data viewer  will create a combined chart title of \u201cTotal Sales; Total Expenditures\u201d by combining the dissimilar elements, and eliminating the duplicate elements.","Three examples illustrate other types of automatic title manipulation. In the first example, suppose a chart has two series placed on it: Series A has a title of \u201cGDP\u201d and a legend of \u201cChina\u201d, and Series B has a title of \u201cGDP\u201d and a legend of \u201cMalaysia\u201d. If both are put on the chart, the titles will duplicate each other. In one implementation consistent with the present invention, duplicate titles are removed such that the title for this chart will be simply \u201cGDP\u201d. Because the series legends are different, the legend on the side of the chart will have two entries: \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cMalaysia\u201d.","As a second example, suppose the legends are duplicative: Series A has a title of \u201cChina\u201d and a legend of \u201cGDP\u201d, and Series B has a title of \u201cMalaysia\u201d and a legend of \u201cGDP\u201d. Because both legend entries would be \u201cGDP\u201d, there may be confusion about which legend applies to which line on the chart. In this case, the data viewer  transposes the legend and chart title entries such that the result is the same as in the first example above; the title of the chart is \u201cGDP\u201d (the duplicate is removed) and the legend entries are \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cMalaysia\u201d.","Finally, in a third example, suppose the series have different titles and different legends. Series A has a title of \u201cGDP\u201d and a legend of \u201cChina\u201d, and Series B has a title of \u201cNational Savings\u201d and a legend of \u201cMalaysia\u201d. The legends are left as is, and a new chart title is created by appending one to the other separated by a \u201c;\u201d. The chart title on the display thus becomes \u201cGDP; National Savings\u201d, and the first legend becomes \u201cGDP\u2014China\u201d and the second legend becomes \u201cNational Savings\u2014Malaysia\u201d. All three of these changes are string manipulations (selecting and\/or appending).","The chart manager  and chart view  can also automatically trim beginning and ending x-values , thus relieving the user of the need to trim null leading and trailing values from charts. In conventional spreadsheet and charting programs, chart pointers must be recreated or manually adjusted when the underlying data is enlarged or shortened. For example, if a series is charted that runs from 1990 to 1998 and it is replaced by data from 1990 to 1996, there would be two blank spaces at the right side of the chart. The data viewer  and chart manger  avoid this and similar problems by handling missing or null values at the front or back of line items as indications that the chart should be automatically restructured.","The chart manager  also automatically formats the x- and y-axis labels  and . RDML shifts the burden of formatting the numbers on the x-axis  and y-axis  from the user (of which there may be thousands or millions, each reformatting the numbers manually one or more times) to the data originator (of which there is one, who only has to do it once.) The format templates are regular expression strings found in current spreadsheets and programming languages. The data viewer  uses the formatting strings for the axis labels on the chart view , for the numbers in the tree view , and as defaults for the numbers in reports. The formatting templates are automatically changed if a macro moves the numbers outside of the precision range that is legible on the chart , or out of a format that makes sense in the tree view  or in a report.","As stated previously, one of the RDML line item element attributes is the precision of the number, the number of significant digits to be displayed in a chart. Unlike conventional products, which leave this entirely up to the user to figure out, the data viewer  uses the specified precision to set the scale of the y-axis , and the format and precision of its labels and tick marks.","Additionally, the chart manager  automatically creates and removes a second y-axis  as shown on . A chart with two dissimilar series plotted on it will require two axes. The y-values may not be of the same units, measures or scales. A user might, for example, have plotted a series denominated \u201c$ in Millions\u201d and then want to add to the same chart  a series denominated \u201c% of GDP,\u201d and these two series cannot share a common y-axis. Chart manager  recognizes this incompatibility, creates a new y-axis , and directs all subsequent formatting, macros, etc., to the proper axis. Current spreadsheets and charting programs require that the user restructure the chart with a charting wizard (entailing many directives to be entered, and, much trial and error to get the various scales, colors, etc., correct), or by custom programming. The data viewer  automates this process, creating and formatting a new axis if required by the specifics of the unit and scale attributes of the line items. If the series is removed from the chart, the associated axis is removed and the various scales, colors, etc., of the remaining series are updated to make the chart readable immediately.","Table 4 shows a class diagram of the chart manager .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0247"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 4"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"ChartManager",{}]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2212chart1 : JCChartComponent",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212chart_data : ChartData",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212chart_legend : ChartLegend",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212chart_title : JCTitle",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212CDV1 : ChartDataView",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212CDV2 : ChartDataView",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212DS : DataStore",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212LineColors : JCVector",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212mainFrame : MainFrame",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212series1 : ChartDataViewSeries",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212series2 : ChartDataViewSeries",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212x_value_labels : JCVector",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212xaxis : JCAxis",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212xtitle : JCTitle",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212y1axis : JCAxis",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212y1title : JCTitle",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212y2axis : JCAxis",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212y2title : JCTitle",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212yLabelGenerator1 : YLabelGenerator",{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u2212yLabelGenerator2 : YLabelGenerator",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+addSeries(key : String) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+addY2Axis( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+ChartManager(mainFrame : MainFrame, chart_comp :",{}]},{"entry":[{},"JCChartComponent, legend : ChartLegend) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+checkYAxisTitle(series : int, y1title : JCAxisTitle,",{}]},{"entry":[{},"y2title : JCAxisTitle) : int",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+deleteLastSeries( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+deleteSeriesAfterFirst( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+getAddSeriesFlag( ) : boolean",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+getChartData( ) : ChartData",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+getYAxisTitle(series : int) : String",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+initChart( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+markWhichYAxis(num_series : int) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+replotChart( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+replotSeries( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+resetChart( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+setAddSeriesFlag(flag : boolean) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+setChartType(type : int) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+setDataStore(ds : DataStore) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+setStartPeriod(sp : String) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateChartTitle( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateChartTypes( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateFooter(num_series : int) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateFootnotes( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateLegend( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updatePrecision( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateSeriesStyles(num_series_local : int) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateXAxis( ) : void",{}]},{"entry":[{},"+updateYAxis(num_series_local : int) : void"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Class methods of a chart manager object in accordance with one implementation consistent with the present invention are described below.

Tree View","Referring back to , this screen shot further contains the tree view  on the lower half of the screen. The tree view  presents a hierarchical view of the data. The tree view  serves a different purpose than \u201cdatasheet view\u201d of conventional spreadsheets and database management systems. It shows the numbers in their context visually. The user can see the dependency relationships, identify from icons and visual clues how the different line items are related to their parents, peers, and children. The \u201cUnits\u201d column  prominently displays the units, scales, magnitudes, etc., of each line item, an important display in mixed data sets, where the unit context changes from line item to line item.","Each line item in the various active RDML documents  is displayed in the original order. In the tree view , each RDML document  begins a new top level node. The information displayed in the tree view  is a summary of important data from and about the line item, not a display of all the data points as would be found in a typical spreadsheet view. Instead of presenting a potentially confusing matrix of raw data digits that make the discerning of patterns difficult, the tree view  shows, in one implementation, the following information for each line item: legend , units , three user-selectable representative data points , and one or more summary columns . In the example on , there is some important documentation  (description, units), some representative data  (in this case, three years worth), and a summary data column  (in this case, the sum of all the data points). The first column  displays the legend of the line item. This is the plain language description; it is repeated in each view where identification of the line item must be made by a human.","The representative data columns  in the tree view  give the user visual clues as the relative importance, the types, and the format of the line items. The RDML data viewer  permits the user to select different fields to be displayed. For example, one user might want to see \u201c1940, 1970, 2000\u201d to get a sense of the long term trends, while another might only wish to see \u201c1998, 1999, 2000\u201d to see the recent trends.","The summary column  allows the user to choose a statistic that is either desired to understand the lines and their context better, or that is desired for purposes of sorting the columns from greatest to least or vice versa. Any of the columns can be sorted simply by clicking on them. The summary column provides much easier statistics for the user than database or spreadsheet formulas because the RDML data viewer  provides one-click selection of statistical methods, thus removing the need to write formulas, adjust for missing values, handle nulls in the denominators, etc. Some examples of summary statistics include: (1) sum, (2) average (3), median, (4) minimum, (5) maximum, (6) moving average, (7) variance\/standard deviation, (8) % difference (selected periods or categories), (9) % of parent, (10) % of specified line item, (11) correlation with parent, and (12) custom formulas. For each of these statistical measures, the RDML data viewer  provides a dialog box in which the user can adjust the assumptions. For example, the \u201cmoving average\u201d can be for one period, five periods, ten periods, and so forth.","The tree view  emphasizes that line items are the primary data unit in the RDML data viewer , as opposed to single numbers as are found in spreadsheets as cells. Since each line item  is an object, the RDML data viewer  may be thought of as an object-oriented spreadsheet. The icons  for each line item identifies that line item's context. For example, a \u201c+\u201d icon  indicates that adding that line item to its peers will produce the parent line item. This feature addresses a shortcoming of spreadsheets and database datasheet views: the inability to view formulas and data at the same time. It shows the user how the numbers are related to one another.","Conventional database management systems, spreadsheet and numerical analysis tools have no built-in indication of how one record is related to another. In relational databases, the position or row may have no relevance to its data. RDML and the tree view  changes this by making the position of a line item in a set a usable piece of information by a user, and icons  may visually designate the relationship of a line item to its parent node.","In one implementation consistent with the present invention, the following values are used for relationship icons: (1) plus, (2) minus, (3) times, (4) divide, (5) equals, (6) computed at, (7) member, (8) collection, (9) child, (10) parent, (11) memo, (12) general, (13) note, (14) none, and (15) root.","Sub-line items may add up to the parent line item (or may be modified by other relationships of their sibling line items.) \u201cPlus\u201d may add to siblings while \u201cminus\u201d subtracts from them. For example, a line item called \u201cNet Sales\u201d may have two children: \u201cTotal Revenues\u201d and \u201cCost of Goods Sold.\u201d If \u201cTotal Revenues\u201d has an li_relationship attribute of \u201cPLUS\u201d, and \u201cCost of Goods Sold\u201d has one of \u201cMINUS\u201d, then the treeview  can show that Net Sales is equal to Total Revenues minus Cost of Goods Sold. \u201cTIMES\u201d and \u201cDIVIDE\u201d show multiplication and division of line items respectively.","\u201cEQUALS\u201d is the same as \u201cplus,\u201d but shows the result of calculations of line items above it in order. \u201cCOMPUTED AT\u201d is used for assumptions, such as percentages, interest rates, etc., while \u201cMEMBER\u201d denotes that the line item is simply a member of a collection of line items denoted by the parent line item. In this case, no assumption is made regarding arithmetic relationship, if any.","\u201cCOLLECTION\u201d denotes that the line item has child members one level directly below it and denotes the concepts of sets or collections. \u201cCHILD\u201d illustrates that the line item is simply a \u201cchild\u201d of the \u201cparent\u201d line item. It implies a sort of descent, derivation, or inheritance. No assumption is made regarding arithmetic relationship, if any.","\u201cMEMO\u201d is a line item that might be of interest to those looking at the sibling line items, but which is not necessarily related to the siblings, while \u201cGENERAL\u201d is a generic designator. \u201cNOTE\u201d is usually used for line items with text values, and \u201cNONE\u201d denotes that no relationship is implied. \u201cROOT\u201d states that the line item is the root line item.","The tree view  also provides other capabilities. It allows the user to chart multiple line items  by holding down the \u201cshift\u201d key. Although number browsing can be done in the data viewer  with a mouse, it is also possible for users to graph line items using arrow keys. When the focus is on the tree view , navigating up and down with the arrow keys automatically chart the selected line item .

First, a mouse down event is performed over a line (e.g., Bristol Center). The mouse is then dragged down (highlighting lines in the process) to the last line to be included in the group (e.g., Hamlet West Center). By delaying the mouse up event while retaining the cursor over the last line to be included, the user is able to signal the system (and the system is able to detect) that all elements in the selected\/highlighted group are to be added. Accordingly, the system checks their corresponding check boxes.","The tree view  further provides an easy way of creating an RDML document  through drag-and-drop techniques. In conventional spreadsheet and DBMS applications, it is possible to create new tables from existing ones by selecting the data rows and cutting and pasting them, or by writing a SQL query. In the tree view , creating a new RDML document  complete with necessary documentation can be performed by dragging and dropping the desired line items to an icon that represents the new document.

This provides one-click addition of information to the spreadsheet view . Therefore, the way to copy data into the spreadsheet is simply to add them to the chart . It is also possible to copy an entire data document  or collection of data documents from the tree view  to the spreadsheet view , making any desired macro changes in the process.","Furthermore, RDML documents  may be created directly from the spreadsheet view . Whereas a data table is shown in the spreadsheet  (either created from another RDML document  or typed in from scratch), an RDML document may be created from that data in from the default specified by the user.

Aspects of RMDL Markup Documents","RDML is designed to be used to describe numbers across industries and domains. To do so, it provides a basic set of tags and a matching vocabulary to describe six aspects of a table of numbers: (1) value, (2) structure, (3) format, (4) semantics, (5) provenance, and (6) measurement.","Value denotes that numbers are transmitted as strings, with additional tags to define their data type, degrees of precision, handling of missing values, handling of nulls, and other directives to the end application.","Structure refers to a structuring of the data in within a table. RDML permits records to be arranged hierarchically within a table. Although not a standard approach for relational tables, this permits multiple levels of information to be placed in a single two-dimensional table. Users desire this, for example, when viewing financial statements, where a single line item (e.g., \u201cEquipment leasing\u201d) may have several sub-components (\u201cAutos,\u201d \u201cTrucks,\u201d \u201cOffice Equipment.\u201d)","Format allows the application to present users with numbers in human readable form. The tags specify default formats for numbers, internationalization issues such as comma\/decimal point handling, and default legends and chart titles. These formats may be changed by the users at run time.","Semantics refers to the fact that RDML provides generic tags in which indicators of the \u201cmeaning\u201d of the numbers, including the vocabularies of other SGML and XML markup languages, can be placed. This allows RDML to act as a \u201cwrapper\u201d for data from other markup language documents. Semantic meaning is also conveyed in text-based attributes: legends, titles, labels, footnotes, etc.","Provenance is the documentation of various elements. RDML elements include information on the source of the data, who marked it up, timestamps and link addresses, and licensing information, etc.","Finally, in the context of generic numbers, \u201cMeasurement\u201d refers to the characteristics necessary to describe the measurement aspects of the domain the number is taken from: units (\u201cmeters\u201d, \u201cfeet\u201d), magnitude (\u201cmillions\u201d, \u201cbillions\u201d), modifiers (\u201cAdjusted for inflation, 1997 index\u201d), and so forth. This permits macros to ensure the results of any calculation are adequately derived and described to the end user.","IV.B. Graphical User Interface and HTML Browser","The screen shots of ,  and  have been of the graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d)  which has several responsibilities. Generally, it creates itself and other visual components upon start-up of the application, and provides a central storage place for a minimal number of global variables of the application (such as file directories, etc.). Further, it responds to user actions, such as mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts, and repaints the screen, or portions of the screen, at appropriate moments.","The HTML browser  may be a third party component which displays HTML files. Although this browser has been designated as an HTML browser, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate from this disclosure that other browsers (e.g., an XML browser) can likewise be used. This component provides basic web-browsing capabilities and a way to view hyperlinks for RDML documents . Additionally, it acts as a display window for certain pages generated by the RDML data viewer  (such as RDML document source code, chart documentation, etc.)","IV.C. Reusable Macro Markup Language",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0300","num":"0306"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1800","104","1800","1800","1800","104","1800"]},"The RMML DTD  data structure is optimized to provide information needed in the order in which it is required, to reduce the learning on the part of new users to RMML Macro development, and to avoid unnecessary duplication. The first line of the DTD  in Appendix D starts with \u2018<?xml encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d?>\u2019 because XML documents start with a line that tells the client application, in this case, the RMML Interpreter  (described below) and the data viewer , what type of document it is and the version of XML.","With further reference to , the DTD  used to define RMML macro documents  is structured in a hierarchical tree structure of elements. Each element may include a list of attributes (displayed in Appendix D, but not shown on ) and\/or an association with one or more sub-elements. As with the RDML DTD described above, some attributes may be required while others may be optional, depending on design parameters. At the highest level, the DTD  has three elements descending from a root element, <macrodoc> . The first element, <macro_header> , contains the metadata for the document as a whole. The second, <macro_code>  contains the source code expression to be evaluated, related variables, and instructions to the application regarding the graphical user interfaces for any parameters. The third, <macro_references>  contains elements related to remote data (RDML documents ) or other macros (RMML documents ).","The macro_header element  is designed to match, as closely as possible, the rdmldoc_header element of RDML documents . This saves learning time for developers and end users, and allows reusable code modules to be built for both purposes.","Nevertheless, in one implementation consistent with the present invention, the <macro_header> element  contains several attributes that are unique. In this implementation, there are 8 unique attributes in the <macro_header> element . The first of these is \u201cmacro_type.\u201d This attribute tells the application which general capability this particular macro requires within the context of that application. The application uses this attribute in a factory class  to create the correct type of macro object for internal use. Two example types consistent with this implementation are: (1) \u201cTSL\u201d (time series line, a macro that works with time series to create a new line or lines on the chart), and (2) \u201cTSO\u201d (time series overlay, a macro that works with time series to create a new overlay on the chart , such as gray backgrounds behind certain time periods.)","The result_type attribute tells the RDML data viewer  how to display the results of any transformation created by the macro. There are, in one implementation, five permissible values for this string: \u201cReplace Each,\u201d \u201cReplace All,\u201d \u201cReplace AB,\u201d \u201cAdd New,\u201d \u201cAdd Annotation,\u201d and \u201cAdd Overlay.\u201d Replace Each removes every line on the chart  in the RDML data viewer , and replaces it with the transformed version. For example, if there are four series on the chart, all denominated in \u201cmiles\u201d, and user selects a macro \u201cto kilometers\u201d, then every line will be converted to kilometers, the miles lines erased, and the kilometers lines placed on the chart in their place.","Replace All is used where all current lines are being replaced by one line. For example, if A and B are charted, a macro called \u201cB as % of A\u201d would replace them with a single line. Replace AB is a special case of Replace All where there are only two lines charted. Add New adds a line to whatever is plotted. For example, a macro called \u201cAverage\u201d might draw a line through the existing line at the average level. Add Annotation adds a label with a pointer to a certain value on a chart (e.g., \u201c2-3 Stock Split\u201d). Add Overlay adds a shaded area behind certain regions of the chart.","The attribute \u201crdmldoc_type\u201d designates the type of RDML Document  with which the macro is designed to work. Valid strings for this attribute are TS, CT and XY, corresponding to the types of RDML Documents .","The elements <macro_source>  and <license_terms>  are identical to, and play the same role as, <data_source>  and <license_terms>  in the RDML Document Type Definition . The <documentation>  element is a container for two sub-elements: <macro_description>  and <help_page> . The <macro_description> element contains a short string (e.g., under 50 characters) which describes the basic functionality of the macro. It appears in the description label of the parameters panel  (shown in  and described below) For users desiring a more detailed description of the macro, the <help_page>  element contains a text block that provides this information. This text block can be read by the data viewer  in an HTML pane as part of the regular help system. This text block is intended to provide information on all aspects of the macro that might be of interest to the user: its use, its code, its parameters, and its inputs.","The second top-level element is <macro_code> . This section contains the actual source code and related variables. The <code>  element contains one or more expressions which evaluate to a transformation of certain numbers in the RDML data viewer . In one implementation consistent with this invention, the transformations apply to the chart view  in the RDML data viewer . But transformations may also be applied to the treeview  or other views.","The expression(s) in this element are formulas similar to those seen in spreadsheet formulas: the expression is a series of (1) operators, (2) literals, (3) variables, (4) functions, and (5) miscellaneous expression delimiters. The main difference from traditional spreadsheet formulas is that the variables may stand for either scalars or vectors, depending on the source or the context. A sample expression follows:\n\n*(2000)\u2212(3,12,45)\n","Operators are: addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (*), division (\/), less than (<), greater than (>), or (|), and (&). The operators have different meanings based on the types of the sub-expressions they work on. Operating on two vectors is interpreted as element-by-element operation on the two vectors. Thus, A*B, where A and B are vectors, is C={a*b, . . . an*bn}.","Literals are defined either directly in the expression (e.g., \u201c46\u201d), or assigned to a variable (e.g., \u201cpi=3.14156\u201d).","Variables can come from one of six different places in RMML. First, they can be defined as variables directly in the RMML document . This is done by creating a <variable> element and assigning it a default value. Second, variables can be associated with graphical components in the parameters panel  in the RDML data viewer . In one implementation consistent with this invention, there are four different types of \u201cgui components.\u201d These are listed and described below under <gui> element . Third, a variable can be defined from a line item element identical to those found in an RDML document . Because they are identical, a line item can be simply cut and pasted from an RDML document  to an RMML document . Fourth, a variable can be drawn from a remote source. In one implementation consistent with the present invention, that remote source can be a hyperlink to a line item in an RDML document . This is accomplished by using an Xpointer hyperlink in the \u201chref\u201d attribute of a variable element. Fifth, a variable can be defined as one of the series of data that is currently plotted on the chart. In one implementation in accordance with the present invention, there can be a maximum of six series on the chart; each can be accessed by using the reserved words A, B, C, D, E, and F. As would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, any number of uniquely definable series may be used. If the result type attribute of a macro is \u201cReplace All\u201d, then the expression is evaluated once for each series, with A being the series currently being transformed. Sixth, variables can be taken from an RDML document  that is already loaded in the RDML data viewer . In this case, the expression indicates the URL and a class string that can be found in one of the li_class elements of a line item element. The expression then uses that line item as the variable value.","Functions that are built in are provided by the interpreter  in one implementation consistent with the present invention and are a principal means of extending the language. These are in the form \u201cFUNCTION_NAME(expression)\u201d. Functions include: IF(x,y,z); SUM(x); AVERAGE(x); COUNT(x); MIN(x); MAX(x) and so forth.","Miscellaneous delimiters are implemented by separating expressions by a semi-colon (;). This indicates that the expressions are to be evaluated in order. Expressions can also be grouped in parentheses to tell the interpreter  how to evaluate sub-expressions.","Any string appearing in the <instructions> element  will be displayed in the parameters panel  to give the user any last minute instructions or suggestions. The <gui> element  contains any number of elements that describe graphical components. These graphical components will appear in the parameters panel  to give the user the ability to make changes to the macro's parameters. Four gui components (not shown) may be: <comp_vector>, <comp_list>, <comp_rbutton>, and <comp_ipanel>. The <comp_vector> is a vector variable, where the individual values of the vector can be viewed in a scrolling list box. A<comp_list> element is a scrolling list; each time the user clicks on a different item, the value of the variable attached to that component is changed to the value associated with that item. A<comp_rbutton> is a collection of radio buttons; each is associated with a different value. As the user clicks on different buttons, the value associated with the component itself is changed, and the macro is re-run. A<comp_ipanel> is an input field that allows the user directly to input changes to the macro.","Generally, macros are not meant to run blindly on all data. First, the interpreter  checks if the macro has any \u201cqualifiers\u201d that must be checked against the data. If there are any strings in the <qualifiers> element  of the RMML document , these are checked against strings in the <li_class> element  or other elements or attributes of the data. If the data is qualified, the interpreter  will proceed with running the macro. For example, if the <qualifiers> element  of the macro specifies \u201cli_unit==currency\u201d, then the macro will only be run if the li_unit attribute of the data being operated on is a currency value.","The <error_handling> element  holds error messages that can be displayed by the RDML data viewer  if there are problems of an indicated type. The <testing> element  holds instructions to testing applications regarding automated testing routines. These applications undertake basic unit testing such as checking for out-of-bounds problems, missing value problems, divide-by-zero issues, etc.","The third major section of the RMML document , the <macro_references> element  holds references to outside macros and data sets that might be incorporated into the macro by reference. The two sub-elements are, accordingly, the <rmmldocs> element  and the <data_docs> element .","IV.C.1. RMML Macro Package","Generally, there are three major areas of the RMML Macro Package: the RMML document handling classes (), the graphical interface (), and the macro interpreter (). In one implementation consistent with the present invention, this package of software classes connects to the RDML data viewer  in only a few places: it gets data from the ChartManager \/ChartData  objects, posts its graphical components through the GUI  object, and can access the loaded RDML documents  in the Primary Data Store .","RMML Document Handling",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0322","num":"0328"},"figref":"FIG. 19A","b":["1910","104","706","100","104","1906","1906","1908"]},"The RMMLDoc  can be structured in two ways: either wrapping a TXDocument object to arrive at an RMMLDoc , or creating a new RMMLDoc  object with the data from the TXDocument.","The RMMLDoc  object contains methods for accessing individual elements and attributes of the document in a way that is easy to comprehend in the context of the macro package.

First, MacroAdapter( ) is the constructor that creates a MacroAdapter  object. Before a macro is run, it has a chance to make a copy of the data that it is about to transform so that undo operations can be performed. The createMemento( ) method takes a snapshot of the data plotted on the chart by copying the ChartData object  to a Memento object.","Also, before a macro is run, the method initMacro( ) is run and gives the macro a chance to load any remote data or macro code. The replaceVariable( ) method runs the macro on multiple series on a chart. For example, if the result_type is \u201cReplace Each\u201d and there are four series charted on the chart, the macro will be run four times. The first time, A in the formula represents the first series, the second time it represents the second series and so forth. The method performTransformation( ) evaluates the transformation string, and updates the various titles and legends. An important part of performTransformation( )'s code is to determine the result_type of the macro and call the evaluateFormula( ) method in the correct manner. For \u201cReplace Each,\u201d it is called once for each series, while for \u201cReplace All,\u201d it is run only once.","The performTransformation( ) method also calls the four update methods: updateChartTitle( ) updateLabels( ), updateLegend( ) and updateYAxisTitle( ). Each of these modifies the relevant strings in the ChartData object  so it can be passed on to the chart.","RMML Graphical Interface",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0332","num":"0338"},"figref":["FIG. 19B","FIG. 20A"],"b":["734","100","732","1926","732","2002","1958","1960"]},"The NewMacroPanel  may be a subclass of a JPanel  in Java's Swing set of classes. Those skilled in the art will be able to chose the appropriate class to use for other major platforms. The left side of the NewMacroPanel  is a frame for a multiple document interface (in this case, a Desktop for JinternalFrame objects from Java's Swing Set). Each MacroLibrary  that is opened created a new internal frame, which allows users to select macros from multiple libraries at the same time.","When a MacroLibrary  is opened, all macros within it are loaded and registered. \u201cRegistration\u201d is a series of methods wherein the macro's variables are found in various elements of the RMMLDoc , and graphical representations of these variables are built for inclusion in the parameter panel .","The graphical components for all of the variables associated with a set of macros are created in the MacroAssumptionGroup 1944 class. This class has a factory method that examines the attributes of the variables reported by the RMMLDoc  (variable name, variable value, gui type, default value, etc.) and creates the appropriate MacroGUI class: MacroGUI_List  (see ), MacroGUI_RadioButton  (see ), MacroGUI_Vector  (see ), or MacroGUI_Default  (see ). Each of these graphical compents appears differently in the parameter panel  as shown in the screen shots noted.","The registration of macros by the MacroLibrary  also involves creating an MVariable  object to go with each variable, and adding these to a cache of available Mvariables . These Mvariable  objects are used in the actual evaluation of expressions. The registration process also involves registering the MacroGUI  objects as sources for events that the MacroManager  object can use to trigger the running of a macro. Mvariables  encapsulate the various characteristics of a variable: its value, default, and source.","The description panel  and the parameter panel  are populated with graphical components and text when a particular macro is selected in the treeview  listing of a MacroLibrary  internal frame. The macro that is selected provides the description text, the various labels and the MacroGUI  components.","RMML Interpreter","The MacroManager object  is responsible for detecting that a macro has been selected or a parameter changed, getting the various data sets and variables called up and made available to an Evaluator object , and that the data set charted (or showing on the treeview ) is obtained and transformed and sent back to be recharted on the chart  or relisted on the treeview.","ChartData  contains the data from the current chart  (or active treeview , depending on the type of the macro). It makes this data available as just another variable to the Evaluator object , and takes the final result of the Evaluator object .","The Evaluator  evaluates the string expression(s) in the <code> element  of the RMML document , or the various expressions from the macros that have been selected. The expression is broken up into tokens by the Tokenizer classes . These tokens are the various operators, variables, literals, functions and other control symbols used in the RMML expression language detailed above. From these tokens, the Formula object  builds a parse tree, by recursive descent, made up of FormulaNode  objects created from the tokens. The FormulaNode  objects evaluate themselves using the resolver objects VariableResolver  and FunctionResolver . These resolvers in turn call the Evaluator objects  to give them the current value of a variable or a function. For example, the FormulaNode  evaluation process may have an \u201cA\u201d token; the Evaluator object  knows that this means series A on the chart, and uses the vector of data (it could be an array or other data structure) currently found in the chart . The formula exception  relays errors associated with the processing of a function.","The foregoing description of an implementation of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not exhaustive and does not limit the present invention to the precise form disclosed.
