title: Recording system and control method for a recording system
abstract: A system in which a recording device is connected to another device can test the functionality of the recording device and test the functionality of the system including the recording device at the same time. A recording system  causes the printer  to execute a test relating to the functionality of the printer  in response to operation of a test switch , store the test switch  operation count, and return the stored test switch  operation count in response to a request from the host computer . The host computer  requests the printer  to send the test switch  operation count, and runs a test related to the recording system  based on the operation count returned by the printer  in response to the request.

Technical Field","The present invention relates to a recording system including a recording device and a recording control device, and to a method of controlling the recording system.","2. Related Art","Printers and other types of recording devices that record on a recording medium and can execute a print test when a switch provided on the recording device is operated are known from the literature. See, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Appl. Pub. JP-A-2003-76228.","When a recording control device that outputs data to be recorded and recording commands to the recording device is connected to the recording device, testing communication between the recording device and the recording control device is controlled by the recording control device. See, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Appl. Pub. JP-A-11-350271.","When a new recording device is set up, the functionality of the recording device is usually first tested alone by executing a print test, for example, and the functionality of the system including the recording control device and the recording device is tested using a communication test, for example, to confirm if the recording device and the recording control device are both operating normally. These tests typically include operating a switch on the recording device causing the recording device to output a predetermined printout that is then visually evaluated by the operator to check the functionality of the recording device itself, and a communication test in which the connected recording control device is operated to send a particular print command to the recording device and check if the recording device outputs the printout specified by this command.","However, the recording device and recording control device are not necessarily together, and may be located in remote locations or different rooms connected by a communication line. In order for one person to operate and check the test results of both the recording device and the recording control device in this situation requires that person to move between the different locations, and testing the functionality of the recording device and the functionality of the system that includes the recording device together (one after the other) is not easy.","At least of one embodiment of the present invention enables easily testing both recording device functionality and the functionality of a system including a recording device that is connected to a recording control device or other device.","A first aspect of the invention is a recording system comprising a recording device that records on a recording medium, and a recording control device that is communicably connected to the recording device, wherein: the recording device includes a test control unit that detects a first operation instructing test (self-test) execution from operation of an operating unit, and executes a test related to a function of the recording device, an operation information storage unit that stores operation information related to operation of the operating unit, and a transmission unit that sends operation information for the operating unit stored in the operation information storage unit in response to a request from the recording control device; and the recording control device includes a system test control unit that requests the recording device to send operation information for the operating unit, and executes a test of the recording system based on second operation information that is related to a second operation included in the operation information sent from the recording device in response to the request.","In a recording system connecting a recording device and a recording control device, a test of recording device functionality is run when the operator performs a first operation of an operating unit disposed to the recording device in order to test the functionality of the recording device.","When the operator performs a second operation of the operating unit of the recording device to test system functionality, the recording device sends second operation information relating to this second operation to the recording control device, and triggered by detecting this second operation information in the operation information, the recording control device performs a test of a recording system function, such as sending a command to the recording device to produce specific output and causing the recording device to output the specific printout.","Both tests can thus be performed as a result of the operator operating only the operating unit of the recording device, and the operator can evaluate the test result from the operation of the recording device and the output result.","A test of recording device function and a test of the function of the system including the recording device can thus both be performed as a result of a simple operation on the recording device side. In addition, the operator can run tests including a communication test and get the test results at the same location by operating only the recording device. The recording device and the recording control device can therefore be located remotely to each other and the tests can be performed without the operator needing to change location.","Furthermore, because the recording device may also store operation information such as the number of times the operating unit was operated (operation count), the type and location of the operated operating unit, the length of time of or the time between operations of the operating unit, and the recording control device detects operation of the operating unit based on this information about operation of the operating unit, the recording device does not need to inform the recording control device every time the operating unit is operated.","In addition, if the second operation information specifies a test of the recording system, the recording system test is executed only when the operation information from the recording device is interpreted and the second operation information is detected because a indication of the recording system test is stored in the recording control device. As a result, a recording system test can be performed easily even when using a simple recording device that only has a function for reporting operation information and other status information to the recording control device in addition to a recording function. Furthermore, because these tests can be started by operating only the recording device, testing is simple when the recording control device is in a location far from the recording device.","In a recording system according to another aspect of the invention, the recording control device preferably includes a control-side operation detection unit that compares the past operation information including past sent from the recording device in response to the operation information transmission request, and operation information including past that was previously sent from the recording device, and detects the second operation information; and the system test control unit executes a test related to the recording system when the second operation information is detected by the control-side operation detection unit.","The recording control device in this aspect of the invention can reliably detect operation of the operating unit based on change in the operation information of the operating unit stored by the recording device.","In a recording system according to another aspect of the invention, the control-side operation detection unit of the recording control device requests operation information for the operating unit from the recording device at a regular interval after the operating system of the recording control device starts.","In this aspect of the invention, because the recording control device requests and gets the operation information of the operating unit from the recording device at a regular interval after the operating system of the recording control device starts, the recording control device can quickly detect operation of the operating unit and run the test without performing an operation timed to operation of the operating unit.","In a recording system according to another aspect of the invention, the recording control device includes a storage unit that stores the operation information sent from the recording device; and the control-side operation detection unit detects the second operation information by comparing the operation information including past sent from the recording device with the previously sent operation information including past stored in the storage unit.","The recording control device in this aspect of the invention can reliably detect operation of the operating unit based on change in the operation information of the operating unit stored by the recording device.","In a recording system according to another aspect of the invention, the system test control unit of the recording control device executes a test including communicating with the recording device as a test related to the recording system.","This aspect of the invention enables also testing communication with a recording control device located in a place remote from the recording device based on an operation performed at the recording device.","In a recording system according to another aspect of the invention, the recording device is a printing device that forms images on the recording medium by means of a printhead; and the test control unit executes a test printing operation using the printhead when the first operation is detected.","This aspect of the invention enables performing a print test using the printhead as the test of the recording device.","Another aspect of the invention is a control method for a recording system comprising a recording device that records on a recording medium, and a recording control device that is communicably connected to the recording device, including steps of: the recording device detecting a first operation instructing test execution from operation of an operating unit, executing a test related to the recording device, storing operation information related to operation of the operating unit, and sending the stored operation information for the operating unit in response to a request from the recording control device; and the recording control device requesting the recording device to send operation information for the operating unit, and executing a test of the recording system based on second operation information that is related to a second operation included in the operation information sent from the recording device in response to the request.","In a recording system connecting a recording device and a recording control device, a test of recording device functionality is run when the operator performs operates an operating unit disposed to the recording device in order to test the functionality of the recording device.","When the operator performs a second operation of the operating unit of the recording device to test system functionality, the recording device sends second operation information relating to this second operation to the recording control device, and triggered by detecting this second operation information in the operation information, the recording control device performs a test of a recording system function, such as sending a command to the recording device to produce specific output and causing the recording device to output the specific printout.","Both tests can thus be performed as a result of the operator operating only the operating unit of the recording device, and the operator can evaluate the test result from the operation of the recording device and the output result.","A test of recording device function and a test of the function of the system including the recording device can thus both be performed as a result of a simple operation on the recording device side. In addition, the operator can run tests including a communication test and get the test results at the same location by operating only the recording device. The recording device and the recording control device can therefore be located remotely to each other and the tests can be performed without the operator needing to change location.","Furthermore, because the recording device stores information about operation of the operating unit, and the recording control device detects operation of the operating unit based on this information about operation of the operating unit, the recording device does not need to inform the recording control device every time the operating unit is operated.","In addition, if the second operation information specifies a test of the recording system, the recording system test is executed only when the operation information from the recording device is interpreted and the second operation information is detected because the indication of the recording system test is stored in the recording control device.

The printer  is an example of a recording device that prints (records) markings such as text and images on a cut sheet or continuous sheet medium made of coated paper, plastic film, or other recording medium. The host computer  is an example of a recording control device that controls the printer  to print.","Note that this embodiment shows the host computer  and printer  connected 1:1, but the number of printers  that may be connected to a single host computer  is not limited and a plurality of printers  may be connected to the host computer . A single printer  may also be connected to a plurality of host computers .","The communication line  may be a communication cable or wireless circuit connecting the host computer  and printer  1:1, or a wired or wireless LAN or wide-area network using public telecommunication lines connecting a plurality of printers  to one host computer .","The recording method of the printer  is also not limited. In this embodiment of the invention, for example, the printer  is an inkjet printer that records markings such as text or images by discharging plural colors of ink from a printhead onto the recording medium.","As shown in , the host computer  mainly includes a CPU , nonvolatile memory such as ROM , volatile memory such as RAM , a storage unit , an input unit  connected to a keyboard or other input device, an output unit  connected to a display or other output device, and a communication interface . The host computer  controls the printer  by outputting commands and print data to the printer  through the communication interface  while the CPU  runs the operating system A, application program B, and printer driver C stored in the storage unit . The host computer  sends print jobs including print execution commands and print data to the printer  for printing. The host computer  also sends a timer reset command described below to the printer  at regular intervals.","When host computer  power turns on, the operating system A is activated and an application program B for testing the recording system  starts.","The main parts of the printer  include a CPU , rewritable nonvolatile memory such as flash ROM , volatile memory such as RAM , a communication interface , a printing control unit  that records images by ejecting ink onto the recording paper (recording medium), a paper transportation mechanism , a printhead , a speaker , and an LED .","The printer  receives print data by communicating with the host computer  through the communication interface  while the CPU  executes firmware stored in flash ROM . Based on the received commands and print data, the printing control unit  issues a receipt or coupon, for example, by controlling the paper transportation mechanism  to convey paper and driving the printhead  to print on the paper. The printer  also reports information visually or audibly to the user by causing the LED  to light steady or blink, or the speaker  to sound a buzzer, play a melody, or output spoken guidance.","The printer  also has a test switch  as an operating unit. The test switch  is a switch for telling the printer  to run the print test, and is disposed with the LED  in an operating panel (not shown in the figure) disposed at the front of the printer  case. When the test switch  is operated, the CPU  of the printer  controls printing a nozzle check pattern to visually check for clogging of the printhead .","The printer  also has a function for counting and storing an operation count indicating the number of times the test switch  is operated, and enables the host computer  to detect operation of the test switch  based on the test switch  operation count.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","3","1","21","2","24","41","3","42"]},"As shown in , the printer  has a reception unit  that receives commands and print data sent from the host computer , and a receive buffer  that temporarily stores the commands and print data received by the reception unit . The data received in the receive buffer  is interpreted by the command interpreter , command data is sent to the control command buffer , and print data is sent to the print buffer , by DMA transfer.","Print data temporarily stored in the print buffer  is converted by a data conversion process, resulting in dot pattern data corresponding to the nozzle configuration of the printhead  being generated and stored in the print buffer . The control command data temporarily stored in the control command buffer  is read by the main control unit , and processes are executed according to the control commands, such as a paper cut command.","When the operation detection unit  of the printer  detects an operation such as pressing the test switch  once (first operation), the main control unit  (test control unit) converts image data for printing a nozzle check pattern to produce and store the corresponding dot pattern data in the print buffer . The dot pattern data stored in the print buffer  is read by the printing control unit , and a print test (a self-test of the printer ) is executed as controlled by the printing control unit .","If the operation detection unit  detects the test switch  being pressed plural times (second operation), the main control unit  controls storing the operation count (operation information) of the test switch  in the test switch operation count storage unit  (operation count storage unit).","The test switch operation count storage unit  is a storage area reserved in flash ROM  () that stores the cumulative operation count of the test switch , and increments the count (+1) each time the operation detection unit  detects operation of the test switch . The test switch operation count storage unit  does not necessarily need to be a counter that maintains a multiple digit count. More particularly, the test switch operation count storage unit  simply needs to be able to acquire at least two states, and could be a storage area storing a flag that changes between 0 and 1 each time the operation detection unit  detects operation of the test switch .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"3"},"As shown in , the operation detection unit  of the printer  detects when the test switch  is operated (step S), and the main control unit  controls incrementing the operation count of the test switch  stored in the test switch operation count storage unit  (step S). The printer  then starts the print test and prints the nozzle check pattern (step S), and returns to the normal standby state when the print test ends (step S).","As shown in , the host computer  also renders the basic functions of the host computer  by running the operating system A stored in the storage unit . The host computer  includes a application execution unit  that runs the application program B stored in the storage unit , a printer driver execution unit  that runs the printer driver C, and a communication unit  that communicates with the printer  to send print jobs and commands.","The printer driver execution unit  includes a command transmission control unit , test execution control unit , test switch operation detection unit , and communication unit  that communicates with the printer .","The command transmission control unit  generates and sends to the printer  by means of the communication unit  print jobs and control commands for printing data processed by the application execution unit  based on data output by the application execution unit  running an application program.","The test execution control unit  (system test control unit) runs a communication test with the printer .","The test switch operation detection unit  (control-side operation detection unit) detects operation of the test switch  disposed to the printer .","The communication unit  sends commands to the printer  and receives information from the printer  according to instructions from the API (application programming interface) communicated through a port (a LAN port in this embodiment of the invention) for communicating with the printer .","When the application execution unit  outputs a print command and print data, the command transmission control unit  generates a print job including a print command and the print data, and sends the generated print job to the printer  by means of the communication unit .","The test execution control unit  generates and sends test commands to the printer  by means of the communication unit  as controlled by the application execution unit , and tests communication between the host computer  and printer  (sending a command for a print test) based on whether or not a response command from the printer  is received within a predetermined time.","The test switch operation detection unit  generates and sends to the printer  by means of the communication unit  a status request command requesting the printer  to return the operation count of the test switch . The status request command is commonly used to request status information reporting the operating status of the printer , but the status request command in this embodiment of the invention is defined as a command that also requests the test switch  operation count.","When the printer  receives the status request command sent by the test switch operation detection unit , the main control unit  reads the test switch  operation count stored in the test switch operation count storage unit , and sends the operation count together with status information reporting the current operating state (such as standby, sleep, on-line, or off-line) of the printer  to the host computer .","The printer  can return only status information as the response to the status request command, and when only status information is sent the host computer  receives and processes the status information as not containing the operation count.","The test switch operation detection unit  of the host computer  sends the status request command at a predetermined interval (such as every 3 seconds) by means of the communication unit , and the operation count is sent with the status information each time from the printer .","The test switch operation detection unit  of the host computer  acquires the operation count added to the status information sent from the printer , and detects operation of the test switch  by comparing this count with the previously sent count. If the previously received count and the current count are not the same (the second operation information is detected), the test switch  was operated.","Operation of the test switch  can thus be easily and accurately determined based on whether or not the counts are the same (match). Furthermore, because the count changes each time the test switch  is operated and clearly detecting if the counts are the same is sufficient, the test switch operation count storage unit  can be any configuration enabling discriminating between at least two states (that is, a configuration that can store  data bit). However, because the test switch  could be operated multiple times in the interval between when the host computer  sends the status request command, the test switch operation count storage unit  can preferably at least approximately 5 or 10 values so that more operating status can be discriminated and operation of the test switch  can be detected more reliably.","The application execution unit  periodically outputs a printer status request to the test switch operation detection unit  to acquire the printer  status. The test switch operation detection unit  outputs the status information received from the printer  as the response to the printer status request.","When operation of the test switch  is detected based on the test switch  operation count added to the status information received from the printer , the test switch operation detection unit  adds and outputs information indicating operation of the test switch  to the status information sent to the application execution unit .","The application execution unit  controls the test execution control unit  and executes a communication status test with the printer  when information indicating operation of the test switch  is added to the status information input from the test switch operation detection unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"210"},"As shown in , when the printer driver execution unit  sends a status request command to the printer  by means of the test switch operation detection unit , and the printer  returns status information in response to this status request command, the printer driver execution unit  acquires the test switch  operation count that was sent with the status information (step S).","The test switch operation detection unit  determines if the acquired operation count matches the operation count contained in the previously received status information (step S), and returns to step S if the values match. If the values do not match (second operation information is detected), the test switch operation detection unit  determines the test switch  was operated, and runs a communication test by means of the test execution control unit  (step S).","Alternatively, each time the test switch operation detection unit  acquires the test switch  operation count (step S), the printer driver execution unit  could store the acquired operation count in a storage area provided in storage unit  (), for example, and after acquiring the test switch  operation count compare the acquired count with the stored count to determine coincidence. In this case, the stored count can be updated each time the same process executes.","The test switch  of the printer  is, for example, operated once to print a nozzle check pattern when the printer  is newly installed. When the printer  is newly installed, the host computer  and printer  were just connected and the host computer -printer  communication test is therefore preferably run, but this test is executed by a function of the host computer . Therefore, when the nozzle check pattern of the printer  is printed and a communication test is also performed, the test switch  must be operated on the printer  and the input unit  of the host computer  must then be operated.","The printer  in this recording system  can be installed at a location remove from the host computer . For example, the host computer  and printer  may be located on different floors of the same building, or the printer  and host computer  could be located remotely from each other using a dedicated line or public telecommunication network as the communication line . When the host computer  and printer  are thus remote from each other, it is difficult for one person to operate both the host computer  and printer , and printing a nozzle check pattern on the printer  and testing communication with the host computer  cannot be done together.","In a recording system  according to this embodiment of the invention, the operating system A is activated when the host computer  power turns on, and an application program B for testing the recording system  is started.","This test application program B has a function for detecting operation of the test switch , and executes the communication test when operation of the test switch  is detected. The test operator can print the nozzle check pattern (run the self-test) and run the communication test by operating the test switch  of the printer  whether the host computer  and printer  are in proximity to each other or in remote locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["1","201","222","3"]},"As shown in , the printer  increments the operation count stored in the test switch operation count storage unit  and executes the print test each time the test switch  is operated.","The test switch operation detection unit  sends a status request command to the printer  at a predetermined interval. The printer  receiving this status request command adds the count stored in the test switch operation count storage unit  to the status information indicating the current operating status, and outputs to the test switch operation detection unit . If the returned count matches the previously received count, the test switch operation detection unit  detects that the test switch  was operated.","The application execution unit  outputs a printer status request command to the test switch operation detection unit  at a preset interval to get the printer  status. In response to this status request command, the test switch operation detection unit  outputs the printer  status information, and the application execution unit  refers to the status information to determine if the printer  is operating normally. If information indicating that the test switch  was operated is added to the status information output by the test switch operation detection unit , the application execution unit  controls the test execution control unit  and runs a communication test with the printer .","A recording system  according to this embodiment of the invention is a recording system  including a printer  and a host computer  communicably connected to the printer .","The printer  detects operation of a test switch  by means of a operation detection unit , executes a print test to test printer  functionality as controlled by the main control unit  in response to the test switch  being operated, stores the test switch  operation count in a test switch operation count storage unit , increments the operation count stored in the test switch operation count storage unit  when the operation detection unit  detects that the test switch  was operated, and in response to a request from the host computer  outputs the test switch  operation count stored in the test switch operation count storage unit .","The host computer  asks the printer  to send the test switch  operation count using a function of the test switch operation detection unit , and based on the operation count returned by the printer  in response to this request tests the communication state, which is a test of the recording system , by means of the test execution control unit .","As a result, the recording system  can execute both a test of printer  functionality and a test of the system including the printer  by means of a simple operation. Both tests can also be started based only on operation of the test switch  disposed to the printer  even when the host computer  and the printer  are remote from each other.","In addition, when the printer  is requested to send the test switch  operation count by means of a function of the test switch operation detection unit , the test switch operation detection unit  of the host computer  compares the operation count sent from the printer  in response to this request with the operation count previously sent from the printer  and detects operation of the test switch . Operation of the test switch  can therefore be detected based on change in the operation count of the test switch .","In addition, because the printer  stores the operation count of the test switch , and the host computer  detects operation of the test switch  based on this test switch  operation count, the printer  does not need to notify the host computer  every time the test switch  is operated. As a result, operation of the test switch  of a printer  can be reliably detected by the host computer  even when a printer  with a simple design is used.","Because the test switch operation detection unit  of the host computer  in this recording system  requests the test switch  operation count from the printer  at a regular interval, operation of the test switch  can be quickly detected and a test performed without executing an operation timed to operation of the test switch .","In addition, because the host computer  stores the operation count sent from the printer  in the storage unit , and the test switch operation detection unit  detects operation of the test switch  by comparing the operation count sent from the printer  with the operation count that was previously sent and stored, the host computer  can reliably detect operation of the test switch  based on change in the test switch  operation count stored by the host computer .","It will be obvious to one with ordinary skill in the related art that the foregoing embodiment is but one example of the invention, and the invention is not limited thereto. For example, the printer  in the foregoing embodiment test prints a nozzle check pattern as controlled by the main control unit , and the test execution control unit  of the host computer  controls running a communication test with the printer , but the invention is not so limited. For example, the print test of the printer  could be an operation that prints a list of particular parameter settings, or an operation that prints out the current operating status of the printer , or the total running time or number of lines printed by the printer .","In addition, the host computer  test could test the operating state of all printers  in the recording system , or the communication state and printing function could be tested simultaneously as a result of the host computer  controlling printing by the printer .","Yet further, if the test fails when the host computer  tests communication in the foregoing embodiment, the failure could be reported by causing the LED  to light steady or blink, printing out a message reporting the error, or outputting audio reporting that an error occurred, or a control signal could be sent from the printer  to another device connected to the printer , and the device that receives this control signal could output an appropriate error message.","Operation based on the operation count used as test switch  operation information is described by way of example in the foregoing embodiment, but the process could be executed using the length of time the test switch  is pressed or the interval between when the test switch  is pressed as this operation information. A plurality of test switches could also be used and the process could be based on the combination of plural test switches that are operated, or the test switch could be a touch panel switch and the process executes based on the combination of places that are operated on the touch panel switch. Based on this switch operation data, a test related to the functionality of the printer , and a test of the function of the recording system  including the printer , can also be selectively executed.","The printer  in the foregoing embodiment is described as being an inkjet printer, but the recording device to which the invention can be applied is not particularly limited as long as the device can record markings such as text or images. More particularly, the invention can also be applied to thermal printers that print on thermal roll paper using a line thermal head having heating elements, a dot impact printer, or a laser printer, for example. The invention can also be applied to printers that are incorporated into other devices.","The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that it may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims."],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","EFFECT OF AT LEAST OF ONE EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
