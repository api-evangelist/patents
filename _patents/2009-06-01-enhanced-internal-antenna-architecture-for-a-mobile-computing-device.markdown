{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A mobile computing device such as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone or smart phone generally may provide voice and data communications functionality, as well as computing and processing capabilities. For voice and data communications, the mobile computing device typically employs a radio transmitter\/receiver (\u201ctransceiver\u201d) and one or more antennas. Antenna design for a mobile computing device is an important consideration and is often limited by strict performance constraints.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0003","num":"0002"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","100","106","108","104","100","108"]},"Some antenna placements may be undesirable if they increase the overall size and shape of the device. In addition, some antenna placements may provide reduced or unsatisfactory performance. Some antenna placements even may prevent compliance with certain regulatory requirements for device operation, such as the FCC specific absorption rate (SAR) limit of 1.6 mW\/g. Such problems may be further exacerbated for mobile computing devices with smaller form factors. Accordingly, there exists the need for improved internal antenna architectures for a mobile computing device.","Various embodiments are directed to an internal multi-band antenna architecture for a mobile computing device. In one or more embodiments, a mobile computing device may be implemented as a dual-mode Global System for Mobile Communications\/Universal Mobile Telephone System (GSM\/UMTS) multi-band device configured to operate in either an 850 MHz frequency band, an 1800 MHz frequency band, a 1900 MHz frequency band, and a 2100 MHz frequency band (850\/1800\/1900\/2100 frequency set) or a 900 MHz frequency band, the 1800 MHz frequency band, the 1900 MHz frequency band, and the 2100 MHz frequency band (900\/1800\/1900\/2100 frequency set). Other sets of frequency bands may be used as well. The internal multi-band antenna architecture may comprise a split multi-band\/single sub-band design having internal antenna elements which coexist to cover all four frequency bands with sufficient efficiency and SAR performance.","When employing the conventional antenna designs illustrated in , it may not be feasible to design a single multi-band antenna having sufficient efficiency and performance to cover the 850\/1800\/1900\/2100 MHz frequency bands or the 900\/1800\/1900\/2100 MHz frequency bands. As the number of frequency bands and required bandwidth increase, the design of a single multi-band antenna becomes more difficult. Prior solutions focus on extending functionality of an antenna with longer traces or meander lines, more intricate planar structures, larger physical antenna sizes, and so forth. This becomes untenable for smaller form-factor devices. In particular, antenna size is a key limitation. For example, an antenna may have a height of only 5.9 mm in some devices. Furthermore, regardless of antenna efficiency, the antenna in such small devices often may be too close to the user's head while the user is talking. As a result, the user's head absorbs too much energy radiating from antenna or, stated another way, the SAR value of the device will be too high to comply with the FCC limit of 1.6 mW\/g.","Because the conventional internal antenna designs shown in  require more space to function properly, they are not suitable as the internal dimensions of the device decrease. With such designs, when there is less space for the antenna, performance suffers significantly. Namely, either the SAR value will be too high to comply with FCC standards or the efficiency will be too low to pass carrier requirements.","For example, if the conventional design (e.g., PIFA) of  is employed, the top-positioned internal antenna may be able to achieve only 36% minimum efficiency across the four operating bands with a SAR of 1.86 mW\/g or above, which is higher than FCC limit of 1.6 mW\/g. If the conventional design (e.g., paper-clip) of  is employed, the bottom-positioned internal antenna could improve efficiency to 42%, but still cannot obtain 50% minimum efficiency across all four operating bands. In addition, it is difficult to have a SAR value at all four bands of less than 1.6 mW\/g. Typically, the SAR value for such design is 2.43 mW\/g.","To solve these and other problems, a mobile computing device may comprise an internal multi-band antenna architecture having a split multi-band\/single sub-band design. For example, a first internal antenna element may be configured for downlink UMTS operations in the 2100 MHz frequency band. A second internal antenna element may be configured for tri-band GSM operation in the 850 MHz frequency band, the 1800 MHz frequency band, and the 1900 MHz frequency band (850\/1800\/1900 MHz) or in the 900 MHz frequency band, the 1800 MHz frequency band, and the 1900 MHz frequency band (900\/1800\/1900 MHz). The second internal antenna element may be further configured for uplink UMTS operations in the 1900 MHz frequency band. In such embodiments, the first internal antenna element and the second internal antenna element may co-exist to cover all four frequency bands with sufficient efficiency and SAR performance. The embodiments, however, are not limited in this context.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200"]},"As shown, the mobile computing device  may have an internal antenna architecture comprising at least two internal antenna elements , . In the illustrated embodiment shown in , the mobile computing device  may have, among other elements, a housing . The housing  may have different parts, including an upper portion, a lower portion and a mid-frame (not shown). In one embodiment, a first internal antenna element  may be disposed somewhere on the internal surfaces of the various portions of the housing . The first internal antenna element  may be arranged to operate in at least one downlink frequency sub-band of an upper frequency band from a set of frequency bands for communication in a first mode. A second internal antenna element  may also be disposed on the housing . The second internal antenna  may be arranged to operate in an uplink frequency sub-band of the upper frequency band for communication in the first mode. The second internal antenna element  may also be arranged to operate in at least three lower frequency bands from the set of frequency bands for communication in a second mode.","The mobile computing device  may comprise, or be implemented as, any type of suitable portable wireless device that is consistent with the described embodiments, such as a smart phone, mobile station, portable computing device with a self-contained power source (e.g., battery), a laptop computer, ultra-laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, combination cellular telephone\/PDA, mobile unit, subscriber station, user terminal, portable computer, handheld computer, palmtop computer, wearable computer, media player, pager, messaging device, data communications device, and so forth.","In one embodiment, for example, the mobile computing device  may be implemented as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone, sometimes referred to as a smart phone. Examples of smart phones include various Palm\u00ae products such as Palm\u00ae Pre\u2122 and Treo\u2122 smart phones, made by Palm Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif. Although some embodiments may be described with the mobile computing device  implemented as a smart phone by way of example, it may be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context.","The mobile computing device  may implement various communications technologies using, for example, one or more antennas, transceivers, processors and supporting radio architecture. For instance, the mobile computing device  may provide voice communications functionality in accordance with different types of cellular systems. Examples of cellular systems may include GSM systems, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, North American Digital Cellular (NADC) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Extended-TDMA (E-TDMA) systems, Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone Service (NAMPS) systems, third generation (3G) systems such as UMTS, Wide-band CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA-2000 and so forth.","In addition to voice communications functionality, the mobile computing device  may be arranged to provide wireless wide area network (WWAN) data communications functionality in accordance with different types of cellular systems. Examples of cellular systems offering WWAN data communications services may include Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO) systems, Evolution For Data and Voice (EVDV) systems, CDMA\/1xRTT systems, GSM with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (GSM\/GPRS) systems, Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) systems, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) systems, High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) systems, and so forth.","The mobile computing device  may be arranged to provide data communications functionality in accordance with different types of wireless local area network (WLAN) systems. Examples of suitable WLAN systems offering data communication services may include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.xx series of protocols, such as the IEEE 802.11a\/b\/g\/n series of standard protocols and variants (also referred to as \u201cWiFi\u201d), the IEEE 802.16 series of standard protocols and variants (also referred to as \u201cWiMAX\u201d), the IEEE 802.20 series of standard protocols and variants, and so forth.","The mobile computing device  may be arranged to perform data communications in accordance with different types of shorter range wireless systems, such as a wireless personal area network (PAN) system. One example of a suitable wireless PAN system offering data communication services may include a Bluetooth system operating in accordance with the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) series of protocols, including Bluetooth Specification versions v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v2.0, v2.0 with Enhanced Data Rate (EDR), as well as one or more Bluetooth Profiles, and so forth. Other examples may include systems using infrared techniques or near-field communication techniques and protocols, such as electromagnetic induction (EMI) techniques. An example of EMI techniques may include passive or active radio-frequency identification (RFID) protocols and devices.","The mobile computing device  may comprise an overall low-profile, small and compact device design. The mobile computing device  may also have multiple physical configurations. In one embodiment, for example, the mobile computing device  may have an open configuration where a keyboard is exposed, and a closed configuration where the keyboard is hidden. A slider mechanism may allow the mobile computing device  to move between the open and closed configurations. A size of the mobile computing device  when closed may be approximately 100.53 mm Length (L)\u00d759.57 mm Width (W)\u00d716.95 mm Thickness (T) or smaller. It can be appreciated that designing devices with such small form factors presents major difficulties with respect to the antenna design.","The mobile computing device  may have, among other elements, the housing . The housing  may comprise various materials such as plastic, metal, ceramic, glass, and so forth, suitable for enclosing and protecting the internal components of the mobile computing device. The housing  may enclose various internal components of the mobile computing device, including a printed circuited board (PCB) . The PCB  may comprise materials such as FR4, Rogers R04003, and\/or Roger RT\/Duroid, for example, and may include one or more conductive traces, via structures, and\/or laminates. The PCB  also may include a finish such as Gold, Nickel, Tin, or Lead. In various implementations, the PCB  may be fabricated using processes such as etching, bonding, drilling, and plating.","The mobile computing device  may be implemented with multiple antennas or antenna elements. In general, an antenna (or aerial) is a transducer designed to transmit or receive electromagnetic waves. In other words, antennas convert electromagnetic waves into electrical currents and vice versa. Physically, an antenna is an arrangement of conductors that generate a radiating electromagnetic field in response to an applied alternating voltage and the associated alternating electric current, or can be placed in an electromagnetic field so that the field will induce an alternating current in the antenna and a voltage between its terminals. Examples of antennas may include without limitation a planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA), a paper-clip antenna, a planar inverted-L antenna, an inverted-F antenna with a helical structure, an inverted-L antenna with a helical structure, a folded inverted conformal antenna (FICA), a monopole antenna, a meandered monopole antenna, a dipole antenna, a balanced antenna, a printed helical antenna, a chip antenna, a ceramic antenna, a microstrip antenna, a printed antenna, a patch antenna, a microstrip patch antenna, and any other suitable type of internal antenna which is consistent with the described embodiments.","In one embodiment, for example, the mobile computing device  may be implemented with at least two internal antenna elements, including the first internal antenna element  and the second internal antenna element . Additional antennas or antenna elements may also be implemented for the mobile computing device , and the embodiments are not limited in this context.","In various embodiments, the first internal antenna element  and\/or the second internal antenna element  may comprise multiple layers and\/or traces formed by chemical etching, metal etching, and other similar techniques. The actual number of layers, and length of each individual layer, may vary for a particular implementation. The antenna traces may have any suitable pattern or geometry tuned for various operating frequencies. For example, the antenna traces may comprise one or more center lines and\/or branch lines. Phase lines and\/or various chip components, such as resistors, capacitors or inductors, may be used among the center lines and\/or branch lines. The different elements may be contacted or parasitic.","In various embodiments, the first internal antenna element  and\/or the second internal antenna element  may comprise a flexible material or substrate. A flexible material may include any pliant material that is capable of being bent or flexed such as a flexible printed circuit (FPC). Other flexible materials may be used, however, such as a wire material, helical material, Teflon material, FR4 material, Mylar material, dielectric substrate, a soft plastic material, and other flexible materials.","In some embodiments, the first internal antenna element  and\/or the second internal antenna element  may comprise a rigid material. A rigid material may include any material that is deficient in or devoid of flexibility. Examples of rigid materials may include metal materials, plastic materials, ceramic materials, and so forth. In some cases, an antenna may be formed using a flat stamped metal having suitable characteristics to match the design and performance constraints for the mobile computing device .","In various embodiments, the first internal antenna element  and the second internal antenna element  may be internal antennas positioned somewhere within the housing . As such, all or some of the parts for the antenna elements ,  are not visible to a user. The antenna elements ,  may be positioned in various locations within the housing , such as disposed on various inner surfaces of the housing , such as an inner surface for an upper portion, a lower portion, or a mid-frame portion. Additionally or alternatively, the antenna elements ,  may be positioned on various components enclosed by the housing , such as the PCB .","In general, the first internal antenna element  may be located substantially near the top of the mobile computing device . For example, the first internal antenna element  may be located substantially near the top of the housing  and\/or the top of the PCB . The second internal antenna element  may be located substantially near the bottom of the mobile computing device . For example, the second internal antenna element  may be located substantially near the bottom of the housing  and\/or the bottom of the PCB . This placement attempts to maximize distance and space between the antenna elements , , thereby solving some of the problems associated with co-located antennas within a single device.","The first internal antenna element  may be positioned substantially near the top of the housing  and\/or the top of the PCB . The first internal antenna element  may be configured to operate in a downlink frequency sub-band of an upper frequency band, such as the 2100 MHz frequency band, for example. Upper frequency bands, in general, require smaller antenna volumes. In some embodiments, the first internal antenna element  may be structured and arranged in close proximity to various components of the mobile computing device  such as a speaker , a camera , and\/or a battery within the mobile computing device . Due to the smaller volume required by the first internal antenna element , there is sufficient space on the top of the mobile computing device  to implement a high-quality speaker , a camera , and\/or other components.","In various implementations, the first internal antenna element  may employ a planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) type antenna design having a ground layer of the PCB  underneath the internal antenna element . The ground plane may improve antenna performance and reduce SAR. The ground plane also may be required underneath the first internal antenna element  when certain components positioned at the edge of the PCB  demand a ground layer underneath for their circuitry. In such implementations, the first internal antenna element  may achieve greater than 50% efficiency.","The second internal antenna element  may be positioned substantially near the bottom of the housing  and\/or the bottom of the PCB  in order to improve efficiency. In some embodiments, the second internal antenna element  may be structured and arranged in close proximity to various components of the mobile computing device  such as a battery and\/or battery connector within the mobile computing device .","In various implementations, the second internal antenna element  may be structured and arranged with a bent or folded configuration. For example, the second internal antenna element  may employ a paper-clip type design in which most of ground layer of the PCB  underneath the internal antenna element  is removed. In such implementations, the antenna pattern may be optimized and most of the radiating element at the lower frequency bands may be on the top of the antenna carrier and further away from the PCB . As such, the second internal antenna element  may achieve 50% minimum efficiency at the 850\/1800\/1900 or 900\/1800\/1900 MHz frequency bands with a reduced SAR value of 1.35 mW\/g, which is lower than FCC limit of 1.6 mW\/g.","The first internal antenna element  may be positioned at the top of the mobile computing device  and the second internal antenna element  may be positioned at the bottom of the mobile computing device  to allow enough spatial separation to provide sufficient isolation among all four (e.g., 850\/1800\/1900\/2100 or 900\/1800\/1900\/2100 MHz) frequency bands. In some embodiments, the first internal antenna element  and the second internal antenna element  may achieve maximum separation within the mobile computing device . For example, the first internal antenna element  may be integrated with the mobile computing device  such that an external surface of the first internal antenna element  is substantially even, aligned or flush with the top of the housing  and\/or the top of the PCB . The second internal antenna element  may be integrated with the mobile computing device  such that an external surface of the second internal antenna element  is substantially even, aligned or flush with the bottom of the housing  and\/or the bottom of the PCB .","As described above, the internal multi-band antenna architecture may comprise a split multi-band\/single sub-band design having internal antenna elements ,  which coexist to cover all four frequency bands with sufficient efficiency and SAR. The internal antenna architecture also may be used to implement a multi-band antenna solution for a mobile computing device  having a small form factor. The internal antenna architecture may allow devices (e.g., QWERTY keyboard products) to have smaller internal dimensions and smaller antenna area while maintaining excellent GSM and UMTS services and functionality, such as high quality audio and camera functionality in the back of the device.","While the mobile computing device  shown in  comprises an exemplary embodiment of an internal antenna architecture, it can be appreciated that the exact placement or location of the first internal antenna element  and the second internal antenna element  within the mobile computing device  may be performed in accordance with various performance and design constraints. For example, the efficiency of each antenna may depend upon a proper relationship between the size and shape of the antenna and the wavelength of the targeted frequency. The specific frequency range that the antenna is designed to cover may dictate the optimal size of an antenna. Therefore, the specific implementation of the first internal antenna element  and the second internal antenna element  may vary depending upon such factors as the target operating frequencies, power consumption requirements, battery life, a form factor of the mobile computing device, transceiver operations, signal quality, weight considerations of the mobile computing device, and so forth.","The internal antenna architecture having the first internal antenna element  and the second internal antenna element  may be tuned for operating at one or more frequency bands, or certain portions of a frequency band. Accordingly, the mobile computing device  may be compatible with multiple types of wireless data, multimedia, and\/or cellular systems. In addition, the first internal antenna element  and\/or the second internal antenna element  may be used to implement various spatial diversity techniques to improve communication of wireless signals across one or more frequency bands of wireless shared media.","In one or more embodiments, the mobile computing device  may be implemented as a dual-mode device capable of communication over multiple networks. For instance, the mobile computing device  may be capable of operating in a first mode and a second mode. An example of a first mode may include a UMTS mode for communicating over a UMTS network. An example of a second mode may include GSM mode for communicating over a GSM network. As such, the internal antenna elements ,  may be tuned for operating across a set of frequency bands assigned to a GSM network and a UMTS network. It may be appreciated that the mobile computing device  may have other types of modes, networks and frequency bands as desired for a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","In order to support dual-mode communications, the mobile computing device  may be implemented as a multi-band device capable of supporting multiple frequency bands for communication over the multiple networks.

In this case, the second internal antenna element  may be arranged to operate in at least three lower frequency bands 850\/1800\/1900 MHz or 900\/1800\/1900 MHz from the set of frequency bands 850\/1800\/1900\/2100 MHz or 900\/1800\/1900\/2100 MHz for communication in a GSM mode. The embodiments, however, are not limited in this context.","In various embodiments, the downlink frequency sub-band and the uplink frequency sub-band may comprise discontiguous frequency sub-bands. The downlink frequency sub-band and the uplink frequency sub-band are discontiguous in that they are designed to cover different parts of the RF spectrum without overlap. In other words, the sub-bands may be adjacent to one another but not necessarily adjoining to one another. Utilizing separate internal antenna elements ,  for each of the respective downlink and uplink communications for a given network provides several technical advantages over conventional internal antenna architectures. For example, there is typically a guard band between a downlink frequency sub-band and an uplink frequency sub-band. In radio architectures, a guard band is an unused part of the radio spectrum between frequency bands for the purpose of preventing interference. It is typically a narrow frequency range used to separate two wider frequency ranges to ensure that both can transmit simultaneously without interfering each other. Guard bands may be used so that adjacent frequency bands on the same wireless shared media can avoid interference. As indicated in Table 2, for example, the UMTS Operating Band I has a frequency band of 2100 MHz, and utilizes a downlink frequency sub-band of 2110-2170 MHz, and an uplink frequency sub-band of 1920-1980 MHz. In this example, the guard band between the uplink and downlink frequency sub-bands is approximately 130 MHz. Utilizing separate internal antenna elements ,  for each of the respective downlink and uplink communications for a UMTS network reduces or eliminates the need for the antenna elements ,  to cover the 130 MHz guard band. This may reduce the geometries and antenna specifications needed to support UMTS operations, which may be particularly advantageous given the smaller form factors for the mobile computing device . Further, this may reduce the need for various components and circuit elements typically used to detect and filter the RF signals across a contiguous set of frequencies.","In one or more embodiments, the mobile computing device  may comprise a third internal antenna element  arranged to operate in at least one frequency band for communication in a third mode. The third mode may comprise, for example, a Global Positioning System (GPS) mode.

In one or more embodiments, the third internal antenna element  may comprise a single-band antenna element such as a separate Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna element.
