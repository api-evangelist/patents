{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to an elevation apparatus for a device such as a keyboard or other workstation accessory. More particularly, this invention relates to a vertical adjustment apparatus to hold a device, such as a keyboard, mouse, and\/or laptop computer, for a user to use while either sitting at the workstation or standing near the workstation. This allows a user to change from a seated to a standing position throughout the workday without moving the device from the apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the workplace, persons are often required to perform repetitive manual tasks in a sedentary position. By maintaining a sedentary position throughout the workday, the person can become fatigued without proper support. Remaining in that sedentary position may reduce blood flow through the legs as well. Utilizing ergonomic principles when designing furniture may increase worker productivity, decrease worker fatigue and absenteeism, and improve blood flow throughout the body.","Further, ergonomic principles dictate that it is desirable to properly support the hands, arms, and wrists of a seated person who is utilizing devices such as a computer keyboard, mouse, and\/or laptop computer.","It is known in the workstation design industry that by varying a person's body position, fatigue is reduced. Without changing positions periodically, proper circulation is hampered. By changing body positions at multiple times throughout the day, a person can reduce stress and increase productivity.","One desirable way of changing body position is for a worker to switch from a seated to a standing position. Alternating from a seated to a standing position facilitates blood flow through the legs, which helps prevent fatigue and improves worker comfort. This sit-and-stand method of reducing worker fatigue is known in the furniture design field.","Several attempts at providing a comfortable keyboard support for a seated person are known. For example, it is known in the workplace design industry that it is possible to provide keyboard supports for use by a person in a seated position. For example, the approach of Trimnell described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,607 utilizes a computer keyboard holder attached to a chair. Trimnell's keyboard holder attaches to the chair legs, and is for use by a person in the seated position, not the standing position. Alternatively, U.S. Pat. No. 4,779,922 to Cooper describes a chair with a built-in computer workstation. U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,073 to VanBeek describes the holder in front of a chair to reduce the chance of the user incurring repetitive stress injuries. U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,950 to Crenshaw describes a school desk computer workstation, while Dearing (U.S. Pat. No. 5,490,710) describes the holder built into a chair arm.","Commercial products such as X-TENSION ARM by Cal Trak, Inc. of Broomfield, Colo., and ERGOREST by Ergonomic Design, Inc. of Northglenn, Colo., are available which provide for the attachment of a keyboard support to a chair, the support being mounted at a given height for a seated user.","In each of these approaches, the holder is designed for one position of a user, generally seated. None describe a system for providing a keyboard support for use by a person standing near a chair. Further, when a user is practicing those prior designs, but would like to stand to take advantage of the sit-and-stand principle, modifications to the work area would be required. For instance, combining two prior design support systems could possibly be used to accommodate different user positions.","It is known to provide two keyboard supports at one workstation: one permanently mounted at a height suitable to a person in a seated position, and one permanently mounted at a height suitable to a person in a standing position. However, the addition of another piece of furniture in the work area is not always desirable in many space-limited workplace designs. Further, the same keyboard, mouse, and\/or computer may be utilized by multiple workers throughout the day. Therefore, it is desirable to have accessory supports, which are capable of adjusting to the different depths, angles, and heights to accommodate the differently-statured individuals who may utilize the same keyboard support. Additionally, the use of radio frequency or infra red communication makes the use of a cordless keyboard, mouse, or computer feasible in the modern workplace.","It is also known to provide one device that is mountable to a chair at various locations, such that the sit-and-stand principle may be employed. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 6,604,786 to Benden et al., issued Aug. 12, 2003, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, (and commonly-owned by the present assignee of record, Neutral Posture, Inc. of Bryan, Tex.) describes using a support apparatus that is removably attachable to an armrest of a chair, the back of a chair, or to a desk. In this way, accessories, such as computer, keyboard, and\/or a mouse, can be utilized by a person seated in the chair or standing near the chair. When the apparatus is attached to the back of the chair, the apparatus may be utilized by a person in a standing position. The height of the apparatus may be adjusted by adjusting the height of the chair.","It is also known to provide some keyboard adjustment through the use of an industry-standard keyboard mechanism, such as those provided by CompX Waterloo Inc., Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, for example. The prior art keyboard mechanism systems may provide sufficient adjustment of a keyboard for a seated user, in some situations. However, the adjustability of prior art units may be limited such that the same equipment may not be utilized in conjunction with the sit-and-stand principle described above\u2014at least not to the degree as dictated for an ergonomically-correct standing height of a 95percentile male.","Thus, it would be desirable to have one piece of equipment that would be capable of elevating a device such as a keyboard for utilization by a user in a seated position and in a standing position. It would also be desirable that the unit be able to be installed on existing keyboard mechanism as a retrofit, such that the sit and stand ergonomic principle may be utilized with existing keyboard mechanisms. It would also be desirable that the vertical adjustment mechanism be easily adjusted from one height to another.","Thus, a need exists for a single, versatile support adapted to vertically adjust devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or laptop computer, so that a user may utilize the device alternatively in a seated or standing position. It is desirable that this support be capable of attaching to a workstation, for instance via an industry-standard keyboard mechanism, in such a way as to let the user sit or stand throughout the day, thus reducing worker fatigue. It is therefore desirable that the attachment mechanism be simple to use so that the user can change positions as desired.","A vertical adjustment apparatus is described that is attachable to a work station by a keyboard mechanism. The vertical adjustment apparatus includes a base tray attachable to the keyboard mechanism, an upper tray to support a device at an adjustable height above the base tray, a first leg having an upper end functionally associated with the upper tray and a lower end slidably associated with the lower tray; and a second leg having a lower end functionally associated with the base tray and an upper end slidably associated with the upper tray, wherein the predetermined height may be adjusted from a first height to accommodate a user utilizing the device in a seated position, to a second height to accommodate the user in a standing position. In some embodiments, the upper end of the first leg is pivotally attached to the upper tray and the lower end of the second leg is pivotally attached to the base tray.","Some embodiments may include locking means to selectively lock the upper tray at a predetermined height above the base tray. The locking means may be a member pivotally mounted to the first leg, the member having at least one notch, and a post in the second leg to selectively engage one of the at least one notches to selectively lock the upper tray at a predetermined height. In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment apparatus further comprises power means to raise and lower the upper tray over the lower tray, which may be a pneumatic device, for example. In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment apparatus may be simply placed on a desk top, and may or may not include a base tray.","A method of elevating a device is also described such that the device may be utilized by a user alternatively between a seated and a standing position.","The vertical adjustment apparatus disclosed herein extends the current range of height-adjustability that is available in one workstation configuration and allows the user to avoid the cost of adding an expensive adjustable tables or other additional equipment. This allows one piece of equipment to be utilized to reach full standing work postures. Prior art keyboard trays generally comprise one of two basic varieties: desk level to a given distance below, or (2) desk level to a given distance above or below desk level. As such, prior art units generally are not compatible with a standing keyboard user, as the additional given distance is below an ergonomically-correct height of a 95percentile male. Further, by utilizing industry-standard hole configurations, the vertical adjustment apparatus is universal, and may be incorporated into any workstation configuration generally.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.","The invention relates to an apparatus and a method to vertically adjust the height of a device for so that an operator may utilize the device in both a seated and standing position as desired. In this way, a single device may be added to a traditional keyboard\/keyboard mechanism configuration, which allows the keyboard to be used in both a seated and standing position. In each of these embodiments, the advantage of using one piece of furniture to support the accessories while the user is seated or standing is utilized. Thus, cost and space is reduced compared to using two pieces of furniture to employ the sit and stand principle.","Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below as they might be employed in the use of a vertical adjustment apparatus that can be utilized to elevate a device, such as a keyboard, mouse, or laptop computer. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.","Further aspects and advantages of the various embodiments of the invention will become apparent from consideration of the following description and drawings.","Referring to , various views of one embodiment of the present invention is shown comprising a vertical adjustment apparatus  which is attachable to a keyboard mechanism  of the prior art. Keyboard mechanism  is attachable to a workstation , such as a desk, via a mount  on the underside of the workstation. Further, in typical prior art keyboard mechanisms , a keyboard tray  is attached to the other end  of the keyboard mechanism . As would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art familiar with standard keyboard mechanisms, the height and location of the keyboard  is adjustable by depressing handle  (which allows for limited height adjustment) or by sliding the keyboard mechanism  toward or away from workstation , the keyboard mechanism being slidably attached to the workstation  via mount . Such a system and the utilization of that apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,488,248 to Watt, incorporated by reference in its entirety.","While these keyboard mechanisms are designed to provide some vertical adjustment of the keyboard, sufficient adjustability is not generally provided to allow a user to utilize the sit-an-stand principle throughout the day.","In the embodiment shown in , the vertical adjustment mechanism  is attachable to both the industry-standard keyboard mechanism  and the industry-standard keyboard holder . The vertical adjustment apparatus  is shown interposed between the keyboard mechanism  and the keyboard holder .","The vertical adjustment mechanism  is shown in this embodiment as comprising a base tray , an upper tray , a first leg , and a second leg . The base tray  is attachable to the keyboard mechanism  at mount . The upper tray  is attachable to the keyboard holder  to support a device (not shown), such as a keyboard, a mouse, etc.","In this embodiment, the first leg  and the second leg  are connected at a pivot , the legs ,  thus forming a scissor-like configuration. Legs  and  may comprise tubular steel members, while the base tray  and upper tray  may be stamped from sheet metal, for example. Of course, the embodiments are not limited to any particular materials of construction.","First leg  has one end  that is attachable to the upper tray  in this embodiment, and another end  that is slidably attachable to base tray . In this embodiment, end  of leg  is pivotally attached to the upper tray . In this embodiment, the lower end  of the first leg  is slidably attached to the base tray , as the lower end  of the first leg  is attached to a slidable member such as a rod . The ends  of rod  are adapted to slide within channels  in the base tray  in this embodiment, the channels  being described in more detail below.","Similarly, second leg  has one end  that is attachable to the base tray  in this embodiment, and another end  that is slidably attachable to the upper tray . In this embodiment, lower end  is pivotally attached to the base tray . In this embodiment, the upper end  of the second leg  is slidably attached to the upper tray , the upper end  of the second leg  being attached to a slidable member such as a rod . The ends  of rod  are adapted to slide within channels  in the upper tray  in this embodiment.","As shown most clearly in , upper and lower trays ,  may further comprise channels ,  respectively therein. Channels ,  may comprise a C-shape on the periphery of the trays ,  along a longitudinal axis of the trays , . It should be noted that in some embodiments, the trays ,  may be identical\u2014thus reducing manufacturing costs\u2014the upper tray  being inverted prior to assembly. In some embodiments, as shown in , the mounting holes \u201cH\u201d in trays ,  may be arranged such the holes correspond to industry standard configurations; thus, the elevation apparatus  may be interposed between an industry-standard keyboard tray and an industry-standard keyboard mechanism, with relative ease without the need to drill additional holes.","The vertical adjustment apparatus described with respect to some embodiments herein is adapted to provide vertical adjustment of the height of the upper tray  over the base tray .  show the apparatus  in which the upper tray  is in its lower-most position with respect to the base tray . In other words, the adjustable height of the upper tray  over the base tray  is at its minimum value, as the upper tray  and the base tray  are in contact.","In contrast, referring to , the upper tray  has been adjusted to a predetermined height \u201ch\u201d in . As described more fully hereinafter, the predetermined height \u201ch\u201d may be adjusted to any number of heights to accommodate the desires of the user or users.","Returning to , in operation, the upper tray  is movable vertically over base tray  as follows. As an upward force is applied to the upper tray  by a power means (described more thoroughly hereinafter), the vertical distance between the upper tray  and base tray  increases to a height \u201ch.\u201d As the upper tray  is raised, ends  and  move with respect to the upper tray  and base tray  respectively. In this embodiment, the ends ,  pivot about pins attached to upper and lower trays ,  respectively. Concomitantly, ends ,  slidably move with respect to longitudinal axes of the upper and lower trays , . In this embodiment, the ends  on rod  of end  of the first leg  slide within channels  of the upper tray , while the ends  on rod  of end  of the first leg  slide within channels  of base tray .","It should be mentioned that in some embodiments, the apparatus as shown in  is placeable directly on a desk top and may be utilized to raise and lower a keyboard such that the sit-and-stand principle may be utilized. That is, the vertical adjustment apparatus is not connected to the keyboard mechanism or arm in these embodiments. Further, in some embodiments of this desk-top version, the base tray  is not required, the lower ends ,  of the first and second legs ,  contacting the desk top directly. The other features described herein (locking means, power means, etc.) may be utilized with this desk-top version.","In some embodiments, a locking means may be provided to selectively lock the upper tray  at a given predetermined, adjustable height above the base tray . The locking means will be discussed in more detail hereinafter.","In these embodiments, one end ,  of each leg ,  may be pivotally attached to a tray , . It has been determined that this method of attachment acts to ensure that the upper tray  remains aligned above the lower tray  as the upper tray is elevated. While this may be preferable in some embodiments, it is also possible to allow both ends ,  of the first leg  and both ends ,  of the second leg  be slidably attachable to the upper and lower trays , .","It should be noted that in , the ends ,  of legs ,  are pivotally attached to the trays , , while ends ,  of legs ,  are slidably attached to the trays , . As shown, the pivotally-attached end corresponds to the user's right side as the user is operating the device such as a keyboard to the upper tray . It has been determined that in some instances, this configuration is preferable; however, as would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, the ends ,  of legs ,  corresponding to the user's left side could be pivotally attached, with the other ends ,  slidably attached to the trays , . Alternatively, as described above, all ends , , ,  could be slidably attachable to the trays , .","Although the rods ,  within channels ,  are shown, any type of slidable attachment could be utilized, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. For instance, a rod may be affixed to a tray to run along the longitudinal axis of each tray, with a slidable attachment means movably connecting an end of a leg to the rod, for example.","As described above, the vertical adjustment apparatus  may be used with conventional office equipment, to provide additional elevation of a device, such as a keyboard, that is in addition to any vertical adjustment provided by a prior art keyboard mechanism. This additional elevation allows the device to be utilized by a user in a seated position as well as in the standing position, not previously possible. By way of example, in some embodiments, the vertical adjustment apparatus  may provide an additional height to a standard keyboard mechanism mounted to a workstation, such as a desk, such that the apparatus  allows the device to be elevated to a 95percentile standing elbow rest height. This additional height allows the user to operate a device, such as a keyboard on the keyboard mechanism or on the desk top, while standing, without adding other equipment to the work area to elevate the keyboard. Further, as the height \u201ch\u201d may be adjusted to various heights, the vertical adjustment apparatus allows the same keyboard mechanism to be utilized to accommodate various users who may be assigned to the given workstation over time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A\u2013E","FIGS. 1A\u2013G"],"b":["240","250","240","242","120","244","110","242","240","220","244","240","110","146","250","252","110","254","120","252","110","254","250","120","254","250","300","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 4\u20136B","FIG. 4"],"b":["120","110","410","150","420","410","430","430","120","110","440","140","120","410","430","440","120","110","410","140","150"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","b":["110","500","500","500","510","520","530","510","520","540","550","510","520","550","510","520","120","110","540","510","520","120","110","530","510","520","540"]},"Of course, in other embodiments, the means for selectively locking may comprise a simple bolt passing through pivot  and adapted to have a nut tightened on the bolt once the desired predetermined height may be attached.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A\u2013C","FIG. 6B"],"b":["120","110","560","120","560","120","156","156","154","150","156","158","122","120","560","110","120","570","560","580","582","560","580","570","560","580","560","580","560","560","570","580","584","570","120","110"]},"In other embodiments, and as shown in , a spring  may bias the toggle  in the locked position. A user may apply a force to the toggle  thus overcoming the biasing force of the spring  to allow the slidable member  to move along the rod . The spring  may be compressed between the toggle  and the stationary wall  also mounted to the slidable member .","To adjust the height of the upper tray  over the base tray  in this embodiment, a user pushed on the toggle  to overcome the biasing force of the spring , the toggle  pivoting on pin . In this position, the toggle  is allowed to move angularly such that the slidable member  is movable with respect to the locking rod . When the user releases the force on the toggle , the spring  acts to bias the toggle  to lock against rod , thereby locking the upper tray  at a desired predetermined height over the lower tray . As would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, any number of slidable members having toggles  and springs  may be connected to locking rod . For example, two slidable members  may be utilized: one to prevent the slidable member  moving to the right along locking rod , and one to prevent the slidable member  from moving to the left along locking rod .","As described above, some embodiments include a power means to adjust the height of the upper tray  above the base tray . The power means could include a user manually pulling upwardly on the upper tray . Alternatively, a power means may include a pneumatic device  as shown in , interposed between the upper tray  and the base tray  in any configuration. Pneumatic device  may comprise a gas lift, such as the one commercially available from Suspa of Germany, for example. As would be realized by one of ordinary skill in the art, such gas lifts may assist in raising the upper tray  (i.e. providing counter-balanced functionality), and resist in lowering the upper tray , or vise versa.","Referring to , the power means to elevate the upper tray  over the lower tray  could comprise a lead screw  rotatably attached to the base tray . One of the lower ends  or  of either the first leg  or second leg  in these embodiments is connected via attachment means to the engage the thread of the lead screw . An electric motor may be utilized to rotate lead screw . As the electric motor turns the lead screw , the height of the upper tray  over the lower tray  is changed, being raised or lowered depending on the direction of rotation of the lead screw . When the motor is turned off, the lead screw  acts to lock the upper tray  at the predetermined height above the lower tray , thus acting as a locking means described above.","Further, the power means to elevate the upper tray  over the lower tray  may comprise a spring compressed to bias the lower ends ,  of the legs ,  toward each other.","Although various embodiments have been shown and described, the invention is not so limited and will be understood to include all such modifications and variations as would be apparent to one skilled in the art.","The following table lists the description and the reference numbers as used herein and in the drawings attached hereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Number","Name"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["3","Workstation"]},{"entry":["20","Keyboard Mechanism"]},{"entry":["22","Workstation Mount"]},{"entry":["24","Handle"]},{"entry":["26","Mount"]},{"entry":["30","Keyboard Tray"]},{"entry":["100","Vertical Adjustment Apparatus"]},{"entry":["110","Base\/Lower Tray"]},{"entry":["112","Channels in Base Tray"]},{"entry":["120","Upper Tray"]},{"entry":["122","Channels in Upper Tray"]},{"entry":["140","First Leg"]},{"entry":["142","Upper end of First Leg"]},{"entry":["144","Lower End of First Leg"]},{"entry":["146","Rod on First Leg"]},{"entry":["148","Ends of Rods"]},{"entry":["150","Second Leg"]},{"entry":["152","Lower End of Second Leg"]},{"entry":["154","Upper End of Second Leg"]},{"entry":["156","Rod on Second Leg"]},{"entry":["158","Ends of Rod on Second Leg"]},{"entry":["240","Third Leg"]},{"entry":["242","Upper End of Third Leg"]},{"entry":["244","Lower End of Third Leg"]},{"entry":["250","Fourth Leg"]},{"entry":["252","Lower End of Fourth Leg"]},{"entry":["254","Upper End of Fourth Leg"]},{"entry":["300","Pivot"]},{"entry":["310","Pivot Member"]},{"entry":["410","Member"]},{"entry":["420","Pin"]},{"entry":["430","Notch in Member"]},{"entry":["440","Post"]},{"entry":["500","Frustoconical Member"]},{"entry":["510","First Locking Member"]},{"entry":["520","Second Locking Member"]},{"entry":["530","Teeth"]},{"entry":["540","Spring"]},{"entry":["550","Pin"]},{"entry":["560","Locking Rod for Slidable Member"]},{"entry":["570","Slidable Member"]},{"entry":["580","Toggle"]},{"entry":["582","Pin of Toggle"]},{"entry":["584","Hole in Slidable Member"]},{"entry":["586","Spring"]},{"entry":["588","Stationary Wall"]},{"entry":["610","Pneumatic Cylinder"]},{"entry":["620","Lead Screw"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A\u2013G","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1D","FIG. 1E","FIG. 1F","FIG. 1G"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1H","b":["112","122"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1I","FIG. 1H"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A\u2013E","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A\u20133E","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A\u20136C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
