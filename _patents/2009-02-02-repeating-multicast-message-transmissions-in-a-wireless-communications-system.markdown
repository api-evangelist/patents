title: Repeating multicast message transmissions in a wireless communications system
abstract: In an embodiment, an application server determines a priority associated with a given multicast message for transmission to at least one access terminal, configures the given multicast message to indicate the priority of the given multicast message and forwards the configured multicast message to an access network for transmission to the at least one access terminal a number of times based at least in part on the indicated priority. Alternatively, the application server can indicate, in the configured multicast message, the number of times to transmit the given multicast message. The priority, or number of times to transmit the given multicast message, can be conveyed to the access network by a flag inserted into the configured multicast message by the application server. The access network determines the number of times to transmit the given multicast message to the at least one access terminal based on the flag.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to repeating multicast message transmissions in a wireless communications system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communications network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as \u201cunicast\u201d. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A \u201cbroadcast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a \u201cmulticast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or \u201cmulticast group\u201d may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a cell or sector), similar to a broadcast.","Broadcasts and\/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast\/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled \u201cPush-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007\/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and\/or delay and may degrade system performance.","The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 (\u201c3GPP2\u201d) defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled \u201cCDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification\u201d, dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In an embodiment of the invention, an application server determines a priority associated with a given multicast message for transmission to at least one access terminal, configures the given multicast message to indicate the priority of the given multicast message and forwards the configured multicast message to an access network for transmission to the at least one access terminal a number of times based at least in part on the indicated priority. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the application server can indicate, in the configured multicast message, the number of times to transmit the given multicast message. The priority, or alternatively number of times to transmit the given multicast message, can be conveyed to the access network by a flag inserted into the configured multicast message by the application server. The access network determines the number of times to transmit the given multicast message to the at least one access terminal based on the flag, and then transmits the given multicast message the determined number of times to the at least one access terminal.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A10 connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u2019)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","For convenience of explanation, a description of conventional multicast message transmissions is provided, followed by a description of message transmissions according to embodiments of the present invention, also with reference to multicast transmissions. For some multicast messages, it is important to deliver one or more messages to all multicast group members as soon as possible, as the loss of the message can result in degradation of multicasting quality. For example, loss of a multicast call announcement message at any given group member will result in that group member's failure to participate in the call. In this case, the given group member would not even be aware that a multicast call is taking place.","Access terminals participating in unicast communications are typically provided with a reverse link channel on which to transmit feedback to the RAN (e.g., a measured SIR level, ACK, NACK, etc.) such that, for example, the RAN can adjust downlink transmission power to a particular access terminal. In multicast sessions, however, because a potentially large number of access terminals are participating in the multicast session, permitting the access terminals to transmit feedback may overload the reverse link feedback or access channel and\/or increase the complexity of power control for the forward link multicast transmissions. Thus, conventional multicasting implementations do not typically enable individual multicast group members to transmit feedback relating to the multicast transmissions (e.g., a measured SIR level, ACK, NACK, etc.). Therefore, ensuring delivery of a multicast message to all multicast group members is challenging.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["170","400","170","1","120","405","120","100","410","120"]},"Next, assume that AT  misses the call announce message, , and that ATs  . . . N receive and decode the call announce message. For example, AT  may miss the call announce message if AT  is not turned on, is located in a high-interference area of a serving sector, etc. Next, ATs  . . . N accept the call by sending a call accept message to the application server . At the same time, ATs  . . . N register for the multicast session by sending a registration message to the RAN  (e.g., a BCMCSFlowRegistration message), . However no messages are transmitted from AT  because AT  missed the call announce message and is therefore unaware of the multicast session.","The RAN  transmits a scheduling message for the announced multicast session, , that advertises a flow ID for the multicast session and includes instructions with regard to how access terminals can tune to the multicast session. For example, the scheduling message can be a broadcast overhead message (BOM) that includes listing of a BCMCSFIowID for the multicast session along with an interlace-multiplex (IM) pair that carries the multicast session on a downlink broadcast channel (BCH). The scheduling message is received by ATs  . . . N, which are aware that the multicast session has been announced, as discussed above. Those ATs who have not transmitted the Accept Call (or announce ACK) and registration messages may suppress their responses once they receive the scheduling message as described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/974,831, entitled \u201cMETHODS OF MANAGING ACKNOWLEDGMENT TRANSMISSIONS FROM MULTICAST GROUP MEMBERS OF A MULTICAST GROUP WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK\u201d, filed on Sep. 24, 2007, assigned by the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Next, the application server , after receiving a first Accept Call message (or announce ACK message), begins to forward multicast messages to the RAN  for transmission, . The RAN  receives the forwarded multicast messages and transmits the multicast messages at least within sectors including one or more ATs that have registered for the multicast session, . As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, AT  ignores the multicast messages because AT  is still unaware that the multicast session has been initiated, , whereas ATs  . . . N monitor the multicast messages (e.g., on the BCH) in accordance with the scheduling message, .","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, it is difficult to ensure that each target AT receives a call announce message to a multicast session because the RAN  does not necessarily receive feedback (e.g., an ACK or NACK) that would permit the RAN  to distinguish between ATs that have received and chosen to ignore the call announce message and ATs that missed the call announce message. Accordingly, it is possible that ATs wishing to participate in a multicast session may lose this opportunity if the initial call announce message is missed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","170","120","1","1","505","120","104","1","505","1","1","2","510","515"]},"Referring to , the application server  determines whether to end the multicast session, . For example, a PTT initiator or current floor-holder may indicate a request to terminate the call. If the application server  determines not to end the multicast session, the process returns to  and the application server  continues to forward multicast messages associated with the multicast session to the RAN  for transmission to ATs  . . . N. Otherwise, if the application server  determines to end the call, the application server  generates an end call message and forwards the end call message to the RAN  for transmission to ATs  . . . N, . The RAN  receives the forwarded end call message and transmits the end call message to the ATs  . . . N, . For example, the RAN  may transmit the end call message on a next physical layer packet.","Referring to , assume that AT  misses the transmitted end call message, , and that ATs  . . . N receive and decode the transmitted end call message, . Accordingly, AT  continues to monitor for multicast messages associated with the multicast session (e.g., at least for the duration of an inactivity timer period), , whereas ATs  . . . N are aware that the multicast session has terminated and thereby cease monitoring for multicast messages, . In an example, AT  may continue monitoring for multicast messages until an inactivity that runs from a previous multicast message expires. Thus, AT  may reject any incoming calls because AT  believes it is still in a call until the inactivity timer expires. Furthermore, AT  may waste resources searching for multicast messages that will not arrive because AT  missed the end call message in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIGS. 4 and 5"},"As discussed above with respect to , messages (e.g., call announce messages, end call messages, etc.) can be missed, which can cause communication problems in a wireless communications system. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention are directed to processes for repeating message transmissions for certain messages within the wireless communications system. Below, three message transmission processes according to embodiments of the present invention are described with respect to ,  and , respectively. Then, the processes of ,  and  are described within the call announce and call end multicast message scenarios, followed by a description of selective multicast repetition where messages that are already transmitted periodically (e.g., overhead messages, such as BOMs) are transmitted in a more rapid succession in response to a triggering event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","170","1"]},"Next, in , the application server  determines whether to transmit the message, determined in , multiple times. In an example, the application server  can determine to transmit the multicast message multiple times if the multicast message is determined to be relatively important. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, repeating all multicast messages transmitted from the application server  may increase the load upon the RAN  as well as interference within the wireless communications system. Thus, determining which multicast messages to repeat can be based upon a tradeoff between the load\/interference associated with the repeated multicast messaging and the relative importance of target access terminals successfully receiving and decoding the multicast message. For example, a multicast message that may be determined to have an importance sufficient for multiple transmission in  can include a call announce message or end call message for a multicast session, a BOM message transmitted during an initial period of a multicast session, certain frames in a multimedia transmission (e.g., an I-frame in MPEG4, or any frame that other frames are dependent on for successful decoding, etc.), an emergency message (e.g., if a cell-phone battery is low, if a message sender has a high priority, such as a general, if a message is sent from a particular location, such as war zone, etc.) and\/or any other message that the application is configured to allocate higher message priority.","While not illustrated in , if the application server  determines to transmit the multicast message a single time, the multicast message is forwarded to the RAN  for transmission to ATs  . . . N, as is known in the art. Alternatively, if the RAN  determines to transmit the multicast message multiple times, the process advances to .","Referring to , in , the application server  determines the number of times or repetition number, denoted as \u2018X\u2019, to transmit the message. For example, particular types of messages may be associated with default repetition numbers.

With respect to the BOM example, as will be described in greater detail below, BOMs are conventionally sent periodically, at a given BOM interval, during a multicast session. In an example, Table 1 illustrates the BOM can be transmitted multiple times (e.g., 4 times) before a next BOM transmission period. This is discussed in greater detail below with respect to BOMs and other types of overhead messages that repeat. It is also possible, while not in Table 1, to have a hierarchy of priorities within one or more message types, such that the same repetition number need not be associated for all messages of the same type.","In an alternative embodiment, instead of a static table with default message repetition values, the number of transmission repetitions can be determined dynamically. For example, the number of transmission repetitions can be based upon current operating parameters. For example, if previous call announce messages have resulted in a relatively low number of registrations, then the number of repetitions associated with future call announce messages can be augmented in an attempt to increase the number of responses from the target access terminals. Thus, while the application server  is not typically aware of channel conditions within particular sectors, poor channel conditions may be inferred if call announce messages are relatively unsuccessful in obtaining registrations.","After determining the number of times X the message is to be transmitted in , the message is transmitted X separate times, from the application server , in . An example implementation of  of  is described in greater detail below with respect to .","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, increasing the number of times a particular multicast message is transmitted increases the probability that at least one version or instantiation of the multicast message will be received and decoded by one or more target ATs successfully. Also, as will be discussed below with respect to , the timing of each of the X multicast message forwards from the application server  to the RAN  can be controlled to reduce an occurrence of multiple message instantiations being transmitted on the same physical layer packet, which can reduce the transmission success-rate benefit gained from transmitting the same message multiple times.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","705","710","600","605","610","700","705","710","715","615","170","120","170","120","715"]},"Referring to , the RAN  receives the forwarded multicast message, extracts the flag and interprets the extracted flag to determine X, . In an example, the RAN  checks the headers of each message on the BCA connection associated with the signaling flow. In another example, if media messages are potentially repeated as well, the RAN  checks the headers of each message on the BCA connection associated with media as well. Accordingly, the RAN  is configured to check the headers of packets that the application server  may potentially flag for repetition.","After determining X, the RAN  transmits the multicast message X times, . In an example, the RAN  does not simply transmit each message repetition at the same time, but rather spreads the repetitions of the message transmissions apart to increase the points of failure and the probability that at least one instance of the message will be successfully decoded. For example, in certain BCMCS protocols, the RAN  transmits a physical layer packet associated with a BCMCS flow every 100 ms (e.g., a physical layer packet interval). In this example, for X repetitions of a particular message, the RAN  may transmit each multicast message instantiation on a different physical layer packet. In an example, the RAN  may schedule the multicast message instantiations on consecutive physical layer packets.

It is understood that other embodiments of the invention can be directed to more than three (3) priority levels, as well as different message types.","In an alternative embodiment, instead of a static table with default message type priority values, the priority level of a message can be determined dynamically. For example, the priority level of a particular message can be based upon current operating parameters. For example, if previous call announce messages have resulted in a relatively low number of registrations, then the priority level of future call announce messages can be augmented in an attempt to increase the number of responses from the target access terminals.","After determining the priority level of the message, the application server  determines whether to insert a flag indicating the priority level, . In an example, if the message is determined to have low priority (e.g., priority level 3 in Table 2), then no flag indicating the low priority need be entered because the message need not be repeatedly transmitted. Thus, by not including a priority flag, the RAN  will simply interpret the low-priority message as requiring a single transmission, as is known in the art. Alternatively, if even low priority messages are associated with more than one message repetition, then the low priority can also be flagged in the message. In a further example, the application server  may determine to insert a flag indicating medium or high priority for the message, based upon the priority determination of .","For convenience of explanation, assume that the application server  determines to insert a flag into the message in . Accordingly, in , the application server  inserts the flag (e.g., a DSCP value indicating the priority) into the message and forwards the flagged message to the RAN . The RAN  receives the forwarded message, extracts the flag and determines the number of times X to transmit the message based at least in part upon the priority indicated by the flag, . In an example, the RAN  checks the headers of each message on the BCA connection associated with the signaling flow. In another example, if media messages are potentially repeated as well, the RAN  checks the headers of each message on the BCA connection associated with media as well. Accordingly, the RAN  is configured to check the headers of packets that the application server  may potentially flag for priority.","In an example, the RAN  can maintain default X values that are associated with each priority value the flag may indicate. In this example, the RAN , in , simply loads a priority table, sets X equal to the value associated with the flagged priority. In another example, the value associated with the flagged priority in the priority table can be a base value Xthat can be scaled to compute an actual repetition value Xby the RAN  based on operational conditions.","For example, the base value Xmay be scaled on a per-sector basis, such that sector-specific conditions can be taken into account. For example, if a given sector is notorious for dropped packets due to poor channel conditions, the sector may be allocated a positive repetition offset to be applied to Xto calculate X. For example, assume that the flag indicates priority , and that the RAN  checks the priority table and determines X=3 for priority . Next, assume that the message is to be transmitted in  sectors in order to reach ATs  . . . N, with a first sector having good channel conditions, a second sector having poor channel conditions and a third sector having average channel conditions. The first sector having good channel conditions is allocated a negative repetition offset of (\u22121), the second sector having poor channel conditions is allocated a positive repetition offset of (+1) and the third sector having average channel conditions is allocated a neutral repetition offset of (0). Thus, X=2 for the first sector, X=4 for the second sector and X=3 for the third sector. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the above example lists one possible way that channel conditions can be taken into account by the RAN .","After determining X (or X) in , the RAN  transmits the message X times, . As will be appreciated, the RAN  may determine a different value for X in different sectors (e.g., X), as discussed above. In an example, the RAN  does not simply transmit each message repetition at the same time, but rather spreads the repetitions of the message transmissions apart to increase the points of failure and the probability that the message will be successfully decoded. For example, in certain BCMCS protocols, the RAN  transmits a physical layer packet associated with a BCMCS flow every 100 ms (e.g., a physical layer packet interval). In this example, for X repetitions of a particular message, the RAN  may transmit each message instantiation on a different physical layer packet. In an example, the RAN  may schedule the message instantiations on consecutive physical layer packets.","Below, examples of the processes of ,  and  are described with respect to a call announce message in ,  and , respectively, followed by examples of the processes of ,  and  described with respect to an end call message in ,  and , respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 6","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 6","FIG. 9","FIG. 6"],"b":["170","900","905","170","1","905","600","170","910","910","605","610","170","170"]},"In , the application server  forwards a first call announce message to the RAN , and the RAN  transmits the first call announce message in a plurality of sectors of the wireless communication system .

During the multicast session, however, the RAN  also generates and transmits certain messages without explicit instructions from the application server . These overhead messages, such as Broadcast Overhead Messages (BOMs), can be repeated throughout the multicast session. For example, with respect to BOMs, BOMs conventionally repeat during the multicast session at a given BOM period (e.g., every three seconds).","The BOM period, or repetition period, in this case is controlled by the RAN . At certain times during a multicast session, it may be more important to receive BOMs correctly than at other times. For example, at the beginning of the call following the announce message, many new multicast group members wait for the BOM for instructions regarding how to decode multicast messages on the downlink BCH. If one or more ATs miss the initial BOM, those ATs cannot tune to the downlink BCH on the correct interlace-multiplex (IM)-pair, such that the ATs must wait for a next BOM before participating in the multicast session. Because the BOM period is relatively long, this can reduce the effectiveness of the multicast session.","Accordingly, in an embodiment of the invention, overhead messages, such as BOMs, that already are scheduled for repetition, can be sent more rapidly in response to one or more triggering events. As mentioned above, one potential triggering event that may trigger a more rapid repetition of overhead messages (e.g., BOMs) can be the beginning of the multicast call. Another example triggering event can be a determination that relatively few ATs that have registered for the multicast session have tuned to the downlink BCH.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 7","FIG. 15"],"b":["170","1500","170","1","120","1505","120","100","1510","120","1","1515","170","1","120","1520","120","1525"]},"Next, the application server , after receiving a first Accept Call message (or announce ACK message), begins to forward multicast messages to the RAN  for transmission, .

For example, if the RAN  packages a plurality of message repetitions within a single physical layer packet, and a target AT misses the physical layer packet, then the message repetitions do not necessarily help to increase the transmission success rate of the message to that access terminal. Examples will now be provided wherein the message repetitions can be spread out among different (e.g., consecutive) physical layer packets to decrease the single point-of-failure scenario described above.","With respect to , an initial message is forwarded from the application server , but the message repetitions are scheduled by the RAN  based on a flag included therein. Thus, it can be said that the transmission of the repetitions is scheduled, or originates from, the RAN  in these examples. As such, steps  and  of , respectively, can include an additional scheduling aspect wherein each message repetition is scheduled on a different physical layer packet. For example, the transmission of  and  can include transmitting the message on X consecutive physical layer packets.","With respect to , the transmission of each message repetition at  originates, or is scheduled, at the application server . Conventionally, it is difficult for the application server  to ensure that different messages are scheduled on the same physical layer packet because this type of scheduling typically occurs at the RAN . For example, during intervals between physical layer packet transmissions, the RAN  can collect packets for physical layer transmission and transmit them on a next physical layer packet. Thus, if the application server  sends the message repetitions too quickly (i.e., between successive physical layer packet intervals), the RAN  may potentially transmit each of the message repetitions on the same physical layer packet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16","FIG. 16","FIG. 6","FIG. 16"],"b":["170","120","615"]},"Accordingly, after  of , the process advances to  of .
