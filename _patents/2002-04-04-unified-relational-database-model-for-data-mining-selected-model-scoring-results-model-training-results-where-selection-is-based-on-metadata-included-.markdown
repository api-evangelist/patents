Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, systems, and products for managing data mining activities in a data mining environment.","2. Description of Related Art","Data mining is an analytic technique to dynamically discover patterns in historical data records and to apply properties associated with these records to production data records that exhibit similar patterns. Based on historical data, a data mining algorithm first generates a data mining model that captures the discovered patterns; this activity is called \u201cmodel training.\u201d The data mining model so generated is then applied on production data; this activity is called \u201cmodel scoring.\u201d","Data mining tools such as IBM's Intelligent Miner are used directly in customer environments by connecting the tool to customer's historical and production databases. As a result, any structural change to the historical and production databases (such as renaming tables and columns or reorganizing the columns across tables) is likely to throw the data mining activity off balance and make it disfunctional. Rectifying this often requires a lot of changes in the data mining activity because of its direct dependency on the names used in historical and production data.","To manage data mining activities in an analytic application, one needs to deal with several different types of data structures, including input data for model training and model scoring, results from model training, output data from model scoring, and metadata to manage models and model results. In current practice, definition of input data for model training and scoring is left to the end user, a tool specific proprietary internal representation is used for model training results, definition of output data from model scoring is left to the end user, and there is hardly any support for control data to manage models and model results, although it would be advantageous if there were. It would be advantageous to have a database model that includes a set of tables describing the tables containing historical data and production data.","This disclosure presents exemplary embodiments of a database model typically comprising a set of tables that describe which tables contain historical data and which tables contain production data. This approach makes the data mining activity easily pluggable into different customer environments. In addition to information about input\/output data, embodiments of the database model maintain information about the mining models themselves, thereby simplifying the management of mining models.","Embodiments of the present invention typically implement a unified relational database model to represent all the various types of data structures needed to manage data mining activities in an analytic environment. In this disclosure, we sometimes refer to exemplary embodiments of unified relational database models of the present invention as \u201cunified systems.\u201d In this discussion, we often illustrate unified systems by focusing on a particular data mining algorithm called \u201cclustering,\u201d also sometime called \u201csegmentation,\u201d and by showing how a relational database model may be defined for capturing the input, results, output and control data of this algorithm in an analytic application.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention typically include methods for managing data mining activities in a data mining environment, in which the data mining environment typically includes data sets, a data mining tool and a data mining model.

Segments are groups of shoppers with enough similarities that they qualify for the same marketing campaign. The traditional and most often used method to identify market segments is by constraining various attributes of shoppers (for example, age, sex, income, or geography). Such segments can be identified using reporting and query or OLAP tools (tools for On-Line Analytical Processing) once the constraints that define the segments are chosen.","The data mining technique of clustering, on the other hand, allows the dynamic discovery of segments of shoppers with similar characteristics without having to specify any constraints on the attributes. Intelligent Miner does clustering by searching the records for characteristics that most frequently occur in common, and then grouping the related records into clusters. A marketing manager can inspect these clusters and select some of them as market segments. Thus, clustering makes it possible to identify market segments that might not have been discovered using more traditional methods.","Turning again to , an embodiment is illustrated wherein the data mining model is a clustering model and the data mining tool scores scoring input data sets using the clustering model to produce scoring output data records. When the data mining tool scores the input data sets it establishes clusters and selects from the clusters a best fitting cluster and a second best fitting cluster and scores the fitting quality of each record to the best fitting cluster and the second best fitting cluster. The data mining tool also establishes a confidence value of the cluster assignment of each record. In such embodiments the managed representation table for scoring results further comprises for each record a numerical index for the best fitting cluster (), the score of the fitting quality of the record to the best fitting cluster (), a numerical index for the second best fitting cluster (), the score of the fitting quality of the record to the second best filling cluster (), and the confidence of the cluster assignment of the record ().","In typical embodiments of the kind illustrated in , the managed representation table mining model foreign key (reference  on ) comprises a model identification column () in the managed representation table for scoring results in which is stored content from a model identification column in the mining model control table.

As shown in the example, the identification number \u201c1,001\u201d for an input data set has been first stored in the data set identification column of the metadata table referred to herein as the data set control table (reference  on FIG. ). By virtue of one of the previously described mining model control table foreign keys, and one of the previously described scoring control table data set foreign keys, the identification number \u201c1,001\u201d is duplicated appropriately in the training input data identification column (reference  in ) in the mining model control table (reference  on FIG. ), that is, the second metadata table. It is further duplicated in the scoring input data identification column (reference  in ) of the scoring results control table (reference  on FIG. ), that is, the third metadata table.","Similarly, by initially storing the identification number \u201c1,003\u201d in the data set identification column (reference  in ) of the data set control table, embodiments of the metadata system of the present invention provide for a future scoring output data set to be described and identified by this number in a metadata table that describes all data sets of any type and simultaneously described, using the same identification number \u201c1,003,\u201d in a metadata table that describes all scoring outputs and scoring output related information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["602","804","8"]},"In the present example, the clustering table is related to the mining model control table through the model training results table foreign key (reference  on ) which comprises the clustering identification column. The model training results table foreign key in this example references the model identification column (reference  on ) of the mining model control table, as does the managed representation table mining model foreign key (reference  on ) which comprises the model identification column (reference  on ) in the managed representation table for scoring results.","The managed representation table training results foreign key, in this example, references the clustering identification column of the clustering table, the clustering table clustering identification column being referenced by each of the other model training results control tables, thus further unifying the tables. The relationship between the model training results tables and the detailed information on the individual records in the model scoring results in the managed representation table for scoring results is important. The further unification achieved by the addition of the \u201cchild-parent\u201d relationship between the managed representation table for scoring results and the clustering table supports the referential integrity of the tabled data.","In this example, the relational tables such as clustering table  are used very efficiently for the subsequent model scoring that generated the model scoring results tables \u201cwcamng.initapp11\u201d and \u201cwcamng.memapp22.\u201d Once generated these scoring results tables are unmanaged until registered in the models scoring results control table () along with related metadata to enable the selection of either or both of the tables for reading. In the example embodiment illustrated in , both model scoring results tables are selected. Records (reference  on ) are then read () from the tables and stored () in the managed representation table for scoring results ().","This example illustrates the advantage of managing multiple model scoring results tables in the managed representation table for scoring results. As shown in , the data mining model identification number related to each record is displayed in the data mining model identification column () of the managed representation table for scoring results along with the identification number () of the related scoring input data set used in the scoring. This information accompanies the actual scores and other scoring output data included in each record. This assembly of information for each record is readily available for querying by typical reporting tools.","In embodiments of this kind, for example, a query that locates records having a \u201ccluster_id\u201d value of \u201c1\u201d locates the record with the \u201crecord_id\u201d of \u201c10,010,\u201d as shown in FIG. . The managed representation table for scoring results described in this example embodiment shows that this record was generated when the data mining model having the identification number \u201c1,101\u201d was used in scoring the input data with the identification number \u201c1,001.\u201d The same query locates the record \u201c9,990,\u201d which was generated when a different data mining model having the identification number \u201c1,201\u201d was used in scoring the different input data having the identification number \u201c2,001.\u201d","Each record located in such a query is accompanied by the identification numbers of the related data mining model and the related scoring input data set. The managed representation table for scoring results is a unified table by virtue of its relation, as a referencing table, to the clustering model identification fields in both the mining model control table and the model training results tables. This exemplary embodiment illustrates that the use of the managed representation table for scoring results enhances the querying technique in that a single table can be queried that includes the collected records from multiple model scoring results tables generated by scoring multiple input data sets using multiple data mining models.","It will be understood from the foregoing description that various modifications and changes may be made in the exemplary embodiments of the present invention without departing from its true spirit.
