application is a 371 National Stage Application of International Application Number PCT\/US2012\/027009, filed Feb. 28, 2012, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/447,587 that was filed on Feb. 28, 2011.","The present invention relates to compounds which inhibit kinases and which are useful for treating hyperproliferative and neoplastic diseases by inhibiting signal transduction pathways which commonly are overactive or overexpressed in cancerous tissue. The present compounds are selective inhibitors of ERK. The present invention further relates to methods for treating cancer or hyperproliferative diseases with compounds within the scope of the present invention","The processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand-bound cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK's) such as erbB family, PDGF, FGF, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of an RTK induces a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf, a serine-threonine kinase. Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK1\/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1\/2. When activated, ERK1\/2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK\/MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation, and it is believed that the ERK\/MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes, which are upstream of ERK1\/2, are mutated in several cancers including colorectal, melanoma, breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition, mutations of BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase of the Raf family, are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas (60%), thyroid cancers (greater than 40%) and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERK1\/2 signaling pathway is an attractive pathway for anticancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumors. (M. Hohno and J.

Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates while; in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto\/enol (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014OH)\u2550CH\u2014), amide\/imidic acid (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014OH)\u2550N\u2014) and amidine (\u2014C(\u2550NR)\u2014NH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014NHR)\u2550N\u2014) tautomers.

The racemates of these isomers, the individual isomers and mixtures enriched in one enantiomer, as well as diastereomers when there are two chiral centers, and mixtures partially enriched with specific diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention. It will be further appreciated by the skilled artisan that substitution of the tropane ring can be in either endo- or exo-configuration, and the present invention covers both configurations.

of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes and examples described below. The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as ; Wiley & Sons: New York, Volumes 1-21; R. C. LaRock, 2nd edition Wiley-VCH, New York 1999, B. Trost and I. Fleming (Eds.) vol. 1-9 Pergamon, Oxford, 1991, A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees (Eds) Pergamon, Oxford 1984, vol. 1-9, A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees (Eds) Pergamon, Oxford 1996, vol. 1-11; and , Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.","The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.","Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about \u221278\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C., more preferably from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 125\u00b0 C., and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20\u00b0 C.","In the methods of preparing the compounds of this invention, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., 1975 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. (see, e.g., , Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York 1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-. \u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. Eliel and S. Wilen, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. 1982 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d 1989 W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, 1990 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Racemic mixtures were separated by supercritical fluid chromatography using a Mettler Toledo MG II chromatograph using a 5 \u03bcm AS-H SFC 21.2\u00d7250 mm column or AD-H SFC column using MeOH or IPA containing 0.1% TFA as a cosolvent. Typical conditions include a flow rate of 50 g\/min, a column temperature of 40\u00b0 Celsius. Run time was typically 5 to 10 min.","Some compounds in the following schemes are depicted with generalized substituents; however, one skilled in the art will immediately appreciate that the nature of the R groups can varied to afford the various compounds contemplated in this invention. Moreover, the reaction conditions are exemplary and alternative conditions are well known. The reaction sequences in the following examples are not meant to limit the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.","Compounds of the present invention are prepared by the general procedure depicted in SCHEME A. The requisite 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-amine fragments A-3b are prepared by condensation of a substituted guanidine and tert-butyl 4-((dimethylamino)methylene)-3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylate (A-9) which is prepared by condensation of tert-butyl 3-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylate (CASRN 98977-36-7) and tert-butoxy-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylmethanediamine (CASRN 5815-08-7). The 2-position of compounds of the present invention typically is substituted by a secondary amine and the ready availability of N-substituted guanidines afford the flexibility to incorporate the substituents contemplated in the present invention. The synthesis of A-2 is readily accomplished by treating 1H-pyrazole-1-carboximidamidate hydrochloride (A-1, R\u2033\u2550H) or the corresponding bis-CBZ derivative (A-1; R\u2033\u2550CBZ) with a primary amine. A structurally diverse collection of primary amines is readily available from commercial sources or by literature preparations allowing wide latitude in the substitution at the 2-position. After the condensation of A-2 and A-9 the Boc protecting group is removed under acidic conditions using standard protocols to afford a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-amine derivative (A-3b).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0336"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00597","num":"00597"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00597","he":"188.47mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09133187-20150915-C00597.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Acylation of the piperidine to afford a urea (A-3 R\u2032\u2550C(\u2550O)NRCRRY) can be accomplished by treating a primary or secondary amine (A-4) with CDI which affords a N-substituted 1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamide (A-5), which is subsequently treated with A-3b to afford the urea A-8. An alternative route to preparing an activated acylating agent is to convert an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid A-6 to the corresponding acyl azide with DPPA which can subsequently be converted to an isocyanate A-7 by a Curtius rearrangement. The reactive isocyanate will readily react with A-3b to afford the A-8. (K. Ninomiya et al. 1974 30:2151; V. V.

Carboxylic acids are converted into their acid chlorides using standard reagents well known to someone skilled in the art, such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, phosphoryl chloride and the like. Those reagents can be used in presence of bases, such as DIPEA, TEA or pyridine.","Alternatively a carboxylic acid can be converted in situ into activated acids by treating the carboxylic acid with EDC, DCC, BOP, PyBrOP, or 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium p-toluenesulphonate (Mukaiyama's reagent) and the like, optionally in the presence of modifiers such as HOBt, with or without a base such as NMM, TEA or DIPEA in an inert solvent, such as DMF or DCM, at temperatures between 0\u00b0 C. and 60\u00b0 C.
