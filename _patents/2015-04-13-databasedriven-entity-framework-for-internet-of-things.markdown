title: Database-driven entity framework for internet of things
abstract: Unified and normalized management of an object within a structured data store on any machine and/or across difference machines. In an embodiment, a first agent accesses a first request dataset representing a two-dimensional structure. Each row in the request dataset comprises an identification of an agent, a statement, an identification of a resource to execute the statement, and one of a plurality of request types. Each row in the request dataset is processed according to the identification of the agent in the row. When the identified agent is the first agent, the request type of the row is accessed, and one or more elements in the row are processed based on the request type. When the identified agent is not the first agent, the row is sent within a second request dataset to the identified agent (which may be on a different machine than the first agent) for processing.

Field of the Invention","The embodiments described herein are generally directed to the unified and normalized management of an object within a structured data store on any machine and\/or across different machines.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, data-centric software applications and application platforms have incorporated one or more software architecture patterns and programming paradigms, including service-oriented, client-server, peer-to-peer, event-driven, and object-oriented architectures, and object-oriented programming, object-relational mapping, and entity-relationship modeling.","Conventionally, machine to machine and human to machine communications are managed through one or more communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, XMPP, DDS, AMQP, CoAP, RESTful HTTP).","None of the existing software architecture patterns or communication protocols has an abstraction layer capable of effectively supporting the interoperability requirements of the Internet of Things. This leads to fragmented systems within complex and costly integrations between disparate systems.","It would be beneficial to have an architectural pattern and communication protocol that eliminates fragmentation and provides a normalized layer of abstraction that supports universal interoperability among machines, and enables unified management of an object within a structured data store on any machine and\/or across different machines.","Accordingly, systems and methods are disclosed for unified and normalized management of an object within a structured data store on any machine and\/or across different machines.","In an embodiment, a method is disclosed. The method comprises using at least one hardware processor to: by a first agent on a first machine, accessing a first request dataset, wherein the first request dataset represents a two-dimensional structure having one or more rows and a plurality of columns, and wherein each of the one or more rows comprises an identification of an agent, a statement, an identification of a resource to execute the statement, and one of a plurality of request types; and process each of the one or more rows in the first request dataset by accessing the identification of an agent in the row, when the identification of the agent is the first agent, accessing the request type of the row, and processing one or more elements in the row based on the request type of the row, and, when the identification of the agent is not the first agent, sending the row in the first request dataset within a second request dataset comprising one or more rows to the identified agent for processing, wherein the identified agent is on a machine that is different from the first machine.","In an additional embodiment, a system is disclosed.

Examples of scripting languages include, without limitation, Structured Query Language (SQL), HTML, Printer Control Language (PCL), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), Computer Numeric Control (CNC), etc.","\u201cBooting\u201d: The process of loading and executing bootstrap software by a computer during the start-up process. Booting is a chain of events that start with execution of hardware-based procedures that may then hand-off to firmware and software which is loaded into memory. Booting often involves processes such as performing self-tests, and loading configuration settings, Basic Input\/Output System (BIOS), resident monitors, a hypervisor, an operating system, and\/or utility software.","\u201cEvent\u201d: An action that is initiated outside the scope of a command processor, and that is handled by the command processor. Typical sources of events include users (e.g., via keystroke(s), i.e., pressing one or more keys on a keyboard) and software or hardware devices (e.g., a timer). A computer program that changes its behavior in response to events is said to be \u201cevent-driven,\u201d often with the goal of being interactive.","\u201cInstruction Set\u201d: A collection of computer instructions, including native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external Input\/Output (I\/O). Instructions are in the form of a programming language (i.e., source code) or machine language (i.e., machine code) that is compatible with a machine resource. Source code is written using some human-readable computer language, usually as text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer, primarily by writing source code. The source code is automatically translated at some point (e.g., by a compiler) to machine code that the computer can directly read and execute.","\u201cData Store\u201d: A repository of a set of objects. A data store can contain one or more object datasets. A data store is a general concept that includes not just repositories like databases, but also simpler store types, such as flat files or firmware.","\u201cNormalization\u201d: The process of reducing data and metadata to a canonical form to facilitate interoperability. For instance, dataset normalization is the process of organizing datasets and dataset elements within a data store to minimize redundancy and dependency.","\u201cEntity\u201d: A category of like things or objects which are each recognized as being capable of an independent existence and which can be uniquely identified. Non-limiting examples of an entity include physical objects such as houses or cars, events such as house sales or car services, concepts such as customer transactions or orders, personal information such as contacts, message, appointments, and tasks, and object schema such as object datasets, dataset elements, attributes, and entities, reflectively.","\u201cAttribute\u201d: A data characteristic of an entity. Every entity has a minimal set of uniquely identifying attributes, including a unique identifier.","\u201cObject\u201d: A data representation of a unique instance of an entity. Data characteristics (\u201cattribute values\u201d) of an object can be stored as dataset elements within a row of a dataset.","\u201cGUID\u201d: A globally unique identifier (GUID) is a unique reference number generated by an algorithm that is used as an identifier in computer software. Non-limiting examples of a GUID include alphanumerical text, a sequence of digits (e.g., decimal or hexadecimal digits), a MAC address and time, and may be stored as a 16-byte (128-bit) number. An example of a GUID is \u201cD9A4F842-AF53-4A49-B752-CE58BE46C72D\u201d.","\u201cObject Event\u201d: A change in the state of an object, including, for a new object, the change from no state into an initial state. For example, when a consumer purchases a car, the car's state changes from \u201cfor sale\u201d to \u201csold\u201d.","\u201cObject Event Notification\u201d: A type of message (typically asynchronous) that is produced, published, propagated, detected, or consumed, and contains one or more object events. For example, a car dealer's automated system may notify another system of a car object's state change from \u201cfor sale\u201d to \u201csold\u201d.","\u201cObject View\u201d: A script in a resource-compatible scripting language that includes elements from one or more related view datasets and formatting instructions. The script, when executed by a resource, changes the state of a resource or resource's machine, and\/or generates a response from the resource or resource's machine. An object view, when executed by a resource on a machine, can render a display or user interface, retrieve and\/or manipulate data, print a document, invoke an application programming interface (API), control a mechanism, transmit a message to a web service, and\/or change the state of a machine and\/or resource, etc.","\u201cAggregate Object\u201d: A cluster of associated objects, including a root object, that are treated as a unit for the purpose of data changes. An example of an aggregate object is a purchase order object with one or more line item objects assigned to the purchase order object.","\u201cTriggered Action\u201d: An action performed in response to an object event that meets a defined condition, rule, or logical test.","\u201cDomain\u201d: A realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control within a network. A domain can represent an addressable location on a network or a tenant within a multi-tenancy software architecture.","The disclosed structured program transfer protocol, agent, object event processor, object view generator, and structured data store facilitate unified and normalized management of any object within a structured data store on any machine and\/or across different machines. Such machines may range, for example, from a sensor (e.g., home thermostat) to a computer (e.g., smart phone), and so on. The disclosed embodiments also facilitate the transfer and delivery of programs, applications, data, events, and views on one machine (e.g., tablet PC) to another machine (e.g., in-vehicle navigation system) via a communications interface. The request, delivery, and transfer of data and metadata for programs, program-compatible applications, events, views, etc. between machines are facilitated by a novel structured program transfer protocol for communications. The applications can be simple (e.g., an on\/off switch) or complex (e.g., robotics or business solutions (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), etc.)).","For example, the disclosed structured program transfer protocol, agent, object event processor, object view generator, and\/or structured data store can facilitate codeless, rapid development and on-demand delivery of data-centric applications on end-user devices, such as smart phones, tablets, PCs, and in-vehicle navigation systems. The data-centric application may be a spreadsheet, web site, client-server business solution, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In an embodiment, the structured program transfer protocol is a type of communication protocol that defines the dataset schema (\u201cSPTP Request\u201d) for sending one or more types of request, and the dataset schema (\u201cSPTP Response\u201d) for receiving one or more types of response from one machine to another, and\/or from one resource to another on a machine.","In an embodiment, each of the one or more rows in the SPTP Request comprises a request type, an identification of an agent, a statement, and an identification of a resource to execute the statement. In this embodiment, a request type in a row can comprise a statement type, i.e., specifying the type of statement included in that row. In this embodiment, an identification of an agent can comprise an agent connection type and agent connection string. In this embodiment, an identification of a resource can comprise a resource connection type and resource connection string.","In an embodiment, while processing a single defined request type within a SPTP Request may only perform a portion of creating, reading, updating, and deleting object datasets within a structured data store (e.g., reading), the combined processing all of the defined request types, within the dataset schema of SPTP Request, perform all aspects of creating, reading, updating, and deleting object datasets within a structured data store.","In an embodiment, each of the one or more rows in the SPTP Response comprises a response type and a response.","In an embodiment, the structured program transfer protocol defines the dataset schema (\u201cSPTP Events\u201d) for creating and sending object events as a type of statement within an SPTP Request, creating and\/or processing object events using an object event processor, and storing object events within a structured data store.","In an embodiment, the structured program transfer protocol defines the string schema (\u201cSPTP View ID\u201d) for sending the identification of an object view as a type of statement within an SPTP Request, and processing identifications of object views using an object view generator.","In an embodiment, the structured program transfer protocol defines the dataset schema (\u201cSPTP View Definition\u201d) for sending the definition of an object view as a type of statement within an SPTP Request, and creating and\/or processing definitions of object views using an object view generator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The object event processor (e.g., OEP ) is a type of resource that processes instances of SPTP Events. The object event processor can reside on multiple machines (e.g., OEP  on machine  and OEP  on machine ) and be a resource available to an agent specific to each machine (e.g., agent  on machine  and agent  on machine ).","The object view generator (e.g., OVG ) is a type of resource that generates view datasets and object views from instances of an SPTP View ID or SPTP View Definition. The object view generator can reside on multiple machines (e.g., OVG  on machine  and OVG  on machine ) and be a resource available to an agent specific to each machine (e.g., agent  on machine  and agent  on machine ). The object view generator may also be a resource available to an object event processor specific to each machine (e.g., OEP  on machine  and OEP  on machine ).","In an embodiment, the structured data store (e.g., SDS ) is a type of data store that maintains objects within a data structure that is compatible with an object event processor and object view generator. The structured data store can reside on multiple machines (e.g., SDS  on machine  and SDS  on machine ) and interact with an agent specific to each machine (e.g., agent  on machine  and agent  on machine ). The structured data store can also interact with an object event processor specific to each machine (e.g., OEP  on machine  and OEP  on machine ), and an object event processor specific to each machine (e.g., agent  on machine  and agent  on machine ).","In an embodiment, a row in the SPTP Request may identify the resource needed to execute a statement within the row. If the resource identified in the SPTP Request is on a remote machine (e.g., machine ), then the SPTP Request also identifies the remote agent (e.g., agent ) on the remote machine that can communicate with the resource (e.g., resource ) on the remote machine. For example, if agent  on machine  is processing an SPTP Request that has a row identifying a needed resource  on machine , agent  may forward the SPTP Request or a new SPTP Request (e.g., SPTP Request dataset ) to the remote agent (e.g., agent ).","If a row in the SPTP Request specifies a request to execute a statement included in the SPTP Request, then the processing agent (e.g., agent ) sends the statement to the identified resource (e.g., directly or via forwarding to a remote agent). For example, if agent  processes a request to execute a statement pertaining to identified resource , agent  may send the statement (e.g., statement ) to resource  directly. On the other hand, if agent  processes a request to execute a statement pertaining to remote resource , agent  may forward the request to agent  for execution (e.g., via statement  sent from agent  to resource ). In either case, the executing resource may return a response (e.g., response  or response ) to the invoking agent. The invoking agent generates a SPTP Response that includes a row that contains the response from the executing resource.","In an embodiment, agent  processes rows in the SPTP Request according to the request type specified in the row. In such an embodiment, agent  may process one or more of the following request types in one or more of the following manners:","(1) If a row in the SPTP Request specifies a request type to send instructions for creating a structured data store, then agent  or the identified remote agent (e.g., agent ) invokes the identified resource  or remote resource (e.g., ), respectively, to generate the instructions for creating a structured data store. The invoking agent generates a SPTP Response that includes a row that contains a SPTP Request. The SPTP Request, included in the SPTP Response, includes a row that contains the instructions within a statement.

The row in the SPTP Response may be returned to a command processor, as a resource, for processing.","(5) If a row in the SPTP Request specifies a request type to generate an object view based on an SPTP View ID included in the statement of the row, then agent  or the identified remote agent (e.g., agent ) invokes an object view generator (e.g., ) or remote object view generator (e.g., ), respectively, to generate a row within SPTP Request  for processing by the invoking agent. The generated row includes an identification of a resource and a statement that comprises an object view which was generated by the object view generator from one or more related view datasets which were generated by the object view generator based on the object view identifier.","In an embodiment, an object view generated by an object view generator includes a resource-compatible script in various scripting languages (e.g., HTML, SQL, XML, PCL).

As discussed above and illustrated in , CI [0] for Attribute object dataset  comprises an identifier, such that each row represents a uniquely-identified attribute. Thus, for example, a column representing an attribute within an object dataset (e.g., any of object datasets -, including Attribute object dataset ) within SDS  can be identified by the \u201cObject Identifier\u201d element corresponding to the row in the Attribute object dataset  that represents that attribute.

Such a scenario indicates that the domain owns its own domain object.","In an embodiment, objects within Domain object dataset  may represent persons, organizations, locations, and the like. In this embodiment, a domain object representing an organization and represented as a row in the Domain object dataset  can be assigned as the owner domain for a domain object representing a person, location, or other organization, also represented as a row in the Domain object dataset . As another example, a domain object representing a person and represented as a row in the Domain object dataset  can be assigned as the owner domain for a domain object representing a location or other person, also represented as a row in the Domain object dataset . In either case, a first domain object is assigned as the owner domain for a second domain object by identifying the first domain object in the \u201cOwner Domain\u201d column (CI 1) of the second domain object.","In an embodiment, the \u201cObject Entity\u201d column can identify an entity.

An example is illustrated in , according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, one or more slave entities can be assigned to a master entity. A column within Entity object dataset  (e.g., CI [3]) can identify the master Entity object assigned to a slave Entity object. In the illustrated example, he \u201cMaster Entity\u201d element at index location [5] [3] within Entity object dataset  is set to the value of the object identifier at index location [4][0] within Entity object dataset , which is illustrated as \u201c2C8D . . . \u201d. Thus, in the example illustrated in , the entity represented by RI [5] and identified as \u201c2495 . . . \u201d is a slave entity to the master entity represented by RI [4] and identified as \u201c2C8D . . . \u201d.","In an embodiment, an object identifier for an object dataset within the Dataset object dataset  can be set to an object identifier for a master entity within the Entity object dataset .

In this embodiment, a column within Attribute object dataset  (e.g., CI 3) can identify the Entity object assigned to an attribute object. For example, as illustrated in , the element at index location [5] [3] of the Attribute object dataset  is set to the value of the object identifier (i.e., \u201c2C8D . . . \u201d) for the master entity represented by row [4][0] in the Entity object dataset .","In an embodiment, Attribute object dataset  can contain rows that represent both master attributes and slave attributes as objects. In this embodiment, one or more slave attribute objects can be assigned to a slave Entity object and one or more master attribute objects can be assigned to a master Entity object. Also, in this embodiment, a slave attribute object can be assigned to a master attribute object, where the slave Entity object that is assigned to the slave attribute object is assigned to the master Entity object which is assigned to the master attribute object. A column (e.g., CI 5) within Attribute object dataset  can identify the master attribute object assigned to a slave attribute object. For example, as illustrated in , the \u201cMaster Attribute\u201d element at index location [6] [5] within Attribute object dataset  is set to the value of the object identifier (i.e., \u201c4A82 . . . \u201d) at index location [5][0] within Attribute object dataset . Thus, the attribute represented by RI [6] in the Attribute object dataset  and identified as \u201c9E76 . . . \u201d is a slave attribute to the master attribute represented by RI [5] and identified as \u201c4A82 . . . \u201d in the Attribute object dataset .","In an embodiment, an object dataset (e.g. View object dataset A) can contain objects associated with a master entity and\/or one or more slave entities assigned to the master entity. In this embodiment, the \u201cObject Entity\u201d element (e.g., at CI [2]) within View object dataset A is set to the object identifier (e.g., at CI [0]) for a master Entity object within Entity object dataset . For example, the \u201cObject Entity\u201d element at index location [0][2] in View object dataset A is set to the value of the \u201cObject Identifier\u201d element at index location [4][0] within the Entity object dataset , indicating that View object dataset A contains the master entity represented by RI [4] in Entity object dataset  and identified by \u201c2C8D . . . \u201d. In addition, the \u201cObject Entity\u201d element at index location [1][2] within View object dataset A is set to the value of the \u201cIdentifier\u201d element at index location [5] [0] within Entity object dataset , indicating that View object dataset A also contains the slave entity represented by RI [5] in Entity object dataset  and identified by \u201c2495 . . . \u201d.","In an embodiment, values for master and slave attributes are maintained within the same object dataset column. This object dataset column can be identified as the object identifier of the master attribute. For example, as illustrated in , the \u201cType\u201d element at index location [0][3] within View object dataset A is representing a value of the master attribute identified in RI [5] within Attribute object dataset . In addition, the \u201cType\u201d element at index location [1][3] within View object dataset A is representing a value of the slave attribute identified in RI [6] within Attribute object dataset .","In an embodiment, a Model object assigned to an Entity object can incorporate, as Model Attribute objects, one or more Attribute objects of the Entity object as illustrated in . For example, a \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object can be assigned to a plurality of Model objects with each Model object supporting a subset of the complete attribute set a universal printer definition.","In an embodiment, from a triggered action upon creating or updating an Entity object, the object event processor can create Attribute objects from the \u201cParent Entity\u201d element and\/or the \u201cChild Entity\u201d element of the Entity object as illustrated in .","In an embodiment, human readable identifiers for objects within certain object datasets (e.g., Entities object dataset , Attributes object dataset ) can be constructed from assigned objects from a Terms object dataset as illustrated in . For example, a human readable identifier of \u201cSales Order Item Serial Number\u201d can be constructed from four Term objects assigned to elements of Entity object at RI 12 in Entity object .

In this embodiment, the \u201cType\u201d element of an Attribute object (e.g. RI 15) in Attribute object dataset  can be set to a value by processing a row in SPTP Events. From a trigger action, the object event processor creates additional Attribute objects to be assigned to Term objects.

The profile file maintains structured content including the Device object identifier and its Model object identifier, the identification of a remote agent on a controller device, and the identification of one or more local and\/or remote resources. A program and application dataset is also resident on Devices A, B, and C.","Device A is owned by and is the controller device (e.g., web server) for the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object. Device A has the SDS component installed.","The \u201cjsmith@zebra.com\u201d Domain object is owned by the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object, and is a Member object, as a \u201cSales Rep\u201d entity, of the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object.","Device B is owned by and is the controller device (e.g., web server) for the \u201cadctech.com\u201d Domain object. Device B has the SDS components installed.","Device C is owned by and is an End User Device (EUD) (e.g., smartphone) for the \u201cjsmith@zebra.com\u201d Domain object. Device C has the SDS and agent components installed.","Device C has a \u201cweb socket\u201d Connection object to Device A. The \u201cjsmith@zebra.com\u201d Domain object has an active Session object with the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object using this Connection object.","Device D (e.g., printer) does not have a resident program and application dataset, as the agent on Device D has never been booted and provisioned. The name of the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object (i.e. \u201czebra.com\u201d) is the identification of the remote agent in its profile file.","Device E is a machine that does not have the agent component installed.","The \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object is a Member object, as a \u201cVendor\u201d entity, of the \u201cadctech.com\u201d Domain object, and the \u201cadctech.com\u201d Domain object is a mirrored Member object, as a \u201cCustomer\u201d entity, of the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object with a subscription to Item and Sales Rep objects owned by the \u201czebra.com\u201d Domain object.

The SDS component includes an OEP and OVG. Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) are used as object identifiers within all object datasets in the SDS.","Tables 26 and 27 represent an ordered sequence of steps for demonstrating the sample utility. In these tables, the sequence column in the table represents the sequence, the device column represents the Device (e.g., Device A) performing the sequence step, and the component column represents the component of the device (e.g. agent) identified in the device column that performs the sequence step. The Automation column describes the sequence step being performed.","Through an embodiment of the disclosed database-driven entity framework, the demonstration in Table 26 illustrates how a user on a smartphone (Device C) creates an aggregate \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object and an aggregate \u201cQL420\u201d Model object assigned to the \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object, and how those objects are transported as SPTP Events datasets to a vendor's cloud server (Device A) and stored within its SDS. It further illustrates how automation generates a \u201cQL420 Printer\u201d Item object based on the new \u201cQL420\u201d Model object and associated \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object, and transports the new aggregate \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object and new \u201cQL420 Printer\u201d Item object as a SPTP Events dataset to a customer's cloud server (Device B) based on a subscription, and replicates these objects within its SDS.","The demo also illustrates how the booting of an un-provisioned printer (Device D) transports its Device object identifier and Model object identifier (which is the identity of the new \u201cQL420\u201d model object) and current attribute settings of the printer as a SPTP Events dataset to the vendor's cloud server (Device A) to be stored as a new \u201c00:B0 . . . \u201d Device object within its SDS. It further illustrates how automation generates a new \u201c00:B0 . . . \u201d Item Serial Number object based on the \u201c00:B0 . . . \u201d Device object, and generates nested datasets within a program and application dataset from object datasets in the SDS, and transports the program and application datasets to the printer (Device D). Device D stores the program and application datasets in firmware and processes them using its command processor to control the printer and render a user interface for the printer's control panel.","This demonstration of the sample utility also illustrates how the program and application datasets and current attribute settings of the printer can be transported, as a collection of datasets, from the printer (Device D) to the smartphone (Device C) which processes the datasets using its command processor to render a user interface for a printer's control panel. It further illustrates how the user can change attribute settings of the printer using the printer's control panel rendered on the smartphone (Device C) and transport the setting changes, as an SPTP Events dataset, to the printer (Device D) which processes the rows in SPTP Events to update its attribute settings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0224","num":"0223"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00026","num":"00026"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 26"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Sequence","Device","Component","Automation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1.1","C","command","A row in a SPTP Events is created for each attribute value"]},{"entry":[{},{},"processor","created from user events within a \u201cNew Entity\u201d object"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"view, including the \u201cTerm\u201d attribute value set to the"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"\u201cPrinter\u201d Term object identifier, and the \u201cMaster Entity\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"attribute value set to the \u201cDevice\u201d Entity object identifier."]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"When a user event invokes saving the \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"object, a row in a SPTP Request is created with the SPTP"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Events included in its Statement."]},{"entry":["1.2","C","agent","The row in the SPTP Request is transported via HTTP to"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the agent on Device A using the Agent Connection"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"address\u201czebra.com\u201d defined in the row."]},{"entry":["1.3","A","agent","The SPTP Events within the Statement of the submitted"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"SPTP Request is submitted to the OEP for the SDS."]},{"entry":["1.4","A","OEP","A \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object and child Attribute and Attribute"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Value objects are created from these SPTP Events to form"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"an aggregate \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object."]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"As the \u201cPrinter\u201d Entity object is a new master Entity"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"object, a triggered action creates a Dataset object within"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"SDS with the Dataset object identifier set to the \u201cPrinter\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Entity object identifier.

The automation then generates a mirrored aggregate Sales Order object that is transported as an SPTP Events dataset to a vendor's cloud server (A) which is then stored within its SDS. The automation then generates a new Task object within its SDS from rows in an SPTP Events dataset. The automation then generates a mirrored Task object that is transported as an SPTP Events dataset to a smartphone (C) which is then stored within its SDS.","The demo also illustrates how the mirrored Task object can be rendered to the user on the smartphone (C) using its command processor to process its program dataset. It further illustrates how a new Shipment object view linked to the Task object can be rendered to the user. The user can fulfill the Sales Order using the rendered Shipment object view and the new aggregate Shipment object is transported as a SPTP Events dataset to the vendor's cloud server (A) and stored within its SDS.","The automation then invokes a disparate carrier web service to initiate pickup, generates a \u201cshipping label\u201d object view of the aggregate Shipment object, and transports the object view to the printer (C) which prints a shipping label and broadcasts an \u201cout of paper\u201d status as a row in an SPTP Events dataset, which generates a Task object.

Computer programs can also be received via communication interface  and stored in the main memory  and\/or the secondary memory . Such computer programs, when executed, enable the system  to perform the various functions of the disclosed embodiments as previously described.","In this description, the term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d is used to refer to any non-transitory computer-readable storage media used to provide computer-executable code (e.g., software and computer programs) to the system . Examples of these media include main memory , secondary memory  (including internal memory , removable medium , and external storage medium ), and any peripheral device communicatively coupled with communication interface  (including a network information server or other network device). These non-transitory computer-readable mediums are means for providing executable code, programming instructions, and software to the system .","In an embodiment that is implemented using software, the software may be stored on a computer-readable medium and loaded into the system  by way of removable medium , I\/O interface , or communication interface . In such an embodiment, the software is loaded into the system  in the form of electrical communication signals . The software, when executed by the processor , preferably causes the processor  to perform the inventive features and functions previously described herein.","In an embodiment, I\/O interface  provides an interface between one or more components of system  and one or more input and\/or output devices. Example input devices include, without limitation, keyboards, touch screens or other touch-sensitive devices, biometric sensing devices, computer mice, trackballs, pen-based pointing devices, and the like. Examples of output devices include, without limitation, cathode ray tubes (CRTs), plasma displays, light-emitting diode (LED) displays, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), printers, vacuum florescent displays (VFDs), surface-conduction electron-emitter displays (SEDs), field emission displays (FEDs), and the like.","The system  also includes optional wireless communication components that facilitate wireless communication over a voice and over a data network. The wireless communication components comprise an antenna system , a radio system , and a baseband system . In the system , radio frequency (RF) signals are transmitted and received over the air by the antenna system  under the management of the radio system .","In one embodiment, the antenna system  may comprise one or more antennae and one or more multiplexors (not shown) that perform a switching function to provide the antenna system  with transmit and receive signal paths. In the receive path, received RF signals can be coupled from a multiplexor to a low noise amplifier (not shown) that amplifies the received RF signal and sends the amplified signal to the radio system .","In alternative embodiments, the radio system  may comprise one or more radios that are configured to communicate over various frequencies. In one embodiment, the radio system  may combine a demodulator (not shown) and modulator (not shown) in one integrated circuit (IC). The demodulator and modulator can also be separate components. In the incoming path, the demodulator strips away the RF carrier signal leaving a baseband receive audio signal, which is sent from the radio system  to the baseband system .","If the received signal contains audio information, then baseband system  decodes the signal and converts it to an analog signal. Then the signal is amplified and sent to a speaker. The baseband system  also receives analog audio signals from a microphone. These analog audio signals are converted to digital signals and encoded by the baseband system . The baseband system  also codes the digital signals for transmission and generates a baseband transmit audio signal that is routed to the modulator portion of the radio system . The modulator mixes the baseband transmit audio signal with an RF carrier signal generating an RF transmit signal that is routed to the antenna system and may pass through a power amplifier (not shown). The power amplifier amplifies the RF transmit signal and routes it to the antenna system  where the signal is switched to the antenna port for transmission.","The baseband system  is also communicatively coupled with the processor . The central processing unit  has access to data storage areas  and . The central processing unit  is preferably configured to execute instructions (i.e., computer programs or software) that can be stored in the memory  or the secondary memory . Computer programs can also be received from the baseband processor  and stored in the data storage area  or in secondary memory , or executed upon receipt. Such computer programs, when executed, enable the system  to perform the various functions of the disclosed embodiments as previously described. For example, data storage areas  may include various software modules (not shown).","Various embodiments may also be implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, components such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
