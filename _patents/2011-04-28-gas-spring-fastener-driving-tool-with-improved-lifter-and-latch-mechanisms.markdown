title: Gas spring fastener driving tool with improved lifter and latch mechanisms
abstract: A portable linear fastener driving tool is provided that drive staples, nails, or other linearly driven fasteners. The tool uses a gas spring principle, in which a cylinder filled with compressed gas is used to quickly force a piston through a driving stroke movement, while a driver also drives a fastener into a workpiece. The piston/driver is then moved back to its starting position by use of a rotary-to-linear lifter, and the piston again compresses the gas above the piston, thereby preparing the tool for another driving stroke. An improved lifter design has modified lifting pins that reduce the side-forces on the driver. A pivotable latch acts as a safety device, by preventing the driver from making a full driving stroke at an improper time. An improved latch design has a more durable catching surface.

No. 12\/243,568, titled \u201cFASTENER DRIVING TOOL USING A GAS SPRING,\u201d filed on Oct. 1, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,011,547, which claims priority to provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/977,678, titled \u201cFASTENER DRIVING TOOL USING A GAS SPRING,\u201d filed on Oct. 5, 2007.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to linear fastener driving tools, and, more particularly, directed to portable tools that drive staples, nails, or other linearly driven fasteners. The invention is specifically disclosed as a gas spring linear fastener driving tool, in which a cylinder filled with compressed gas is used to quickly force a piston through a driving stroke movement, while also driving a fastener into a workpiece. The piston is then moved back to its starting position by use of a rotary-to-linear lifter, which again compresses the gas above the piston, thereby preparing the tool for another driving stroke. A driver member is attached to the piston, and has protrusions along its edges that are used to contact the lifter member, which lifts the driver during a return stroke. A pivotable latch is controlled to move into either an interfering position or a non-interfering position with respect to the driver protrusions, and acts as a safety device, by preventing the driver from making a full driving stroke at an improper time. In alternative embodiments, the fastener driving tool uses a different type of driving device, such as a mechanical spring, to force the driver into a driving stroke. In other alternative embodiments, the fastener driving tool includes a rotary-to-linear lifter having multiple protruding pins that lift the fastener driver element back to the initiating ready position, in which at least one of the lifter pins has a shape (or geometry) that reduces the side-loading forces between the lifter pin and the fastener driver element; and the fastener driving tool includes a movable latch that is controlled to disengage from a slotted rib (a raised wall with spaced-apart openings) along one side of the driver element during a driving stroke, but also will tend to engage the slotted rib of the driver element as a safety interlock.","2. Description of the Related Art","An early air spring fastener driving tool is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,215,808, to Sollberger. The Sollberger patent used a rack and pinion-type gear to \u201cjack\u201d the piston back to its driving position. A separate motor was to be attached to a belt that was worn by the user; a separate flexible mechanical cable was used to take the motor's mechanical output to the driving tool pinion gear, through a drive train.","Another air spring fastener driving tool is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,423, to Kondo. This Kondo patent used a separate air replenishing supply tank with an air replenishing piston to refresh the pressurized air needed to drive a piston that in turn drove a fastener into an object.","Another air spring fastener driving tool is disclosed in published patent application no. US2006\/0180631, by Pedicini, which uses a rack and pinion to move the piston back to its driving position. The rack and pinion gear are decoupled during the drive stroke, and a sensor is used to detect this decoupling. The Pedicini tool uses a release valve to replenish the air that is lost between nail drives.","What is needed in the art is a portable fastener driving tool that is electrically powered, but which uses a gas spring principle of operation to drive a fastener into an object, and also uses few moving parts, which allows for simplicity of operation and provides a substantially gas-tight system for containing the pressurized gas for the gas spring.","Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle, in which the cylinder that contains the moving piston and driver is substantially surrounded by a pressure vessel (as a main storage chamber) to increase the storage space of the pressurized gases needed for the gas spring effect.","It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that uses a gas spring principle to provide a quick downward driving stroke, and uses a rotary-to-linear lifter having a cam-shaped perimeter surface and multiple cylindrical protruding pins that lift the fastener driver element and the piston back to the initiating firing (or driving) position.","It is a further advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle, in which the tool has a cylinder displacement volume and also includes a main storage chamber, and in which a volumetric ratio of the main storage chamber's volume with respect to the cylinder's displacement volume is at least 2.0:1.","It is still a further advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle, in which there is a \u201cworking storage volume\u201d comprising a combination of a main storage chamber and a cylinder displacement volume, and in which there is no gas replenishment system on-board the tool for allowing a user to replenish the charge gases of the tool's working storage volume, thereby reducing opportunities for gas leaks.","It is yet another advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that uses a gas spring principle that uses a rotary-to-linear lifter to move the driver back to its firing (or driving) position, in which there can be a variable driving stroke by use of multiple rotations of the lifter member.","It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle, in which, for a first embodiment, a movable latch is controlled by a solenoid to disengage from multiple teeth of the driver element during a driving stroke, but also will tend to engage the teeth of the driver element as a safety interlock, and also at the maximum driver element displacement just before a driving stroke is to occur, so that the movable latch engages the driver teeth until the user activates the tool.","It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle, in which, for a second embodiment, a gearbox is provided that is essentially self-locking from its output side, or has a one-way feature, and thus the gearbox\/lifter combination holds the driver in position just before a driving stroke.","It is a yet further advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle which includes a system controller that allows operation in either a \u201cbottom firing mode\u201d or a \u201ctrigger firing mode.\u201d","It is a still further advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle in which the system controller has error correction capability, including the capability of recovering from a jam of the driver element, without having to completely disable the tool.","It is a further advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that uses a gas spring principle to provide a quick downward driving stroke, and uses an alternative embodiment rotary-to-linear lifter having multiple protruding pins that lift the fastener driver element and the piston back to the initiating firing (or driving) position, in which at least one of the lifter pins has a geometry that reduces the side-loading forces between the lifter pin and the fastener driver element.","It is still a further advantage of the present invention to provide a fastener driving tool that operates on a gas spring principle, in which, for an alternative embodiment, a movable latch is controlled to disengage from a slotted rib along one side of the driver element during a driving stroke, but also will tend to engage the slotted rib of the driver element as a safety interlock during abnormal operating conditions.","Additional advantages and other novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned with the practice of the invention.","To achieve the foregoing and other advantages, and in accordance

Surrounding, in the illustrated embodiment, the cylinder wall  is a main storage chamber  (also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cpressure vessel storage space\u201d) and an outer pressure vessel wall  (which corresponds to the \u201cfront\u201d cover  of , along the left portion of this view). At the top (as seen on ) of the fastener driver portion  is a top cap  for the cylinder mechanism.","Also within the fastener driver portion  are mechanisms that will actually drive a fastener into a solid object. This includes a driver , a cylinder \u201cventing chamber\u201d  (which would typically always be at atmospheric pressure), a driver track  (see ), a rotary-to-linear lifter , and a latch . The driver  is also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cdriver member\u201d and the rotary-to-lifter  is also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201clifter member,\u201d or simply as a \u201clifter.\u201d Driver  is rather elongated, and as an individual element can best be seen in . There are multiple \u201cteeth\u201d  that are positioned along the driver. In the illustrated embodiment, these teeth  are spaced-apart not only in a transverse direction from the elongated centerline of driver , but they are also spaced-apart from one another along the outer longitudinal edges of the driver . The positions of teeth  are clearly illustrated in . It will be understood that the precise positions for the teeth  could be different from those illustrated for the driver  without departing from the principles of the present invention.","There is a cylinder base  that mainly separates the gas pressure portions of the fastener driver portion  from the mechanical portions of that driver portion . The venting of air from the cylinder venting chamber  passes through the cylinder base , as seen at a vent  (see ). The mechanical portions of  begin with a rotary-to-linear lifter  which was briefly mentioned above, along with a lifter drive shaft . Drive shaft  protrudes through the center portions of the fastener driver portion  and through the center of the lifter , and this shaft is used to rotate the lifter, as desired by the control system.","Lifter  is not designed with an entirely circular outer perimeter, but instead is arcuate and portions of its perimeter exhibit an eccentric shape of a cam (see ). A portion of the lifter's outer perimeter is mainly circular for about half of a circle (designated by the reference numeral ), but the other half of the lifter's outer perimeter is more eccentric, which provides an elliptical surface that is designated by the reference numeral . The rotary-to-linear lifter  also includes three cylindrical protrusions (or \u201cextensions\u201d) that will also be referred to herein as \u201cpins.\u201d The first such pin (\u201cpin \u201d) is designated , the second pin (\u201cpin \u201d) is designated , while the third pin (\u201cpin \u201d) is designated . These pins are all viewed on . Furthermore, there is a fourth cylindrical pin (\u201cpin \u201d) that protrudes from the opposite side of the lifter , which fourth pin is designated , and which can be viewed on several of the other figures, namely .","It should be noted that  also depict a \u201cback\u201d side of the first three pins , , and , in which these views essentially show a \u201cboss portion\u201d of those pins. These boss portions of the pins , ,  are not entirely necessary for the proper functioning of the rotary-to-linear lifter , however, the boss portions are illustrated in the figures of this patent document for ease of description. (In other words, the surface of the lifter  could be perfectly smooth at those locations rather than exhibiting a \u201cboss.\u201d) It should be understood that the \u201cworking side\u201d of these three pins , , and  is on the opposite side of the lifter  in the views of , and this working side is directly illustrated in . When discussing these pins , , and  with respect to  in this written description, it is with reference to the \u201cboss side\u201d of those pins; however, the effects of the \u201cworking side\u201d of those pins is discussed in some detail with respect to other structures that are also illustrated on . It should also be noted that pins , , , and  are illustrated as having circular cross-sectional shapes, which is desirable for this embodiment, although other cross-sectional shapes could instead be used without departing from the principles of the present invention, particularly for the fourth pin .","The latch  that was briefly noted above is depicted on , and has a latch shaft  protruding therethrough, and this shaft rotates the latch  as determined by the controller. Latch  includes a latch \u201ccatching surface\u201d at , and this will be more fully explained below. In , there is an internal cover  that is a portion of the back plate , and hides some of the other mechanical components that will be visible in other views.","In , the piston  is not quite at its uppermost or top-most position, and a gas pressure chamber  can be seen above the top-most area of the piston, near the piston seal . It will be understood that the gas pressure chamber  and the main storage chamber (or storage space)  are in fluidic communication with one another. It will also be understood that the portion to the interior of the cylinder wall  forms a displacement volume that is created by the stroke of the piston . In other words, the gas pressure chamber  is not a fixed volume, but this chamber will vary in volume as the piston  moves up and down (as seen in ). This type of mechanical arrangement is often referred to as a \u201cdisplacement volume,\u201d and that terminology will mainly be used herein for this non-fixed volume .","It will be further understood that the main storage chamber  preferably comprises a fixed volume, which typically would make it less expensive to manufacture; however, it is not an absolute requirement that the main storage chamber actually be of a fixed volume. It would be possible to allow a portion of this chamber  to deform in size and\/or shape so that the size of its volume would actually change, during operation of the present invention, without departing from the principles of the present invention.","In the illustrated embodiment for the first embodiment fastener driving tool , the main storage chamber  substantially surrounds the working cylinder . Moreover, the main storage chamber  is annular in shape, and it is basically co-axial with the cylinder . This is a preferred configuration of the illustrated first embodiment, but it will be understood that alternative physical arrangements could be designed without departing from the principles of the present invention.","Referring now to , the piston is depicted at its bottom-most travel position, and in this configuration, the displacement volume  and the main storage chamber  are at their largest combined volumes, while the cylinder venting chamber  is at its minimum volume. This bottom position is also sometimes referred to herein as the \u201cdriven position.\u201d","In , the movable piston stop  is now in contact with the stationary piston stop , which is why the cylinder venting chamber  is at its minimum (or zero) volume. In , the driver  is also at its bottom-most travel position, and its lower-most tip can be seen extending out the exit port at the bottom of the guide body .","In , the rotary-to-linear lifter  and the latch  are in their respective positions at the end of a firing (driving) stroke, and the latch  has its latching surface  in a location that will not interfere with the teeth  of the driver . This is necessary so that the driver  can make a linear stroke from its top-most position to its bottom-most position. However, the latch  will later be slightly rotated by the latch shaft  (which is spring-loaded) so that its catching surface  will be able to interfere with the teeth .","In the configuration depicted on , the fastener driving tool  has been used to drive a fastener, and the tool now must cause the driver  to be \u201clifted\u201d back to its top-most position for a new firing (driving) stroke. This is accomplished by rotating the lifter , which is actuated by the motor , through its gearbox , etc.","As rotary-to-linear lifter  rotates counterclockwise (as seen in ) at least one of its pins , , or  will come into contact with one of the teeth  along the left side (as seen in ) of the driver . This will cause the driver  to be \u201clifted\u201d upward (as seen in ). As the lifter  rotates, one of the teeth  will be in contact with one of the rotating pins , ,  throughout a portion of the rotational travel of the lifter, and the \u201cnext\u201d pin will then come into contact with the \u201cnext\u201d tooth  so that the driver  continues to be moved upward. This will remain true until the eccentric cam surface  comes into play, and since there are no \u201cworking\u201d lifter pins protruding along that surface, the driver  will not continue to be driven upward while the eccentric cam surface  is positioned along the right portion (as seen in ) of the rotary-to-linear lifter . However, when this occurs, the latch , which is spring-loaded, will have its latch catching surface  in a proper location to \u201ccatch\u201d the closest tooth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver , thereby preventing the driver from falling downward for any significant distance. After this occurs, the \u201cnext\u201d lifter pin (which will be the pin ) will then come along and again make contact with one of the teeth  along the left-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver , thereby continuing to lift the driver toward the top (as seen in ) of the cylinder .","In the illustrated embodiment of the first embodiment fastener driving tool , the rotary-to-linear lifter  makes two complete rotations to lift the driver  from its bottom-most position to its top-most position. (The upper position is also sometimes referred to herein as the \u201cready position.\u201d) At the end of the second rotation, the parts will be configured as illustrated in . The piston  is once again near the top of the cylinder , and the combined volumes of the main storage chamber  and displacement volume  have now been reduced to a smaller volume, which means their gases are under a greater pressure, since the gas that was above the piston and in chamber  was compressed during the lift of the driver. (As noted above, the actual volume of the main storage chamber  does not change in the illustrated embodiment.) During the lift of the driver, the latch  was \u201cengaged\u201d with the teeth , however, the latch has a smooth surface in one direction that allows the teeth  to push the latch out of the way during the upward lift of the driver. This is much like a ratchet-type action, remembering that the latch is spring-loaded so as to act in this manner.","In , the \u201clast\u201d tooth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver  is engaged with the latch catching surface , and so latch  now prevents the driver from being moved downward (as seen in this view). The third pin  is still in contact with the lower-most tooth  along the left-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver , at this point in the rotational travel of the rotary-to-linear lifter . There is a sensor which, in the illustrated embodiment, is a limit switch  (see ), that detects the rotational movements of the lifter . This sensor detects the fourth pin , as discussed below in greater detail.","When the sensor  detects the fourth pin  a first time (in this embodiment), the control system turns off the solenoid , which will then allow the latch  to engage the right-hand teeth (in these views) of the lifter . Note that the solenoid can also be turned off earlier during the lift, if desired. When sensor  detects this pin  a second time (in this embodiment), the current to the motor  is turned off, and the motor thus is de-energized and stops the lifting action of the driver . As described herein, the solenoid  acts as a latch actuator.","Due to the gas pressure above the piston , the driver\/piston subassembly will drift downward (in these views) a small distance until the tooth  contacts the latch surface . This is the position illustrated in  of these components, and this configuration is considered to be the \u201crest\u201d position of the tool. Although the gas pressure in the combined main storage chamber  and displacement volume  is at its maximum, the latch  prevents the driver from being moved further downward, so the piston is essentially locked in this position until something else occurs. In a preferred mode of the invention, the pressure vessel may be pressurized at about 100 PSIG to 120 PSIG.","When it is time to drive a fastener, the next action in the illustrated first embodiment is to cause the motor  to become energized once again. This occurs by two independent actions by the user: in some modes of the invention, these two independent actions can occur in either order. (There is also an optional \u201crestrictive mode\u201d of operation, in which the two independent actions must occur in a specific order.) These two actions are: pressing the nose  of the safety contact element  against a solid surface, and depressing the trigger actuator . The trigger actuator will cause the trigger switch  to change state, which is one condition that will start sending current to the motor . The safety contact element  has an upper arm  (see ) that will be moved as the nose  is pushed into the tool , and this upper arm  will actuate another sensor which, in the illustrated embodiment, is a second limit switch  (see ). When both of these actions are occurring simultaneously, current is delivered to the motor  which will once again turn the rotary-to-linear lifter  a short distance. Also, the controller will energize the solenoid , which will rotate the latch  a small angular distance clockwise (as seen in ) to disengage the latch catching surface  from one of the teeth  of the driver . More specifically, this would be the \u201clast\u201d tooth  as seen in . Note that  show details of the same structure depicted in  at different perspective angles.","It should be noted that the rotary motion of the lifter  will cause a small upward movement of the driver  so that the latch  can easily disengage from the \u201clast\u201d tooth  of the driver . Thus, there will not be a binding action that might otherwise cause the mechanism to jam.","Now that all this has occurred, the latch  is in its disengaged position so that its catching surface  will not interfere with any of the teeth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver ; also the eccentric cam surface  is now facing the teeth  along the left-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver , and none of the three \u201cworking\u201d pins of the lifter will interfere with those left-hand teeth . Once the driver tooth \u201cdrops off\u201d the last lifting pin , the driver  is quickly thrust downward in a linear stroke, due to the high gas pressure within the main storage chamber  and displacement volume . (This is the \u201cgas spring\u201d effect.) Along the way, the driver  will pick up a fastener that is waiting at the feeder carriage , and drive that fastener along the back plate  to the exit area at the bottom (at the area  on ). After this action has occurred, the driver  will be situated at its lower-most position, as viewed in .","The pressure of the gas in the combined main storage chamber  and displacement volume  is sufficiently high to quickly force the driver  downward, and such pneumatic means is typically much faster than a nail driving gun that uses exclusively mechanical means (such as a spring) for driving a fastener. This is due to the \u201cgas spring\u201d effect caused by the high gas pressure within the main storage chamber  and displacement volume  that, once the driver is released, can quickly and easily move the driver  in a downward stroke.","As the driver  is being moved downward, the piston  and the movable piston stop  are forcing air (or possibly some other gas) out of the cylinder venting chamber  that is below the piston. This volume of air is moved through a vent to atmosphere , and it is desired that this be a low resistance passageway, so as to not further impede the movement of the piston and driver during their downward stroke. The gas above the piston is not vented to atmosphere, but instead remains within the displacement volume , which is also in fluidic communication with the main storage chamber .","One aspect of the present invention is to provide a rather large storage space volume to hold the pressurized gas that is also used to drive the piston downward during a driving stroke of the driver . There is a fluidic passage  between the upper portion of the cylinder and the main storage chamber . (In the illustrated first embodiment, the cylinder wall  does not extend all the way to the \u201ctop\u201d cap .) It is preferred that the volume of the main storage chamber be larger than the total volume of the cylinder working spaces (i.e., the displacement volume) by a volumetric ratio of at least 2.0:1, and more preferably at least 3.0:1. This will allow for a powerful stroke, and a quick stroke.","The illustrated first embodiment of the present invention allows for both a quick firing (or driving) stroke time and also a fairly quick \u201clifting\u201d time to bring the driver back to its upper position, ready for the next firing (driving) stroke. Both of these mechanical actions can sequentially occur in less than 340 milliseconds (combined time), and allow a user to quickly place fasteners into a surface. In one operating mode of the present invention, the human user can hold the trigger in the engaged position and quickly place a fastener at a desired location merely by pressing the nose (or \u201cbottom\u201d) of the tool against the working surface to actuate the fastener driver and place the fastener. Then the user can quickly remove the fastener driver tool from that surface, and move it to a second position along the work surface, while still depressing the trigger the entire time, and then press the nose (or bottom) of the tool against the working surface at a different position, and it will drive a fastener at that \u201cdifferent\u201d position. This is referred to as a \u201cbottom fire\u201d capability, and when using the illustrated embodiment it can occur virtually as fast as a human can place the tool against a surface, then pick up the tool and accurately place it against the surface at a different position, and thereby repeat these steps as often as desired until emptying the magazine of fasteners. This type of mode of operation will be discussed in greater detail below in connection with the logic flow chart starting at , with respect to the control system of the fastener driving tool .","Referring now to , another side sectional view is provided that shows some of the elements beneath the latch and other portions of the first embodiment fastener driving tool . There are two electromechanical limit switches  and . The limit switch  detects movements of the fourth pin  of the rotary-to-linear lifter  (as noted above). The limit switch  detects movement of the upper arm , which is a portion of the safety contact element  that is pushed rearward (or \u201cup\u201d in these views) with respect to the overall tool  when the nose of the tool is pressed against a working surface. These limit switches provide electrical input signals to the controller, which is discussed below in greater detail. It will be understood that other types of sensors could be used instead of electromechanical limit switches, such as optoelectrical sensors, or magnetic sensors, including a Hall-effect switch, or even a metal-sensing proximity switch.","Also viewed on  is a return spring , which causes the safety contact element  to be pushed back downward (in this view) once the user releases the nose of the tool  from the working surface. In addition, there is a depth of drive adjustment at .","Referring now to , further details of the solenoid are viewed. In , the solenoid  has a plunger  that will move linearly either in or out from the main coil body of the solenoid . When the solenoid is energized, it pulls the plunger  in toward the solenoid body , which rotates a solenoid arm  (part of the solenoid's \u201clinkage\u201d), which in turn rotates the latch shaft  that also rotates the latch  a small arcuate distance. This causes the latch  to disengage from the teeth  of the driver . On the other hand, when the solenoid  becomes de-energized, the plunger will be pushed out by the plunger spring , which will rotate the solenoid arm  a short distance, and that in turn rotates the latch shaft  and the latch . This will tend to cause the latch to engage the teeth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver . However, since this is a spring action, the teeth  can slide against the surface of the latch  and move the latch out of the way if the teeth are attempting to move upward along with the driver . However, the spring action of the solenoid plunger spring will be strong enough to push the latch  into its engaged position, and any teeth  attempting to move downward will be caught by the catching surface  of the latch .","This \u201ccatching\u201d action of the latch  has more than one benefit. In the first place, the latch holds the tooth  (which is the \u201cbottom tooth\u201d along the right-hand side of the driver as seen in ) in place when the piston has been lifted to its top or \u201cfiring\u201d position. The driver cannot be fired until the latch  is moved out of the way, as discussed above. On the other hand, if there is some type of jam or an improper use of the tool by a user such that the driver  does not totally complete its travel during a firing (driving) stroke, the latch  will also prevent a misfire from occurring at an inconvenient time.","More specifically, if the driver jams during a drive stroke, and if a person tries to clear the jam, and if there was no precaution taken to prevent the remainder of the stroke from occurring at that moment, then possibly an injury could occur when the driver  suddenly becomes released from its jammed condition. In other words, a fastener could be driven during the attempt to clear the jam, and that fastener would likely be directed somewhere that is not the original target surface. In the present invention, the latch  will have its solenoid  become de-energized once the jam occurs (because solenoid  will de-energize after a \u201ctimeout\u201d interval occurs), and therefore the latch  will be engaged and the catching surface  will be in a position to interfere with the downward movement of the driver teeth . By use of this configuration, the driver could only move a short distance even if the jam was suddenly cleared, because the latch catching surface  will literally \u201ccatch\u201d the \u201cnext\u201d tooth  that unexpectedly comes along during a downward travel of the driver . This makes the tool much safer in situations where a complete driver stroke has not occurred.","The process for controlling the solenoid and the moments when the solenoid will either be energized or de-energized are discussed below in connection with the flow chart that begins on .","With respect to various types of firing (or driving) modes, a \u201ctrigger fire\u201d mode is where the user first presses the tool nose against a working surface, and then depresses the trigger actuator . It is the trigger being depressed that causes the drive stroke to occur in this situation. With respect to a \u201cbottom fire\u201d mode, the trigger is actuated first, and then the user presses the nose of the tool against a work surface, and it is the work surface contact that causes the drive stroke to occur. As discussed above, the user can continue to hold the trigger down while pressing against and releasing the tool from the work surface multiple times, and obtain quick multiple firing strokes (or driving strokes), thereby quickly dispensing multiple fasteners into the working surface at various locations.","There is also an optional \u201crestrictive firing mode,\u201d in which the nose of the tool must be first placed against a working surface before the trigger is pulled. If the sequence of events does not unfold in that manner, then the drive stroke will not occur at all. This is strictly an optional mode that is not used by all users, and certainly in not all situations.","With regard to alternative embodiments of the present invention, an exemplary fastener driving tool can be made with a main storage chamber volume of about twelve cubic inches and a cylinder displacement volume of about 3.75 cubic inches. This would provide a volumetric ratio of the main storage chamber versus the displacement volume of about 3.2:1. As discussed above, it is desirable for the volumetric ratio of the main storage chamber's volume to the displacement volume to be at least 2.0:1, and it could be much higher if desired by the fastener driving tool's designer.","The working pressure in the system could be around 120 PSIG, and should probably be at least 100 PSIG for a quick-firing tool. By the term \u201cworking pressure\u201d the inventors are referring to the pressure in the displacement volume  (and main storage chamber ) at the time the piston  is at its \u201cready\u201d position, which is when it is at (or proximal to) its uppermost travel position as illustrated in .","It should be noted that other gases besides air can be used for the main storage chamber and the displacement volume, if desired. While air will work fine in many or most applications, alternative gases could be used as the \u201ccharge gas,\u201d such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas. Moreover, the use of nitrogen gas can have other benefits during the manufacturing stage, such as for curing certain adhesives, for example.","In the illustrated first embodiment, there is no fill valve on the fastener driving tool  at the storage tank (main storage chamber) . This is a preferred mode of the present invention, although an optional fill valve could be provided, if desired by a tool designer. The design of the preferred mode of the present invention is such that the charge gas should not significantly leak from the tool, and therefore a fill valve would not be required.","Another feature of the present invention is that a variable stroke is possible by causing the rotary-to-linear lifter  to be rotated a multiple number of times to create a shorter or longer firing (driving) stroke, if desired. In the illustrated first embodiment, the lifter  makes a complete rotation two times to lift the piston from its lower-most position to its top-most position. This number of rotations of the lifter could be increased to three times or four times if desired, or even could be decreased to a single turn for a shorter stroke tool, if desired.","Another possible variation is to use a composite sleeve for the internal cylinder wall , which would make contact with the seals of the piston . In addition, the outer pressure vessel wall  could also be made of a composite material, if desired. The use of a carbon fiber composite, for example, would decrease weight, but would maintain the desired strength.","Referring now to , some of the details of a first piston arrangement are illustrated in cross-section for one of the embodiments of the present invention. The piston is depicted at the reference numeral . A piston seal  is near the upper end (in this view) of the piston , and a piston scraper  is near the lower end (in this view) of the piston. A piston guide ring  is located at a central region of the piston, and essentially surrounds that middle portion of the piston.","Referring now to , some of the details of a second piston arrangement are illustrated in cross-section for an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment piston is designated by the reference number . There are upper and lower seals at  and , respectively. Between these seals is an annular space  that is at least partially filled with lubricating fluid, such as oil. This oil will tend to lubricate the movements of the piston  along the inner surface of the alternative cylinder wall . The seals  and  are designed to hold the oil  within the annular space  indefinitely, or at least to lose the oil only at a very slow rate.","Referring now to , the opposite side (compared to ) of the rotary-to-linear lifter  is illustrated. The three pins , , and  are directly seen in this view, and this is the \u201cworking side\u201d of those three pins, which make contact with the teeth  of the driver .  shows the positional relationship of these three pins with respect to the lifter  and the center position for the lifter drive shaft , in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In addition,  shows the semi-circular outer shape of a first part of the perimeter of the lifter at , and the more elliptical outer shape of a second part of the perimeter of the lifter at , as discussed above. The outer shape of the perimeter portions (at  and ) define an outer perimeter of a surface from which these pins , , and  protrude.","Referring now to , a logic flow chart is provided to show some of the important steps used by a system controller for the fastener driving tool  of the illustrated embodiment for the present invention. Starting at an initializing step , a step  loads registers with predetermined values, and a step  loads special function registers with predetermined values. A step  now \u201cchecks\u201d the RAM (Random Access Memory) to be sure it is functioning properly, and then a step  clears the RAM. A step  now loads unused RAM with predetermined values, based on the software coding for the system controller (typically in firmware or hard-coded).","A step  now determines the stability of the system electrical power supply. And then a step  initializes the interrupts that will be used for the controller. The controller is now ready to enter into an operational routine.","At a step , the control logic enters a \u201cFIRST \u201d routine. A decision step  now determines whether or not a \u201cmode\u201d selector switch has been activated. (Note, this mode switch would typically be only an optional feature for a driving tool , and many tools will not include this mode switch at all.) If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step . On the other hand, if the mode selector switch was turned \u201con,\u201d then the logic flow is directed to a step  in which the tool enters a \u201crestrictive fire\u201d routine. The logic flow is directed now to a decision step  that determines if the trigger has been pulled. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step . On the other hand, if the trigger has been pulled, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that will further direct the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP \u201d function (or routine) at step  on . It should be noted that, in the \u201crestrictive fire\u201d mode of operation, the trigger cannot be pulled first; instead the nose of the fastener driving tool must be pushed against the solid surface before the trigger is pulled.","If the answer at step  was NO, the decision step  now determines whether or not the trigger has been pulled. If the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  in which the logic flow enters a \u201cTRIGGER\u201d routine. A step  turns on a \u201cwork light\u201d which is a small electric lamp (e.g., an LED) that illuminates the workpiece where the fastener is to be driven.","A decision step  now determines whether or not a predetermined timeout has occurred, and if the answer is YES, a step  directs the logic flow to a \u201cSTOP \u201d routine, that is illustrated on  at a step . What this actually means is that a user pulled the trigger, but then did not actually use the tool against a solid surface, and rather than having the tool ready and primed to fire a fastener at any moment for an indefinite period of time, a predetermined amount of time will pass (i.e., the \u201ctimeout\u201d interval), and once that has occurred, the system will be basically deactivated in the STOP  mode. This is not a permanent stoppage of the functioning of the tool, but is only temporary. Note that the \u201ctimeouts\u201d are interrupt driven, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.","If the timeout has not occurred at decision step , then a decision step  determines if the safety has been actuated. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed back to the FIRST  routine . On the other hand, if the safety has been actuated at step , then the logic flow is directed to a step  that will send the logic flow to a \u201cDRIVE\u201d routine, which is on  at a step . This will be discussed below in greater detail.","If, either at step  or step , the trigger was not yet pulled, then the logic flow is directed to the decision step . When the logic flow reaches decision step , the logic now determines whether or not the safety has been actuated. This step determines whether or not the safety contact element  has been pressed against a solid object to an extent that actuates the sensor (e.g., limit switch ), which means that the tool is now pressed against a surface where the user intends to place a fastener. If the answer is NO, the logic flow is directed back to the mode switch query at decision step . However, if the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  in which the controller enters a \u201cSAFETY\u201d routine.","Once at the SAFETY routine at step , a step  turns on the \u201cwork light,\u201d which is the same lamp\/LED that was discussed above in reference to step . A decision step  now determines whether or not a timeout has occurred, and if the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  that directs the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP \u201d function at step  on . This temporarily stops the tool from operating. On the other hand, if the timeout has not yet occurred, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines whether the trigger has been pulled. If the answer is NO, the logic flow is directed back to the decision step . On the other hand, if the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  that causes the tool to enter the \u201cDRIVE\u201d mode of operation at step  on .","As can be seen by reviewing the flow chart of , unless the tool  is in the restrictive fire mode (at step ), the tool can be actuated with either one of the two important triggering steps occurring first: i.e., the trigger could be pulled before the safety is actuated, or vice versa.","Referring now to , the logic flow from  is directed to the \u201cDRIVE\u201d routine  from two other steps on : these are step  and step . Once at the DRIVE routine , a switch debounce step  is executed to determine whether or not one or both of the triggering elements was somehow only actuated intermittently. If so, the system designers have determined that the tool should not operate until it is more certain that the input switches have actually been actuated. To do this, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  to determine if the safety is still actuated. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow back to the SAFETY routine at step . On the other hand, if the safety still is actuated at step , then the logic flow is directed to a decision step  to determine if the trigger is still being pulled. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow back to the TRIGGER routine at step .","On the other hand, if decision steps  and  are both answered affirmatively, then a step  clears the operational timers, and the logic flow is then directed to a decision step  that determines if the software code flow is within certain parameters. This is a fault-checking mode of the software itself, and if the system does not determine a satisfactory result, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to a \u201cSTOP\u201d routine at a step  on . This will ultimately turn the tool off and require a safety inspection of the tool, or at least have the tool reset. However, the tool does not need to be completely disabled, and after the safety inspection and tool reset procedure, the tool will be ready to use again without being sent to a service center. In an exemplary mode of the invention, the code flow check step determines if a correct number resides in a register or memory location; this number is the result of being incremented at predetermined executable steps of the software for the system controller.","If the software code flow check is within acceptable parameters at decision step , then the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns on the motor, and then a step  that turns on the solenoid. A step  now starts the solenoid timer and a step  now starts the motor run timer. As will be discussed below, these timers will be periodically checked by the system controller to make sure that certain things have occurred while the solenoid is on and while the motor is running. Otherwise, after a predetermined maximum amount of time, the motor will be turned off and the solenoid will be turned off due to these timers actually timing out, which should not occur if the tool is being used in a normal operation, and if the tool is functioning normally.","In addition to the solenoid and motor run timers discussed above, a \u201cdwell timer\u201d is used to allow the tool to begin its normal operation before any further conditions are checked. This is accomplished by a decision step  on , which causes the logic flow to essentially wait a short amount of time before continuing to the next logic steps.","Once the dwell timer has finished at step , the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines if the solenoid \u201con time\u201d has been exceeded. If the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns off the solenoid. This situation does not necessarily mean the tool is being misused or is not functioning properly, and therefore the logic flow does not travel to a \u201cstop step\u201d from the step . Instead, the logic flow is directed to a decision step , discussed below.","If the solenoid on time has not been exceeded, then the logic flow also is directed to the decision step , which determines if the cam limit switch has received a first signal. This is the limit switch  that detects the presence or absence of the fourth pin  of the lifter. If the tool of the illustrated embodiment is being used, the lifter  will make two complete rotations when lifting the driver and piston from their bottom-most positions to their top-most positions. Therefore, the cam limit switch  will receive two different signals during this lift. Step  determines if the first signal has occurred. If not, then a decision step  determines whether the motor timeout has occurred. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed back to decision step . On the other hand, if the motor run timer has indeed timed out, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to a \u201cSTOP\u201d routine at step . This would likely indicate that there is a problem with the tool, or a problem with the way the user is attempting to operate the tool.","Referring back to decision step , if the first signal from the cam has occurred, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns off the solenoid. This will allow the latch  to engage the teeth  of the driver , in case there has been some type of jam, or other type of unusual operation while the driver and piston are being lifted. It also allows the latch  eventually to properly engage the bottom-most tooth  of the driver, which is the normal operation once the driver and piston have been raised to their top-most (or firing) position.","The logic flow is now directed to a decision step  that determines whether a second signal has been received from the cam limit switch. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines whether or not the motor run timer has timed out. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed back to decision step . On the other hand, if the motor timer has timed out, the logic flow is directed to a step  that directs the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP\u201d routine at , and indicates that there is some type of problem.","Once decision step  determines that the second signal from the cam has been received, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns off the motor, then to a step  that starts a \u201creset\u201d timeout referred to as \u201call switches on.\u201d In this mode, it is either assumed that both the actuation (input) devices are still actuated, or at least that the controller needs to make an examination of those input devices to see what the proper status of the tool should be. Accordingly, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines if the safety is still actuated. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that then sends the logic flow to the \u201cFIRST \u201d routine at step  on . On the other hand if the safety is still actuated, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines if the trigger is still pulled. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that also directs the logic flow to the \u201cFIRST \u201d step at  on . Finally, if the trigger is still pulled, then a decision step  determines whether or not a \u201creset\u201d timeout has occurred, and if the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP \u201d routine at step  on . If the reset timeout has not yet occurred at step , then the logic flow is directed back to the decision step  and the inspection of all of the switches will again be performed.","The logic flow is continued on , in which there are two different types of stop routines. The routine called \u201cSTOP\u201d at step  will first turn off the motor at a step , turn off the solenoid at a step , and turn off the work light at a step . The STOP routine will then clear the timers at a step . The logic flow then becomes a \u201cDO-Loop,\u201d and continues back to the STOP routine at step . This is a fault mode, and the tool must be inspected. As a minimum, it needs to be reset to terminate the DO-Loop processing of the software, which means that the battery must be disconnected from the tool. If the user has been using the tool properly, this may be an indication that there is some operational problem with the tool itself, or that a fastener perhaps has jammed somewhere in the tool and the operator did not notice that fact.","The other type of STOP routine is the \u201cSTOP \u201d routine at step . Once that occurs, a step  turns off the motor, turn off the solenoid at a step , and turn off the work light at a step . The STOP  routine will then clear the timers at a step , and a decision step  determines whether or not the trigger is still pulled. If the answer is YES, then the logic flow is directed back to the STOP  routine at step . If the trigger is not pulled at step , the logic flow is then directed to a decision step  that determines if the safety is still actuated. If YES, the logic flow is directed back to the STOP  routine at step . However, if the safety is not actuated, the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to the \u201cFIRST \u201d routine at step  on . At this point, the tool has been successfully used, and is ready for the next firing (driving) actuation.","Referring now to , a second embodiment of a fastener driving tool is generally designated by the reference numeral . Tool  is mainly designed to linearly drive fasteners such as nails and staples. Tool  includes a handle portion , a fastener driver portion , a fastener magazine portion , and a fastener exit portion .","A \u201cright\u201d outer cover or \u201chousing\u201d of the driver portion is indicated at . A \u201ctop\u201d cover is indicated at , while a \u201cfront\u201d outer cover of the driver portion is indicated at . A \u201crear\u201d cover for the handle portion is indicated at  (which is also the battery pack cover), while a \u201crear\u201d cover of the magazine portion is indicated at . It will be understood that the various directional nomenclature provided above is with respect to the illustration of , and the second embodiment fastener driving tool  can be used in many other angular positions, without departing from the principles of the present invention.","The area of the second embodiment tool  in which a fastener is released is indicated approximately by the reference numeral , which is the \u201cbottom\u201d of the fastener exit portion of tool . Before the tool is actuated, a safety contact element  extends beyond the bottom  of the fastener exit, and this extension of the safety contact element is depicted at , which is the bottom or \u201cfront\u201d portion of the safety contact element. Other elements that are depicted in  include an upper guide body  and a front cover ; the upper guide body generally is in mechanical communication with the magazine portion .","Reference numeral  indicates a magazine housing, while reference numeral  indicates a fastener track through which the individual fasteners run while they remain within the magazine portion . A feeder carriage  (see ) is used to feed an individual fastener from the magazine into the drive mechanism area, and a back plate  is used to carry an individual fastener while it is being driven. In the illustrated embodiment, the feeder carriage  positions a fastener to a position within the upper guide body  that is coincident with the path of the driver member  (see ), so that when the driver  moves through a driving stroke, its driving end will basically intercept the fastener and carry that fastener to the exit end of the tool , essentially at the bottom portion  of the tool's exit area.","The second embodiment fastener driving tool  also includes a motor  (see ) which acts as a prime mover for the tool, and which has an output that drives a gearbox  (see ). An output shaft  (see ) of the gearbox drives a lifter drive shaft  (see ). A solenoid  (see ) is included in tool , and further details of its operation are discussed below. A battery  is attached near the rear of the handle portion , and this battery provides electrical power for the motor  as well as for a control system.","A printed circuit board (see ) that contains a controller is generally designated by the reference numeral , and is placed within the handle portion  in this embodiment. A trigger switch  (see ) is activated by a trigger actuator . As can been seen by viewing , the handle portion  is designed for gripping by a human hand, and the trigger actuator  is designed for linear actuation by a person's finger while gripping the handle portion . Trigger switch  provides an input to the control system .","A three-position selector switch, acting as a \u201cmode\u201d control switch, is mounted on tool  at . This switch  allows the user (the tool's operator) to select an operating \u201cMode A\u201d or an operating \u201cMode B\u201d, or to turn the tool OFF. These operating modes are described in detail below, and in conjunction with logic flow charts in the drawings.","There also are one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs)  mounted on tool , which provides an indication as to certain functions of the tool. This is described below in greater detail, in the description of the logic flow charts. There are also other input devices for the controller, however those input devices are not seen in .","The controller at  will typically include a microprocessor or a microcomputer device that acts as a processing circuit. At least one memory circuit will also typically be part of the controller, including Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) devices. To store user-inputted information (if applicable for a particular tool model), a non-volatile memory device would typically be included, such as EEPROM, NVRAM, or a Flash memory device.","Referring now to  (which are similar to ), a working cylinder subassembly is designated by the reference numeral , and this is included as part of the fastener driver portion . The working cylinder  includes a cylinder wall , and within this cylinder wall  is a movable piston . Further details of this piston arrangement are illustrated in , described below. Surrounding the cylinder wall , in the illustrated second embodiment, is a main storage chamber  (also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cpressure vessel storage space\u201d) and an outer pressure vessel wall  (which corresponds to the \u201cfront\u201d cover  of , along the right portion of this view). At the top (as seen in these views) of the fastener driver portion  is an upper end portion at  for the cylinder mechanism.","Also within the fastener driver portion  are mechanisms that will actually drive a fastener into a solid object. This includes a driver , a cylinder \u201cventing chamber\u201d  beneath the piston  (which would typically always be at atmospheric pressure), a driver track (not seen in this view; however, see  at ), a rotary-to-linear lifter , and a latch . The driver  is also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cdriver member\u201d and the rotary-to-lifter  is also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201clifter member,\u201d or simply as a \u201clifter.\u201d Driver  is rather elongated, and as an individual element can best be seen in . There are multiple \u201cteeth\u201d  that are positioned along the driver. In the illustrated embodiment, these teeth  are spaced-apart not only in a transverse direction from the elongated centerline of driver , but they are also spaced-apart from one another along the outer longitudinal edges of the driver . The positions of teeth  are clearly illustrated in .","It will be understood that the precise positions for the teeth  and  could be different from those illustrated for the driver  or , without departing from the principles of the present invention. It will also be understood that the precise shapes of teeth  and  could be different from those illustrated for the driver  or , without departing from the principles of the present invention. It will be further understood that the longitudinal edges of the driver elements  and  do not necessarily have to be linear or straight, although a straight edge is probably the simplest to construct and use. Moreover, the longitudinal edges of the driver elements  and  do not necessarily need to be parallel to one another, or parallel to the longitudinal axis of the driver itself, although again, such parallel construction is probably the simplest to build and use.","There is a cylinder base  that mainly separates the gas pressure portions of the fastener driver portion  from the mechanical portions of that driver portion . The venting of air from the cylinder venting chamber  passes through the cylinder base , as seen at a vent  on . The mechanical portions of  begin with a rotary-to-linear lifter  which was briefly mentioned above, along with a lifter drive shaft . Drive shaft  protrudes through the center portions of the fastener driver portion  and through the center of the lifter , and this shaft is used to rotate the lifter, as desired by the control system. (See also .)","Lifter  can be designed with an entirely circular outer perimeter, or it can have a different shape. In the first embodiment of , lifter  was arcuate and portions of its perimeter exhibited an eccentric shape of a cam (see ). A portion of the lifter's outer perimeter was mainly circular for about half of a circle (designated by the reference numeral ), but the other half of the lifter's outer perimeter was more eccentric, which provided an elliptical surface (designated by the reference numeral ). In the second embodiment of , the outer shape of lifter  is still illustrated as half-circular and half-eccentric. However, it will be understood that the lifter's exact outer shape is not important, so long as it provides a base to hold in place certain protrusions (or \u201cpins\u201d) that will make physical contact with teeth on the driver , but in a manner that creates a discontinuous contact surface with those teeth. This will be discussed below in greater detail. (See, for Example, .)","The rotary-to-linear lifter  includes three cylindrical protrusions (or \u201cextensions\u201d) that will also be referred to herein as \u201cpins.\u201d The first such pin (\u201cpin \u201d) is designated , the second pin (\u201cpin \u201d) is designated , while the third pin (\u201cpin \u201d) is designated . (See, .) These pins are mainly not visible on , since they face away from the viewer of this .","It should be noted that  do not show a \u201cboss portion\u201d of the three pins , , and , (as did pins , , and  on ), since such boss portions of the pins , ,  are not entirely necessary for the proper functioning of the rotary-to-linear lifter . Instead, the surface of the lifter  may be perfectly smooth (e.g., flat) at those locations rather than exhibiting a \u201cboss.\u201d","It should be understood that the \u201cworking side\u201d of these three pins , , and  is on the opposite side of the lifter  in the view of . When discussing these pins , , and  with respect to  in this written description, it is with reference to the non-protruding side of those pins; however, the effects of the \u201cworking side\u201d of those pins is discussed in some detail with respect to other structures that are also illustrated on .","It should also be noted that pins , , an  are illustrated as having circular cross-sectional shapes, which is desirable for this embodiment, although other cross-sectional shapes could instead be used without departing from the principles of the present invention. For example, the pins could have a smooth arcuate outer surface along the portions that will come into contact with the protrusions or \u201cteeth\u201d of the lifter , and the remaining portion of the outer surface of the pins could exhibit a sharp angular cut-off edge, that for example, would have the appearance of a slice of pie. This alternative shape can apply both to the pins , , and  of the first embodiment and to the pins , , and  of the second embodiment, without departing from the principles of the present invention. Moreover, the pins do not necessarily need to protrude from the lifter surface at right angles.","In the first embodiment of , there was a fourth cylindrical pin (\u201cpin \u201d) that protruded from the opposite side of the lifter , designated pin . In this second embodiment of , there is no fourth pin at all. Instead a small permanent magnet at  is placed in the lifter . A Hall effect sensor (described below) is used to sense the movements of this magnet , and thus the movements of lifter .","The latch  that was briefly noted above is depicted on , and has a latch shaft  protruding therethrough, and this shaft rotates the latch  as determined by the controller. Latch  includes a latch \u201ccatching surface\u201d at  (see ), and this will be more fully explained below.","In , the piston  depicted at or near its uppermost or top-most position (in this view), and a gas pressure chamber  can be seen above the top-most area of the piston, near the top piston seal  (see ). It will be understood that the gas pressure chamber  and the main storage chamber (or storage space)  are in fluidic communication with one another. It will also be understood that the portion to the interior of the cylinder wall  forms a displacement volume that is created by the stroke of the piston . In other words, the gas pressure chamber  is not a fixed volume, but this chamber will vary in volume as the piston  moves up and down (as seen in ). As noted above, this type of mechanical arrangement is often referred to as a \u201cdisplacement volume,\u201d and that terminology will mainly be used herein for this non-fixed volume .","In , the piston  is piston is depicted at or near its bottom-most travel position (in this view), and a gas pressure chamber  can be seen above the top-most area of the piston. It will be understood that the gas pressure chamber  and the main storage chamber (or storage space)  are in fluidic communication with one another. It will also be understood that the portion to the interior of the cylinder wall  forms a displacement volume that is created by the stroke of the piston . In other words, the gas pressure chamber  is not a fixed volume, but this chamber will vary in volume as the piston  moves up and down. This type of mechanical arrangement is often referred to as a \u201cdisplacement volume,\u201d and that terminology will mainly be used herein for this non-fixed volume .","It will be further understood that the main storage chamber  preferably comprises a fixed volume, which typically would make it less expensive to manufacture; however, it is not an absolute requirement that the main storage chamber actually be of a fixed volume. It would be possible to allow a portion of this chamber  to deform in size and\/or shape so that the size of its volume would actually change, during operation of the present invention, without departing from the principles of the present invention.","In the illustrated embodiment for the second embodiment fastener driving tool , the main storage chamber  substantially surrounds the working cylinder . Moreover, the main storage chamber  is annular in shape, and it is basically co-axial with the cylinder . This is a preferred configuration of the illustrated second embodiment, but it will be understood that alternative physical arrangements could be designed without departing from the principles of the present invention.","For example,  illustrates a fastener driver mechanism  in which a main storage chamber  is not co-axial with a working cylinder  of the fastener driving tool, which is generally designated by the reference numeral . In other words, storage chamber  does not substantially surround the working cylinder , and instead is located off to one side of this working cylinder. This arrangement allows for various physical component arrangements of the tool , and offers a different possible center of mass, which might be advantageous for some special applications.","In , the main storage chamber  has an outer pressure vessel wall , and the working cylinder  has a cylinder wall . These two spaces  and  are pneumatically in communication with one another by way of a passageway , near the top (in this view) of the working cylinder, at . Within cylinder wall  is a movable piston  (not visible in this view), which can be constructed in a similar manner to the movable piston  illustrated in , described above. Also within the fastener driver portion  is a driver member  (not visible in this view), which can be constructed in a similar manner to the driver  illustrated in , and described above.","A cylinder base  separates the gas pressure portions of the fastener driver portion  from the mechanical portions of that fastener driver portion . The tool  can include a handle portion (not shown), a fastener magazine portion  (not shown), and a fastener exit portion . The remaining parts of tool  can be very similar, or identical, to other parts of the second embodiment tool , illustrated in .","Referring again to , the piston  is depicted near or at its bottom-most travel position, and in this configuration, the displacement volume  and the main storage chamber  are at their largest combined volumes, while the cylinder venting chamber  is at its minimum volume. This bottom position is also sometimes referred to herein as the \u201cdriven position.\u201d In , movable piston  is now in contact with the stationary piston stop , which is why the cylinder venting chamber  is at its minimum (or zero) volume. In , the driver  is also at its bottom-most travel position, and its lower-most tip can be seen extending out the exit port at the bottom of a lower guide body .","In , the rotary-to-linear lifter  and the latch  are in their respective positions at the end of a firing (driving) stroke, and the latch  has its latching surface  in a location that will not interfere with the teeth  of the driver . This is necessary so that the driver  can make a driving stroke from its top-most position to its bottom-most position (see also, ). However, the latch  will later be slightly rotated by the latch shaft  (which is spring-loaded) so that its catching surface  will be able to interfere with the teeth .","In the configuration depicted on , the fastener driving tool  has been used to drive a fastener, and the tool now must cause the driver  to be \u201clifted\u201d back to its top-most position for a new firing (driving) stroke. This is accomplished by rotating the lifter , which is actuated by the motor , through its gearbox , etc.","As rotary-to-linear lifter  rotates counterclockwise (as seen in ) at least one of its pins , , or  will come into contact with one of the teeth  along the left side (as seen in ) of the driver . This will cause the driver  to be \u201clifted\u201d upward (as seen in ) in a \u201creturn\u201d stroke. As the lifter  rotates, one of the teeth  will be in contact with one of the rotating pins , ,  throughout a portion of the rotational travel of the lifter, and the \u201cnext\u201d pin will then come into contact with the \u201cnext\u201d tooth  so that the driver  continues to be moved upward. This lifting procedure will continue until the controller determines that the driver has been moved to its proper position for a new driving stroke. When this occurs, the latch , which is spring-loaded, will have its latch catching surface  in a proper location to \u201ccatch\u201d the closest tooth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver , thereby preventing the driver from falling downward for any significant distance. After this occurs, the \u201cnext\u201d lifter pin (which will be the pin ) will then come along and again make contact with one of the teeth  along the left-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver , thereby continuing to lift the driver toward the top (as seen in ) of the cylinder .","In the illustrated embodiment of the second embodiment fastener driving tool , the rotary-to-linear lifter  makes two complete rotations to lift the driver  from its bottom-most position to its top-most position. (The upper position is also sometimes referred to herein as the \u201cready position.\u201d) At the end of the second rotation, the parts will be configured as illustrated in . The piston  will again be near the top of the cylinder , and the combined volumes of the main storage chamber  and displacement volume  have now been reduced to a smaller volume, which means their gases are under a greater pressure, since the gas that was above the piston and in chamber  was compressed during the lift of the driver. (As noted above, the actual volume of the main storage chamber  does not change in the illustrated embodiment.) During the lift of the driver, the latch  was \u201cengaged\u201d with the teeth , however, the latch has a smooth surface in one direction that allows the teeth  to push the latch out of the way during the upward lift of the driver. This is much like a ratchet-type action, remembering that the latch is spring-loaded (and thus has a mechanical bias) so as to act in this manner.","At the end of the piston's normal upward movement, the \u201clast\u201d tooth along the right-hand side (as best seen in ) of the driver  is engaged with the latch catching surface , and so latch  now prevents the driver from being moved downward (as seen in this view). (This is similar to the arrangement of components depicted in , for the first embodiment.) The third pin  is still in contact with the lower-most tooth  along the left-hand side of the driver , at this point in the rotational travel of the rotary-to-linear lifter . There is a sensor which, in the illustrated embodiment, is a Hall effect sensor  (see ) that detects the rotational movements of the lifter . This sensor detects the magnet , as discussed below in greater detail.","When the sensor  detects the magnet  a first time (in this second embodiment), the control system turns off the solenoid , which will then allow the latch  to engage the right-hand teeth (in these views) of the lifter . Note that the solenoid can also be turned off earlier during the lift, if desired. When sensor  detects this magnet  a second time (in the second embodiment), the current to the motor  is turned off, and the motor thus is de-energized and stops the lifting action of the driver . As described herein, the solenoid  acts as a latch actuator.","In the second illustrated embodiment tool , the latch surface  is not in contact with the driver teeth  when the driver  has been moved to its \u201cready\u201d position. In this second illustrated embodiment, the gearbox  has an attribute by which it essentially is self-locking from its output side (i.e., from its output shaft ), and this prevents the lifter  from allowing the driver  to move \u201cbackward,\u201d which is the \u201cdown\u201d direction in . Therefore, the driver\/piston subassembly will not drift downward a small distance, and thus, the driver teeth  do not come into contact with the latch, even in view of the gas pressure above piston  (in the space ).","At the \u201cready\u201d position for the driver , the latch  may be positioned such that it would interfere with the driver teeth  (i.e., in an \u201cinterfering position\u201d) as a safety feature (i.e., in which the latch surface  would \u201ccatch\u201d the teeth  of the driver , if the driver somehow would move downward). However, the gearbox\/lifter combination does not allow the \u201clast tooth\u201d  to contact that latch  at this point in the tool's operation.","This is the position illustrated in  of the second embodiment tool, and this configuration is considered to be the \u201crest\u201d position of the tool . Although the gas pressure in the combined main storage chamber  and displacement volume  is at its maximum, the gearbox prevents the driver  from being moved further downward (in this view), so the piston\/driver combination is essentially locked in this position until something else occurs. In a preferred mode of the invention, the pressure vessel may be pressurized at about 130 PSIG to 140 PSIG, just before a driving stroke.","It should be noted that, for the second embodiment tool , the gearbox can be of yet another alternative construction. For example, instead of being self-locking from its output side, a \u201cregular\u201d gearbox could be used if provided with a \u201cone-way\u201d feature, such as an adjacent one-way clutch (or a one-way clutch constructed therewithin). In this manner, the driver  would still be prevented from moving down (in ) and contacting the latch surface , just before a driving stroke.","When it is time to drive a fastener, the next action in the illustrated second embodiment is to cause the motor  to become energized once again, so that the lifter  rotates further in its original direction. This occurs by two independent actions by the user: in some modes of the invention, these two independent actions can occur in either order. (There is also an optional \u201crestrictive mode\u201d of operation, in which the two independent actions must occur in a specific order.) These two actions are: pressing the nose  of the safety contact element  against a solid surface, and depressing the trigger actuator . The trigger actuator will cause the trigger switch  to change state, which is one condition that will start sending current to the motor . The safety contact element  has an upper arm  (see ) that will be moved as the nose  is pushed into the tool , and this upper arm  will actuate another sensor which, in the illustrated embodiment, is a small limit switch  (see ).","When both of these actions occur simultaneously, current is delivered to the motor  which will once again turn the rotary-to-linear lifter  a short distance. Also, the controller energizes the solenoid , which rotates the latch  a small angular distance clockwise (as seen in ) to move the latch catching surface  from an interfering position, so that the latch will not prevent the driver  from moving downward when it is correctly time for a driving stroke. Therefore, the \u201clast\u201d tooth  of driver  (as seen in ) would not \u201ccatch\u201d on this latch catching surface. Note that  show details of the same structure depicted in  at different perspective angles.","Now that all this has occurred, the latch  is in its disengaged position so that its catching surface  will not interfere with any of the teeth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver ; and none of the three \u201cworking\u201d pins of the lifter  will interfere with those left-hand teeth . Once the driver tooth  \u201cdrops off\u201d the last lifting pin , the driver  is quickly thrust downward in a driving stroke, due to the high gas pressure within the main storage chamber  and displacement volume . (This is the \u201cgas spring\u201d effect.) Along the way, the driver  will pick up a fastener that is waiting at the feeder carriage , and drive that fastener along the back plate  to the exit area at the bottom (at the area  on ). After this action has occurred, the driver  will be situated at its lower-most position, as viewed in .","The pressure of the gas in the combined main storage chamber  and displacement volume  is sufficiently high to quickly force the driver  downward, and such pneumatic means is typically much faster than a nail driving gun that uses exclusively mechanical means (such as a spring) for driving a fastener. This is due to the \u201cgas spring\u201d effect caused by the high gas pressure within the main storage chamber  and displacement volume  that, once the driver is released, can quickly and easily move the driver  in a downward stroke.","As the driver  is being moved downward, the piston  and the movable piston stop  are forcing air (or possibly some other gas) out of the cylinder venting chamber  that is below the piston. This volume of air is moved through a vent to atmosphere , and it is desired that this be a low resistance passageway, so as to not further impede the movement of the piston and driver during their downward stroke. The gas above the piston is not vented to atmosphere, but instead remains within the displacement volume , which is also in fluidic communication with the main storage chamber .","One aspect of the present invention is to provide a rather large storage space or volume to hold the pressurized gas that is also used to drive the piston downward during a driving stroke of the driver . There is a fluidic passage  between the upper portion of the cylinder and the main storage chamber . (In the illustrated second embodiment, the cylinder wall  does not extend all the way to the top end region .) It is preferred that the volume of the main storage chamber be larger than the total volume of the cylinder working spaces (i.e., the displacement volume) by a volumetric ratio of at least 2.0:1, and more preferably at least 3.0:1. This will allow for a powerful stroke, and a quick stroke; moreover, it provides for an efficient operating air spring.","The illustrated second embodiment of the present invention allows for both a quick firing (or driving) stroke time and also a fairly quick \u201clifting\u201d time to bring the driver back to its upper position, ready for the next firing (driving) stroke. Both of these mechanical actions can sequentially occur in less than 340 milliseconds (combined time), and allow a user to quickly place fasteners into a surface. In one operating mode of the present invention, the human user can hold the trigger in the engaged position and quickly place a fastener at a desired location merely by pressing the nose (or \u201cbottom\u201d) of the tool against the working surface to actuate the fastener driver and place the fastener. Then the user can quickly remove the fastener driver tool from that surface, and move it to a second position along the work surface, while still depressing the trigger the entire time, and then press the nose (or bottom) of the tool against the working surface at a different position, and it will drive a fastener at that \u201cdifferent\u201d position. This is referred to as a \u201cbottom fire\u201d capability, and when using the illustrated embodiment it can occur virtually as fast as a human can place the tool against a surface, then pick up the tool and accurately place it against the surface at a different position, and thereby repeat these steps as often as desired until emptying the magazine of fasteners. This type of mode of operation will be discussed in greater detail below in connection with the logic flow chart starting at , with respect to the control system of the fastener driving tool .","Referring now to , another side sectional view is provided that shows some of the elements beneath the latch and other portions of the second embodiment fastener driving tool . There are two limit switches  and . The limit switch  is a Hall-effect sensor that detects movements of the magnet  of the rotary-to-linear lifter  (as noted above). The limit switch  is a small electromechanical limit switch that detects movement of the upper arm , which is a portion of the safety contact element  that is pushed rearward (or \u201cup\u201d in these views) with respect to the overall tool  when the nose of the tool is pressed against a working surface. These limit switches provide electrical input signals to the controller, which is discussed below in greater detail. It will be understood that other types of sensors could be used instead of electromechanical limit switches or Hall-effect switches, such as optoelectronic sensors, or magnetic sensors, or even a metal-sensing proximity switch.","Also viewed on  is a return spring , which causes the safety contact element  to be pushed back downward (in this view) once the user releases the nose of the tool  from the working surface. In addition, there is a depth of drive adjustment at .","As generally indicated on  at a reference numeral , the driver  may be driven toward the exit end by a type of driver actuation device other than a gas spring. For example, the driver member  could have a top circular area  that is forced downward (in this view) by a mechanical spring , which could be a fast-acting coil spring, for example, thereby also causing driver  to move downward (in this view). Or an alternative driver actuation device could use a different type of mechanical force, for example, applied by compressed foam (in the area at ). In such alternative embodiments, there would be no need for a cylinder at all, and instead the spring  (or other device at ) would merely need a mechanical guide to keep it moving in a correct motion.","Further alternative ways to force the driver  of  to move in a driving stroke toward the exit end are the use of a fast-acting motor, or the use of a compressed gas valve (releasing compressed air into a cylinder against, for example, a piston  instead of the circular area ), or perhaps a pressurized liquid valve (releasing pressurized hydraulic fluid into a cylinder against the piston , for example). If a piston  is used with compressed gas or pressurized liquid, then a cylinder (not shown) would also be added to the unit of , instead of merely using a mechanical guide.","Referring now to , further details of the solenoid are viewed. In , the solenoid  has a plunger  that will move linearly either in or out from the main coil body of the solenoid . When the solenoid is energized, it pulls the plunger  in toward the solenoid body , which rotates a solenoid arm  (part of the solenoid's \u201clinkage\u201d), which in turn rotates the latch shaft  that also rotates the latch  a small arcuate distance. This causes the latch  to disengage from an interfering position with the driver . On the other hand, when the solenoid  becomes de-energized, the plunger will be pushed out by the plunger spring , which will rotate the solenoid arm  a short distance, and that in turn rotates the latch shaft  and the latch . This will tend to cause the latch to engage the teeth  along the right-hand side (as seen in ) of the driver . However, since this is a spring action, the teeth  can slide against the surface of the latch  and move the latch out of the way if the teeth are attempting to move upward along with the driver . However, the spring action of the solenoid plunger spring will be strong enough to push the latch  into its engaged position, and any teeth  attempting to move downward will be caught by the catching surface  of the latch .","This \u201ccatching\u201d action of the latch  has more than one benefit. In the first place, the latch remains in its interfering position as the piston  is lifted to its top or \u201cfiring\u201d position. The driver  cannot be fired until the latch  is moved out of the way, as discussed above. On the other hand, if there is some type of jam or an improper use of the tool by a user such that the driver  does not totally complete its travel during a firing (driving) stroke, the latch  will also prevent a misfire from occurring at an inconvenient time.","More specifically, if the driver jams during a driving stroke, and if a person tries to clear the jam, and if there was no precaution taken to prevent the remainder of the stroke from occurring at that moment, then possibly an injury could occur when the driver  suddenly becomes released from its jammed condition. In other words, a fastener could be driven during the attempt to clear the jam, and that fastener would likely be directed somewhere that is not the original target surface. In the present invention, the latch  will have its solenoid  become de-energized once the jam occurs (because solenoid  will de-energize after a \u201ctimeout\u201d interval occurs), and therefore the latch  will be engaged and the catching surface  will be in a position to interfere with the downward movement of the driver teeth . By use of this configuration, the driver could only move a short distance even if the jam was suddenly cleared, because the latch catching surface  will literally \u201ccatch\u201d the \u201cnext\u201d tooth  that unexpectedly comes along during a downward travel of the driver . This makes the tool much safer in situations where a complete driving stroke has not occurred.","The process for controlling the solenoid and the moments when the solenoid will either be energized or de-energized are discussed below in connection with the flow chart that begins on .","It will be understood that the latch  or  could be controlled by a device other than a solenoid, without departing from the principles of the present invention. For example, the solenoid  or  could be replaced by motor, or some type of air or hydraulic valve, if desired. Moreover, the latch action could be linear rather than rotational (pivotable), if desired.","With respect to various types of firing (or driving) modes, a \u201ctrigger fire\u201d mode is where the user first presses the tool nose against a working surface, and then depresses the trigger actuator . It is the trigger being depressed that causes the driving stroke to occur in this situation. With respect to a \u201cbottom fire\u201d mode, the trigger is actuated first, and then the user presses the nose of the tool against a work surface, and it is the work surface contact that causes the driving stroke to occur. As discussed above, the user can continue to hold the trigger down while pressing against and releasing the tool from the work surface multiple times, and obtain quick multiple firing strokes (or driving strokes), thereby quickly dispensing multiple fasteners into the working surface at various locations.","There is also an optional \u201crestrictive firing mode,\u201d in which the nose of the tool must be first placed against a working surface before the trigger is pulled. If the sequence of events does not unfold in that manner, then the driving stroke will not occur at all. This is strictly an optional mode that is not used by all users, and certainly in not all situations.","With regard to alternative embodiments of the present invention second embodiment, an exemplary fastener driving tool can be made with a main storage chamber volume of about 11.25 cubic inches and a cylinder displacement volume of about 3.75 cubic inches. This would provide a volumetric ratio of the main storage chamber versus the displacement volume of about 3.0:1. As discussed above, it is desirable for the volumetric ratio of the main storage chamber's volume to the displacement volume to be at least 2.0:1, and it could be much higher if desired by the fastener driving tool's designer.","The working pressure in the system could be around 120 PSIG, and should probably be at least 100 PSIG for a quick-firing tool. By the term \u201cworking pressure\u201d the inventors are referring to the pressure in the displacement volume  (and main storage chamber ) at the time the piston  is at its \u201cready\u201d position, which is when it is at (or proximal to) its uppermost travel position.","It should be noted that other gases besides air can be used for the main storage chamber and the displacement volume, if desired. While air will work fine in many or most applications, alternative gases could be used as the \u201ccharge gas,\u201d such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas. Moreover, the use of nitrogen gas can have other benefits during the manufacturing stage, such as for curing certain adhesives, for example.","In the illustrated second embodiment, there is no fill valve on the fastener driving tool  at the storage tank (main storage chamber) . This is a preferred mode of the present invention, although an optional fill valve could be provided, if desired by a tool designer. The design of the preferred mode of the present invention is such that the charge gas should not significantly leak from the tool, and therefore a fill valve would not be required.","Another feature of the present invention is that a variable stroke is possible by causing the rotary-to-linear lifter  to be rotated a multiple number of times to create a shorter or longer firing (driving) stroke, if desired. In the illustrated second embodiment, the lifter  makes a complete rotation two times to lift the piston from its lower-most position to its top-most position. This number of rotations of the lifter could be increased to three times or four times if desired, or even could be decreased to a single turn for a shorter stroke tool, if desired.","Another possible variation is to use a composite sleeve for the internal cylinder wall , which would make contact with the seals of the piston . In addition, the outer pressure vessel wall  could also be made of a composite material, if desired. The use of a carbon fiber composite, for example, would decrease weight, but would maintain the desired strength.","Referring now to , some of the details of the piston arrangement are illustrated in cross-section for the second embodiment  of the present invention. This piston is designated by the reference number . There are upper and lower seals at  and , respectively. Between these seals is an annular space  that is at least partially filled with lubricating fluid, such as oil. This oil will tend to lubricate the movements of the piston  along the inner surface of the cylinder wall . Part of the piston mechanism of this embodiment includes a piston scraper .","The seals  and  are designed to hold the oil  within the annular space  indefinitely, or at least to lose the oil only at a very slow rate. In a preferred mode of the invention, the seals have a \u201cslick\u201d coating material to provide a long operational life. In the illustrated embodiment, an exemplary material for this coating is XYLAN\u2122, which is a TEFLON\u2122 material that includes molybdenum powder.","The driver element  of tool  and the driver element  of tool  both retract into their respective working cylinder areas  and . This is a unique arrangement, in that some of the driver's latching protrusions (or \u201cteeth\u201d)  and  also retract into the working cylinder areas  and . This is made possible by the positioning of the respective lifters  and , and by the shapes of the driver elements  and , and also by the sealing arrangement of the pistons  and , discussed in the previous paragraphs.","It will be understood that the fastener magazine portion  of tool  and the fastener magazine portion  of the tool  are essentially optional features. In other words, the fastener driving tools  and  could be constructed to act as \u201csingle-shot\u201d devices, and no magazine would be provided for such a tool. Alternatively, the tools  and  could be provided with a standard detachable magazine, but the tools themselves could also be constructed to work in a \u201csingle-shot mode\u201d such that a single fastener is placed in the tool  or , near its front end or tip (e.g., near ) and that single fastener is then driven by tool  or . In this mode, the magazine  or  could be dismounted from the tool  or  during the single-shot procedure; later, the magazine  or  could be re-mounted to the tool  or , and the collated fasteners in the magazine could then be driven by the tool, as desired by the user.","Referring now to , an alternative embodiment rotary-to-linear lifter is illustrated, generally designated by the reference numeral . Lifter  has only a single protrusion (or \u201cpin\u201d) at , and the lifter  rotates about a pivot axis at . The outer perimeter shape of lifter  is mainly arcuate at , and only comprises a small sector of a full circle. Yet lifter  can achieve the goals of the present invention, in that its protrusion  will provide a discontinuous contact surface with the \u201cteeth\u201d of a driver element, such as the driver  or driver .

Starting at an initializing step , a step  loads registers with predetermined values, and a step  loads special function registers with predetermined values. A step  now \u201cchecks\u201d the RAM (Random Access Memory) to be sure it is functioning properly, and then a step  clears the RAM. A step  now loads unused RAM with predetermined values, based on the software coding for the system controller (typically in firmware or hard-coded).","A step  now determines the stability of the system electrical power supply. Then a step  causes an electrical output to blink one or more LEDs (light-emitting diodes)  on tool , so the user is made aware that the tool  has entered its \u201cstartup\u201d mode of operation.

Step  also determines if the trigger  has been pulled. If the answer is YES for either of these questions, then the logic flow is directed to a step .

This three-position switch  is part of an exemplary arrangement of the second embodiment of the fastener driving tool , and in this description of the second tool embodiment, Mode A and Mode B are also referred to as a \u201cRestrictive Mode,\u201d and a \u201cContact Actuation Mode.\u201d","If the current operating mode is not the RESTRICTIVE mode, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step . On the other hand, if the current mode is the RESTRICTIVE mode, then the logic flow is directed to a step  in which the tool enters a \u201crestrictive fire\u201d routine. The logic flow is directed now to a decision step  that determines if the trigger has been pulled. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step . On the other hand, if the trigger has been pulled, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that will further direct the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP \u201d function (or routine) at a step  on . It should be noted that, in the \u201crestrictive fire\u201d mode of operation, the trigger cannot be pulled first; instead the nose of the fastener driving tool must be pushed against the solid surface before the trigger is pulled.

What this actually means is that a user pulled the trigger, but then did not actually use the tool against a solid surface, and rather than having the tool ready and primed to fire a fastener at any moment for an indefinite period of time, a predetermined amount of time will pass (i.e., the \u201ctimeout\u201d interval), and once that has occurred, the system will be basically deactivated in the STOP  mode. This is not a permanent stoppage of the functioning of the tool, but is only temporary. Note that the \u201ctimeouts\u201d are interrupt driven, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.","If the timeout has not occurred at decision step , then a decision step  determines if the safety has been actuated.

Once at the DRIVE routine , a switch debounce step  is executed to determine whether or not one or both of the triggering elements was somehow only actuated intermittently. If so, the system designers have determined that the tool should not operate until it is more certain that the input switches have actually been actuated. To do this, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  to determine if the safety is still actuated. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow back to the SAFETY routine at step . On the other hand, if the safety still is actuated at step , then the logic flow is directed to a decision step  to determine if the trigger is still being pulled. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow back to the TRIGGER routine at step .","On the other hand, if decision steps  and  are both answered affirmatively, then a step  clears the operational timers, and the logic flow is then directed to a decision step  that determines if the software code flow is within certain parameters. This is a fault-checking mode of the software itself, and if the system does not determine a satisfactory result, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to a \u201cSTOP\u201d routine at a step  on . This will ultimately turn the tool off and require a safety inspection of the tool, or at least have the tool reset. However, the tool does not need to be completely disabled, and after the safety inspection and tool reset procedure, the tool will be ready to use again without being sent to a service center. In an exemplary mode of the invention, the code flow check step determines if a correct number resides in a register or memory location; this number is the result of being incremented at predetermined executable steps of the software for the system controller.","If the software code flow check is within acceptable parameters at decision step , then the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns on the motor, and then a step  that turns on the solenoid.

As will be discussed below, these timers will be periodically checked by the system controller to make sure that certain things have occurred while the solenoid is on and while the motor is running Otherwise, after a predetermined maximum amount of time, the motor will be turned off and the solenoid will be turned off due to these timers actually timing out, which should not occur if the tool is being used in a normal operation, and if the tool is functioning normally.","In addition to the solenoid and motor run timers discussed above, a \u201cdwell timer\u201d is used to allow the tool to begin its normal operation before any further conditions are checked. This is accomplished by a decision step  on , which causes the logic flow to essentially wait a short amount of time before continuing to the next logic steps.","Once the dwell timer has finished at step , the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines if the solenoid \u201con time\u201d has been exceeded. If the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns off the solenoid. This situation does not necessarily mean the tool is being misused or is not functioning properly, and therefore the logic flow does not travel to a \u201cstop step\u201d from the step . Instead, the logic flow is directed to a decision step , discussed below.","If the solenoid on time has not been exceeded, then the logic flow also is directed to the decision step , which determines if the cam limit switch has received a first signal. This is the Hall effect sensor  that detects the presence or absence of the magnet  of the lifter. If the tool of the illustrated embodiment is being used, the lifter  will make two complete rotations when lifting the driver and piston from their bottom-most positions to their top-most positions. Therefore, the cam limit switch  will receive two different signals during this lift. Step  determines if the first signal has occurred. If not, then a decision step  determines whether the motor timeout has occurred. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed back to decision step . On the other hand, if the motor run timer has indeed timed out, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to a \u201cSTOP\u201d routine at step . This would likely indicate that there is a problem with the tool, or a problem with the way the user is attempting to operate the tool.","Referring back to decision step , if the first signal from the cam has occurred, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns off the solenoid. This will allow the latch  to engage the teeth  of the driver , in case there has been some type of jam, or other type of unusual operation while the driver and piston are being lifted. It also allows the latch  eventually to properly engage the bottom-most tooth  of the driver, which is the normal operation once the driver and piston have been raised to their top-most (or firing) position.","The logic flow is now directed to a decision step  that determines whether a second signal has been received from the cam limit switch. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines whether or not the motor run timer has timed out. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed back to decision step . On the other hand, if the motor timer has timed out, the logic flow is directed to a step  that directs the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP\u201d routine at , and indicates that there is some type of problem.","Once decision step  determines that the second signal from the cam has been received, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that turns off the motor, then to a step  that starts a \u201creset\u201d timeout referred to as \u201call switches on.\u201d In this mode, it is either assumed that both the actuation (input) devices are still actuated, or at least that the controller needs to make an examination of those input devices to see what the proper status of the tool should be. Accordingly, the logic flow is first directed to a decision step , which determines whether the operator mode selector switch  is set to the Restrictive Mode, and if not, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  (discussed below).","If the answer is YES at step , the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines whether or not the reset timeout has occurred. If the answer is YES, then the logic flow is directed to a step , and the tool is then enters the STOP routine at step  on . If the answer was NO at step , a decision step  determines whether or not the safety is still actuated (or \u201cpulled\u201d). If the answer is YES, then the logic flow is directed back to step ; if the answer is NO, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  which determines whether or not the trigger is still being pulled. If the answer is YES, then the logic flow is directed back to step ; if the answer is NO, the logic flow is directed to a step , and the tool then enters the BEGIN routine at step  on .","Back at step , if the current selector switch mode was not Restrictive, then the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines if the safety is still actuated. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that then sends the logic flow to the \u201cBEGIN\u201d routine at step  on . On the other hand if the safety is still actuated, the logic flow is directed to a decision step  that determines if the trigger is still pulled. If the answer is NO, then the logic flow is directed to a step  that also directs the logic flow to the \u201cBEGIN\u201d step at  on . Finally, if the trigger is still being pulled, then a decision step  determines whether or not a \u201creset\u201d timeout has occurred, and if the answer is YES, the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to the \u201cSTOP \u201d routine at step  on . If the reset timeout has not yet occurred at step , then the logic flow is directed back to the decision step  and the inspection of all of the switches will again be performed.","The logic flow is continued on , in which there are two different types of stop routines. The routine called \u201cSTOP\u201d at step  will first turn off the motor at a step , turn off the solenoid at a step , and turn off the work light at a step . The STOP routine will then clear the timers at a step . The logic flow then becomes a \u201cDO-Loop,\u201d and continues back to the STOP routine at step . This is a fault mode, and the tool must be inspected. As a minimum, it needs to be reset to terminate the DO-Loop processing of the software, which means that the battery must be disconnected from the tool. If the user has been using the tool properly, this may be an indication that there is some operational problem with the tool itself, or that a fastener perhaps has jammed somewhere in the tool and the operator did not notice that fact.","The other type of STOP routine is the \u201cSTOP \u201d routine at step . Once that occurs, a step  turns off the motor, turn off the solenoid at a step , and turn off the work light at a step . The STOP  routine will then clear the timers at a step , and a decision step  determines whether or not the trigger is still pulled. If the answer is YES, then the logic flow is directed back to the STOP  routine at step . If the trigger is not pulled at step , the logic flow is then directed to a decision step  that determines if the safety is still actuated. If YES, the logic flow is directed back to the STOP  routine at step . However, if the safety is not actuated, the logic flow is directed to a step  that sends the logic flow to the \u201cBEGIN\u201d routine at step  on . At this point, the tool has been successfully used, and is ready for the next firing (driving) actuation.","Referring now to , an alternative embodiment of a rotary-to-linear lifter mechanism is illustrated, and is generally designated by the reference numeral . In , the opposite side (compared to certain earlier views of lifter , such as ) of lifter  is seen. Three extensions or \u201cpins\u201d , , and  are directly seen in this view, and this is the \u201cworking side\u201d of those three pins, which are designed to make contact with the teeth  of a driver  (see ).  shows the positional relationship of these three pins with respect to the lifter mechanism  and the center position for its lifter drive shaft , in an exemplary alternative embodiment. In addition,  shows the semi-circular outer shape of a first part of the perimeter of the lifter at , and the more elliptical outer shape of a second part of the perimeter of the lifter at , similar to the perimeter portions  and , discussed above. The outer shape of the perimeter portions (at  and ) define an outer perimeter of a surface or \u201cface\u201d  from which these pins , , and  protrude.","The lifter pin  is also referred to as the \u201cfirst pin,\u201d while the pin  is also referred to as the \u201csecond pin,\u201d and the pin  is also referred to as the \u201cthird pin,\u201d mainly because these pins , , and  engage the driver's teeth  in that order, as the lifter  rotates during a lifting event of the driver . The third pin  is also known as the \u201clast pin,\u201d because when the lifter  rotates past the point where \u201clast pin\u201d  makes contact with one of the driver teeth , then the driver  can move quickly downward (in the orientation of most of the views herein) to create a driving stroke to force a fastener into a target workpiece.","The geometry of the outer surface of the last lifter pin  is important: as illustrated on , pin  exhibits a substantially circular shape at  for most of its outer perimeter (as seen in this view). However, this circular shape is cut off at two outer corners,  and . A substantially flat surface (having a linear appearance in this view) at  runs between those two corners. This geometry reduces the side forces that otherwise would be imparted to the edge of the driver , which will be discussed in detail below, with respect to .","It will be understood that the lifter pins , , and  are also sometimes referred to herein as spaced-apart \u201cextensions\u201d that originate in the face  of the lifter mechanism . The last pin  is also sometimes referred herein as the \u201cfinal one\u201d of the spaced-apart plurality of extensions, and is said to have a geometric shape comprising: an arcuate shape for a portion of its outer perimeter, and at least two outer corners with a substantially linear face therebetween. The arcuate shape is at , the two outer corners are at  and , and the substantially linear face is at .","As can be seen in , there is an abrupt angular change in direction along the outer perimeter of lifter pin , at a location between first and second portions of said outer perimeter, in which the first portion is the arcuate shape , and the second portion is the relatively flat (or planar) shape at . The second portion between the outer corners  and  is also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201ccut-off face\u201d or a \u201ccut-off surface\u201d of lifter pin .","Referring now to , the lifter  has rotated to a position where the \u201cfirst pin\u201d  is making contact with one of the driver teeth, and therefore, is able to raise the driver  upward (in this view) when the lifter  rotates in the correct direction, which would be the counterclockwise direction in this view. Most of the driver teeth have the same shape, i.e., those teeth designated by the reference numeral . However, the \u201ctop tooth\u201d at  is elongated; this also is the \u201cfirst tooth\u201d that is engaged by the lifter pins at the beginning of a lift cycle. In , the pin  is making contact with the tooth  along a surface , which essentially is the bottom surface (in this view) of the tooth .","The opposite side of the driver  also exhibits an alternative shape, at reference numeral . This alternative shape is better seen in the perspective view of , and will be discussed below, in reference to that view. The driver  is mechanically connected to a piston , as seen in , which performs the same functions as the piston , described above and illustrated in , and in other views. This alternative embodiment includes a guide body , which is similar to the guide body , described above and illustrated in , and in other views.","Referring now to , the lifter  has rotated to a position where the \u201csecond pin\u201d  is making contact with one of the driver teeth ; moreover, the \u201cthird pin\u201d  is about to make contact with a different one of the driver teeth . This assures a smooth transition when the second pin  releases from its contact with its particular driver tooth \u2014as the second pin  releases from contact at a point , the third pin  quickly begins to make contact at a point , and this keeps the upward (in this view) movement of the driver  going along smoothly. More accurately, the contact \u201cpoint\u201d  is essentially the bottom surface of one of the driver teeth , and the contact \u201cpoint\u201d  is essentially the bottom surface of the \u201cnext\u201d one of the driver teeth . This is easily discerned by viewing .","Referring now to , the lifter  has rotated to a position where the \u201cthird pin\u201d  is about to release its contact with one of the driver teeth , at a point . As the lifter  continues to rotate in the counterclockwise direction (in this view), the corner  of the pin  will suddenly go by the point in space where it can touch the driver tooth . As soon as that occurs, the driver  will be quickly forced downward (in this view) by the gas pressure stored in the displacement volume of the working cylinder  of the tool. Just before that occurs, the mechanical forces on the lifter pin  and on the driver  will be at a maximum value.","In the earlier embodiments, the \u201cthird pin\u201d was entirely circular (as seen in , for example, for pin ). The working forces, just before the pin  released from contact with one of the driver teeth , are illustrated in a vector force diagram, seen on FIG. . This diagram of  illustrates a \u201cpin contact lift force diagram,\u201d and shows the positions of a driver , a \u201cthird pin\u201d , a lifter , and the lifter's rotational shaft , thereby indicating its center (or axis) of rotation \u201cC\u201d. The arrow \u201cGP\u201d indicates the direction of the force produced by gas pressure in the working cylinder. The arcuate arrow \u201cR\u201d indicates the direction of rotation of the lifter . The line \u201cL\u201d indicates a hypothetical line connecting the lifter's center (\u201cC\u201d) and the pin's center.","The bottom portion of the driver's tooth  is indicated at reference numeral , and this is the location where the pin  physically contacts the driver . The triangle overlaying the pin  indicates the lift force developed by the lifter  at the interface between the lift pin  and the driver tooth . This force triangle has three components: \u201cF\u201d, the total lift force; \u201cV\u201d, the vertical component of the lift force F\u2014note that this component force V is equal to the gas pressure force; and \u201cH\u201d, the horizontal component of the lift force F.","Note that, as the pin-driver tooth contact moves beyond the hypothetical line L, due to lifter rotation, the relative size of the horizontal and vertical lift forces (H and V) switch in magnitude. This change in orientation causes a significant change in normal loading between the pin  and the driver . This normal loading causes a proportional increase in friction between the driver and the lifter pin. For a full round pin, as in the embodiment of  and , the horizontal force component H can become extremely large as the lifter rotation continues farther than shown in .","In the alternative embodiment illustrated in , the working forces, just before the pin  releases from contact with one of the driver teeth , are illustrated in a vector force diagram, seen on . This diagram of  illustrates a \u201cpin contact lift force diagram,\u201d and shows the positions of a driver , a \u201cthird pin\u201d , a lifter , and the lifter's rotational shaft , thereby indicating its center (or axis) of rotation \u201cC\u201d. The arrow \u201cGP\u201d indicates the direction of the force produced by gas pressure in the working cylinder. The arcuate arrow \u201cR\u201d indicates the direction of rotation of the lifter . The line \u201cL\u201d indicates a hypothetical line connecting the lifter's center (\u201cC\u201d) and the pin's center.","The bottom portion of the driver's tooth  is indicated at reference numeral , and this is the location where the pin  physically contacts the driver . The triangle overlaying the pin  indicates the lift force developed by the lifter  at the interface between the lift pin  and the driver tooth . This force triangle has three components: \u201cF\u201d, the total lift force; \u201cV\u201d, the vertical component of the lift force F\u2014note that this component force V is (again) equal to the gas pressure force; and \u201cH\u201d, the horizontal component of the lift force F.","The two force diagrams of  are not to scale; if they were, then it would be quite clear that the horizontal force H is much less than the horizontal force H, keeping in mind that the vertical forces V and V are equal to one another. (V and V are equal to the gas pressure, which is the same in both embodiments for a given power stroke.) The location of the corner  is started close to the point where the hypothetical line L crosses the pin face. This change in design guarantees a limited horizontal component of force, and any loss of lift height is minimal. Moreover, in this embodiment, the lifter pin  is \u201ccut\u201d at a large enough angle to ensure that the driver  will clear the pin  as it releases from the driver tooth . This cut-off angle is designated by the letter \u201cA\u201d on .","It should be noted that, on , the magnitude of the horizontal force H is less than that for the vertical force V, which is the opposite case compared to the force diagram of , where H was greater in magnitude than V. This shows a major advantage of the alternative embodiment described herein, starting on . The rotational position of the corner , and its cut-off angle A, determine the effectiveness of the side-loading force reduction characteristics. So long as the internal parts have not been damaged and the friction of the lifter subassembly system has not been compromised due to dirt or debris entering into the mechanism, the lift force side-load component (e.g., H) should not equal or exceed the lift force in the perpendicular direction (e.g., the V force component).","Referring now to , the alternative embodiment for the driver  is more clearly illustrated in this perspective view. Along one edge of the driver are a series of teeth , and also a larger \u201cfirst tooth\u201d at ; these driver teeth were discussed in some detail above, in connection with . As can be seen in , the lifter pins  and  are sized and shaped to fit in the openings between these multiple teeth , as the lifter mechanism  rotates.","Along the opposite edge of the driver  are a series of openings  that are formed in a raised wall  that extends at a substantially perpendicular angle from that opposite edge; this forms a \u201cslotted rib\u201d structure, in appearance. The earlier embodiments (such as driver , illustrated in ) included a plurality of raised teeth  that were virtually identical to the teeth that were formed along the opposite edge\u2014i.e., the edge that engaged with the rotatable lifter . In those earlier embodiments, there were spaces between the top surfaces of the multiple teeth. However, in the alternative embodiment of , there is a single continuous top surface or \u201cface\u201d at , which runs along the entire length of the portion of the driver  that contains the series of openings . The raised wall presents a substantially planar surface  for the latch member to work against, such that the latch member may slide along the raised wall, except at locations where one of the spaced-apart openings  appears in the raised wall.","The alternative embodiment of  also includes a different design for the latch mechanism, generally designated by the reference numeral . Latch mechanism  works in much the same manner as the latch  of the earlier embodiment illustrated in , but with some differences. In , the latch  included a pivotable extension that included a \u201ccatching surface\u201d at , which exhibited an angular outer shape that included an internal corner. This shape was designed to receive one of the driver teeth , and thereby prevent the driver  from moving downward any farther, once the latch  had been engaged with the driver's teeth. The mechanical loading on the latch's catching surface  was quite large, since the gas pressure of the tool was always present, and particularly if the driver had been lifted almost all the way back toward its starting position. This situation, if occurring often due to misuse of the tool, could lead to breakage of the latch catching surface, at or near one its pointed extensions away from the internal corner.","In the alternative embodiment of , the angled catching surface has been replaced with a substantial solid surface that has no internal corners with pointed protrusions that could become broken, due to repeated tool misuse. Instead, the alternative latch design  has a single large extension at  that is physically large in size, and it has a single substantially linear catching surface at . The extension  is sized and shaped to fit within one of the openings  in the side wall  of the driver . The latch  is spring-loaded, so it tends to be thrust into these openings  as the driver  is lifted toward its starting position; however, the latch still has a \u201csliding surface\u201d that allows the driver  to slide by without being \u201ccaught\u201d by the latch extension .","When the driver  is forced downward (in the orientation of ) by gas pressure, the latch  is supposed to be physically out of the way, so that it will not interfere with the movement of the driver during a driving stroke. However, if an abnormal (or \u201cfault\u201d) condition occurs during operation of the tool, then the latch  is allowed to rotate (or pivot) and force its extension  toward the driver ; in that circumstance, the relatively solid catching surface  will fit into the \u201cnext\u201d opening  of the driver, and thereby intercept the driver  to suddenly stop its downward movement. The large, and relatively smooth, catching surface  is capable of multiple such events without damage, either to itself, or to the openings  of the driver . The more sturdy construction of the alternative embodiment driver , along this smooth face , aids in preventing damage to itself. It will be understood that other physical arrangements for the latch mechanism could be used to achieve a desired effect, such as to prevent or reduce the chance of damage to the parts.","The latch mechanism , as well as the earlier-described latches in this disclosure (e.g., latch , latch ), typically have been described as being biased by a mechanical means, such as a mechanical spring. However, it will be understood that the biasing mechanism could be based on a different principle of operation, such as a magnetic, hydraulic, or pneumatic mechanism, without departing from the principles of the invention. The important feature is that the latch is positionally biased in some way, so that it tends to be moved into a interfering position with respect to the driver . This positional biasing could be in a rotational direction (e.g., a pivoting action) or in a linear direction.","Referring now to , another alternative embodiment of a rotary-to-linear lifter mechanism is illustrated, and is generally designated by the reference numeral . In , the opposite side of lifter  is seen, similar to . Three extensions or \u201cpins\u201d , , and  are directly seen in this view, and this is the \u201cworking side\u201d of those three pins, which are designed to make contact with the teeth  of a driver  (see ).  shows the positional relationship of these three pins with respect to the lifter mechanism  and the center position for its lifter drive shaft , in an exemplary alternative embodiment. In addition,  shows the semi-circular outer shape of a first part of the perimeter of the lifter at , and the more elliptical outer shape of a second part of the perimeter of the lifter at , similar to the perimeter portions  and , discussed above. The outer shape of the perimeter portions (at  and ) define an outer perimeter of a surface or \u201cface\u201d  from which these pins , , and  protrude.","The lifter pin  is also referred to as the \u201cfirst pin,\u201d while the pin  is also referred to as the \u201csecond pin,\u201d and the pin  is also referred to as the \u201cthird pin,\u201d mainly because these pins , , and  engage the driver's teeth  in that order, as the lifter  rotates during a lifting event of the driver . The third pin  is also known as the \u201clast pin,\u201d because when the lifter  rotates past the point where \u201clast pin\u201d  makes contact with one of the driver teeth , then the driver  can move quickly downward (in the orientation of most of the views herein) to create a driving stroke to force a fastener into a target workpiece.","The geometry (shape) of the outer surface of the last lifter pin  is important: as illustrated on , pin  exhibits a substantially circular shape at  for most of its outer perimeter (as seen in this view). However, this circular shape is cut off at two outer corners,  and . A \u201ccut-off face\u201d surface (having a curved appearance in this view) at  runs between those two corners. This geometry also reduces the side forces that otherwise would be imparted to the edge of the driver , which were discussed above in detail, with respect to .","It will be understood that the lifter pins , , and  are also sometimes referred to herein as spaced-apart \u201cextensions\u201d that originate in the face  of the lifter mechanism . The last pin  is also sometimes referred herein as the \u201cfinal one\u201d of the spaced-apart plurality of extensions, and is said to have a geometric shape comprising: an arcuate shape for a portion of its outer perimeter, and at least two outer corners with a cut-off face therebetween. The arcuate shape is at , the two outer corners are at  and , and the cut-off face is at .","As can be seen in , there is an abrupt angular change in direction along the outer perimeter of lifter pin , at a location (e.g., corner ) between first and second portions of said outer perimeter. The first portion is the arcuate shape , and the second portion is the face at  that rather abruptly changes direction from the arcuate shape (while moving along the perimeter of the pin ). The second portion between the outer corners  and  is also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201ccut-off face\u201d or a \u201ccut-off surface\u201d of lifter pin .","As can be seen by viewing both , the cut-off face for the \u201cthird\u201d lifter pin can have more than one shape, while performing the task of reducing side forces. The cut-off corner (at  or ) needs to be positioned correctly, and the angles A or B must be such that the pin will clear the driver  during its power stroke to drive a fastener. The rotational position of the corner , and its cut-off angle B, determine the effectiveness of the side-loading force reduction characteristics.","In the above detailed description, there are a number of various timeouts that may occur during the operation of the tools built according to the present invention. As of the writing of this patent application, all of the timeout intervals are set for three (3) seconds. However, each of the timeouts is designed so as to be independently settable by the system designer, in case it becomes desirable to alter one or more of the individual timeout intervals (i.e., to a time value other than three seconds). Normally this would be done in software code (stored in the memory circuit), used to instruct the processing circuit in its operations, although hardware timers could instead be used.","It will also be understood that the logical operations described in relation to the flow charts of  and  can be implemented using sequential logic, such as by using microprocessor technology, or using a logic state machine, or perhaps by discrete logic; it even could be implemented using parallel processors.

In fact, the entire microprocessor or microcontroller, along with RAM and executable ROM, may be contained within a single ASIC, in one mode of the present invention. Of course, other types of circuitry could be used to implement these logical operations depicted in the drawings without departing from the principles of the present invention.","It will be further understood that the precise logical operations depicted in the flow charts of  and , and discussed above, could be somewhat modified to perform similar, although not exact, functions without departing from the principles of the present invention.
