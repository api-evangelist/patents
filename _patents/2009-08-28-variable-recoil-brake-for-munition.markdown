title: Variable recoil brake for munition
abstract: A recoil brake includes a control rod disposed in a central opening in a piston and cylinder assembly. A fluid passage leads from the piston to the control rod. A long stroke body is fixed to the piston and defines a long stroke orifice around the control rod. A short stroke body is removably disposed in the long stroke orifice. The short stroke body defines a short stroke orifice around the control rod, the short stroke orifice being smaller than the long stroke orifice. The recoil brake may be used with a 120 mm gun.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/425,812 filed on Jun. 22, 2006 now abandoned and entitled \u201cVariable Recoil Brake for Munition.\u201d This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC \u00a7120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/425,812, which is expressly incorporated by reference in this application.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to recoil brakes for guns.","Recoil brakes for guns, such as artillery and howitzers, absorb recoil force when a gun is fired and limit the travel of the gun during recoil. Some guns, such as launchers, may be elevated to deliver a long-range projectile, i.e., the muzzle end of the gun is higher than the breech end. When the angle of elevation is large, the breech end may strike the deck of the surrounding area during recoil. Thus, it is desirable to have a recoil brake that can shorten the recoil distance of the gun when the angle of elevation is large.","U.S. Pat. No. 1,335,464, issued to Schneider on Mar. 30, 1920, discloses an apparatus for varying the recoil of a gun, and is incorporated by reference herein. FIGS. 1-4 of Schneider illustrate a recoil brake having a short stroke orifice and a long stroke orifice. As noted by Schneider at column 2, lines 1-7, a drawback of the recoil brake shown in FIGS. 1-4 of Schneider is that it is difficult to give to the counter-rod F a shape that is suitable to produce a braking law for both the long recoil and the short recoil. Schneider solves this problem with a complex mechanism that is illustrated in FIGS. 5-15 of Schneider. The mechanism of FIGS. 5-15 requires many additional components, compared to the mechanism shown in FIGS. 1-4 of Schneider. A need exists for a simpler recoil brake that operates suitably for both a long recoil stroke and a short recoil stroke.","It is an object of the invention to provide a recoil brake that has a variable stroke.","It is another object of the invention to provide a variable stroke recoil brake that is simple to adjust from long stroke to short stroke and vice versa.","A further object of the invention is to provide a variable stroke recoil brake suitable for a 120 mm gun.","One aspect of the invention is a recoil brake that may include a cylinder and a piston disposed in the cylinder for reciprocation therein. A piston rod may be attached to the piston. The piston rod and the piston may have a central opening therethrough. A control rod may be disposed in the central opening in the piston rod and piston.","The control rod may have a diameter that varies along its length substantially in accordance with the following number pairs, wherein the first number in each pair is the axial location along the control rod, in inches, and the second number in each pair is the diameter, in inches, of the control rod at that axial location: (0.00, 0.6250); (0.50, 0.6250); (1.00, 0.6250); (1.50, 0.6250); (2.00, 0.7641); (2.50, 0.9093); (2.75, 0.9150); (3.00, 0.9195); (3.50, 0.9250); (4.00, 0.9270); (4.50, 0.9285); (5.00, 0.9310); (5.50, 0.9335); (6.00, 0.9365); (6.50, 0.9395); (7.00, 0.9425); (7.50, 0.9460); (8.00, 0.9500); (8.50, 0.9540); (9.00, 0.9575); (10.00, 0.9660); (11.00, 0.9750); (12.00, 0.9850); (13.00, 0.9975); (14.00, 1.0150); (15.00, 1.0300); (15.50, 1.0350); (16.00, 1.0420); (16.50, 1.0475); (17.00, 1.0530); (17.50, 1.0560); (18.00, 1.0610); (18.50, 1.0670); (19.00, 1.0750); (19.50, 1.0830); (20.00, 1.0926); (20.50, 1.0999); (21.00, 1.1073); (21.50, 1.1170); (22.00, 1.1300).","An end cap may be rotatably disposed in one end of the cylinder. One end of the control rod may be fixed to the end cap and the other end of the control rod may be free. The recoil brake may include at least one fluid passage from the piston to the control rod. A long stroke body may be fixed to the piston. The long stroke body may define a long stroke orifice around the control rod. The diameter of the long stroke orifice may be about 1.14 inches. A short stroke body may be removably disposed in the long stroke orifice. The short stroke body may define a short stroke orifice around the control rod. The diameter of the short stroke orifice may be about 1.05 inches. Fluid flow through the at least one fluid passage may be selectively directed through one of the long stroke orifice and the short stroke orifice by rotation of the end cap.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Referring to  and A-B, recoil brake  includes a cylinder , a piston  disposed in the cylinder  for reciprocation therein and a piston rod  attached to the piston . The piston rod  and piston  have a central opening therethrough. A control rod  is disposed in the central opening in the piston rod  and piston . An end cap  is rotatably disposed in one end  of the cylinder . One end  of the control rod  is fixed to the end cap  and the other end  of the control rod  is free.","Piston , piston rod  and cylinder  define a fluid chamber . The working fluid in fluid chamber  may be, for example, hydraulic fluid. At least one fluid passage  leads from the fluid chamber  through the piston  to the control rod . A long stroke body  is fixed to the piston . The long stroke body  defines a long stroke orifice  around the control rod , best seen in .","A short stroke body  is removably disposed in the long stroke orifice . Short stroke body  has a short stroke orifice  that is smaller than the long stroke orifice . The short stroke body  is rotatable with the end cap , releasably attached to the cylinder  and releasably attached to the long stroke body . Fluid flow through the at least one fluid passage  may be selectively directed through either the long stroke orifice  or the short stroke orifice  by rotating the end cap . If short stroke recoil is desired, then the fluid flow is directed through the short stroke orifice . If long stroke recoil is desired, then the fluid flow is directed through the long stroke orifice .","An outer end cap  closes one end of cylinder . Outer end cap  may be fixed to cylinder  with threads. An attachment means, for example, a clevis , is provided on outer end cap . Clevis  is attached to either a portion of the gun that recoils, such as the breech ring, or a non-recoil surface, such as the gun mount. At the opposite end of the cylinder , another attachment means, for example, a clevis , is fixed to the end of the piston rod . If clevis  is attached to a portion of the gun that recoils, such as the breech ring, then clevis  is attached to a non-recoil surface, such as the gun mount, and vice-versa.","End cap  fits in cylinder  behind outer end cap . End cap  may partially rotate in cylinder  and is sealed against cylinder . A handle  fastened to the end cap  extends outside the cylinder , for manually rotating the end cap . Short stroke body  fits in cylinder  behind the end cap . Short stroke body  is rotatable with end cap  via, for example, a clawed connection. The outer circumference of the right hand end (as viewed in ) of the short stroke body  includes four slots  formed in its face. These slots  mate with four bosses  (two bosses are shown in ) formed on the outer circumference of the end cap . Thus, rotational motion of the end cap  is transferred to the short stroke body  via the bosses  and slots . The bosses  and slots  form the clawed connection between short stroke body  and end cap .","The short stroke body  is removably disposed in the long stroke orifice . Rotation of the short stroke body  attaches and releases the short stroke body  to the long stroke body . The short stroke body  is attached to the long stroke body  with, for example, a single, zero pitch segmented thread. The long stroke body  () is internally threaded with thread segments  and grooves . The short stroke body  () is externally threaded with thread segments  and grooves . In the rest position, the short stroke body  is disposed inside the long stroke orifice  () such that the thread segments  of the short stroke body  pass through the grooves  of the long stroke body . The thread segments  of the short stroke body  are located to the left of (in ) the grooves  of the long stroke body . That is, the segments  and grooves  are in different planes so that they do not \u201cmesh\u201d when the short stroke body  rotates.","When short stroke recoil is desired, the rotative position of the short stroke body  is such that its thread segments  are axially aligned with the thread segments  of the long stroke body . Then, when the piston  and long stroke body  move to the left (as seen in ), the thread segments  of the long stroke body  bear against the thread segments  of the short stroke body  to thereby \u201ccapture\u201d and move the short stroke body  axially with the piston  and long stroke body . Being thus captured, the short stroke orifice  remains adjacent the oil passageways  in the piston . Oil that passes through the piston passageways  flows through the short stroke orifice , thereby providing short stroke recoil.","If long stroke recoil is desired, the short stroke body  is rotated (via handle  and end cap ) so that its thread segments  are aligned with the grooves  of the long stroke body . Then, when the long stroke body  moves axially to the left (as seen in ), the thread segments  of the short stroke body  simply pass through the grooves  in the long stroke body  and the short stroke body  does not move axially. As the long stroke body  moves away from the short stroke body , the long stroke orifice  opens up to receive the fluid from the passageways  in the piston , thereby providing long stroke recoil. When the recoil brake  returns to the rest position again, the short stroke body  is again disposed inside the long stroke body  with the thread segments  aligned with the grooves .","The short stroke body  is releasably attached to the cylinder  with at least one spring loaded pin  (). Pin or pins  are circumferentially disposed around cylinder  with spring loaded detents that bear against the outer surface of short stroke body . The outer surface of short stroke body  includes variable depth grooves  in which the pins  move as the short stroke body  is rotated. Handle  is used to rotate end cap  and, therefore, short stroke body  between the short and long stroke positions.","Rather than adding additional control rods and other components to produce braking that is suitable for both short and long recoil, as shown in  of Schneider, the present invention may use a single control rod . The successful results obtained with a single control rod  were not predictable. In the invention, the diameter d () of the control rod  may be varied in a non-linear manner along the length of the control rod . While there may be an infinite number of possible non-linear profiles for control rod , the inventors discovered a rod profile that may produce suitable results for both long and short stroke recoil.","The diameter of rod  may be varied along its length. The diameter may be varied beginning at a point \u201c0\u201d, near end  of rod , which may be the beginning of recoil, and ending 22 inches from point 0, near end  of rod , which may be the end of the long stroke recoil. The diameters (in inches) of rod  and the axial locations (in inches) of the diameters are substantially as set forth in the following number pairs, where the first number in each pair is the axial location along the rod  and the second number in each pair is the diameter of rod  at that axial location: (0.00, 0.6250); (0.50, 0.6250); (1.00, 0.6250); (1.50, 0.6250); (2.00, 0.7641); (2.50, 0.9093); (2.75, 0.9150); (3.00, 0.9195); (3.50, 0.9250); (4.00, 0.9270); (4.50, 0.9285); (5.00, 0.9310); (5.50, 0.9335); (6.00, 0.9365); (6.50, 0.9395); (7.00, 0.9425); (7.50, 0.9460); (8.00, 0.9500); (8.50, 0.9540); (9.00, 0.9575); (10.00, 0.9660); (11.00, 0.9750); (12.00, 0.9850); (13.00, 0.9975); (14.00, 1.0150); (15.00, 1.0300); (15.50, 1.0350); (16.00, 1.0420); (16.50, 1.0475); (17.00, 1.0530); (17.50, 1.0560); (18.00, 1.0610); (18.50, 1.0670); (19.00, 1.0750); (19.50, 1.0830); (20.00, 1.0926); (20.50, 1.0999); (21.00, 1.1073); (21.50, 1.1170); and (22.00, 1.1300).","A graphical representation of a portion of the variation in the diameter of the rod  is shown in . Distance \u201c0\u201d may correspond to the beginning of recoil and may be located toward end  of rod . Sixteen inches on the x-axis may mark the end of the short stroke recoil. Twenty-two inches on the x-axis may mark the end of the long stroke recoil, toward end  of rod . For purposes of clarity, the diameters of the rod  from 0.00 to about 2.00 inches on the x-axis are not shown.","The diameter of the short stroke orifice  may be about 1.05 inches and the diameter of the long stroke orifice  may be about 1.14 inches. The recoil brake  with control rod  may be used with a gun  (), such as a 120 mm gun, for example, the XM 360 120 mm gun.","Computerized recoil simulations indicate that the maximum force transferred through the brake  with rod  may be substantially the same for both the short and long stroke recoils. Also, the maximum force transferred through the brake  for both recoil strokes may be about 20% more than the force transferred through a brake having a control rod designed for only short stroke operation.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3B"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4B"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
