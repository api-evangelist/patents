Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) succeeds IPv4 partly due to the growth of the Internet, which has resulted in the need for more addresses that can be supported by IPv4. Like IPv4, IPv6 is an Internet Layer protocol for packet-switched internetworking and provides end-to-end datagram transmission across multiple IP networks. While IPv4 uses 32 bits for each IP address and can therefore support 2(4,294,967,296) addresses, IPv6 uses 128 bits for each IP address and can therefore support 2(approximately 3.4\u00d710) addresses. This expansion allows for many more devices and users on the Internet as well as extra flexibility in allocating addresses and efficiency for routing traffic. It also eliminates the primary need for network address translation (NAT).","A unique local address (ULA) is an IPv6 address in the block fc00::\/7 defined in RFC4193. It is the IPv6 counterpart of the IPv4 private address. Each ULA has 128 bits with the following format:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"IPv6 ULA Format"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"7 bits","1 bit","40 bits","16 bits","64 bits"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Prefix","L","Global ID","Subnet ID","Interface ID"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Prefix FC00::\/7 prefix to identify local IPv6 unicast addresses;","L Set to 1 if the prefix is locally assigned;","Global ID Identifier used to create a globally unique prefix;","Subset ID Identifier of a subnet within the site;","Interface ID Identifier as defined in IPv6 Addressing Architecture."]}}}},"ULAs are available for use in private networks (e.g., inside a single site or organization, or spanning a limited number of sites of organizations). RFC4193 defines the format of a ULA but does not prescribe how the full address should be constructed, except that Global IDs are pseudo-random and locally assigned Global IDs must be generated with a pseudo-random algorithm.","Particular embodiments derive a ULA for a network device (e.g., router, gateway, switch, computer, etc.) from its device name. In particular embodiments, a network device may have a device name in the form of \u201chostname.domain-name\u201d. A domain name (e.g., cisco.com, google.com, yahoo.com, microsoft.com, etc.) is an identification label that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control on the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). A hostname (e.g., router104, notebook_john, etc.) is a label assigned to a device connected to a computer network and is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communications. Thus, as an example, the device name of a network device may be \u201crouter104.cisco.com\u201d, where \u201crouter104\u201d is the hostname portion of the device name and \u201ccisco.com\u201d is the domain-name portion of the device name. Particular embodiments may derive the Global-ID portion (40 bits) of the ULA from the domain-name portion of the device name, and the Subnet-ID and Interface-ID portions (16 bits+64 bits=80 bits) of the ULA from the hostname portion of the device name.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"110"},"Note that in some rare cases, when applying a hash function to two different domain names, it is possible that the two domain names result in the same hash value, which means it is possible that two domain names may yield the same Global ID. However, the possibility of such an occurrence is very low. Even if, per chance, two domain names yield the same Global ID, particular embodiments derive Unique Local Addresses, which are identified as starting with FD00:\/8. ULAs are relevant only within an Enterprise or network, and should not be transmitted on the global Internet. Thus, even if two Enterprises or networks, having different domain names, end up with the same Global ID, they should never see each other's packets.","Particular embodiments may construct the Subnet-ID and Interface-ID portions (80 bits) of the ULA by encoding the hostname portion of the device name, as illustrated in STEP . A hostname may be formed using 26 letters (not case sensitive), 10 digits (0 to 9), and \u201c-\u201d and \u201c.\u201d. This results in a total of 38 unique characters to be encoded.","In one implementation, 5 bits are used to encode the 38 characters (e.g., \u201ca\u201d is encoded as \u201c00000\u201d, \u201cb\u201d is encoded as \u201c00001\u201d, \u201cc\u201d is encoded as \u201c00010\u201d, and so on). In this case, some characters may have the same encoding as 2=32 (i.e., the characters are not uniquely encoded). If the hostname has 16 characters or more, only the 16 rightmost characters are used. Each character is encoded to produce 5 bits, and thus 16 characters may be encoded to produce 80 bits. On the other hand, if the hostname has less than 16 characters, the available characters are encoded to produce some number of bits, and a sufficient number of \u201c0\u201d bits is padded to the most significant side to fill in for the missing bits and make the total number of bits . For example, to encode hostname \u201crouter104\u201d, the characters \u201cr\u201d, \u201co\u201d, \u201cu\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, \u201ce\u201d, \u201cr\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, and \u201c4\u201d are each encoded to produce a total of 45 bits, and 35 \u201c0\u201d bits are padded to the left to make the total number of bits .","Alternatively, in another implementation, 6 bits are used to encode the 38 characters (e.g., \u201ca\u201d is encoded as \u201c000000\u201d, \u201cb\u201d is encoded as \u201c000001\u201d, \u201cc\u201d is encoded as \u201c000010\u201d, and so on). In this case, the 38 characters can be uniquely encoded. If the hostname has 13 characters or more, only the 13 rightmost characters are used. Each character is encoded to produce 6 bits, and thus 13 characters may be encoded to produce 78 bits. The 2 most significant bits may be padded with 2 \u201c0\u201d bits. On the other hand, if the hostname has less than 13 characters, the available characters are encoded to produce some number of bits. Finally, a sufficient number of \u201c0\u201d bits is padded to the most significant side to fill in for the missing bits and make the total number of bits . For example, to encode hostname \u201crouter104\u201d, the characters \u201cr\u201d, \u201co\u201d, \u201cu\u201d, \u201ct\u201d, \u201ce\u201d, \u201cr\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, and \u201c4\u201d are each encoded to produce a total of 54 bits, and 26 \u201c0\u201d bits are padded to the left to make the total number of bits .","Alternatively, in another implementation, again, 6 bits are used to encode the 38 characters). If the hostname has 14 characters or more, only the 14 rightmost characters are used. Each character is encoded to produce 6 bits, and thus 14 characters may be encoded to produce 84 bits. The 4 most significant or least significant bits may be discarded so that the total number of bits remaining is 80. On the other hand, if the hostname has less than 14 characters, the available characters are encoded to produce some number of bits, and a sufficient number of \u201c0\u201d bits is padded to the most significant side to fill in for the missing bits and make the total number of bits 80.","The following illustrates an example encoding scheme for the characters used in hostnames.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0022"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Character","6-Bit encoding"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["a","000000"]},{"entry":["b","000001"]},{"entry":["c","000010"]},{"entry":["d","000011"]},{"entry":["e","000100"]},{"entry":["f","000101"]},{"entry":["g","000110"]},{"entry":["h","000111"]},{"entry":["i","001000"]},{"entry":["j","001001"]},{"entry":["k","001010"]},{"entry":["l","001011"]},{"entry":["m","001100"]},{"entry":["n","001101"]},{"entry":["o","001110"]},{"entry":["p","001111"]},{"entry":["q","010000"]},{"entry":["r","010001"]},{"entry":["s","010010"]},{"entry":["t","010011"]},{"entry":["u","010100"]},{"entry":["v","010101"]},{"entry":["w","010110"]},{"entry":["x","010111"]},{"entry":["y","011000"]},{"entry":["z","011001"]},{"entry":["0","011010"]},{"entry":["1","011011"]},{"entry":["2","011100"]},{"entry":["3","011101"]},{"entry":["4","011110"]},{"entry":["5","011111"]},{"entry":["6","100000"]},{"entry":["7","100001"]},{"entry":["8","100010"]},{"entry":["9","100011"]},{"entry":["0","100100"]},{"entry":["\u2014","100101"]},{"entry":[".","100110"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The Global ID (40 bits), Subnet ID (16 bits), and Interface ID (64 bits) thus derived are predictable. That is, the same device name always produces the same Global ID, Subnet ID, and Interface ID. The Global ID is sufficiently unique for many applications. In particular embodiments, to ensure that the Subnet ID and Interface ID are sufficiently unique, the hostnames of the devices may be required to have 16 characters to more.","In addition, the ULA has 8 bits for prefix. These 8 bits will always be FD00, representing that the ULA is a Unique Local Address according to RFC4193.","The ULAs derived from the device names are site unique, predictable, compliant with RFC4193, and easy to determine. As long as a device has the hash function and the encoding scheme, it can produce a ULA from a device name, and multiple devices having the same hash function and encoding scheme can produce the same ULA from the same device name. This eliminates the need of having a centralized device to determine ULAs for other network devices. The ULAs have many practical applications. For example, they may be used for router loopback interfaces.","Particular embodiments may be implemented in a network environment.  illustrates an example network environment .
