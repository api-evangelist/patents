title: Detecting a compromised online user account
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are disclosed for detecting and/or mitigating a potentially compromised online user account. One or more baselines can be established for a user's online account to determine a normal usage pattern for the account by the user (e.g., frequency of incoming/outgoing emails, text messages, etc.). The online user account can be periodically or continually monitored for use of the same resources used to determine the baseline(s). If a deviation from the baseline is detected, the deviation may be compared against a threshold to determine whether the deviation indicates that the account may be compromised. When an indication of a potentially compromised account is detected, the user can be notified of the indication, so that one or more actions can be taken to mitigate the potentially compromised account.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In a computing environment, online services can comprise social networking, web-based email, cloud-based storage and application use, content aggregation services, as well as blogging and micro-blogging services, just to name a few. Further, some online service providers aggregate several of these service together and\/or aggregate their service with those of other providers. Users of online services typically open an account that is linked to the online service, such as a social network, which may comprise some sort of authentication (e.g., using shared secrets and\/ or security information). Unauthorized users (e.g., malicious hackers) occasionally hijack a user's online account by breaking the authentication (e.g., stealing or figuring out the security information), and may use the account for malicious purposes (e.g., spamming, transferring malicious code, vandalism, hijacking other accounts linked to the user, etc.)","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A significant number of people have an online presence in one or more professional or personal social networks, content aggregation services, email\/communication accounts and\/or cloud-based service accounts, for example. Compromising of a user's accounts not only takes away control from the user, it may damage their online identity\/reputation, it can create an online threat for the users network and\/or may result in the compromising of the user's social network contacts. Currently, when an online user's account is hijacked, the user may not find out until it is too late to do anything about it. For example, the hijacker can take over the account, change log-in and security information, and begin performing malicious acts, such as attempting to hijack user contacts.","Detecting compromised user accounts and providing notification to the user and user contacts in a social network, for example, may allow the users and contacts to mitigate damage to the network, and to have a clean, safe online experience. Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed that may detect a compromised user account, and notify the user and\/or user contacts of the potential threat, thereby allowing them to take action(s) to mitigate the problem. When a user account is hijacked, for example, the use of resources associated with the account typically changes dramatically, for example. In this example, these dramatic changes may be used to detect the compromised account, and to send out an appropriate notice to the user, and possibly the user's contacts.","In one embodiment for mitigating a compromised online user account, a baseline for the online user account can be established, such as from a period where the account is known not to be compromised. Further, a deviation from the baseline that is indicative of a potentially compromised online user account can be detected, by monitoring of the online user account. Additionally, upon detection of the indication, the user of the online user account can be notified of the potential that their account may be compromised.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that provides for detecting a potential compromised user account, such as an online social network account, and providing a way for the user of the account to mitigate the potential compromised account. Further, because an online user account is typically linked to one or more contacts (e.g., social network connections\/friends), the method may provide a way for the contacts of the user account to mitigate their accounts being compromised (e.g., or further compromised). Monitoring the user account for potential undesired or malicious activity, and notifying the user of a potential compromised state so that the user can mitigate a potential problem, may allow the user to have an enhanced (e.g., clean and safe) online experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104"]},"For example, a first online social network provider can allow a user to set up an account, and the user can connect with other users who also have an account with the same service provider. Further, a second social network provider may allow the user to aggregate information from one or more first online social network providers as well as from the second social network provider. In this way, for example, the users social network account may comprise contacts and aggregated information from more than one online social network provider.","A baseline for the users online user account can comprise data that indicates typical use of resources associated with the account by the user. For example, resources associated with the account may comprise communication tools, such as email, message boards, instant messaging (IM), video chat, updating a micro-blog stream, and\/or commenting on postings to the social network. Other resources may comprise establishing contact relationships, uploading content, and\/or sending content to contacts, for example. In one embodiment, the baseline can be established at a desired interval (e.g., after one week of account initiation), for example, so as to comprise enough data to establish an effective baseline. Further, the baseline may be continually updated to reflect normal usage pattern changes of the account by the user.","Further, the respective resources associated with the account may have one or more variables, for example, for which a baseline (e.g., alone or in combination with others) may be established. For example, baseline data may be established for a number of times (e.g., frequency) the user sends\/initiates messages to contacts, which may further be broken down into data for respective types of communications (e.g., email, IM, etc.). As another example, baseline data may be established for a number and\/or frequency of requests sent to establish a new contact (e.g., sending a contact\/friend request), a number and\/or size of content uploaded, and\/or a number and\/or size of content sent to (e.g., particular) contacts of the account, for example.","At  in the exemplary method , a deviation from the baseline is detected that comprises an indication of a potentially compromised online user account. In one embodiment, if a deviation (e.g., a transformation in account resource use) from the baseline for the user account is detected, the deviation may be compared against a threshold to determine if the deviation comprises an indication of a potentially compromised user account. In one embodiment, the threshold may be determined empirically (e.g., by observing what happens to a user account when it is hijacked), through machine learning (e.g., training a classifier to detect a compromised account), and\/or some other technique(s).","A compromised user account may occur when a users account is hijacked (e.g., taken over) by an unauthorized user (e.g., a malicious hacker), who uses the account for unauthorized purposes (e.g., vandalism of the account or users reputation; purchasing; and\/or sending spam, viruses, and\/or Trojan horses; etc.). An unauthorized user may hijack an account by acquiring one or more portions of the users secret authentication information, for example. The acquired information can be used to log onto the account and change the authentication information (e.g., change a password and\/or security information), such that the user may not be able to log back into the account (e.g., to shut down undesired behavior).","At  in the exemplary method , the user of the online user account is notified of the detected indication of the potentially compromised online user account. In one embodiment, the user may be notified by a means that is not associated with the compromised user account. For example, if a users email account is compromised, an alternate means of communication (e.g., IM, video chat, texting, alternate email account) may be used that is not associated with the username for the user's (compromised) email account. In this way, in this embodiment, the user may be able to mitigate the compromised nature of the users online account, and\/or mitigate propagation of the unauthorized use to contacts of the users online account. Also, after the user receives the notification from , the user may investigate and determine that the account is not, in fact, compromised. For example, some setting may have been inadvertently changed causing a deviation from the baseline, that is innocuous rather than malicious.","Having notified the user of the indication of the potentially compromised account, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"Accordingly, at , contacts associated with an online user account can be identified. For example, in order to establish a baseline for communication activity segments associated with the user's account, the user's contacts may need to be identified. In one embodiment, anonymous information may be identified for the user's contacts, such as an IP address, or range of IP addresses, and\/or an anonymous contact ID. In one embodiment, a number of contacts and type of contact can comprise data used to establish the baseline. For example, when a users account is compromised, empirical evidence often shows a large spike in a number of new contacts added to the account, which may be evidence of a compromised account.","In one embodiment, establishing the baseline can comprise determining historical use of the online user account by the user for a desired period of time. Accordingly, at , historical communication between the user and the contacts can be identified. For example, when determining the baseline for the user account a particular communication-related activity (e.g., new friend requests) from a particular period of time, such as the previous week, month, year, may be mined. Further, identifying historical communication-related activity can comprise mining data from one or more activity segments related to communication.","At , activity related to a frequency of communication can be identified. Communication frequency may comprise how often a user communicates with contacts from the account, and\/or how often the contacts communicate with the user. For example, empirical evidence suggests that communication frequency in a social network can increase dramatically when a user account is compromised.","At , activity related to a duration of communications can be identified. Duration of communications can comprise how long a conversation, chat, send\/response occurrence lasts. For example, when using IM or texting for communication, a user and contact may send messages back and forth during a chat or conversation, which can be identified as a duration of communication. As another example, a user's email length, or send\/response to an email chain can be identified as a duration of communication. For example, empirical evidence suggests that a duration of a communication may be significantly shorter when an online user account is compromised.","At , activity related to a mode of communications can be identified. Modes of communications may comprise email messaging, instant messaging (IM), text messaging, voice messaging, video messaging or chatting, posting to a message board, posting a comment to online content, posting an update to a status stream, uploading content to an online service, micro-blogging on an online service, and blogging using an online service, among others.","Further, different modes of communication may respectively comprise different trust levels. For example, a video and\/or a voice message may have a high trust level, as an identity of the contact can more easily be confirmed. As another example, an IM may have a lower level of trust than a video message, as it may be more difficult to confirm an identity of the sender. However, the IM may have a higher level of trust than a posting to a message board, as the posting is typically a one way communication. Empirical evidence suggests that a number of communications utilizing a communication mode that has a lower trust level often increase when an online user account is compromised. For example, video and voice messaging or chatting will typically be eliminated when an account is compromised, and emailing, posting, and IM often increase in frequency.","At , activity related to a direction of communications can be identified. For example, the user can send or broadcast communications to contacts, and the user may receive communications from contacts. Typical communication activity for a user account may comprise a mix of sending and receiving communications in different proportions. Empirical evidence suggests that when a user account is compromised, for example, the attacker will usually just push communications out to contacts, and then move on to another venture. In this example, the empirical evidence would suggest that the proportion of communication direction will change significantly (e.g., to much more sending).","At , activity related to a type of contact associated with the communications can be identified. For example, contacts linked to the online user account may be grouped by age, such as how long they have been linked to the account. As another example, communications may be sent from the online user account to contacts linked to the network associated with the account (e.g., friends in the user's account, or contacts in the user's address book\/contact list). Further, for example, communications can be sent to contacts that are not from the user account (e.g., addresses that are not linked to the user's social network, or are not found in the user's online address book\/contact list). Empirical evidence suggests that a frequency of non-network communications (e.g., communications to entities with which the user does not have an existing online relationship) increases when an account is compromised.","In one embodiment, the historical activities related to the communication activity segments described above (e.g., and\/or others) can be identified, for example, and used to create a typical use profile for the online user account. In this embodiment, this profile may be used to generate a baseline for the account.","At , a baseline value may be generated for identified activity segments. In one embodiment, a baseline value may be determined for the respective identified activity segments, and\/or a baseline value may be determined for combination of one or more of the activity segments indentified for the online user account.","For example, a ratio value may be identified for outgoing versus incoming communications, a percentage value may be identified for respective modes of communications used by the user of the account, and\/or an average (e.g., median or some other statistic) duration value may be identified for the account. Baseline values may also be developed for combinations of activity segments, for example, such as a percentage of outgoing messages to non-network contacts, and a percentage (frequency) of incoming messages using email.","In one embodiment, at  in the example embodiment , the baseline data (e.g., values) may be used to train a classifier to identify a deviation from the baseline, and\/or identify a potential compromised online user account. For example, a trained classifier can be used to classify input data, such as from an activity segment (e.g., account communications), to generate an output classification of the data (e.g., a deviation, a probability of being compromised).","The classifier can be trained over sets of data having a known classification, such as by training over a set of communication frequencies of outgoing emails that are known to be associated with a compromised account; and over sets of known baseline data for the account. In this way, for example, the trained classifier can assign a probability to input data, where the probability may identify no deviation, a deviation, and\/or deviation comprising a potentially compromised account.","In one aspect, the established baseline (e.g., initially established for the account, and\/or updated periodically) can be used to compare against monitored ongoing activity for the online user account.  is a flow diagram illustrating an example embodiment  where the baseline may be used to detect a deviation in the online user account. At , the online user account can be monitored (e.g., periodically or continually) for activity related to one or more activity segments associated with the baseline. For example, at periodic intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), which may be set by an administrator or the user of the online account or by a default setting in the account, the use of account related resources associated with one or more activity segments, used to establish the baseline, may be identified.","At , an activity segment value can be determined for respective activity segments being monitored. In one embodiment, the activity segment value may be determined in a same manner as was used to determine the baseline value, described above. For example, if a baseline value comprised a percentage of total outgoing IMs that were sent to non-network contacts, the comparative activity segment value may be determined in a same manner. As another example, if a combination of activity segments were used to establish the baseline value, the same combination of activity segments from monitored activity can be used. In this way, for example, when comparing the activity segment value to the baseline value to determine a deviation, the same type of value is used.","In one embodiment, the monitored activity segment data may be applied to (e.g., input into) a trained classifier. In this embodiment, detecting a deviation can comprise inputting one or more activity segment values from a desired period of activity (e.g., periodic or continual) for the online user account into the classifier trained. The classifier can output a probability of a compromised online user account. For example, the periodically identified data may be entered to the classifier to determine a classification for that period, and\/or continually collected data may be entered into the classifier to continually identify whether a deviation is present for the account (e.g., likelihood of compromised account at any point in time).","In one embodiment, detecting a deviation for the online user account can comprise comparing activity from one or more activity segments with a desired deviation threshold from the baseline. A desired deviation threshold can comprise a value that is set by the user of the account, for example, or may be determined by a service providing the account monitoring activity. For example, the threshold value may be determined by empirical evidence (e.g., using known compromised accounts to identify deviation values for an activity segment), can be determined by statistical variation (e.g., applying standard deviation calculations from a group of online user accounts to the users account), and\/or may be set using a default value (e.g., which may be updated by the user and\/or periodically by using periodically collected data).","At , if an activity segment value comprises a deviation from the baseline value for that activity segment (e.g., singly or in combination with other activity segment values), the activity segment value can be compared to the deviation threshold value. If the activity segment value does not meet (e.g., or exceed) the threshold value (NO at ), the online user account can continue to be monitored (e.g., periodically or continually). If the activity segment value meets (e.g., or exceeds) the threshold value (YES at ), the online user account can be identified at potentially compromised.","At , the user of the potentially compromised online user account can be notified, and provided a suggestion to mitigate the problem (e.g., take corrective action to sanitize the account, contact the provider, and\/or change security information). In one embodiment, when notifying the user, a notification can be sent using a mode of communication that is identified as having a low probability of being compromised. For example, if a users social network account comprises emails, IMs, and posting modes of communication, the users text-based, voice-based, and\/or video-based modes of communication may be less likely to be compromised. Further, text, voice and\/or video-based modes of communications may have a higher trust level, as they are typically easier to verify a sender's true credentials.","At  in the example embodiment , contacts of the online user account can also be notified of the indication of the potentially compromised online user account. For example, a malicious account hijacker may utilize the user's contacts to attempt to hijack more accounts. Often, an account hijacker will send communications to contacts of the hijacked account in an attempt to gather security information for the contact's account (e.g., or to send malicious code), for example. In this example, because the communications come from a supposedly trusted source (the user), the contact may be more likely to provide information to the hijacker (or download malicious code).","In one embodiment, notifying the contacts can comprise sending a notification to respective contacts of the online user account using a mode of communication that is identified as having a high communication trust level. As described above, those communication modes that provide a better ability to verify an identity of the sender may be considered to have a higher trust level, such as voice and\/or video communications. Therefore, for example, a voicemail message may be sent out to respective contacts from the user, notifying of the potential compromised nature of the account, and suggesting that the contact consider taking corrective actions (e.g., changing security information for the account).","A system may be devised that helps a user of an online account (e.g., email account, social network, aggregation service, etc.) identify when their account is potentially compromised (e.g., by a malicious hijacker). A user's account related activities, such as communication-related activities, are typically found to stay within a normal use pattern. That is, for example, a number of emails sent and received during any given month for the user account usually remains within a given range. These normal use patterns (e.g., baselines) can be used to detect when the online user account deviates from normal use, for example, to a point indicative of the account being compromised by a hijacker.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","404","450","456"]},"In one embodiment, the baseline establishing component  may identify a baseline value for one or more activity segments associated with the online user account . For example, an activity segment can comprise a user  (e.g., owner) of the account performing some activity that is linked with the online user account , such as posting to a message board for the account, sending a message to one or more contacts  linked to the account, uploading content to a status stream for the account, and others.","In one embodiment, the baseline value can comprise a statistical value, for example, which may be identified for respective activity segments, and\/or may comprise a statistical value for a combination of activity segments. In this embodiment, the statistical value for an activity segment may represent a frequency of communications between the user and one or more contacts of the online user account. For example, a mean value for a daily number of communications may be used as a frequency statistic (e.g., average number of combined communications per day, both incoming and outgoing). As another example, a frequency statistic can represent a subset of an activity segment, such as a mean value for a daily number of outgoing communications, or merely outgoing emails, for example.","Further, in this embodiment, the statistical value for an activity segment may represent a duration of communications between the user and one or more contacts from the online user account. For example, a median value of communication durations over a desired period (e.g., last week) may be identified. A communication duration may be represented in terms of time (e.g., for voice chats, text chats, IMs, etc.), and\/or may be represented in terms of a number of send-response segments (e.g., a number of texts, IMs, comments\/responses, or emails sent back and forth during a same conversation\/thread), for example. Further, as an example, the statistical value for communication duration may represent a subset of the activity segment, such as a median duration of IMs, or a median duration of outgoing IMs, for example.","Additionally, in this embodiment, the statistical value for an activity segment may represent a mode of communications between the user and one or more contacts from the online user account. For example, a percentage of all modes of communication may be identified for respective modes used for the online user account. As an example, the user may utilize email for twenty-five percent of all communications associated with the account, IMs for ten percent of communications, postings for forty percent, and so-on. As another example, statistics for respective communication modes may be applied to various subsets of the activity segment, such as seventy percent of email communications are outgoing and thirty percent of email communications are incoming, or where email is used for twenty-five percent of all communications (incoming and outgoing), fifteen percent of all outgoing communications comprise email, for example.","In this embodiment, the statistical value for an activity segment may also represent a direction of communications between the user and one or more contacts from the online user account (e.g., outgoing and incoming communications), and\/or a type of contact associated with a communication with the user (e.g., in network versus out-of-network contacts). For example, a percentage of total communications may be identified for outgoing messages and incoming messages. Further, for example, a statistical value may be applied to a subset of all the outgoing messages, such as a percentage of outgoing texts. Additionally, for example, a statistical valued for a type of contact may comprise an average number of messages sent to non-network contacts per day. A subset of the type of contact activity segment may comprise an average number of incoming comments to posted messages from in-network contacts, for example.","In the exemplary system , a deviation detection component  is operably coupled with the processor . The deviation detection component  is configured to detect a deviation from the baseline that is indicative of a potentially compromised online user account. In one embodiment, the deviation detection component  can be configured to compare the baseline with monitored activity for the online user account  from a desired period of time in order to determine if a deviation of the monitored activity from the baseline meets a desired potential compromised account threshold.","For example, a threshold value may be identified, such as from empirical data and\/or statistically generated data, that represents a deviation indicative of a potentially compromised account. For example, empirical evidence suggests that when an account is compromised by a malicious hacker outgoing emails to non-network (out-of-network) contacts may increase by a certain percentage (e.g., or a mean value of outgoing emails per day increase by a certain percentage). This data may be used by the deviation detection component  to establish a threshold value to compare against a monitored value for an activity segment (e.g., outgoing communications), for example.","The exemplary system  further comprises a user notification component  that is operably coupled with the processor . The user notification component  is configured to notify the user  of the online user account  that the indication of the potentially compromised online user account has been detected. In one embodiment, the potentially compromised online user account may comprise a social network account that is being utilized by an unauthorized user, such as over the network .","In this embodiment, the user notification component  may identify a mode of communication with the user  that is less likely to be compromised by the unauthorized user, and can use this identified mode to send a notice  to the user . Further, in one embodiment, the notice  may also prompt the user  to disinfect their account , and\/or update security information for the account (e.g., passwords, security questions, etc.). Additionally, in one embodiment, the user notification component  may notify contacts  for the online user account , such as over the network , that the users account may be compromised. In this way, for example, the contacts  can take steps to mitigate their accounts being compromised (e.g., by the malicious hijacker of the user account).","In one embodiment, a classification component  may be utilized by the exemplary system . In this embodiment, the classification component  can be configured to determine a baseline value using input from one or more activity segments from historical activity for the online user account. For example, a computer-based classifier can be trained to determine baseline values for activity segments of the online user account, and when updated historical data (e.g., from a recent day, week, month, or desired period) is input to the trained classifier, the output can comprise the (updated) baseline value for the activity segment (e.g., or combination of activity segments).","In one embodiment, the classification component  can be configured to determine a monitored value for the online user account  using input from one or more activity segments from a desired period of time for activity from the online user account. For example, ongoing monitoring data (e.g., periodically or continually collected) from the online user account, comprising data from one or more activity segments, can be input to the trained classifier. The ongoing monitoring data can comprise data from the same activity segments collected and evaluated for the baseline values, for example. In this embodiment, for example, the output result can comprise a monitoring value that may be compared to the baseline value, such as by the deviation detector . In this way, in this embodiment, the deviation detector can determine whether the monitoring data value comprises a deviation that meets a potentially compromised account threshold.","In another embodiment, the classification component  can be configured to determine a compromised account probability using input from the baseline and from monitored activity, from a desired period of time, for activity from the online user account. For example, the classification component may be trained over a set of baseline data, and a set of known compromised account data. In this embodiment, for example, monitoring data (e.g., collected from a desired period of time) can be input to the classification component  (e.g., comprising the trained classifier), and the output can comprise a probability that the online user account  is in a compromised state. In this example, a higher probability value may indicate a higher likelihood that the account is compromised, where a probability threshold may be applied, such as to trigger a notice  from the user notification component .","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer-readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in , wherein the implementation  comprises a computer-readable medium  (e.g., a CD-R, DVD-R, or a platter of a hard disk drive), on which is encoded computer-readable data .
