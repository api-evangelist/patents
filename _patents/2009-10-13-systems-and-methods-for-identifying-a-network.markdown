The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to network access and more particularly to identifying and accessing a network.","2. Related Art","Conventionally, hotspots may be established in areas where users are not known in advance. Examples of hotspots may comprise hotels, coffee shops, campuses, and other public or private locations where digital device users may be interested in connecting to a communication network such as the Internet. Typically, these hotspots are wireless.","In many embodiments, the hotspots require the users to be authorized. Thus, the user is typically required to perform a login process before the user's digital device is allowed access to the hotspot. A common login process comprises opening a web browser and connecting to a captive portal website where a user name and password may be entered. Another process may require the user to provide payment information. After confirmation of the payment, an access point will allow the user's digital device access to the hotspot.","Unfortunately, not all digital devices have browser capability. Such digital devices may include, for example, Wi-Fi VoIP phones, cameras, and MP3 players. These digital devices, typically, do not include a web browser or mechanism to enter credentials or payment information. As a result, it is difficult for these digital devices to use hotspots.","One conventional solution to this problem is to pre-configure credentials into the digital device. However, this would require that credentials for all hotspots that the user plans on using be known at the time of configuration. It may also require that the user be registered with, or subscribe to, all the hotspots. Furthermore, new hotspots cannot be accessed by this preconfigured digital device unless the digital device is updated (e.g., downloaded to the digital device over a fully functional network connection). A yet further disadvantage is that the digital device must comprise enough memory to store all the credential information.","Exemplary systems and methods for identifying a wireless network are provided. In exemplary embodiments, a method comprises receiving, by a digital device, network information associated with a network, generating an access identifier based on the network information, generating a credential request including the access identifier, providing the credential request to a credential server, receiving a credential request response from the credential server, the credential request response comprising network credentials to access the network, and providing the network credentials to a network device to access the network.","The access identifier may comprise an SSID associated with the network. The access identifier may also comprise an IP address. In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining if the IP address is not part of a private non-routable address block and determining to generate the credential request including the IP address based on the determination that the IP address is not part of the private non-routable address block.","The network information comprises XML data. The access identifier may comprise a URL from the XML data and\/or a location from the XML data. In some embodiments, generating the access identifier comprises formatting the URL and\/or the location. Further, formatting the URL and\/or the location may comprise selecting a domain from the URL, removing punctuation from the domain and\/or the location, removing white space from the domain and\/or the location, and truncating a combination of the URL and\/or the location to a limited number of characters.","The network information may comprise a captive portal redirection page. In some embodiments, the access identifier comprises at least a part of a URL from the captive portal redirection page, at least a part of a title from the captive portal redirection page, or both.","An exemplary system may comprise a processor and an access ID module. The processor may be configured to receive network information associated with a network, generate a credential request including the access identifier, provide the credential request to a credential server, receive a credential request response from the credential server, the credential request response comprising network credentials to access the network, and provide the network credentials to a network device to access the network. The access ID module may be configured to generate an access identifier based on the network information.","In various embodiments, an exemplary computer readable medium comprises executable instructions. The instructions may be executable by a processor to perform a method. The method may comprise receiving, by a digital device, network information associated with a network, generating an access identifier based on the network information, generating a credential request including the access identifier, providing the credential request to a credential server, receiving a credential request response from the credential server, the credential request response comprising network credentials to access the network, and providing the network credentials to a network device to access the network.","In order to obtain network credentials to provide to a secured wireless access point for access to a network, the laptop may be configured to receive an access identifier (e.g., SSID) associated with the secured wireless access point and provide the access identifier to a credential server. The credential server may use the access identifier to identify network credential(s) and provide the network credential(s) back to the laptop. The laptop can then provide the network credentials to the secured wireless access point to obtain network access. A network credential is any information (e.g., username, password, certificate, and\/or encryption key) necessary to obtain network access. An access identifier is any information that may be used to identify the secured wireless access point, a wireless network associated with the secured wireless access point, and\/or a business associated with the secured wireless access point.","In some embodiments, the secured wireless access point may not allow the laptop to send information over the wireless network to a network server until after the secured wireless access point receives the network credential. The laptop may be configured, however, to provide the access identifier, such as an SSID of the secured wireless access point, to the credential server in a DNS message. In one example, the secured wireless access point may be configured to allow the laptop access to a DNS server. The laptop may format the access identifier received from the secured wireless access point in a DNS message which is then directed to the DNS server via the secured wireless access point (e.g., through port  or a local DNS proxy). The DNS server may then forward the DNS message to the credential server which may then return the network credentials back to the laptop.","Unfortunately, there are cases in which an SSID is not available from the secured wireless access point (e.g., the SSID is not available or cannot be obtained). In various embodiments, the access identifier may still be obtained or generated from the secured wireless access point. In various embodiments, the access identifier may comprise an IP address or information from a captive portal redirection page. A captive portal redirection page is any web page that is provided to the laptop prior to access to the network being granted. The IP address may be the IP address associated with the secured wireless access point and\/or a DNS resolver. The captive portal redirection page may comprise an XML data and\/or other information which may be used as an access identifier.","In some embodiments, a WISPr network may provide a redirection page that comprises XML data which contains information that may be used to generate the access identifier. In some examples, the XML data may contain a URL and\/or a name of a location. The laptop may extract the domain name for the URL to generate the access identifier. The laptop may also combine the URL and location name to generate the access identifier.","Alternately, if the XML data is unavailable (e.g., the network is not a WISPr network) a domain portion of the redirection target within the captive portal redirection page may be used to generate the access identifier. Alternately, an HTML title text of the page being redirected to may also be used. Further, in some embodiments, the laptop may combine the domain portion and the HTML title text to generate the access identifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","104","116","102","102","104","108","112","114"]},"In various embodiments, a hotspot comprises the network device , the authentication server , the DNS server , and the access controller  which are coupled to the local area network  (e.g., a \u201cwalled garden\u201d). The network device  may comprise an access point which allows the digital device  to communicate with the authentication server , the DNS server , and the access controller  over the local area network . The digital device  may comprise a laptop, mobile phone, camera, personal digital assistant, or any other computing device. The authentication server  is a server that requires network credentials from the digital device  before allowing the digital device  access to communicate over the communication network . The network credentials may comprise a username, password, and login procedure information. The DNS server  provides DNS services over the local area network  and may relay requests to other DNS servers (not shown) across the communication network . The access controller  is an access device such as a router or bridge that can allow communication between devices operationally coupled to the network device  with devices coupled to the communication network .","Although the hotspot in  depicts separate servers coupled to the local area network , those skilled in the art will appreciate that there may be any number of devices (e.g., servers, digital devices, access controllers, and network devices) coupled to the local area network . In some embodiments, the local area network  is optional. In one example, the authentication server , the DNS server , and the access controller  are coupled directly to the network device . In various embodiments, the authentication server , the DNS server , and the access controller  may be combined within one or more servers or one or more digital devices. Further, although  depicts wireless access, the digital device  may be coupled to the network device  wirelessly or over wires (such as 10baseT).","In order to access the communication network , the authentication server  may require the digital device  to provide one or more network credentials for access to the hotspot. The network credential may comprise, for example, a username and password for an account associated with the hotspot. In alternative embodiments, network credentials other than a user name and password may be utilized.","According to exemplary embodiments, the digital device  may dynamically acquire the network credentials from the credential server . The digital device  may send a credential request comprising an identity of the digital device  (or the user of the digital device ) and details about the network device  (e.g., name of the network device  or Wi-Fi service provider) such as an access identifier to the credential server .","In one example, when the digital device  enters the hotspot, the network device  may provide an IP address to which DNS queries may be submitted, for example, via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). The credential request may be formatted as a standard protocol. In an example, the credential request may be formatted as a DNS request. The credential request may be a text record request (e.g., TXT), which comprises a standard record type such that the network infrastructure (e.g., the access controller ) will not block the request.","In some embodiments, the credential request is received by the DNS server  which may forward the credential request to the credential server  for the network credential. In exemplary embodiments, the credential server  may perform a lookup to determine the proper network credential(s) to send back to the DNS server  which forwards the network credential back to the requesting digital device . In various embodiments, the proper network credential(s) are sent from the credential server  to the digital device  over the same path as the transmission of the credential request.","More details regarding the process for determining and providing the network credentials at the credential server  are provided in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/899,739, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Providing Network Credentials,\u201d filed Sep. 6, 2007. Although only one DNS server  is depicted within , the credential request may be forwarded through any number of servers, including but not limited to DNS servers, prior to being received by the credential server . In other embodiments, the credential request is forwarded directly from the network device  to the credential server .","In some embodiments, a credential request response from the credential server  may comprise the username, password and\/or login procedure information. The login procedural information may comprise, for example, HTML form element names, submission URL, or submission protocol. In some embodiments, the network credential response may be encrypted by the credential server  using an encryption key associated with the digital device  prior to transmission back to the digital device .","Once the digital device  receives the network credential response, the digital device  may submit the network credential (retrieved from the network credential response) to the network device  in an authentication response. In exemplary embodiments, the authentication response may be forwarded to an authentication server  for verification. In some embodiments, the authentication server  may comprise an AAA server or RADIUS server.","It should be noted that  is exemplary. Alternative embodiments may comprise more, less, or functionally equivalent components and still be within the scope of present embodiments. For example, as previously discussed, the functions of the various servers (e.g., DNS server , credential server , and authentication server ) may be combined into one or two servers. That if, for example, the authentication server  and the DNS server  may comprise the same server, or the functionality of the authentication server , the DNS server , and the access controller  may be combined into a single device.","Referring now to , the exemplary digital device  is shown in more detail. In exemplary embodiments, the digital device  comprises a processor , input\/output (I\/O) interface(s) , a communication network interface , a memory system , and a storage system . The I\/O interfaces  may comprise interfaces for various I\/O devices such as, for example, a keyboard, mouse, and display device. The exemplary communication network interface  is configured to allow the digital device  to allow communications with the communication network  and\/or the local area network . The storage system  may comprise various databases or storage, such as, for example, a DDID storage  which stored a digital device identifier for the digital device .","The storage system  comprises a plurality of modules utilized by embodiments of the present invention to access the hotspot. In one embodiment, the storage system  comprises a network module , a credential engine , a network access engine , and an encryption\/decryption module . Alternative embodiments of the digital device  and\/or the memory system  may comprise more, less, or functionally equivalent components and modules.","The network module  may be configured to perform operations in order to access the local area network . In some embodiments, the network module  may receive and transmit communications associated with accessing the hotspot. The network module  may also perform a search for the communication network . For example, if the network module  determines that there is no access to the communication network , embodiments of the present invention herein may be practiced.","The exemplary credential engine  is configured to obtain the network credential. In exemplary embodiments, the credential engine  may comprise a request module , a verification module , a retrieval module , and an access ID module . The exemplary request module  is configured to generate a credential request for the network credential. The credential engine  may also receive a credential request response (via the network module ) and verify, via the verification module , that the credential request response is from the credential server . The exemplary retrieval module  is configured to analyze the credential request response to obtain the network credentials. The process for obtaining the network credential will be discussed in more details in connection with  below.","The exemplary access ID module  is configured to receive network information from the network (e.g., a wired or wireless network) and\/or the network device  and generate an access identifier based on the network information. In one example, the digital device  may scan for a wireless network. The network device  may provide network information regarding the network. The network information may comprise information that identifies the network and\/or requests information for access. In some examples, the network information may comprise information regarding how to access the network, an SSID, a name of the network, a name of the network device , an IP address, a web page (e.g., a captive portal redirection page), or the like.","For example, the access ID module  may retrieve an SSID from the network information and generate an access identifier based on the SSID. In one example, the access identifier comprises the SSID. In another example, the access identifier comprises an encoded SSID. The access identifier may be incorporated within the credential request. The credential server  may identify the correct network credentials based, at least in part, on the access identifier.","The access ID module  may generate an access identifier from many different types of network information. In some networks, an SSID is not available (e.g., due to the lack of a suitable application programming interface (API) or when using a wired network interface). If the SSID is not available, the access ID module  may generate an access identifier based on an IP address within the network information, a URL, a location, a title of a captive redirect portal page, or a combination of any of the above. In one example, the access ID module  may generate an access identifier based on a domain of a URL of the captive redirect portal page.","The access ID module  may also combine different types of information from the network information. For example, the access ID module  may combine a URL from the captive redirect portal page and a name from the page to create a single access identifier. In another example, the access ID module  may combine a URL and location information from XML data of the network information to generate the access identifier. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the information may be formatted in many ways to condense the access identifier (e.g., combine the URL and title while removing spaces and special characters) or expand the access identifier (e.g., adding deliminators). In some embodiments, the access identifier may be formatted to comply with external protocol restrictions (e.g., character set and length limitations for DNS domain names). Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that the access ID module  may be configured to generate multiple access identifiers. All or some of the access identifier may be encoded. In one example, the access identifier is hex encoded.","The exemplary network access engine  is configured to receive an authentication request and provide an authentication response to the network device  comprising the network credential. The network access engine  may comprise an authentication record module , a field module , and a submit module . The exemplary authentication record module  is configured to identify an authentication record associated with the digital device . The field module  identifies fields or elements in the authentication record and provides the proper element inputs (e.g., network credential) in the fields. The submit module  is configured to automatically submit the authentication record to the network device  as the authentication response. The process for providing the authentication response is discussed in more details in connection with  below.","The encryption\/decryption module  is configured to encrypt or decrypt communications sent\/received by the digital device . In some embodiments, the credential request response may be encrypted by the credential server . In these embodiments, the encryption\/decryption module  will decrypt the credential request response. In some embodiments, the encryption\/decryption module  may establish a secure communication via SSL and\/or https between the digital device  and the authentication server . It should be noted that, in accordance with some embodiments, the encryption\/decryption module  may be optional or not required.","Referring now to , a flowchart  of an exemplary method for providing communication network access to the digital device  is shown. In step , the digital device  enters a hotspot. For example, a user may turn on their digital device  in a coffee shop or hotel where communication network access (e.g., hotspot) is available. Once the activated digital device  enters the hotspot, the digital device  may sense the hotspot. For example, the network module  may automatically attempt to access the communication network .","Once operational within the hotspot, the network module  of the digital device  may query the network device  of the hotspot in step . In exemplary embodiments, the network device  comprises the access point for the hotspot. By querying the network device , the network module  may receive one or more IP addresses associated with a central server (e.g., the DNS server ) which may be associated with a service provider. Other information may also be received such as DNS records and gateway records. In exemplary embodiments, the IP addresses may be provided via DHCP. In one embodiment, the network module  may attempt to access a known server to determine whether there is live connection to the communication network .","In step , the digital device  requests and obtains the network credential from the DNS server . The process of step  will be discussed in more details in connection with  below.","Once the digital device  obtains the network credential, the digital device  may provide an authentication response to the network device  in order to access the communication network  via the network device  in step . The process of step  will be discussed in more details in connection with  below.","The network device  will then attempt to authenticate the digital device  by comparing the network credential received in the authentication response. According to one embodiment, the network device  may authenticate the network credential utilizing the authentication server . For example, the network credential may be compared against a database of network credentials stored or associated with the authentication server .","If the network credentials are authenticated, the digital device  will be granted access to the communication network in step . In one embodiment, the authentication server  may instruct the access controller  to allow the digital device  access to the communication network .","Referring now to , a flowchart of an exemplary method for obtaining the network credential (step ) is shown. In step , the network credential request is generated. In accordance with one embodiment, the request module  may construct a string using a DNS structure that may already be on a platform of the digital device . The exemplary DNS string generated by the request module  is discussed in more details in connection with  below.","In step , the generated credential request is sent by the digital device . In exemplary embodiments, the digital device  utilizes one of the IP addresses (of the DNS server ) received from the network device . The DNS string is then transmitted to the selected DNS IP address received by the network module .","In step , the digital device  receives the credential request response. In exemplary embodiments, the credential request response is received from the credential server  via the DNS server . The credential request response may be encrypted. In these embodiments, the encryption\/decryption module  will decrypt the credential request response.","The credential request response is then verified in step . In exemplary embodiments, the credential request response is encrypted. The digital device  (e.g., the verification module ) may decrypt the credential request response. In some embodiments, the credential request response is digitally signed. The digital device  (e.g., the verification module ) may verify the authenticity of the credential request response by decrypting the digital signature or decrypting the credential request response. In alternative embodiments, other mechanisms may be used by the verification module  to authenticate the credential request response.","The network credentials may then be retrieved in step . In exemplary embodiments, the retrieval module  will analyze the credential request response to obtain the network credentials embedded therein. In one example, the retrieval module  identifies data within the retrieval module  (e.g., via delimited fields) and may retrieve an encryption key, a user name, a password, a form identifier, or the like.","Referring now to , a flowchart of an exemplary method for authenticating the digital device  (e.g., providing an authentication response of step ) with the network device  is shown. In step , an authentication request is received from the network device  by the network module .","The authentication record module  then identifies and retrieves an authentication record in step . In exemplary embodiments, the authentication request from the network device  may comprise HTML form element names associated with an authentication record in which the network credential may be provided. The authentication record module  may parse out the form(s)\/authentication record(s) needed for logging in with the network device , for example, via the name or identifier (e.g., login form).","In step , the field module  determines field(s) or elements(s) within the authentication record that require an authentication input (e.g., network credential). According to exemplary embodiments, the field module  will analyze the authentication records identified and retrieved in step  to find input fields. As such, a list of these input fields may be generated (e.g., a linked list of forms and input fields).","In step , network credentials are associated with the determined fields) or element(s). In exemplary embodiments, the field module  will associate a proper network credential with each input element. The association may be based on an input name or identifier found in the script of the HTML of the authentication request. For example, the authentication record may comprise an input element requesting a username or an e-mail address.","An authentication response comprising the authentication record is transmitted in step . According to one embodiment, once the network credential(s) have been associated with the authentication record by the field module , a post is generated. In some embodiments, the authentication record may comprise a plurality of hidden values used to identify the digital device  and session information in addition to network access credentials. Such information and values may include, for example, network device MAC address, session identifier, and other values which may be stored in hidden form elements.","It should be noted that in some embodiments, the authentication request may not be the first webpage presented by the network device . For example, if a user is attempting to sign on at a coffee shop, the first webpage may be a welcome webpage from the coffee shop. This welcome webpage may provide a plurality of login options. In these embodiments, a unique fragment of a URL associated with the authentication request may be embedded on the first webpage. As a result, the digital device  (e.g., the network module ) may skim through the webpage to find the fragment. Once the fragment is found, the digital device  will perform a get on this subsequent webpage (e.g., authentication request).","Referring now to , an exemplary authentication page  (e.g., authentication record) is shown. The authentication page  may comprise a username field  and a password field . In some embodiments, the username field  may be replaced with an e-mail field or any other field for providing a unique identifier associated with the digital device  or associated user. According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the field module  may automatically fill in the username field  and password field  with the network credentials.","The authentication page  may also comprise an authenticate selector  (e.g., a submit selector or button). The authenticate selector  will submit the network credentials (e.g., user name and password) to the network device . In some embodiments, the submit module  may automatically activate the authenticate selector  once the network credentials have been associated with their respective fields  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["102","102","102","214","114","700","104","702","110"]},"In step , a credential request is generated by the digital device .

Subsequently, the credential request is sent to the DNS server  in step  using one of the IP addresses previously received from the network device .","Based on the credential request, the credential server  is identified by the DNS server  in step .","The credential server  then identifies the network credential needed based on the credential request in step . For example, the credential request may comprise a unique identifier for the digital device . This unique identifier along with the location identifier may be compared against a table of such identifiers at the credential server  to determine the proper network credential. A credential request response is then generated in step  and sent back to the DNS server  in step . The DNS server  forwards the credential request response back to the digital device in step .","The digital device  may then retrieve the network credentials from the credential request response in step . In exemplary embodiments, the retrieval module  will analyze the credential request response to retrieve the network credential embedded therein.","The network credential may then be provided to the network device  in step . An exemplary method for providing the network credentials to the network device  is discussed in connection with  above. Upon verifying the network credentials, the network device  provides network access to the digital device  in step .","Referring now to , an exemplary credential request  is shown in more details. According to exemplary embodiments, the request module  may generate the credential request . In one embodiment, the credential request  may be a DNS string having a structure that comprise a location identifier , a sequence identifier , a signature , a digital device identifier (DDID) , an access identifier , and a version identifier .","The optional location identifier  may indicate a physical or geographic location of the digital device , the network device , the authentication server , or the access controller . In various embodiments, the location identifier  may be used by the credential server  to track the usage of hotspots, users of the digital device , as well as the digital device .","The sequence identifier  may comprise any number or set of numbers used to correspond to a subsequent request to the credential server  to determine if the login is successful. That is, the sequence identifier  provides a correlation mechanism by which verification of the login process may be made by the credential server .","In exemplary embodiments, the signature  comprises a cryptographic signature that is utilized to prevent spoofing. The signature  of the request from digital device  is verified by the credential server . If the signature  is not valid, then the request is rejected by the credential server .","The DDID  comprises a unique identifier of the digital device . For example, the DDID  may comprise a MAC address or any other universally unique identifier of the digital device . In exemplary embodiments, the DDID is retrieved from the DDID storage .","The access identifier  comprises an identifier of the network access point or Wi-Fi service provider. For example, the access identifier  may comprise an SSID or other information as discussed herein. Further, in some embodiments, the access identifier  may comprise the name of the service provider, or the name of the venue operating the network device . The version identifier  may identify the protocol or format of the credential request . For example, a digital device may generate the credential request  and organize the data in a number of different formats. Each different format may be associated with a different version identifier. In some embodiments, the components of the credential engine  and the network access engine  may be updated, reconfigured, or altered over time, which may affect the structure of the credential request .

In another example, the access identifier may comprise any information including the SSID.","The IP module  is configured to identify an IP address in the network information. In some examples, the network information comprises an IP address associated with a network and\/or an IP address associated with a DNS resolver. In some embodiments, when the IP module  identifies an IP address in the network information, the IP module  determines if the IP address is from a private non-routable address block. If the IP address is from a private non-routable address block, the access identifier may not comprise or be based on the IP address since many networks may use the same address ranges.","In some embodiments, the IP module  identifies an IP address associated with a DNS resolver. The DNS resolver may be set to an IP address in a local network in order to allow an access controller to restrict internet access to port . In one example, the IP module  identifies an IP address in the network information and determines that the IP address is not from a private non-routable address block (e.g., by comparing the IP address to commonly used ranges from private non-routable address blocks). The IP module  may then provide the IP address to the access control module  which may generate the access identifier based on (or including) the IP address.","The portal module  is configured to identify useful information from a captive portal redirection page received from the network device . In some embodiments, captive portal implementations will respond to an initial HTTP GET operation by sending back to the digital device  a temporary redirection result code and\/or include a location header in an HTTP header that contains a URL for the browser to access. In various embodiments, the captive portal redirection page may comprise WISPr data.","For cases where the initial redirect does not contain WISPr XML data (either because the network is not using WISPr, or because the XML data is embedded in the main login HTML rather than being attached to the redirect reply), the portal module  may be configured to identify the domain portion of the redirection target and\/or an HTML title text of the page that is being directed to.","For example, the captive portal redirection page may comprise a URL for the domain wireless.nnu.com (e.g., the domain of the page that the captive portal redirection page is redirecting to). The captive portal redirection page may also comprise a title (e.g., the title of the page that is being redirected to) such as \u201cWelcome to Tully's Coffee.\u201d The portal module  may retrieve and send the domain and title to the access control module  which may then generate an access identifier based on the domain and title. In one example, the access control module  generates \u201cwirelessnuucomWelcometoTullysCo\u201d as an access identifier. The credential server  may ultimately receive a credential request and determine the appropriate network credential based on the access identifier.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the credential server  may identify a network credential based on the access identifier in any number of ways. In some embodiments, the credential server  may identify a network credential for a specific network and\/or a specific network device  (e.g., wireless access point) based on the access identifier. In other embodiments, the credential server  may identify a network credential for a variety of networks and\/or variety of network devices based on the access identifier. For example, all Tully's Coffee Shops may share a similar captive portal redirection page with a similar URL and a similar title for a single user or for multiple users. Further, Tully's Coffee Shops may be configured to accept the network credential for network access for one or more users. When the credential server  receives the access identifier \u201cwirelessnuucomWelcometoTullysCo,\u201d the credential server  may retrieve the network credentials for Tully's Coffee Shop and provide the network credential in a credential request response to the digital device  which may then provide the network credential to the network device .","The WISPr module  is configured to identify XML data received from the network device . In one example, the network associated with the network device  is associated with a WISPr network. The network device  may provide the XML data attached to the captive portal redirection page. The XML data may contain sufficient information to create an access identifier. In some embodiments, the XML data may contain a URL to send the network credentials to and the name of the location. The location, for example, may be the title of a page, the name of a digital device, or the name of a business associated with the network and\/or the network device .","In one example, the domain name from a login URL of the XML data provides a usable string for the access identifier. The WISPr module  may identify the URL from the XML data, remove formatting, and provide the resulting string to the access control module  which may generate the access identifier.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the URL may be insufficient because some networks use third party authentication services such as Aptilo who use the same login URL for all partners. In some embodiments, the WISPr module  may identify a URL and a name of a location in the XML data. The WISPr module  may concatenate the location name to the login URL domain, strip punctuation and white space, and\/or, optionally, truncate to 31 characters. Alternately, different elements of an access identifier (e.g., URL and location of XML data or URL and title of a captive portal redirection page) may be encoded as separate elements. For example, the access identifier may comprise \u201cwirelessnnucom.welcometoullyscoffee.a0.dsadns.net.\u201d In some embodiments, the access control module  is configured to not strip white space or punctuation when generating the access identifier. The access control module  may or may not hex encode the generated access identifier. In other embodiments, the location and\/or login URL domain are not reformatted or altered at all. The result may then be provided to the access control module .","The following is exemplary XML data (from a Wayport location) that may be identified by the WISPr module :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"<WISPAccessGatewayParam"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"xmlns:xsi=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="]},{"entry":[{},"\u201chttp:\/\/secure.wayport.net\/WayportGISParam.xsd\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<Redirect>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"231pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<AccessProcedure>1.0<\/AccessProcedure>"]},{"entry":[{},"<AccessLocation>wp_18738.101333<\/AccessLocation>"]},{"entry":[{},"<LocationName>Devicescape Headquarters<\/LocationName>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<LoginURL>https:\/\/secure.wayport.net\/roamer_login.adp<\/LoginURL>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"231pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<MessageType>100<\/MessageType>"]},{"entry":[{},"<ResponseCode>0<\/ResponseCode>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/Redirect>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<\/WISPAccessGatewayParam>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"b":["910","910","902"]},"In some embodiments, the credential server  may receive the credential request from the digital device  and retrieve one or more network credentials based on the access identifier \u201csecurewayportnetDevicescapeHead.\u201d The credential server  or the access control module  may change the access identifier if the location is not needed to \u201csecurewayportnet%\u201d where % is a wildcard.

In one example, the access ID module  may be configured to provide an access identifier comprising an IP address associated with a network. The credential server , however, may not be able to identify any network credentials associated with the access ID module . As a result, the access ID module  may receive an access identifier request from the credential server  for a different access identifier. The access ID module  may then search for other information to generate a new access identifier (e.g., based on a URL and location in an XML data block). The access ID module  may continue to negotiate with the credential server  until an access identifier related to network credentials is found or until the access ID module  runs out of information that may be used as an access identifier.","In some embodiments, the credential server  may request a specific access identifier (e.g., a URL and title associated with a captive portal redirection page).

The identified correct network credentials may then be provided to the network device  for network access. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the correct network credentials may be identified in any number of ways.","In step , the network module  scans for and selects an active network. In one example, the network module  scans an area for a wireless network. In another example, the network module  detects a wired network, such as an Ethernet wire.","In step , the digital device  receives network information. The network information may comprise an SSID, IP address, a captive portal redirection page, and\/or XML data.

In one example, the captive portal redirection page is received from the network device . In some embodiments, the access information may comprise the portal redirection page and\/or XML data. In various embodiments, the access ID module  may review pages from the network device  to determine if a login form and title are reached. In one example, the access ID module  may scan a page received from the network device  to determine if the page is blank.
