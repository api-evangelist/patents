No. 61\/367,322, filed on Jul. 23, 2010, by Matthew J. Thompson et al., entitled \u201cMETHOD FOR CREATING INTERACTIVE APPLICATIONS FOR TELEVISION,\u201d which application is incorporated by reference herein.","The present disclosure relates generally to media presentation systems and, more particularly, to the use of interactive applications for television.","Satellite television delivery systems, and other media presentation systems, have become commonplace. Such systems typically include a user interface, usually controlled through a remote control, to assist a user in searching through available content, manipulating features of the media presentation system, or ordering programs for pay-per-view or download.","Typically, the user interface is implemented in a series of menus, lists, and\/or guides that are presented on the monitor of such a system. The elements of the user interface may indicate what programs, movies, music, or other events are scheduled for broadcast at certain times, which programs are scheduled for downloading, the contents of a queue, etc. The user may manipulate such a guide to determine upcoming or current programming by moving a cursor through the guide via a remote control or another similar input device. Further, elements of the guide may be selected to tune to programs or events, where the user may determine the status (e.g., a sports score, the weather, a stock price, etc.) of the program or a related event from the broadcast program itself (e.g., determining a sports score by listening to an announcer). Such a status may not be immediately obtainable if, for example, the broadcast program is at commercial.","Other interfaces are also available, such as interfacing with the system via the internet and controlling a receiver, recorder, or other device using a computer. Scheduling of shows, recording of programs, and other actions can be taken via the computer interface as well as via the remote control.","Since the programming choices have become more complex, users expect to see additional features for content delivery.","To minimize the limitations in the prior art, and to minimize other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses methods, apparatuses, and systems for creating an overlay application for use within a broadcast communications system. A method in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention comprises collecting image data from a computer network, generating at least one selectable area within the image data, associating a function with the at least one selectable area, and selectively displaying the image data on a monitor simultaneously with a broadcast data stream, wherein selection of the at least one selectable area executes the associated function.","Such a method further optionally comprises the associated function comprising retrieving a new image data from the computer network, saving the image data and associated function as an application in a publicly accessible database, restricting access to the saved image data and associated function, and the associated function comprising performing a function on a set-top box.","An apparatus for displaying a broadcast data stream and a user-created overlay application on a monitor in a broadcast communications system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention comprises a receiver, an overlay application controller, coupled to the receiver, a storage device, coupled to the overlay application controller and the receiver, a network interface, coupled to the controller and the receiver, and a user interface, coupled to the controller, wherein at least one user-created overlay application is selected via the user interface, the at least one user-created overlay application comprising image data selected from a computer network and a function associated with at least one selectable area within the image data, wherein the at least one user-created overlay application is selectively displayed simultaneously with the broadcast data stream on the monitor.","Such a system further optionally comprises the associated function comprises retrieving a new image data from the computer network, saving the image data and associated function as an application in a publicly accessible database, restricting access to the saved image data and associated function, the associated function comprising performing a function on a set-top box, the user-created overlay application being created on a computer, and the user-created overlay application being created on a user account associated with the broadcast communication system.","A system for displaying a broadcast data stream and a user-created overlay application on a monitor in a broadcast communications system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention comprises a transmission system for transmitting a plurality of broadcast data streams, a network interface, a receiver for receiving the plurality of broadcast data streams from the transmission system and at least one user-created overlay application from the network interface, an overlay application controller, coupled to the receiver, for executing the plurality of user-created overlay applications, and a user interface, coupled to the receiver, wherein at least one user-created overlay application is selected via the user interface, the at least one user-created overlay application comprising image data selected from a computer network and a function associated with at least one selectable area within the image data, wherein the at least one user-created overlay application is selectively displayed simultaneously with the broadcast data stream on the monitor.","Such a system further optionally comprises the associated function comprising retrieving a new image data from the computer network, saving the image data and associated function as an application in a publicly accessible database, restricting access to the saved image data and associated function, and the associated function comprising performing a function on a set-top box.","Other features and advantages are inherent in the system disclosed or will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and its accompanying drawings.","The example overlay applications and associated methods for use in a media presentation system (e.g., a home entertainment system including a media signal decoder and a television) described herein may be implemented in connection with any type of media broadcasting system including, for example, satellite broadcast systems, cable broadcast systems, radio frequency wave broadcast systems, etc.","By way of illustration, an example broadcast system is described below in connection with  and an example receiver (e.g., set-top-boxes, broadcast signal decoders, etc.) is described in detail below in connection with . Further, while the following disclosure is made with respect to example DIRECTV\u00ae services and systems, it should be understood that many other delivery systems are readily applicable to the described methods and apparatus. Such systems include wired or cable distribution systems, Ultra High Frequency (UHF)\/Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequency systems or other terrestrial broadcast systems (e.g., Multi-channel Multi-point Distribution System (MMDS), Local Multi-point Distribution System (LMDS), etc.), and\/or fiber optic networks.","System Architecture","As illustrated in , an example direct-to-home (DTH) system  generally includes a transmission station , a satellite\/relay  and a plurality of receiver stations, one of which is shown at reference numeral , between which wireless communications are exchanged. The wireless communications may take place at any suitable frequency, such as, for example, Ku-band frequencies. As described in detail below with respect to each portion of the system , information from the transmission station  is transmitted to the satellite\/relay , which may be at least one geosynchronous or geo-stationary satellite that, in turn, rebroadcasts the information over broad geographical areas on the earth that include receiver stations . To facilitate backchannel communications, the receiver stations  may be communicatively coupled to the transmission station  via a terrestrial communication link, such as a telephone line and\/or an Internet connection . The Internet connection  may also facilitate other general data transfers, such as requests and responses to and from one or more servers of a network  and the receiver stations .","In further detail, the example transmission station  of the example system of  includes a plurality of sources of data and\/or information (e.g., program sources , a control data source , a data service source , an overlay application data source , one or more program guide data sources , and an on-demand source ). During operation, information from one or more of these sources , , , , , and  passes to an encoder , which encodes the information for broadcast to the satellite\/relay . Encoding includes, for example, converting the information into data streams that are multiplexed into a packetized data stream or bitstream using any of a variety of algorithms. A header is attached to each data packet within the packetized data stream to facilitate identification of the contents of the data packet. The header also includes a service channel identifier (SCID) that identifies the data packet. This data packet is then encrypted. As will be readily appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art, a SCID is one particular example of a program identifier (PID).","To facilitate the broadcast of information, the encoded information passes from the encoder  to an uplink frequency converter  that modulates a carrier wave with the encoded information and passes the modulated carrier wave to an uplink antenna , which broadcasts the information to the satellite\/relay . Using any of a variety of techniques, the encoded bitstream is modulated and sent through the uplink frequency converter , which converts the modulated encoded bitstream to a frequency band suitable for reception by the satellite\/relay . The modulated, encoded bitstream is then routed from the uplink frequency converter  to the uplink antenna  where it is broadcast toward the satellite\/relay .","The programming sources  receive video and audio programming from a number of sources, including satellites, terrestrial fiber optics, cable, or tape. The video and audio programming may include, but is not limited to, television programming, movies, sporting events, news, music or any other desirable content.","Like the programming sources , the control data source  passes control data to the encoder . Control data may include data representative of a list of SCIDs to be used during the encoding process, or any other suitable information.","The data service source  receives data service information and web pages made up of text files, graphics, audio, video, software, etc. Such information may be provided via the network . In practice, the network  may be the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) or a conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN). The information received from various sources is compiled by the data service source  and provided to the encoder . For example, the data service source  may request and receive information from one or more websites . The information from the websites  may be related to the program information provided to the encoder  by the program sources , thereby providing additional data related to programming content that may be displayed to a user at the receiver station .","The overlay application data source  receives and stores data to be transmitted to and used by the example overlay applications described herein, which provide a user with information (e.g., via the overlay application controller  of ) information regarding, for example, a current event, a program, or a status of a device or component of a media presentation system. Further, in some examples, the overlay application data source  may store a collection of overlay applications to be downloaded by the user to the media presentation device (e.g., a set-top box).","Similar to the data service source , the overlay application data source  may gather data (e.g., stock prices, sports scores, news, weather reports, etc.) from a plurality of servers or other databases via the Internet or other network. Such transfers of information may be carried out using standard network protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, TCP\/IP, etc.). In some examples, the provider of the transmission system  (e.g., DIRECTV\u00ae) may transmit data to the overlay application data source  via internal sources (e.g., a server including promotion or notification information regarding the transmission system ). Further, where an overlay application was provided (e.g., created and made available to the user) by a third party (e.g., a television programming provider), the overlay application data source  may receive data directly from a server dedicated to provide information related to the third party or programming provided by the third party.","The contents of the overlay application data source  may be conveyed to the receiver station  in any of a variety of methods (e.g., similar to the transfer of data between the data source  and the receiver station ). For example, the overlay application data source  may stream data to the receiver station  periodically, continuously (e.g., in a one-way push communication), or upon a request from the receiver station  (e.g., in a push-pull communication) via a local controller (e.g., the overlay application controller  described below in connection with ). Additionally or alternatively, the overlay application data source  may send data to the overlay applications (e.g., which are located on the memory of a set-top box) over the network  (e.g., via the Internet connection  of ) using standard network protocols.","The overlay application data source , which may be coupled to the network  and\/or the other sources of , is one possible source of data for the overlay applications. Additionally or alternatively, the overlay applications may receive data directly from the network  (e.g., from a third party database without accessing the overlay application data source ). In other words, the overlay applications may include the capability to retrieve or receive data from various servers over the network . For example, an overlay application may request data from a news agency database located on a server of the network , which may return data (e.g., headlines associated with a list of top news stories) related to the request. In some examples, the overlay applications may receive data from the media presentation device (e.g., the IRD ) on which they are implemented. For example, an overlay application may request and acquire information regarding an amount of available space on a hard disk used to store on-demand programming.","The program guide data source  compiles information related to the SCIDs used by the encoder  to encode the data that is broadcast. For example, the program guide data source  includes information that the receiver stations  use to generate and display a program guide to a user, wherein the program guide may be a grid guide that informs the user of particular programs that are available on particular channels at particular times. The program guide also includes information that the receiver stations  use to assemble programming for display to the user. For example, if the user desires to watch a baseball game on his or her receiver station , the user will tune to a channel on which the game is offered. The receiver station  gathers the SCIDs related to the game, wherein the program guide data source  has previously provided to the receiver station  a list of SCIDs that correspond to the game. Such a program guide may be manipulated via an input device (e.g., a remote control). For example, a cursor may be moved to highlight a program description within the guide. A user may then select a highlighted program description via the input device to navigate to associated content (e.g., an information screen containing a summary of a television show episode) or active an interactive feature (e.g., a program information screen, a recording process, a future showing list, etc.) associated with an entry of the program guide.","The on-demand (OD) source  receives data from a plurality of sources, including, for example, television broadcasting networks, cable networks, system administrators (e.g., providers of the DTH system ), or other content distributors. Such content may include television programs, sporting events, movies, music, and corresponding information (e.g., user interface information for OD content) for each program or event. The content may be stored (e.g., on a server) at the transmission station  or locally (e.g., at a receiver station ), and may be updated to include, for example, new episodes of television programs, recently released movies, and\/or current advertisements for such content. Via a user interface, which also may be updated periodically, a user (e.g., a person with a subscription to an OD service) may request (i.e., demand) programming from the OD source . The system  may then stream the requested content to the user (e.g., over the satellite\/relay  or the network ) or make it available for download and storage (discussed further below in connection with ). Thus, an OD service allows a user to view, download, and\/or record selected programming at any time.","The satellite\/relay  receives the modulated, encoded Ku-band, Ka-band, or other electromagnetic or optical bitstream and re-broadcasts it downward toward an area on earth that includes the receiver station . In the illustrated example of , the example receiver station  includes a reception antenna  connected to a low-noise-block (LNB)  that is further connected to an integrated receiver\/decoder (IRD) . The IRD  may be a set-top box, a personal computer (PC) having a receiver card installed therein, or any other suitable device.","The receiver station  may also incorporate a connection  (e.g., Ethernet circuit or modem for communicating over the Internet) to the network  for transmitting requests and other data back to the transmission station  (or a device managing the transmission station  and overall flow of data in the example system ) and for communicating with websites  to obtain information therefrom.","In operation of the receiver station , the reception antenna  receives signals including a bitstream from the satellite\/relay . The signals are coupled from the reception antenna  to the LNB , which amplifies and, optionally, downconverts the received signals. The LNB output is then provided to the IRD .","Receiver Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["130","130","210","220","215","210"]},"As illustrated in , the recorder  may be implemented separately from and\/or within the IRD . The recorder  may be, for example, a device capable of recording information on a storage device , for instance, analog media such as videotape, or computer readable digital media such as a hard disk drive, a digital versatile disc (DVD), a compact disc (CD), flash memory, and\/or any other suitable media. The storage device  is used to store the packetized assets and\/or programs received via the satellite\/relay  (e.g., a movie requested from the OD source ). In particular, the packets stored on the storage device  are the same encoded and, optionally, encrypted packets created by the transmission station  and transmitted via the satellite\/relay .","To communicate with any of a variety of clients, media players, etc., the example IRD  includes one or more digital interfaces  (e.g., USB, serial port, Firewire, etc.). To communicatively couple the example IRD  to, for instance, the Internet and\/or a home network, the example IRD  includes a network interface  that implements, for example, an Ethernet interface.","Further, the example IRD  includes an example overlay application controller  to manage and\/or operate a collection of overlay applications that may be executed to display information (e.g., a graphical representation of data related to current events or devices related to the corresponding overlay application) on or in connection with, for example, an element of a user interface (e.g., a program guide) or over broadcast media. Additionally, the overlay application controller  may enable the user to select, configure, and\/or customize one or more overlay applications and a presentation thereof.","In some examples, the overlay application controller  stores the user-defined collection of overlay applications (e.g., in local memory of the IRD ). In some examples, the overlay application controller  may manage a default set of overlay applications created and\/or stored (e.g., on the local memory of the IRD ) by a content delivery system provider (e.g., DIRECTV\u00ae). In some examples, a broader collection of available overlay applications may be stored on an external source (e.g., the overlay application data source  or a third party server coupled to the network ) in communication with the overlay application controller . As described herein, the broader collection of available overlay applications may be accessed via a website, which may be associated with a user account, to enable the user to select additional overlay applications for a collection. Generally, the user may login (e.g., by entering a username and password into input fields of the website) to the account and manage (e.g., modify which overlay applications to include in the collection presented to the user for a selection of which overlay applications to execute) the settings, contents, and\/or configurations of the overlay applications.","As described above, the example overlay application controller  may send and\/or receive data to and\/or from various sources (e.g., the overlay application data source ) via various components (e.g., the network interface , the display device , the LNB ) of the transmission system  to implement the presentation and\/or operation of the overlay applications and information associated therewith. The overlay applications may receive streaming information in a push communication scheme or periodically in a push-pull communication scheme. In some examples, only a select number of overlay applications may be active at a given time. In other words, the user may define a subset of the collection of overlay applications as active or executing. Accordingly, the overlay application controller  may refuse (e.g., block) to accept any data related to inactive overlay applications, thereby increasing efficiency, available bandwidth, and memory space. Such an operation may be facilitated by, for example, setting a designated bit as high for active overlay applications to indicate that data may be received.","The example overlay applications described herein are applications (e.g., applets or widgets) that present a user (e.g., via an overlay) with dynamic and\/or substantially live information associated with, for example, a current event, a program, or a status of an element of the media presentation system on which the overlay applications are implemented. An example overlay application may convey information associated with local weather, sports scores, stock market data, ski reports, airline flight information, currently popular television shows or movies, a time until the start of a certain program, a list of programs currently being watched by other users, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the overlay applications may present the user with information associated with the media presentation system, such as an amount of available hard disk space, the amount of recorded programs in a playlist, the next program scheduled for recording or downloading, etc.","Further, overlay applications may be displayed individually, in a list format, on an overlay application homepage or menu dedicated to the overlay application feature, or in any other configuration as determined by a user, a provider of the overlay applications (e.g., a content provider), or a content delivery system provider (e.g., DIRECTV\u00ae).","Hardware Environment for Creating Applications",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Embodiments of the invention are typically implemented using a computer , which generally includes, inter alia, a display device , data storage devices , cursor control devices , and other devices. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any combination of the above components, or any number of different components, peripherals, and other devices, may be used with the computer .","Generally, the admin program  comprises logic and\/or data embodied in or readable from a device, media, carrier, or signal, e.g., one or more fixed and\/or removable data storage devices  connected directly or indirectly to the computer , one or more remote devices coupled to the computer  via a data communications device, etc. Further, the admin program  may utilize a database  such as a spatial database.","Computer  may also be connected to other computers  (e.g., a client or server computer) via network  comprising the Internet, LANs (local area network), WANs (wide area network), or the like. Further, database  may be integrated within computer  or may be located across network  on another computer  or accessible device.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Creating Applications",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","302","400","308","220"]},"Webpage  is typically an image, e.g., a png file, that is desired by a user to be displayed on display device . Webpage  can be, however, a animated image, video window, or other web-based or other data file as desired.","In the example of , the image is that of a calculator, which includes digits 0-9, a decimal point, arithmetic functions, and a \u201cclear\u201d function, along with a display. The image of webpage , within the scope of the present invention, will have portions of the image, e.g., the digits 0-9, the decimal point, etc., defined by the user as having a specific function and specific sections of the image can then be selected by the user via a remote control while viewing the display device .","Once the desired image, namely, the image of webpage , has been found and selected by the user, the user then enters the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the webpage into another section of admin program  as shown in .","Section  of admin program  is the \u201ccreation tool\u201d  which allows a user to view the image  from webpage . The user, or other creator, then uses cursor control device , or other input devices to computer , to define areas on image  that will create \u201cbuttons\u201d or other selectable areas within image , such that when such areas are selected within image  via a remote control or other input device to IRD , that the overlay application performs a user defined function. Section  of the program can be part of or separate from admin program  as desired.","To assist in this creation, a remote control image  is displayed in section , such that the user can use cursor control device  to \u201cclick\u201d on the cursor buttons and the \u201cselect\u201d button on remote control image  to see how the defined areas on image  will react when displayed on display device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Button definition screen  is activated by admin program  as the user\/creator selects areas within image , whether with cursor control device  or via other inputs to computer , as specific areas are defined within image  to create selectable areas of image  that are then tied to specific desired functions for manipulation of overlay applications created in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.","As the specific areas are defined in image , e.g., the area of each of the digits 0-9, etc., admin program , via definition screen , allows the creator to specify the function  and payload  associated with selection of that area of image . For example, and not by way of limitation, if the selected area of image  is the area associated with the digit \u201c7\u201d in image , then the user can define function  as \u201cretrieve a new web page\u201d and the payload  would be the URL of the desired web page, which would be an image of a \u201c7\u201d that is then displayed as part of image  in the \u201cdisplay\u201d area  of image . So, when the specific area of image  associated with the digit \u201c7\u201d is selected, the created application will retrieve another web image at another URL (that of the \u201c7\u201d) and display that on the overlay application when displayed on display device  (or display device  during construction of the overlay application). As each area of image  are defined, different functions  and payloads  are associated with each given area of image , to create the interactive overlay application. Each area of image , once defined, is then saved via selection of save command , which indicates to admin program  that the user\/creator is done with that particular button creation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"As button definition screen  is populated by the creator of the overlay application, and the definitions of the areas within image  are defined and payloads  and functions  are completed for image , admin program  generates computer code, called button definition code, that appears in the button definition code  portion of section .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Once button definition screen  is fully populated and defined, admin program  defines a selected area  which is indicated to the creator\/user of the overlay application by a cursor or other visual indicator, as to the dimensions of the selected area on image . For each area selected in image , the user populates and saves button definition screen , and goes on to create additional buttons and adds code to button definition screen  through selection of the add button selector . Once all buttons\/areas  are defined for the selected image , the user\/creator then saves the entire overlay application when the final area  is defined.","Once all of the areas within image  are properly defined, and the creator wishes to make the final overlay application available to others, the button definition code in code  portion is saved on computer  and\/or sent to overlay application data source . Overlay application data source , which, in the present example, is a third-party storage facility but can also be stored directly on IRD , is accessible via selection of icon , to upload the created overlay application such that the overlay application is available to other users.","Such uploading of the created overlay application can be controlled by the system  provider, such that any created overlay applications meet legal, technical, security, and other standards placed on system  provider, or meet any other scrutiny that system  provider may choose to place on user-created or third-party created overlay applications.","Displaying Applications",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIGS. 9-11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["220","240","108","220"]},"Overlay application controller  displays a menu , also known as dock , which displays one or more selections that can be chosen by a viewer. Through use of the remote control cursor (or other) keys, the dock  can be selectively displayed along with program image  (which is the web image, data stream, or video stream ) and different overlay applications - can be selected. Cursor  is displayed on selected overlay application , and cursor  can be moved within menu  through the use of the cursor keys on the remote control associated with IRD , or through other means as desired.","As cursor  is moved within menu , the selected overlay application, in this example, application , can, if desired, display a selected application image , which is the image  selected as described above. When the desired overlay application is marked by cursor , e.g., when cursor  is on the overlay application - that the viewer wishes to use, the viewer can then select (via the select button on the remote control or by other methods) the overlay application -. So, for example, once the cursor  is on the \u201ccalculator\u201d overlay application , and the viewer selects that overlay application , the IRD  makes a call to overlay application data source  to retrieve image .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"After selection, menu  can be removed from display device , i.e., selectively not displayed once the overlay application - if that is the desire of the creator\/viewer, and now the cursor keys and other remote control keys will be operable on the defined areas of the overlay application. So, for example, once the calculator overlay application  is selected, the cursor and other keys will now operate on the defined buttons that were defined with button definition screen . As the user moves cursor  on the image  of overlay application , and selects a given area on the image of overlay application , the function \/payload  are activated through overlay application controller , which then performs the function \/payload  associated with that given selected area. For example, when the user places cursor  on the \u201c7\u201d portion of the image , the function  associated with that selection, namely, to call a new URL image of a \u201c7\u201d and display that image of a \u201c7\u201d on image  in area , is performed. Selection of other portions of image  will then cause overlay application controller  to perform those associated functions \/payloads  associated with those areas such that additional webpages or URLs are called by overlay application controller .","As such, each cursor  movement and area selection of defined areas  appears, on display device , to be interactive and running on IRD , although cursor  movement and selection of defined areas  are calling additional URLs and\/or performing functions within IRD  through the use of the remote control associated with IRD  and overlay application controller .","As described above, the contents of the overlay applications may be updated periodically, continuously, or only at times when changes in the information related to the overlay applications are selected or present on menu . As an example, an overlay application  that is related to weather, which is constantly changing, may be updated every five to ten minutes, by a call to a URL by overlay application controller  without selection from cursor . In some examples, the information related to an overlay may not change for a significant period of time and, in such a case, the overlay application may not execute for that dormant time period. For example, because trading markets are open during a portion of the day, an overlay application that displays a stock ticker may only update its information during a portion of the day. Specifically, a stock ticker overlay application may include one mode of operation that enables a receipt of data and another dormant mode of operation (i.e., where data cannot be received). This may free up processing capabilities and bandwidth that would otherwise be wasted.","As described above, the overlay applications and the associated features or characteristics thereof may be linked to and\/or tracked by a user account.","In some examples, different users may share any overlay applications they have created by uploading them to a database (e.g., at the overlay application data source ) for other users of a similar system to download. The list of available overlay applications may also include those created by a third party (e.g., a content provider). For example, the entity responsible for providing a certain game show may create an overlay application that presents a program-related trivia game, a countdown to a next episode, a news ticker regarding the program (e.g., the winner or prize won of the last episode), or an overlay application that is synced with a broadcast of the program to correspond with events of each episode. In some examples, a manufacturer of a component of the media presentation system (e.g., the IRD ) may design and\/or create a troubleshooting overlay application or a overlay application to notify users of available upgrades or other products (e.g., advertisements). Additionally or alternatively, the overlay applications may incorporate advertisements. For example, where a user has set multiple overlays to toggle or cycle, an advertisement may be interjected into the cycle or progression of overlays. Some example overlay applications may be solely dedicated to advertisements, which may cycle and update according to newly available products or sales thereof.","Process Chart",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"Box  illustrates collecting image data from a computer network.","Box  illustrates generating at least one selectable area within the image data.","Box  illustrates associating a function with the at least one selectable area.","Box  illustrates selectively displaying the image data on a monitor simultaneously with a broadcast data stream, wherein selection of the at least one selectable area executes the associated function.","The systems, apparatuses, and methods described above are non-limiting examples.
