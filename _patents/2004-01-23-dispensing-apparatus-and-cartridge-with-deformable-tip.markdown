title: Dispensing apparatus and cartridge with deformable tip
abstract: A device for the treatment of periodontal disease. The device includes a handle that has a configuration familiar to dental professionals and a cartridge that is locked into the handle when use, typically delivery of a composition to a periodontal pocket, is desired. The cartridge provides for effective delivery of compositions, such as agents, as its tip is deformable, typically from a circular to an oval shape so as to flatten. The deformation may be made either manually, by the dental professional, or upon contact with teeth or other tissues, whereby this flattened tip can penetrate deeply into periodontal pockets for quick and direct application of the composition, for example, therapeutic agents.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/112,450, filed on Mar. 29, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,682,348. The entire disclosure of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/112,450, filed on Mar. 29, 2002, is expressly incorporated by reference in this application.","The present disclosure is directed to apparatus, components, and methods of treatment for periodontal disease.","Periodontal disease is an umbrella term for a variety of dental conditions associated with either gingivitis or periodontitis. Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gingiva, commonly known as gums, that is commonly associated with poor oral hygiene and\/or the hormonal state of the patient. If left untreated, gingivitis may develop into periodontitis.","Periodontitis is a bacterial disease in which the infection has progressed to involve the oral tissues that retain the teeth in the jawbone. With this disease the gums become red and inflamed. This condition, if untreated, results in damage to the ligaments and bone holding the teeth in place, and formation of pockets around the teeth. As the pockets become deeper, teeth loosen, to a point where they may fall out. The severity of periodontitis is determined by dentists and other dental practitioners, by measuring the depth of these pockets and reviewing x-rays of the teeth and jawbone.","Periodontal disease involves a different treatment protocol than other oral diseases. While many oral diseases can be treated with proper hygiene, fluoride, pastes, washes and rinses, periodontal disease is often more retractile to treatment. This is because of differences between the oral and periodontal cavities. The oral cavity is essentially an aerobic environment, constantly perfused by saliva. In contrast, the periodontal cavity is more anaerobic, and is perfused by plasma filtrate, known as \u201ccrevicular fluid.\u201d The growth of microorganisms within the periodontal cavity microenvironment may cause periodontal disease. As the disease progresses, the periodontal microenvironment becomes more anaerobic, and the flow of crevicular fluid increases.","Efforts to treat periodontal disease have met with limited degrees of success. This is because the site of the bacterial infections in the periodontal cavity are largely inaccessible to agents present in the oral cavity as well as agents provided to the oral cavity, such as mouthwashes, rinses and the like. Moreover, the increased outflow of crevicular fluid that accompanies periodontal disease inhibits therapeutic agents placed into the oral cavity from entering the pockets.","Oral systemic administration of antibiotics has been shown to be a useful method of controlling subgingival flora. However, because of side effects, such as those of the digestive system, oral systemic administration has had only limited use in treating periodontal disease. Oral systemic therapy also requires frequent dosing, so patient compliance is frequently a problem.","Recently, efforts have focused on delivering therapeutic agents directly to these pockets, in some cases, in a controlled release formulation. In general, administration of agents directly to the pocket permits higher local drug concentrations that can be achieved by systemic administration. Also, some agents such as tissue growth factors must be administered directly to the target site, i.e., the periodontal pocket. Also, as these products are typically administered by dental professionals patient compliance is not of moment here.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,175,326 to Goodson discloses the use of a drug-filled polymer hollow fiber. The disclosed delivery system is tied around a tooth and gently pressed below the margin of the gingiva so that it resides in the periodontal pocket, and can deliver tetracycline for a prolonged period, such as a week or more.","Although these devices may be able to dispense an appropriate drug for a time span of a week or more, they have not been widely used. This is because their application is difficult and time consuming and the device may be dislodged by the patient during tooth brushing, flossing or eating.","The aforementioned disadvantages were overcome by administration of microparticles in dry form to the periodontal pocket by use of an apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,236,355, 5,366,733 and 5,622,498, all to Brizzolara, et al., all three patents are incorporated by reference herein. These patents disclose treating dental diseases by administration of dry microparticles to the periodontal pocket. Microparticles suitable for this purpose may have compositions, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,000,886, 5,143,661 and 5,500,228, all to Lawter, et al., all three of these patents incorporated by reference herein, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,236,355, 5,366,733 and 5,622,498, all to Brizzolara, et al., and may be produced by the methods disclosed in the aforementioned six U.S. patents.","The apparatus, components and methods disclosed herein improve on the contemporary art by providing a dispensing apparatus that can effectively deliver therapeutic agents directly to the periodontal pockets. The apparatus disclosed herein includes a reusable handle that is fitted with disposable cartridges, loaded with a composition, for example, a precise dose of a therapeutic agent. This saves the clinician time, eliminates guessing as to the proper dose, and reduces the amount of disposable instrumentation, making the process more economical. Additionally, the handle includes a body that has a configuration familiar to dental professionals, allowing them to use the disclosed apparatus with greater comfort and less training time. The cartridge provides for effective delivery of compositions, such as agents, as its tip is deformable, typically from a circular to an oval shape, either manually by the dental professional or upon contact with teeth or other tissues, whereby this flattened tip can penetrate deeply into pockets for quick and direct application of therapeutic agents.","An embodiment disclosed is directed to an apparatus for dispensing at least one material to a periodontal pocket. The apparatus has a barrel including a body portion and a tube portion, the tube portion extending from the body portion and including a tip configured for being deformed to at least one geometry different from its initial geometry. There is also a plunger, at least a portion of the plunger slideably housed within the barrel, the plunger configured for contacting a portion of an external force applying member. Additionally, there is a quantity of dry particles, for example a composition such as a therapeutic agent(s) or the like, and at least a portion of the dry particles are within the tip. A cap or closure member may be fitted over the tip to maintain the integrity of the composition until use is desired.","The apparatus is configured for receipt in an external force applying member, for example, a handle with a spring loaded shaft, in a temporarily locking arrangement. When use is desired, the apparatus snaps or locks into the handle and the spring loaded shaft is moved into contact with the plunger, pushing it, so as to push composition out of the tip into the periodontal pocket.","Another embodiment is directed to apparatus for dispensing material. This apparatus is formed of a barrel with a plunger, at least a portion of which is slideably housed in the barrel. The barrel includes a body portion and a tube portion, the tube portion extending from the body portion and including a tip configured for being deformed to at least one geometry different from its initial geometry. The plunger is configured for contacting a portion of an external force applying member.","The apparatus is configured for receipt in an external force applying member, for example, a handle with a spring loaded shaft, in a temporarily locking arrangement. When use is desired, the apparatus snaps or locks into the handle and the spring loaded shaft is moved into contact with the plunger in order to push it, to release a composition, previously loaded into at least the tip, out of the tip to the desired site.","Another embodiment is directed to a method for treating periodontal disease. This method involves providing an apparatus comprising, a force applying member adapted for receiving a barrel of a cartridge and a cartridge. The cartridge has a barrel including a body portion and a tube portion, the tube portion extending from the body portion, and the tube portion ends in a tip, that is configured for being deformed to at least one geometry different from its initial geometry. There is also a plunger, at least a portion of the plunger slideably housed within the barrel, the plunger configured for contacting a portion of the force applying member. There is also a quantity of dry particles, at least a portion of the dry particles being within the tip. The force applying member and cartridge are then placed into operative communication each other, for example, by a temporary locking engagement. The tip is then deformed, for example, to a substantially flattened geometry, and the deformed tip is moved into at least one periodontal pocket. The force applying member can have a portion of it (e.g., a spring-loaded shaft), moved to contact the plunger, moving the plunger so as to deliver the composition to the at least one periodontal pocket.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","24","22","24","24","24","24","30","31","24","30"]},"The handle  is of a configuration and dimensions similar to other dental instrumentation. The handle  is formed of a sleeve , with a fingergrip  surrounding it. A thumb ring , connected to a spring loaded shaft , extends from the sleeve , with the shaft  held in place by a nut member , that includes a threaded portion  () that connects to a correspondingly threaded portion  () on the inner wall  () of the sleeve . The nut member , on a proximal portion (), includes a roughened, knurled or grooved outer surface , to assist the user in gripping, when opening the handle  is desired.","Turning also to , the handle  is separated into the sleeve  () and the shaft  and associated components (). The sleeve  includes a proximal end  and a distal end . The proximal end  includes a threaded portion  along its inner wall , for accommodating the correspondingly threaded portion  on an intermediate portion of the nut member . Moving distally (in a direction away from the thumb ring ), there is a section  for accommodating the spring  and its proximal confinement  and distal confinement , specifically its head . This spring section  chamber includes a reduced diameter portion , that serves as a stop surface for the head of the distal confinement , when the shaft  is pushed distally by the thumb ring .","The distal end  includes a notch (or indent)  at the outer edge  of the sleeve , for receiving a corresponding nub  () on the cartridge , to prevent the cartridge  from rotating in the sleeve  (of the handle ) when the cartridge  (in particular, its flanges , see ) is locked in place in the handle , as detailed below. Proximal of this notch  is a chamber  for accommodating the flanges  of the cartridge  as pushed outward by the body of the distal confinement . The chamber  terminates at a groove  that typically extends continuously around the inner wall  of the sleeve . The groove  is typically triangular in its edges , to accommodate the corresponding protrusions  () on the flanges  () of the cartridge , upon their seating therein, when the cartridge  is locked in the handle .","These triangular edges  allow for removal of the cartridge  from the handle , as the protrusions  of the flanges  can slide over these surfaces , allowing for the release of the cartridge , as detailed below. A section  for accommodating the body of the distal confinement  is intermediate the groove  and the spring chamber .","The shaft  extends (in the distal direction) from the thumb ring  to the shaft end  (distal end). The nut member , proximal confinement , spring  and distal confinement  (formed of a head and a body ) are all torroidal and slideable on the shaft . When the nut member  is attached to the sleeve  (so as to be fixed), in its normal operation, the nut member , at its distal portion , serves as a confinement for the proximal confinement , when the shaft , typically via the thumb ring , is moved in the proximal direction (outwards with respect to the sleeve ). The shaft  includes an outwardly extending ring  at its distal end . This ring , typically molded as part of the shaft , is fixed, and serves to limit distal movement of the distal confinement  for the spring .","Handle  and all components thereof, except the spring , are typically made of materials such as metals and in particular surgical grade steels, for example, 303 Stainless Steel. The spring  is typically made of metals such as surgical grade steels, and for example, stainless steels other then 303 Stainless Steel. Accordingly, the handle , including the spring , is sterilizable and reusable. Handle components may also be made by injection molding of suitable resins.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","b":["5","5","24","100","100","104","106","108","108","114","100","116","106","100"]},"The tube portion  is typically angled, at an angle \u0398, that is for example, approximately 40 to 60 degrees, and for example, in particular approximately 50 degrees, to provide the dental professional (clinician) with easy access to the periodontal pockets. The plunger , enclosed within the barrel  is curved similarly. There may be protrusions  on the outer surface  of the barrel , to provide a tactile indication of a gripping area for the cartridge .","The body portion  is typically a cylindrical segment , with an inwardly tapered portion  to the tube portion , and a collar , at the opposite end. Flanges  extend from the collar . The collar  has an inner diameter less than the inner diameter of the sleeve  (between the inner walls ) of the handle , this collar inner diameter extending to an outer diameter that is greater than this sleeve, such that the collar surface abuts the edge  of the sleeve , so as to limit movement of the cartridge , and in particular, prevent the cylindrical segment  from moving into the sleeve  of the handle . For example, the outer diameter of the collar  is equal to or slightly greater than the outer diameter of the sleeve  of the handle , such that the cartridge  and handle are flush along their outer surfaces.","A nub  protrudes from the collar . This nub  is correspondingly shaped, for example, semicircular here, with respect to the notch  in the handle , for seating therein, to prevent rotation of the cartridge . This nub  could also be any other shape provided that upon seating in the notch , typically correspondingly shaped, the seating will prevent rotation of the cartridge . The nub  is for example, positioned approximately 180 degrees with respect to the bending of the tube portion , for ease of access to the periodontal pocket by the dental professional. However, any other positioning is also suitable.","The flanges  extend from the collar . These flanges , based on the resilience of the material of the barrel , are flexible, and are designed to move radially outward and inward. Protrusions  extend from the outer surfaces of each of the flanges . These protrusions  are typically rounded (but could also be triangular or any other shape that allows for sliding easily out of the grooves ) and configured for seating into the groove  of the handle , so as to create a locking engagement of the cartridge  in the handle . Here, for example, four flanges  are shown in a cylindrical (rounded) orientation, to correspond in shape to the sleeve  and distal confinement body of the handle . However, any number of flanges  is suitable, provided the locking engagement of the cartridge  in the handle  can be attained.","Turning also to , the tube portion  terminates at a tip , that tapers inward. This inward tapering (distally) provides the tip  with reduced inner wall  thickness, allowing the tip , with its initially circular opening  and cylinder shape, to change geometries, and flatten out, such that the opening  and the tip  deform, typically into an oval shape (in cross section) and thus, the tip  flattens. This changing in geometries is done by manual manipulation by the dental professional (prior to use) or upon contact with a tooth or other tissue. This flattening provides greater accessibility and maneuverability of the tip  in the periodontal pocket, as detailed below.","The tube portion  includes a ring protrusion  proximate the tip  that serves in frictionally retaining the cap  on the tube portion  (over the tip ), prior to its removal, when use of the cartridge  is desired.","An amount of a composition  is typically placed (preloaded) into the tip  (and if necessary into the tube portion ). This composition is typically a particulate composition, such as a dry microparticle composition in a sufficient treatment quantity. For example, the composition can be ARESTIN\u2122 minocycline hydrochloride (HCl) microspheres, from OraPharma, Inc., 732 Lewis Drive, Warminster, Pa. 18974, for example, in a 1 mg dosage, or those compositions as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,000,886, 5,143,661, 5,236,355, 5,366,733, 5,500,228, and 5,622,498, all six disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. These compositions can be dispersed in matricies of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, in accordance with the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,498.","For example, dry microparticle compositions may include therapeutic agents, such as antibacterials, antibiotics, antifungal agents, anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, immunostimulatory agents, dentinal desensitizers, odor masking agents, immune reagents, anesthetics, antiseptics, nutritional agents, antioxidants, lipopolysaccharide complexing agents, peroxides, tissue growth factors, or mixtures thereof. The therapeutic agent could also have antibiotic activity.","Exemplary therapeutic agents may be antibiotics such as tetracycline, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a tetracycline, hydrates of a tetracycline and hydrates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a tetracycline. The tetracyclines may be doxycycline, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of doxycycline, hydrates of doxycycline and hydrates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of doxycycline. Also, the tetracycline may be minocycline, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of minocycline, hydrates of minocycline and hydrates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of minocycline.","These exemplary therapeutic agents are in the form of particles and in particular, dry particles. They can typically range from about 0.00001 to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the particles or from about 1 to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the particles, or more particularly from about 4 to about 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the particles.","For example, polymers for the aforementioned matricies may include polyglycolide, poly(l-lactide), poly(dl-lactide), poly-(glycolide-co-lactide), poly-(glycolide-co-dl-lactide), poly(alpha hydroxybutyric acid, poly(orthoesters), poly-(p-dioxanone) and mixtures thereof. The polymers can also be block copolymers of polyglycolide, trimethylene carbonate and polyethylene oxide. These polymers may also be such that they become tacky upon contact with water.","The aforementioned particles of particulate compositions including therapeutic agents, may for example, have particles with diameters ranging from about 0.1 to about 1000 microns, and specifically, from about 10 to about 200 microns, and more specifically, from about 30 to about 120 microns.","The barrel  of the cartridge  is of, for example, as an integral unit, of, for example, polymers, such as olefin homopolymers or copolymers or mixtures thereof, such as polypropylene (e.g., MONTELL PD-626 Polypropylene), or polyethylene. It is typically formed by techniques such as injection molding or the like. The bending (curving) of the tube portion  is performed in a separate step, after the injection molding. The cap  is typically of a polymeric material such as polypropylene, and it may be colored, so it can be easily differentiated from the tube portion .","The plunger  is enclosed within the barrel , in a frictionally tight but slideable engagement.  details the plunger  in a first position, prior to use, while  details the plunger  in a second or post use position (after the plunger  has been pushed its requisite distance by the shaft  of the handle , as detailed below). The inwardly tapered portion  of the cylindrical section  serves as a travel limit for the plunger .","Turning to , the plunger  is shown in detail. In these figures, the plunger  is shown straight and not bent or angled. This is for description purposes, as the plunger , when loaded into the barrel  will conform to the shape of the barrel .","The head  and tail  portions of the plunger  are correspondingly configured with respect to the body  and tube  portions of the barrel , where they reside.","Turning also to , the head portion  is formed of slats , typically with a discontinuous distal outer surface , . These slats  extend from a core , that has a central surface , typically flush with the proximal outer surfaces of the slats . This central surface  is a contact surface for the distal end  of the shaft , that abuts it when movement of the plunger  to release composition  is desired. The head portion  slip fits into the body portion  of the barrel , resting loosely therein. The slats  prevent a gross misalignment of the central surface  and distal end  of the shaft . A trunk segment  of the head portion  serves as a limit of travel for the plunger  in the body portion  of the barrel  when the head portion  is pushed (distally) by the distal end  of the shaft .","The tail portion  extends from the trunk segment . The tail portion  includes a first segment , an intermediate segment  and an end segment (distal end segment) . The first segment  is tapered and thickened, for example, to have an outer diameter that provides the plunger  with strength while avoiding the tendency to bend (bow) or kink if excess pressure is applied by the shaft distal end  of shaft  of the handle . The intermediate segment  is of a lesser diameter less than or equal to that of the first segment .","The end segment  is outwardly tapered (distally) to an edge surface , as shown in . This edge surface  is typically of a diameter greater, typically slightly greater, than the inner diameter of the tip , such that it contacts the inner walls  of the tip . This contact, typically is an interference fit, to provide the friction fit necessary to retain the plunger  in the barrel , while allowing the plunger  to slide in the barrel . It also allows for the composition  to be wiped cleanly off of the inner walls  of the tip , such that the composition is pushed (distally) out of the tip  (through the opening ) to the treatment site, keeping the composition  from moving backwards (proximally) in the tube portion , or alternately keeping the composition from moving between the end segment  and inner walls  leading to jamming of the plunger .","The plunger  is typically an integral member, and made of materials such as polymers, for example, olefin homopolymers, olefin copolymers, and polycarbonate (e.g., Bayer\u00ae 2458-1117-Polycarbonate). The plunger  is formed by techniques such as injection molding or the like. The plunger  is typically of a polymer different than those polymers for the cartridge , so as to provide the plunger  with the ability to move smoothly between the aforementioned first () and second () positions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIGS. 10 and 11","b":["224","100","24","106","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIGS. 12-20","FIG. 12"],"b":["20","24","300","300","24","24","24"]},"A first hand  of the dental professional grips the tray , while a second hand  grips the handle . A cartridge  is then removed from the tray , and moved in the direction of arrow  toward the handle , as shown in . Movement in the direction of arrow  continues until the cartridge  enters the sleeve  of the handle , defining the apparatus  and locks in place, as shown in . The handle  now rests comfortably in the hand  of the dental professional with the thumb  extending through the thumb ring and fingers  on the finger grip  for proper maneuvering. The cap  has now been removed.","Turning to , the locking of the cartridge  in the sleeve  is shown in detail. Here, the cartridge  has been pushed proximally, as the handle  remains at rest, as the thumb ring  is at the \u201cat rest\u201d distance D from the sleeve . The inward or proximal pushing of the cartridge  causes the flanges  to abut the body of the distal confinement , whereby the flanges  spread radially outward. Inward movement continues, until the nub  seats in the notch  (inward movement is made with nub  and notch  in alignment) and the protrusions  engage the groove . This is typically noticed tactilely as well as an auditory \u201cclick\u201d can be detected.","Additionally, the plunger  aligns with the shaft end , whereby the shaft end  contacts the central surface . The plunger  is in the first position, as shown in . Throughout this attachment process, distal resistance is provided by the spring . Locking of the cartridge  is complete, as the nub  is seated in the notch , the collar  is close to or in abutment with the edge  of the sleeve , and the protrusions  of the flanges  are seated in the groove .","The tip , with the composition  therein, is in its normal or at rest geometry, with a circular or substantially circular opening and cross section, as shown in . The dental professional can now manually deform the tip , typically by flattening it with an instrument. This flattening results in the opening  and the tip  having an oval or flattened shape (and geometry), as shown to in .","The dental professional, familiar with thumb ring handle devices, can now maneuver the apparatus , in particular the tip  of the tube portion  of the cartridge  of the apparatus  to the periodontal pocket , between the tooth  and gum , as shown in . Here, the tip , that is now flattened, can be maneuvered deep into the periodontal pocket  (for emphasis, being the mark labeled P), between the tooth  and gum .","In , the composition  can now be released into the pocket. Here, turning also to , the thumb ring  is moved distally (toward the sleeve ), such that the shaft  and distal tip  thereof move distally, forcing the plunger  distally, ultimately to the second position shown in , to force composition  out of the tip  through the opening  and into the pocket .","Alternately, returning to  and its accompanying description, the dental professional can maneuver the apparatus  so as to abut the tooth  or gum , as shown in . This abutment, typically coupled with movement into the periodontal pocket  will cause the tip  to deform its shape, becoming flatter, to reach deeper into the periodontal pocket  (beyond the mark labeled P), as shown in . The process continues, as described for  above.","Returning to , for both operations, with the cartridge , and in particular the tip , exhausted of composition , the apparatus  is manipulated, such that the cartridge is removed from the periodontal pocket , in the direction of the arrow .","Attention is now directed to . Here, the cartridge  has been exhausted as the plunger  is in the second position, as shown in  above. The spring  has caused the distal end  of the shaft  to move out of contact with the central surface  of the plunger , as the distal end  moves proximally toward the thumb ring , and returns to the \u201cat rest\u201d position of the handle .","The thumb ring  is pulled proximally (away from the sleeve ), a distance D plus an additional distance n, expressed D+n. The spring  is compressed, as this proximal pulling takes the body of the distal confinement  out of abutting contact with the flanges , allowing them to spring back, moving radially inward, to their rest or normal positions. The protrusions  of the flanges  no longer seat in the groove , but rather just slightly extend into the groove . This allows for easy manual removal of the cartridge  from the handle , while the cartridge  is retained in an engagement with the handle , should the handle  be pointed downward, so the cartridge  remains in and does not fall out of the handle . This ease in removal is accomplished as the rounded edges of the protrusions , coupled with the triangular edges  of the groove , allow for the cartridge  to be easily pulled out of the sleeve  with minimal force. Once the cartridge  is removed from the handle , the process may be repeated with additional cartridges for as long as desired.","While preferred embodiments of an apparatus, components and methods, have been described above, the description of the apparatus, components and methods above is exemplary only. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.
