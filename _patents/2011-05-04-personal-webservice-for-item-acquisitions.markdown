{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Over the lifetime of an individual, the individual may acquire a number of items. In some cases, the individual may possess the items for a short duration, while in other cases the individual may possess the items for a longer period of time. In any case, information about the items acquired by individuals may be produced by a variety of sources during the period of time that the individual possesses the items.","In a particular example, reviews or articles may be published about items acquired by an individual and\/or posts on discussion boards or blogs may be produced about items acquired by the individual. In another example, manufacturers of items may release information about recalls or safety issues of items produced by the manufacturers and\/or updates to manuals provided with certain items. In an additional example, software updates may be provided by manufacturers of electronic devices, distributors of software applications, and the like. Often individuals may be unaware that supplemental information about items they have acquired is available. Additionally, information about items that individuals have acquired may be stored by the individual in a paper file system that is inconvenient to maintain and does not facilitate efficient access to the information. In some cases, financial services software may store some information about items acquired by the individual, but this information is often limited in scope and application.","This disclosure describes architectures and techniques to provide a personal webservice for items acquired by an individual. In particular implementations, an individual may acquire an item from a merchant. The item may be added to a personal webservice of the individual. The personal webservice of the individual may indicate items that have been acquired by the individual. The personal webservice may also include information about the items, such as respective prices of the items, respective merchants that the individual acquired the items from, respective dates of acquisition of the items, and so on.","In order to identify items acquired by the individual, a service provider offering the personal webservice may obtain information about items acquired by the individual from a number of sources. In some cases, the individual may provide the information to the service provider. For example, the individual may forward an email indicating acquisition of an item to the service provider. Additionally, the individual may capture an image of at least a portion of the item and send the image to the service provider with a message indicating that the individual has acquired the item. In some instances, the image may include an identifier of the item, such as a Universal Product Code (UPC).","The service provider may also obtain information about the acquisition of items by the individual from computing devices of the individual. In a particular implementation, the service provider may send a request to an application residing on a computing device of the individual to obtain information related to the acquisition of items by the individual. In certain situations, the request may be directed to an email application to obtain emails associated with the acquisition of items. In other situations, the request may be directed to a spreadsheet application or a financial services application to obtain information about item acquisitions by the individual.","The service provider may also obtain information about items acquired by the individual from third-party data sources. In one example, the service provider may obtain information from financial institutions, such as banks, credit card companies, credit unions, and the like, to identify information about item acquisitions by the individual. The service provider may also obtain information about item acquisitions by the individual from social networking services (e.g. social networking sites, social networking mobile applications, etc.) and\/or merchants that provided the items to the individual. The service provider may need to provide a proper credential to respective third-party data sources in order to obtain information related to item acquisitions by the individual.","In some scenarios, the service provider may obtain information about items that the individual has indicated a desire to acquire, but has not yet acquired. To illustrate, the service provider may obtain information about items included in a media rental queue of the individual. In another illustration, the service provider may obtain information about wish lists or registries of the individual with one or more merchants.","The service provider may also obtain supplemental information about items acquired by the individual and\/or items to be acquired by the individual that are included in the personal webservice of the individual. In some cases, the supplemental information may include at least portions of articles relating to items of the personal webservice, blog posts relating to items of the personal webservice, reviews relating to items of the personal webservice, warranty information relating to items of the personal webservice, recall information relating to items of the personal webservice, software updates relating to items of the personal webservice, online discussions relating to items of the personal webservice, manuals relating to items of the personal webservice, or combinations thereof. The service provider may obtain the supplemental information relating to items of the personal webservice by monitoring one or more sites for information about the personal webservice items. Additionally, the service provider may invoke a webcrawler to identify information about the personal webservice items. In other situations, the service provider may have arrangements with certain sites or entities (e.g. item manufacturers, merchants, etc.) to provide information to the service provider that is related to items included in personal webservices maintained by the service provider.","The service provider may also provide a number of webservice applications and\/or webservice agents to individuals. The webservice applications or agents may provide certain supplemental information about items included in the personal webservices of individuals. In a particular situation, the service provider may provide a warranty and recalls webservice application or agent that obtains supplemental information about warranties and recalls associated with items included in personal webservices of individuals. The warranty and recalls webservice application\/agent may provide notifications indicating when warranties are set to expire on items acquired by individuals. Additionally, the warranties and recalls webservice application\/agent may also provide news articles and\/or notices from manufacturers indicating that a particular item or a portion of the particular item is the subject of a recall.","By providing personal webservices for individuals, a service provider can provide opportunities for individuals to aggregate information about items they have acquired. Thus, individuals may conveniently store and access information about the items that have been acquired. Additionally, the service provider may offer webservice applications and agents that provide supplemental information to individuals about the items they have acquired. Thus, individuals may be able to conveniently keep up with information that is produced about items that they have acquired without having to spend large amounts of time tracking down the information or without relying on chance that they will find out about important notices or information concerning items they have acquired.","Example Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","104"]},"The items acquired by the individual  may include tangible items, intangible items, products, goods, services, a bundle of items, digital goods, digital services, coupons\/deals, and the like. In addition, the acquisition of items by the individual  may be achieved through purchasing items, renting items, borrowing items, trading items, bartering items, etc. Further, the individual  may operate a computing device . The computing device  may include a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a smart phone, an electronic reader device, a mobile handset, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable navigation device, a portable gaming device, a tablet computer, a watch, a portable media player, another client device, and the like.","In some cases, the webservice API  may obtain information about items acquired by the individual  from the computing device . For example, the individual  may operate one or more input devices of the computing device  to provide information to the webservice API  about items acquired by the individual . To illustrate, the individual  may operate a camera of the computing device  to capture an image of at least a portion of an item acquired by the individual  and send the image to the webservice API . In some cases, the image may include an identifier of the item, such as text indicating a name and model number of the item or a UPC of the item. In other cases, the individual  may enter text into an application or page provided by the webservice API  that captures information about item acquisitions, such as price of an item, date of purchase of the item, manufacturer of the item, model of the item, merchant offering the item, warranty information related to the item, and so forth. Further, the individual  may forward emails indicating acquisition of items to the webservice API . In certain scenarios, the emails may have been provided to the computing device  upon acquisition of an item online from a merchant.","The webservice API  may also extract information about item acquisitions from the computing device . In particular implementations, the webservice API  may obtain emails from an email application residing on the computing device  that are related to the acquisition of items. In an illustrative example, the webservice API  may send a request to an email application of the computing device  for emails including content related to the acquisition of one or more items. Additionally, the webservice API  may obtain item acquisition information from other applications residing on the computing device , such as a personal finance application, a business finance application, an accounting application, a spreadsheet application, a word processing application, a database application, an operating system, a data retrieval application, combinations thereof, and so forth. In some cases, the webservice API  may utilize one or more credentials  to obtain item acquisition data from applications of the computing device . The credentials  may include user names, passwords, tokens, security keys, etc.","The webservice API  may also obtain information about items acquired by the individual  from one or more third-party data sources, such as data sources , . The third-party data sources ,  may include financial institutions (e.g. banks, credit unions, etc.), credit card companies, financial services companies, merchants, and the like. For example, the webservice API  may obtain records of transactions conducted by the individual  to acquire items. The webservice API  may also utilize the credentials  to obtain item acquisition data from the data sources , .","When the webservice API  receives item acquisition data from the computing device  and\/or the third-party data sources , , the webservice API , or another component of a service provider, may extract information related to the acquisition of items from the item acquisition data. In some implementations, the webservice API  may utilize image recognition techniques to identify an item acquired by the individual  from an image of the item. The webservice API  may also extract information about items acquired by the individual  from emails, reports, documents, spreadsheets, extensible markup language (XML) files, and so on, obtained from the computing device  and\/or the third-party data sources , .","After identifying information related to the acquisition of items by individuals, the webservice API , or another component of a service provider, may store the information in one or more personal webservices . In the illustrative example shown in , the personal webservices  includes a first personal webservice  that corresponds to the individual  and a number of other personal webservices up to personal webservice N . Each respective personal webservice ,  includes item information , . The item information ,  may include information about items acquired by the individuals associated with the respective personal webservices , . For example, the item information  may include information related to items acquired by the individual  that was obtained via the webservice API . To illustrate, the item information  may include prices of items, dates of acquisition of items, merchants that provided the items to individuals, manufacturers of the items, etc.","In some situations, the webservice API  may store information about a portion of the items acquired by individuals in the personal webservices . In one example, the webservice API  may refrain from storing information about items that individuals may possess for a short period of time, such as some food items. In another example, the individuals associated with the personal webservices  may specify preferences for storing only certain items that have been acquired. In particular instances, the information about some items may be stored in the personal webservices  temporarily. To illustrate, information about particular food items may be stored in the personal webservices  until the items are consumed, until an expiration date lapses, and\/or until another specified period of time expires.","The architecture  also includes a number of webservice applications and agents . In the illustrative implementation shown in , the webservice applications and agents  include particular webservice applications - and particular webservice agents -. Each of the webservice applications - and the webservice agents - may be executable to perform respective operations with respect to information associated with items stored in the personal webservices . That is, each of the webservice applications and agents - may perform different operations with respect to items stored in the personal webservices . In some situations, at least some of the webservice applications and agents - may perform their respective operations with respect to different items of the personal webservices .","Additionally, in certain scenarios, the webservice applications - may operate when invoked by a user of a respective webservice application -, such as the individual . In other instances, the webservice applications - may operate when invoked by another webservice application, a webservice agent -, and\/or another application, program, or module, such a module residing on a service provider server or an application residing on the computing device . Further, the webservice agents - may operate in the background periodically or continuously without being expressly invoked by a user associated with the respective webservice agents -.","In some cases, the webservice applications and agents - may parse webservice item supplemental information  to provide a portion of the webservice item supplemental information  related to items acquired by a particular individual to a computing device of the particular individual. The webservice applications and agents - may also utilize the webservice item supplemental information  to derive notifications relating to items acquired by an individual and stored in a respective personal webservice . The webservice item supplemental information  may include information obtained from manufacturers of items, merchants offering items for acquisition, items acquired by individuals (e.g. vehicles, appliances, electronic devices, etc.). The webservice item supplemental information  may also include information obtained from a number of sites, such as news articles, reviews, discussion board posts, blog posts, micro-blogging posts, and the like.","In the particular implementation shown in , the individual  is associated with individual webservice applications and agents . The individual webservice applications  may include the particular webservice application  and the particular webservice agent . In some cases, the webservice application  and\/or the webservice agent  may reside on the computing device , while in other cases, the webservice application  and\/or the webservice agent  may reside remotely, such as on a server of a service provider that provides the webservice applications and agents .","In an illustrative implementation, the third webservice agent  may be a warranty and recalls webservice application. Accordingly, the third webservice agent  may track the expiration of warranties of certain items of the personal webservice . When the warranty associated with an item of the personal webservice  is set to expire within a specified period of time, the third webservice agent  may generate a notification for the individual  that indicates when the warranty will expire. The notification may also include options related to the expiration of the warranty, such as an option to extend the warranty, an option to purchase replacement parts for the item, an option to view an owner's manual related to the item, recommendations to acquire one or more additional items to replace the item, and so forth. The third webservice agent  may also obtain webservice item supplemental information  that is directed to recalls of items of the personal webservice . In particular, the third webservice agent  may obtain portions of the webservice item information , such as news articles, manufacturers' notices, etc., that indicate a recall of an item of the personal webservice . In these situations, the third webservice agent  may forward any articles indicating recalls of an item of the personal webservice  to the computing device  or generate a notification for the individual  that indicates recall of an item of the personal webservice .","Accordingly, by utilizing the architectures and techniques described herein, an individual can conveniently obtain pertinent information about items they have acquired. In particular, an individual does not need to spend time looking online for information about items that have been acquired or obtaining information from media distribution services related to items that have been acquired. Rather, information that the individual considers important may be provided to them via a computing device through one or more specific webservice applications or agents. Additionally, individuals can access information about items stored in their personal webservice and eliminate paper file systems that can be time consuming and inconvenient to maintain, that occupy large amounts of space, and that do not provide convenient access to information.","Example Framework",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204","204","202","206"]},"The item acquisition pipeline  may include a number of item acquisition pages that may be provided to the computing device  in order for the individual  to acquire the item.
