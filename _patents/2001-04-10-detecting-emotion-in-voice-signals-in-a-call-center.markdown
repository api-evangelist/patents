{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/388,909, filed Aug. 31, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,275,806 which is herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to voice recognition and more particularly to detecting emotion using statistics calculated for voice signal parameters.","Although the first monograph on expression of emotions in animals & humans was written by Charles Darwin in the last century and psychologists have gradually cumulated knowledge in the field of emotion detection and voice recognition, it has attracted a new wave of interest recently by both psychologists and artificial intelligence specialists. There are several reasons for this renewed interest: technological progress in recording, storing and processing audio and visual information; the development of non-intrusive sensors; the advent of wearable computers; and the urge to enrich human-computer interface from point-and-click to sense-and-feel. Further, a new field of research in AI known as affective computing has recently been identified.","As to research on recognizing emotions in speech, on one hand, psychologists have done many experiments and suggested theories. On the other hand, AI researchers made contributions in the following areas: emotional speech synthesis, recognition of emotions and using agents for decoding and expressing emotions. Similar progress has been made with voice recognition.","In spite of the research on recognizing emotions in speech, the art has been devoid of methods and apparatuses that utilize emotion recognition and voice recognition for business purposes.","A system, method and article of manufacture are provided for detecting emotion using statistics. First, a database is provided. The database has statistics including statistics of human associations of voice parameters with emotions. Next, a voice signal is received. At least one feature is extracted from the voice signal. Then the extracted voice feature is compared to the voice parameters in the database. An emotion is selected from the database based on the comparison of the extracted voice feature to the voice parameters and is then output. In one aspect of the present invention, the feature that is extracted includes a maximum value of a fundamental frequency, a standard deviation of the fundamental frequency, a range of the fundamental frequency, a mean of the fundamental frequency, a mean of a bandwidth of a first formant, a mean of a bandwidth of a second formant, a standard deviation of energy, a speaking rate, a slope of the fundamental frequency, a maximum value of the first formant, a maximum value of the energy, a range of the energy, a range of the second formant, and\/or a range of the first formant.","In another aspect of the present invention, the database includes probabilities of a particular voice feature being associated with an emotion. Preferably, the selection of the emotion from the database includes analyzing the probabilities and selecting the most probable emotion based on the probabilities. Optionally, the probabilities of the database may include performance confusion statistics. Also optionally, the statistics in the database may include self-recognition statistics.","In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, a system is provided for performing various functions and activities through voice analysis and voice recognition. The system may be enabled using a hardware implementation such as that illustrated in . Further, various functional and user interface features of one embodiment of the present invention may be enabled using software programming, i.e. object oriented programming (OOP).","Hardware Overview","A representative hardware environment of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system.","Software Overview","Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for the principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided. OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each other's capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with them (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, the logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects. This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increase in the speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal. The benefits of object classes can be summarized as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making all these things work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure). A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems. Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and a company. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language-2.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1:HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cInteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, which are fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","Emotion Recognition","The present invention is directed towards utilizing recognition of emotions in speech for business purposes. Some embodiments of the present invention may be used to detect the emotion of a person based on a voice analysis and output the detected emotion of the person. Other embodiments of the present invention may be used for the detection of the emotional state in telephone call center conversations, and providing feedback to an operator or a supervisor for monitoring purposes. Yet other embodiments of the present invention may be applied to sort voice mail messages according to the emotions expressed by a caller.","If the target subjects are known, it is suggested that a study be conducted on a few of the target subjects to determine which portions of a voice are most reliable as indicators of emotion. If target subjects are not available, other subjects may be used. Given this orientation, for the following discussion:\n\n","In an exemplary test, four short sentences are recorded from each of thirty people:\n\n","After creating the corpus, an experiment may be performed to find the answers to the following questions:\n\n","An interactive program of a type known in the art may be used to select and play back the utterances in random order and allow a user to classify each utterance according to its emotional content. For example, twenty-three subjects can take part in the evaluation stage and an additional 20 of whom had participated in the 15 recording state earlier.","Table 1 shows a performance confusion matrix resulting from data collected from performance of the previously discussed study. The rows and the columns represent true & evaluated categories respectively. For example, the second row says that 11.9% of utterances that were portrayed as happy were evaluated as normal (unemotional), 61.4% as true happy, 10.1% as angry, 4.1% as sad, and 12.5% as fear. It is also seen that the most easily recognizable category is anger (72.2%) and the least recognizable category is fear (49.5%). A lot of confusion is found between sadness and fear, sadness and unemotional state and happiness and fear. The mean 25 accuracy is 63.5% that agrees with the results of the other experimental studies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0112"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Performance Confusion Matrix"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Category","Normal","Happy","Angry","Sad","Afraid","Total"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Normal","66.3","2.5","7.0","18.2","6.0","100"]},{"entry":["Happy","11.9","61.4","10.1","4.1","12.5","100"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 2 shows statistics for evaluators for each emotional category and for summarized performance that was calculated as the sum of performances for each category.

First, take into account fundamental frequency FO (i.e. the main (lowest) frequency of the vibration of the vocal folds), energy, speaking rate, first three formants (F1, F2, and F3) and their bandwidths (BW1, BW2, and BW3) and calculate for them as many statistics as possible.

For all other parameters, the following statistics can be calculated: mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and range. Additionally for F0 the slope can be calculated as a linear regression for voiced part of speech, i.e. the line that fits the pitch contour. The relative voiced energy can also be calculated as the proportion of voiced energy to the total energy of utterance. Altogether, there are about 40 features for each utterance.","The RELIEF-F algorithm may be used for feature selection.

The number of outputs corresponds to the number of emotional categories. To train and test the algorithms, data sets s70, s80, and s90 may be used.

Fortunately, the present invention provides a tool to help combat such fraud. It should also be noted that the present invention has applications in the law enforcement arena as well as in a courtroom environment, etc.","Preferably, a degree of certainty as to the level of nervousness of the person is output to assist one searching for fraud in making a determination as to whether the person was speaking fraudulently. This may be based on statistics as set forth above in the embodiment of the present invention with reference to .

The alarm may include a visual notification on a computer display, an auditory sound, etc. to alert an overseer, the listener, and\/or one searching for fraud.

Thus, for example, a degree of wavering in the tone of the voice, as determined from readings of the fundamental frequency, can be used to help determine a level of nervousness. The greater the degree of wavering, the higher the level of nervousness. Pauses in the person's speech may also be taken into account.","The following section describes apparatuses that may be used to determine emotion, including nervousness, in voice signals.","Exemplary Apparatuses for Detecting Emotion in Voice Signals","This section describes several apparatuses for analyzing speech in accordance with the present invention.","One embodiment of the present invention includes an apparatus for analyzing a person's speech to determine their emotional state. The analyzer operates on the real time frequency or pitch components within the first formant band of human speech. In analyzing the speech, the apparatus analyses certain value occurrence patterns in terms of differential first formant pitch, rate of change of pitch, duration and time distribution patterns. These factors relate in a complex but very fundamental way to both transient and long term emotional states.","Human speech is initiated by two basic sound generating mechanisms. The vocal cords; thin stretched membranes under muscle control, oscillate when expelled air from the lungs passes through them. They produce a characteristic \u201cbuzz\u201d sound at a fundamental frequency between 80 Hz and 240 Hz. This frequency is varied over a moderate range by both conscious and unconscious muscle contraction and relaxation. The wave form of the fundamental \u201cbuzz\u201d contains many harmonies, some of which excite resonance is various fixed and variable cavities associated with the vocal tract. The second basic sound generated during speech is a pseudo-random noise having a fairly broad and uniform frequency distribution. It is caused by turbulence as expelled air moves through the vocal tract and is called a \u201chiss\u201d sound. It is modulated, for the most part, by tongue movements and also excites the fixed and variable cavities. It is this complex mixture of \u201cbuzz\u201d and \u201chiss\u201d sounds, shaped and articulated by the resonant cavities, which produces speech.","In an energy distribution analysis of speech sounds, it will be found that the energy falls into distinct frequency bands called formants. There are three significant formants. The system described here utilizes the first formant band which extends from the fundamental \u201cbuzz\u201d frequency to approximately 1000 Hz. This band has not only the highest energy content but reflects a high degree of frequency modulation as a function of various vocal tract and facial muscle tension variations.","In effect, by analyzing certain first formant frequency distribution patterns, a qualitative measure of speech related muscle tension variations and interactions is performed. Since these muscles are predominantly biased and articulated through secondary unconscious processes which are in turn influenced by emotional state, a relative measure of emotional activity can be determined independent of a person's awareness or lack of awareness of that state. Research also bears out a general supposition that since the mechanisms of speech are exceedingly complex and largely autonomous, very few people are able to consciously \u201cproject\u201d a fictitious emotional state. In fact, an attempt to do so usually generates its own unique psychological stress \u201cfingerprint\u201d in the voice pattern.","Because of the characteristics of the first formant speech sounds, the present invention analyses an FM demodulated first formant speech signal and produces an output indicative of nulls thereof The frequency or number of nulls or \u201cflat\u201d spots in the FM demodulated signal, the length of the nulls and the ratio of the total time that nulls exist during a word period to the overall time of the word period are all indicative of the emotional state of the individual. By looking at the output of the device, the user can see or feel the occurrence of the nulls and thus can determine by observing the output the number or frequency of nulls, the length of the nulls and the ratio of the total time nulls exist during a word period to the length of the word period, the emotional state of the individual.","In the present invention, the first formant frequency band of a speech signal is FM demodulated and the FM demodulated signal is applied to a word detector circuit which detects the presence of an FM demodulated signal. The FM demodulated signal is also applied to a null detector means which detects the nulls in the FM demodulated signal and produces an output indicative thereof. An output circuit is coupled to the word detector and to the null detector. The output circuit is enabled by the word detector when the word detector detects the presence of an FM demodulated signal, and the output circuit produces an output indicative of the presence or non-presence of a null in the FM demodulated signal. The output of the output circuit is displayed in a manner in which it can be perceived by a user so that the user is provided with an indication of the existence of nulls in the FM demodulated signal. The user of the device thus monitors the nulls and can thereby determine the emotional state of the individual whose speech is being analyzed.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the voice vibrato is analyzed. The so-called voice vibrato has been established as a semi-voluntary response which might be of value in studying deception along with certain other reactions; such as respiration volume; inspiration-expiration ratios; metabolic rate; regularity and rate of respiration; association of words and ideas; facial expressions; motor reactions; and reactions to certain narcotics; however, no useable technique has been developed previously which permits a valid and reliable analysis of voice changes in the clinical determination of a subject's emotional state, opinions, or attempts to deceive.","Early experiments involving attempts to correlate voice quality changes with emotional stimuli have established that human speech is affected by strong emotion. Detectable changes in the voice occur much more rapidly, following stress stimulation, than do the classic indications of physiological manifestations resulting from the functioning of the autonomic nervous system.","Two types of voice change as a result of stress. The first of these is referred to as the gross change which usually occurs only as a result of a substantially stressful situation. This change manifests itself in audible perceptible changes in speaking rate, volume, voice tremor, change in spacing between syllables, and a change in the fundamental pitch or frequency of the voice. This gross change is subject to conscious control, at least in some subjects, when the stress level is below that of a total loss of control.","The second type of voice change is that of voice quality. This type of change is not discernible to the human ear, but is an apparently unconscious manifestation of the slight tensing of the vocal cords under even minor stress, resulting in a dampening of selected frequency variations. When graphically portrayed, the difference is readily discernible between unstressed or normal vocalization and vocalization under mild stress, attempts to deceive, or adverse attitudes. These patterns have held true over a wide range of human voices of both sexes, various ages, and under various situational conditions. This second type of change is not subject to conscious control.","There are two types of sound produced by the human vocal anatomy. The first type of sound is a product of the vibration of the vocal cords, which, in turn, is a product of partially closing the glottis and forcing air through the glottis by contraction of the lung cavity and the lungs. The frequencies of these vibrations can vary generally between 100 and 300 Hertz, depending upon the sex and age of the speaker and upon the intonations the speaker applies. This sound has a rapid decay time.","The second type of sound involves the formant frequencies. This constitutes sound which results from the resonance of the cavities in the head, including the throat, the mouth, the nose and the sinus cavities. This sound is created by excitation of the resonant cavities by a sound source of lower frequencies, in the case of the vocalized sound produced by the vocal cords, or by the partial restriction of the passage of air from the lungs, as in the case of unvoiced fricatives. Whichever the excitation source, the frequency of the formant is determined by the resonant frequency of the cavity involved. The formant frequencies appear generally about 800 Hertz and appear in distinct frequency bands which correspond to the resonant frequency of the individual cavities. The first, or lowest, formant is that created by the mouth and throat cavities and is notable for its frequency shift as the mouth changes its dimensions and volume in the formation of various sounds, particularly vowel sounds. The highest formant frequencies are more constant because of the more constant volume of the cavities. The formant wave forms are ringing signals, as opposed to the rapid decay signals of the vocal cords. When voiced sounds are uttered, the voice wave forms are imposed upon the formant wave forms as amplitude modulations.","It has been discovered that a third signal category exists in the human voice and that this third signal category is related to the second type of voice change discussed above. This is an infrasonic, or subsonic, frequency modulation which is present, in some degree, in both the vocal cord sounds and in the formant sounds. This signal is typically between 8 and 12 Hertz. Accordingly, it is not audible to the human ear. Because of the fact that this characteristic constitutes frequency modulation, as distinguished from amplitude modulation, it is not directly discernible on time-base\/amplitude chart recordings. Because of the fact that this infrasonic signal is one of the more significant voice indicators of psychological stress, it will be dealt with in greater detail.","There are in existence several analogies which are used to provide schematic representations of the entire voice process. Both mechanical and electronic analogies are successfully employed, for example, in the design of computer voices. These analogies, however, consider the voiced sound source (vocal cords) and the walls of the cavities as hard and constant features. However, both the vocal cords and the walls of the major formant-producing cavities constitute, in reality, flexible tissue which is immediately responsive to the complex array of muscles which provide control of the tissue. Those muscles which control the vocal cords through the mechanical linkage of bone and cartilage allow both the purposeful and automatic production of voice sound and variation of voice pitch by an individual. Similarly, those muscles which control the tongue, lips and throat allow both the purposeful and the automatic control of the first formant frequencies. Other formants can be affected similarly to a more limited degree.","It is worthy of note that, during normal speech, these muscles are performing at a small percentage of their total work capability. For this reason, in spite of their being employed to change the position of the vocal cords and the positions of the lips, tongue, and inner throat walls, the muscles remain in, a relatively relaxed state. It has been determined that during this relatively relaxed state a natural muscular undulation occurs typically at the 8-12 Hertz 5 frequency previously mentioned. This undulation causes a slight variation in the tension of the vocal cords and causes shifts in the basic pitch frequency of the voice. Also, the undulation varies slightly the volume of the resonant cavity (particularly that associated with the first formant) and the elasticity of the cavity walls to cause shifts in the formant frequencies. These shifts about a central frequency constitute a frequency modulation of the central or carrier frequency.","It is important to note that neither of the shifts in the basic pitch frequency of the voice or in the formant frequencies is detectable directly by a listener, partly because the shifts are very small and partly because they exist primarily in the inaudible frequency range previously mentioned.","In order to observe this frequency modulation any one of several existing techniques for the demodulation of frequency modulation can be employed, bearing in mind, of course, that the modulation frequency is the nominal 8-12 Hertz and the carrier is one of the bands within the voice spectrum.","In order to more fully understand the above discussion, the concept of a \u201ccenter of mass\u201d of this wave form must be understood. It is possible to approximately determine the midpoint between the two extremes of any single excursion of the recording pen. If the midpoints between extremes of all excursions are marked and if those midpoints are then approximately joined by a continuous curve, it will be seen that a line approximating an average or \u201ccenter of mass\u201d of the entire wave form will result. Joining all such marks, with some smoothing, results in a smooth curved line. The line represents the infrasonic frequency modulation resulting from the undulations previously described.","As mentioned above, it has been determined that the array of muscles associated with the vocal cords and cavity walls is subject to mild muscular tension when slight to moderate psychological stress is created in the individual examination. This tension, indiscernible to the subject and similarly indiscernible by normal unaided observation techniques to the examiner, is sufficient to decrease or virtually eliminate the muscular undulations present in the unstressed subject, thereby removing the basis for the carrier frequency variations which produce the infrasonic frequency modulations.","While the use of the infrasonic wave form is unique to the technique of employing voice as the physiological medium for psychological stress evaluation, the voice does provide for additional instrumented indications of aurally indiscernible physiological changes as a result of psychological stress, which physiological changes are similarly detectable by techniques and devices in current use. Of the four most often used physiological changes previously mentioned (brain wave patterns, heart activity, skin conductivity and breathing activity) two of these, breathing activity and heart activity, directly and indirectly affect the amplitude and the detail of an oral utterance wave form and provide the basis for a more gross evaluation of psychological stress, particularly when the testing involves sequential vocal responses.","Another apparatus is shown in . As shown, a transducer  converts the sound waves of the oral utterances of the subject into electrical signals wherefrom they are connected to the input of an audio amplifier  which is simply for the purpose of increasing the power of electrical signals to a more stable, usable level. The output of amplifier  is connected to a filter  which is primarily for the purpose of eliminating some undesired low frequency components and noise components.","After filtering, the signal is connected to an FM discriminator  wherein the frequency deviations from the center frequency are converted into signals which vary in amplitude. The amplitude varying signals are then detected in a detector circuit  for the purpose of rectifying the signal and producing a signal which constitutes a series of half wave pulses. After detection, the signal is connected to an integrator circuit  wherein the signal is integrated to the desired degree. In circuit , the signal is either integrated to a very small extent, producing a wave form, or is integrated to a greater degree, producing a signal. After integration, the signal is amplified in an amplifier  and connected to a processor  which determines the emotion associated with the voice signal. An output device  such as a computer screen or printer is used to output the detected emotion. Optionally, statistical data may be output as well.","A somewhat simpler embodiment of an apparatus for producing visible records in accordance with the invention is shown in  wherein the acoustic signals are transduced by a microphone  into electrical signals which are magnetically recorded in a tape recording device . The signals can then be processed through the remaining equipment at various speeds and at any time, the play-back being connected to a conventional semiconductor diode  which rectifies the signals. The rectified signals are connected to the input of a conventional amplifier  and also to the movable contact of a selector switch indicated generally at . The movable contact of switch  can be moved to any one of a plurality of fixed contacts, each of which is connected to a capacitor. In  is shown a selection of four capacitors , ,  and , each having one terminal connected to a fixed contact of the switch and the other terminal connected to ground. The output of amplifier  is connected to a processor .","A tape recorder that may be used in this particular assembly of equipment was a Uher model  four-speed tape unit having its own internal amplifier. The values of capacitors - were 0.5, 3, 10 and 50 microfarads, respectively, and the input impedance of amplifier  was approximately 10,000 ohms. As will be recognized, various other components could be, or could have been, used in this apparatus.","In the operation of the circuit of , the rectified wave form emerging through diode  is integrated to the desired degree, the time constant being selected so that the effect of the frequency modulated infrasonic wave appears as a slowly varying DC level which approximately follows the line representing the \u201ccenter of mass\u201d of the waveform. The excursions shown in that particular diagram are relatively rapid, indicating that the switch was connected to one of the lower value capacitors. In this embodiment composite filtering is accomplished by the capacitor , ,  or , and, in the case of the playback speed reduction, the tape recorder.","Telephonic Operation with Operator Feedback",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0174"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002","1004"]},"The conversation may be carried out over a telecommunications network, as well as a wide area network such as the internet when used with internet telephony.

Optionally, the emotion associated with the voice signal is identified upon the emotion being provided. In such case, it should be determined whether the automatically determined emotion or the user-determined emotion matches the identified emotion. The user may be awarded a prize upon the user-determined emotion matching the identified emotion. Further, the emotion may be automatically determined by extracting at least one feature from the voice signals, such as in a manner discussed above.","To assist a user in recognizing emotion, an emotion recognition game can be played in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The game could allow a user to compete against the computer or another person to see who can best recognize emotion in recorded speech. One practical application of the game is to help autistic people in developing better emotional skills at recognizing emotion in speech.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus may be used to create data about voice signals that can be used to improve emotion recognition. In such an embodiment, the apparatus accepts vocal sound through a transducer such as a microphone or sound recorder. The physical sound wave, having been transduced into electrical signals are applied in parallel to a typical, commercially available bank of electronic filters covering the audio frequency range. Setting the center frequency of the lowest filter to any value that passes the electrical energy representation of the vocal signal amplitude that includes the lowest vocal frequency signal establishes the center values of all subsequent filters up to the last one passing the energy-generally between 8 kHz to 16 kHz or between 10 kHz and 20 kHz, and also determine the exact number of such filters. The specific value of the first filter's center frequency is not significant, so long as the lowest tones of the human voice is captured, approximately 70 Hz. Essentially any commercially available bank is applicable if it can be interfaced to any commercially available digitizer and then microcomputer. The specification section describes a specific set of center frequencies and microprocessor in the preferred embodiment. The filter quality is also not particularly significant because a refinement algorithm disclosed in the specification brings any average quality set of filters into acceptable frequency and amplitude values. The ratio 1\/3, of course, defines the band width of all the filters once the center frequencies are calculated.","Following this segmentation process with filters, the filter output voltages are digitized by a commercially available set of digitizers or preferably multiplexer and digitizer, on in the case of the disclosed preferred embodiment, a digitizer built into the same identified commercially available filter bank, to eliminate interfacing logic and hardware. Again quality of digitizer in terms of speed of conversion or discrimination is not significant because average presently available commercial units exceed the requirements needed here, due to a correcting algorithm (see specifications) and the low sample rate necessary.","Any complex sound that is carrying constantly changing information can be approximated with a reduction of bits of information by capturing the frequency and amplitude of peaks of the signal. This, of course, is old knowledge, as is performing such an operation on speech signals. However, in speech research, several specific regions where such peaks often occur have been labeled \u201cformant\u201d regions. However, these region approximations do not always coincide with each speaker's peaks under all circumstances. Speech researchers and the prior inventive art, tend to go to great effort to measure and name \u201clegitimate\u201d peaks as those that fall within the typical formant frequency regions, as if their definition did not involve estimates, but rather absoluteness. This has caused numerous research and formant measuring devices to artificially exclude pertinent peaks needed to adequately represent a complex, highly variable sound wave in real time. Since the present disclosure is designed to be suitable for animal vocal sounds as well as all human languages, artificial restrictions such as formants, are not of interest and the sound wave is treated as a complex, varying sound wave which can analyze any such sound.","In order to normalize and simplify peak identification, regardless of variation in filter band width, quality and digitizer discrimination, the actual values stored for amplitude and frequency are \u201crepresentative values\u201d. This is so that the broadness of upper frequency filters is numerically similar to lower frequency filter band width. Each filter is simply given consecutive values from 1 to 25, and a soft to loud sound is scaled from 1 to 40, for ease of CRT screen display. A correction on the frequency representation values is accomplished by adjusting the number of the filter to a higher decimal value toward the next integer value, if the filter output to the right of the peak filter has a greater amplitude than the filter output on the left of the peak filter. The details of a preferred embodiment of this algorithm is described in the specifications of this disclosure. This correction process must occur prior to the compression process, while all filter amplitude values are available.","Rather than slowing down the sampling rate, the preferred embodiment stores all filter amplitude values for 10 to 15 samples per second for an approximate 10 to 15 second speech sample before this correction and compression process. If computer memory space is more critical than sweep speed, the corrections and compression should occur between each sweep eliminating the need for a large data storage memory. Since most common commercially available, averaged price mini-computers have sufficient memory, the preferred and herein disclosed embodiment saves all data and afterwards processes the data.","Most vocal animal signals of interest including human contain one largest amplitude peak not likely on either end of the frequency domain. This peak can be determined by any simple and common numerical sorting algorithm as is done in this invention. The amplitude and frequency representative values are then placed in the number three of six memory location sets for holding the amplitudes and frequencies of six peaks.","The highest frequency peak above 8 k Hz is placed in memory location number six and labeled high frequency peak. The lowest peak is placed in the first set of memory locations. The other three are chosen from peaks between these. Following this compression function, the vocal signal is represented by an amplitude and frequency representative value from each of six peaks, plus a total energy amplitude from the total signal unfiltered for, say, ten times per second, for a ten second sample. This provides a total of 1300 values.","The algorithms allow for variations in sample length in case the operator overrides the sample length switch with the override off-switch to prevent continuation during an unexpected noise interruption. The algorithms do this by using averages not significantly sensitive to changes in sample number beyond four or five seconds of sound signal. The reason for a larger speech sample, if possible, is to capture the speaker's average \u201cstyle\u201d of speech, typically evident within 10 to 15 seconds.","The output of this compression function is fed to the element assembly and storage algorithm which assemblies (a) four voice quality values to be described below; (b) a sound \u201cpause\u201d or on-to-off ratio; (c) \u201cvariability\u201d\u2014the difference between each peak's amplitude for the present sweep and that of the last sweep; differences between each peak's frequency number for the present sweep and that of the last sweep; and difference between the total unfiltered energy of the present sweep and that of the last sweep; (d) a \u201csyllable change approximation\u201d by obtaining the ratio of times that the second peak changes greater than 0.4 between sweeps to the total number of sweeps with sound; and (e) \u201chigh frequency analysis\u201d\u2014the ratio of the number of sound-on sweeps that contain a non-zero value in this peak for the number six peak amplitude. This is a total of 20 elements available per sweep. These are then passed to the dimension assembly algorithm.","The four voice quality values used as elements are (1) The \u201cspread\u201d\u2014the sample mean of all the sweeps' differences between their average of the frequency representative values above the maximum amplitude peak and the average of those below, (2) The \u201cbalance\u201d\u2014the sample means of all the sweeps' average amplitude values of peaks 4, 5 & 6 divided by the average of peaks 1 & 2. (3) \u201cenvelope flatness high\u201d\u2014the sample mean of all the sweeps' averages of their amplitudes above the largest peak divided by the largest peak, (4) \u201cenvelope flatness low\u201d\u2014the sample mean of all the sweeps' averages of their amplitudes below the largest peak divided by the largest peak.","The voice-style dimensions are labeled \u201cresonance\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d, and are assembled by an algorithm involving a coefficient matrix operating on selected elements.","The \u201cspeech-style\u201d dimensions are labeled \u201cvariability-monotone\u201d, \u201cchoppy-smooth\u201d, \u201cstaccato-sustain\u201d, \u201cattack-soft\u201d, \u201caffectivity-control\u201d. These five dimensions, with names pertaining to each end of each dimension, are measured and assembled by an algorithm involving a coefficient matrix operating on 15 of the 20 sound elements, detailed in Table 6 and the specification section.","The perceptual-style dimensions are labeled \u201ceco-structure\u201d, \u201cinvariant sensitivity\u201d, \u201cother-self\u201d, \u201csensory-internal\u201d, \u201chate-love\u201d, independence-dependency\u201d and \u201cemotional-physical\u201d. These seven perceptual dimensions with names relating to the end areas of the dimensions, are measured and assembled by an algorithm involving a coefficient matrix and operating on selected sound elements of voice and speech (detailed in Table 7) and the specification section.","A commercially available, typical computer keyboard or keypad allows the user of the present disclosure to alter any and all coefficients for redefinition of any assembled speech, voice or perceptual dimension for research purposes. Selection switches allow any or all element or dimension values to be displayed for a given subject's vocal sample. The digital processor controls the analog-to-digital conversion of the sound signal and also controls the reassembly of the vocal sound elements into numerical values of the voice and speech, perceptual dimensions.","The microcomputer also coordinates the keypad inputs of the operator and the selected output display of values, and coefficient matrix choice to interact with the algorithms assembling the voice, speech and perceptual dimensions. The output selection switch simply directs the output to any or all output jacks suitable for feeding the signal to typical commercially available monitors, modems, printers or by default to a light-emitting, on-board readout array.","By evolving group profile standards using this invention, a researcher can list findings in publications by occupations, dysfunctions, tasks, hobby interests, cultures, languages, sex, age, animal species, etc. Or, the user may compare his\/her values to those published by others or to those built into the machine.","Referring now to  of the drawings, a vocal utterance is introduced into the vocal sound analyzer through a microphone , and through a microphone amplifier  for signal amplification, or from taped input through tape input jack  for use of a pre-recorded vocal utterance input. An input level control  adjusts the vocal signal level to the filter driver amplifier . The filter driver amplifier  amplifies the signal and applies the signal to V.U. meter  for measuring the correct operating signal level.","The sweep rate per second and the number of sweeps per sample is controlled by the operator with the sweep rate and sample time switch . The operator starts sampling with the sample start switch and stop override . The override feature allows the operator to manually override the set sampling time, and stop sampling, to prevent contaminating a sample with unexpected sound interference, including simultaneous speakers. This switch also, connects and disconnects the microprocessor's power supply to standard 110 volt electrical input prongs.","The output of the filter driver amplifier  is also applied to a commercially available microprocessor-controlled filter bank and digitizer , which segments the electrical signal into 1\/3 octave regions over the audio frequency range for the organism being sampled and digitizes the voltage output of each filter. In a specific working embodiment of the invention, 25 1\/3 octave filters of an Eventide spectrum analyzer with filter center frequencies ranging from 63 HZ to 16,000 HZ. Also utilized was an AKAI microphone and tape recorder with built in amplifier as the input into the filter bank and digitizer . The number of sweeps per second that the filter bank utilizes is approximately ten sweeps per second. Other microprocessor-controlled filter banks and digitizers may operate at different speeds.","Any one of several commercially available microprocessors is suitable to control the aforementioned filter bank and digitizer.","As with any complex sound, amplitude across the audio frequency range for a \u201ctime slice\u201d 0.1 of a second will not be constant or flat, rather there will be peaks and valleys. The frequency representative values of the peaks of this signal, , are made more accurate by noting the amplitude values on each side of the peaks and adjusting the peak values toward the adjacent filter value having the greater amplitude. This is done because, as is characteristic of adjacent 1\/3 octave filters, energy at a given frequency spills over into adjacent filters to some extent, depending on the cut-off qualities of the filters. In order to minimize this effect, the frequency of a peak filter is assumed to be the center frequency only if the two adjacent filters have amplitudes within 10% of their average. To guarantee discreet, equally spaced, small values for linearizing and normalizing the values representing the unequal frequency intervals, each of the 25 filters are given number values 1 through 25 and these numbers are used throughout the remainder of the processing. This way the 3,500 HZ difference between filters 24 and 25 becomes a value of 1, which in turn is also equal to the 17 HZ difference between the first and second filter.","To prevent more than five sub-divisions of each filter number and to continue to maintain equal valued steps between each sub-division of the 1 to 25 filter numbers, they are divided into 0.2 steps and are further assigned as follows. If the amplitude difference of the two adjacent filters to a peak filter is greater than 30% of their average, then the peak filter's number is assumed to be nearer to the half-way point to the next filter number than it is of the peak filter. This would cause the filter number of a peak filter, say filter number 6.0, to be increased to 6.4 or decreased to 5.6, if the bigger adjacent filter represents a higher, or lower frequency, respectively. All other filter values, of peak filters, are automatically given the value of its filter number +0.2 and \u22120.2 if the greater of the adjacent filter amplitudes represents a higher or lower frequency respectively.","The segmented and digitally represented vocal utterance signal , after the aforementioned frequency correction , is compressed to save memory storage by discarding all but six amplitude peaks. The inventor found that six peaks were sufficient to capture the style characteristics, so long as the following characteristics are observed. At least one peak is near the fundamental frequency; exactly one peak is allowed between the region of the fundamental frequency and the peak amplitude frequency, where the nearest one to the maximum peak is preserved; and the first two peaks above the maximum peak is saved plus the peak nearest the 16,000 HZ end or the 25th filter if above 8 kHz, for a total of six peaks saved and stored in microprocessor memory. This will guarantee that the maximum peak always is the third peak stored in memory and that the sixth peak stored can be used for high frequency analysis, and that the first one is the lowest and nearest to the fundamental.","Following the compression of the signal to include one full band amplitude value, the filter number and amplitude value of six peaks, and each of these thirteen values for 10 samples for a 10 second sample, (1300 values),  of , sound element assembly begins.","To arrive at voice style \u201cquality\u201d elements, this invention utilizes relationships between the lower set and higher set of frequencies in the vocal utterance. The speech style elements, on the other hand, is determined by a combination of measurements relating to the pattern of vocal energy occurrences such as pauses and decay rates. These voice style \u201cquality\u201d elements emerge from spectrum analysis , , , and . The speech style elements emerge from the other four analysis functions as shown in , , , , and  and Table 6.","The voice style quality analysis elements stored are named and derived as: (1) the spectrum \u201cspread\u201d\u2014the sample mean of the distance in filter numbers between the average of the peak filter numbers above, and the average of the peak filter numbers below the maximum peak, for each sweep, , ; (2) the spectrum's energy \u201cbalance\u201d\u2014the mean for a sample of all the sweep's ratios of the sum of the amplitudes of those peaks above to the sum of the amplitudes below the maximum peak, ; (3) the spectrum envelope \u201cflatness\u201d\u2014the arithmetic means for each of two sets of ratios for each sample\u2014the ratios of the average amplitude of those peaks above (high) to the maximum peak, and of those below (low) the maximum peak to the maximum peak, for each sweep, .","The speech style elements, that are stored, are named and derived respectively: (1) spectrum variability\u2014the six means, of an utterance sample, of the numerical differences between each peak's filter number, on one sweep, to each corresponding peak's filter number on the next sweep, and also the six amplitude value differences for these six peaks and also including the full spectrum amplitude differences for each sweep, producing a sample total of 13 means, ; (2) utterance pause ratio analysis\u2014the ratio of the number of sweeps in the sample that the full energy amplitude values were pauses (below two units of amplitude value) to the number that had sound energy (greater than one unit of value), ; (3) syllable change approximation\u2014the ratio of the number of sweeps that the third peak changed number value greater than 0.4 to the number of sweeps having sound during the sample, ; (4) and, high frequency analysis\u2014the ratio of the number of sweeps for the sample that the sixth peak had an amplitude value to the total number of sweeps, .","Sound styles are divided into the seven dimensions in the method and apparatus of this invention, depicted in Table 6. These were determined to be the most sensitive to an associated set of seven perceptual or cognition style dimensions listed in Table 7.","The procedure for relating the sound style elements to voice, speech, and perceptual dimensions for output, , , is through equations that determine each dimension as a function of selected sound style elements, , , through . Table 6 relates the speech style elements,  through  of , to the speech style dimensions.","Table 7 depicts the relationship between seven perceptual style dimensions and the sound style elements,  through . Again, the purpose of having an optional input coefficient array containing zeros is to allow the apparatus operator to switch or key in changes in these coefficients for research purposes, , . The astute operator can develop different perceptual dimensions or even personality or cognitive dimensions, or factors, (if he prefers this terminology) which require different coefficients altogether. This is done by keying in the desired set of coefficients and noting which dimension () that he is relating these to. For instance, the other-self dimension of Table 7 may not be a wanted dimension by a researcher who would like to replace it with a user perceptual dimension that he names introvert-extrovert. By replacing the coefficient set for the other-self set, by trial sets, until an acceptably high correlation exists between the elected combination of weighted sound style elements and his externally determined introvert-extrovert dimension, the researcher can thusly use that slot for the new introvert-extrovert dimension, effectively renaming it. This can be done to the extent that the set of sound elements of this invention are sensitive to a user dimension of introvert-extrovert, and the researcher's coefficient set reflects the appropriate relationship. This will be possible with a great many user determined dimensions to a useful degree, thereby enabling this invention to function productively in a research environment where new perceptual dimensions, related to sound style elements, are being explored, developed, or validated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0211"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE

user of this invention are the dimension values, , available selectively by a switch, , to be displayed on a standard light display, and also selectively for monitor, printer, modem, or other standard output devices, . These can be used to determine how close the subject's voice is on any or all of the sound or perceptual dimensions from the built-in or published or personally developed controls or standards, which can then be used to assist in improving emotion recognition.","In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, bio-signals received from a user are used to help determine emotions in the user's speech. The recognition rate of a speech recognition system is improved by compensating for changes in the user's speech that result from factors such as emotion, anxiety or fatigue. A speech signal derived from a user's utterance is modified by a preprocessor and provided to a speech recognition system to improve the recognition rate. The speech signal is modified based on a bio-signal which is indicative of the user's emotional state.","In more detail,  illustrates a speech recognition system where speech signals from microphone  and bio-signals from bio-monitor  are received by preprocessor . The signal from bio-monitor  to preprocessor  is a bio-signal that is indicative of the impedance between two points on the surface of a user's skin. Bio-monitor  measures the impedance using contact  which is attached to one of the user's fingers and contact  which is attached to another of the user's fingers. A bio-monitor such as a bio-feedback monitor sold by Radio Shack, which is a division of Tandy Corporation, under the trade name (MICRONATA\u00ae BIOFEEDBACK MONITOR) model number 63-664 may be used. It is also possible to attach the contacts to other positions on the user's skin. When user becomes excited or anxious, the impedance between points  and  decreases and the decrease is detected by monitor  which produces a bio-signal indicative of a decreased impedance. Preprocessor  uses the bio-signal from bio-monitor  to modify the speech signal received from microphone , the speech signal is modified to compensate for the changes in user's speech due to changes resulting from factors such as fatigue or a change in emotional state. For example, preprocessor  may lower the pitch of the speech signal from microphone  when the bio-signal from bio-monitor  indicates that user is in an excited state, and preprocessor  may increase the pitch of the speech signal from microphone  when the bio-signal from bio-monitor  indicates that the user is in a less excited state such as when fatigued. Preprocessor  then provides the modified speech signal to audio card  in a conventional fashion. For purposes such as initialization or calibration, preprocessor  may communicate with PC  using an interface such as an RS232 interface. A user may communicate with preprocessor  by observing display  and by entering commands using keyboard  or keypad  or a mouse.","It is also possible to use the bio-signal to preprocess the speech signal by controlling the gain and\/or frequency response of microphone .

In LPC modeling generally, each sample in a series of samples is modeled (in the simplified model) as a linear combination of preceding samples, plus an excitation function:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0244"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["S","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"ajSk"},"mo":["-","+"],"mi":["j","uk"]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["k ","k ","k "]},"Within the general framework of LPC modeling, many particular implementations of voice analysis can be selected. In many of these, it is necessary to determine the pitch of the input speech signal. That is, in addition to the formant frequencies, which in effect correspond to resonances of the vocal tract, the human voice also contains a pitch, modulated by the speaker, which corresponds to the frequency at which the larynx modulates the air stream. That is, the human voice can be considered as an excitation function applied to an acoustic passive filter, and the excitation function will generally appear in the LPC residual function, while the characteristics of the passive acoustic filter (i.e., the resonance characteristics of mouth, nasal cavity, chest, etc.) will be molded by the LPC parameters. It should be noted that during unvoiced speech, the excitation function does not have a well-defined pitch, but instead is best modeled as broad band white noise or pink noise.","Estimation of the pitch period is not completely trivial. Among the problems is the fact that the first formant will often occur at a frequency close to that of the pitch. For this reason, pitch estimation is often performed on the LPC residual signal, since the LPC estimation process in effect deconvolves vocal tract resonances from the excitation information, so that the residual signal contains relatively less of the vocal tract resonances (formants) and relatively more of the excitation information (pitch). However, such residual-based pitch estimation techniques have their own difficulties. The LPC model itself will normally introduce high frequency noise into the residual signal, and portions of this high frequency noise may have a higher spectral density than the actual pitch which should be detected. One solution to this difficulty is simply to low pass filter the residual signal at around 1000 Hz. This removes the high frequency noise, but also removes the legitimate high frequency energy which is present in the unvoiced regions of speech, and renders the residual signal virtually useless for voicing decisions.","A cardinal criterion in voice messaging applications is the quality of speech reproduced. Prior art systems have had many difficulties in this respect. In particular, many of these difficulties relate to problems of accurately detecting the pitch and voicing of the input speech signal.","It is typically very easy to incorrectly estimate a pitch period at twice or half its value. For example, if correlation methods are used, a good correlation at a period P guarantees a good correlation at period 2P, and also means that the signal is more likely to show a good correlation at period P\/2. However, such doubling and halving errors produce very annoying degradation in voice quality. For example, erroneous halving of the pitch period will tend to produce a squeaky voice, and erroneous doubling of the pitch period will tend to produce a coarse voice. Moreover, pitch period doubling or halving is very likely to occur intermittently, so that the synthesized voice will tend to crack or to grate, intermittently.","The present invention uses an adaptive filter to filter the residual signal. By using a time-varying filter which has a single pole at the first reflection coefficient (kof the speech input), the high frequency noise is removed from the voiced periods of speech, but the high frequency information in the unvoiced speech periods is retained. The adaptively filtered residual signal is then used as the input for the pitch decision.","It is necessary to retain the high frequency information in the unvoiced speech periods to permit better voicing\/unvoicing decisions. That is, the \u201cunvoiced\u201d voicing decision is normally made when no strong pitch is found, that is when no correlation lag of the residual signal provides a high normalized correlation value. However, if only a low-pass filtered portion of the residual signal during unvoiced speech periods is tested, this partial segment of the residual signal may have spurious correlations. That is, the danger is that the truncated residual signal which is produced by the fixed low-pass filter of the prior art does not contain enough data to reliably show that no correlation exists during unvoiced periods, and the additional band width provided by the high-frequency energy of unvoiced periods is necessary to reliably exclude the spurious correlation lags which might otherwise be found.","Improvement in pitch and voicing decisions is particularly critical for voice messaging systems, but is also desirable for other applications. For example, a word recognizer which incorporated pitch information would naturally require a good pitch estimation procedure. Similarly, pitch information is sometimes used for speaker verification, particularly over a phone line, where the high frequency information is partially lost. Moreover, for long-range future recognition systems, it would be desirable to be able to take account of the syntactic information which is denoted by pitch. Similarly, a good analysis of voicing would be desirable for some advanced speech recognition systems, e.g., speech to text systems.","The first reflection coefficient kis approximately related to the high\/low frequency energy ratio and a signal. See R. J. McAulay, \u201cDesign of a Robust Maximum Likelihood Pitch Estimator for Speech and Additive Noise,\u201d Technical Note, 1979-28, Lincoln Labs, Jun. 11, 1979, which is hereby incorporated by reference. For kclose to \u22121, there is more low frequency energy in the signal than high-frequency energy, and vice versa for kclose to 1. Thus, by using kto determine the pole of a 1-pole deemphasis filter, the residual signal is low pass filtered in the voiced speech periods and is high pass filtered in the unvoiced speech periods. This means that the formant frequencies are excluded from computation of pitch during the voiced periods, while the necessary high-band width information is retained in the unvoiced periods for accurate detection of the fact that no pitch correlation exists.","Preferably a post-processing dynamic programming technique is used to provide not only an optimal pitch value but also an optimal voicing decision. That is, both pitch and voicing are tracked from frame to frame, and a cumulative penalty for a sequence of frame pitch\/voicing decisions is accumulated for various tracks to find the track which gives optimal pitch and voicing decisions. The cumulative penalty is obtained by imposing a frame error is going from one frame to the next. The frame error preferably not only penalizes large deviations in pitch period from frame to frame, but also penalizes pitch hypotheses which have a relatively poor correlation \u201cgoodness\u201d value, and also penalizes changes in the voicing decision if the spectrum is relatively unchanged from frame to frame. This last feature of the frame transition error therefore forces voicing transitions towards the points of maximal spectral change.","The voice messaging system of the present invention includes a speech input signal, which is shown as a time series S, is provided to an LPC analysis block. The LPC analysis can be done by a wide variety of conventional techniques, but the end product is a set of LPC parameters and a residual signal U. Background on LPC analysis generally, and on various methods for extraction of LPC parameters, is found in numerous generally known references, including Markel and Gray, Linear Prediction of Speech (1976) and Rabiner and Schafer, Digital Processing of Speech Signals (1978), and references cited therein, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","In the presently preferred embodiment, the analog speech waveform is sampled at a frequency of 8 KHz and with a precision of 16 bits to produce the input time series S. Of course, the present invention is not dependent at all on the sampling rate or the precision used, and is applicable to speech sampled at any rate, or with any degree of precision, whatsoever.","In the presently preferred embodiment, the set of LPC parameters which is used includes a plurality of reflection coefficients k, and a 10th-order LPC model is used (that is, only the reflection coefficients kthrough kare extracted, and higher order coefficients are not extracted). However, other model orders or other equivalent sets of LPC parameters can be used, as is well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the LPC predictor coefficients acan be used, or the impulse response estimates e. However, the reflection coefficients kare most convenient.","In the presently preferred embodiment, the reflection coefficients are extracted according to the Leroux-Gueguen procedure, which is set forth, for example, in IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, p. 257 (June 1977), which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, other algorithms well known to those skilled in the art, such as Durbin's, could be used to compute the coefficients.","A by-product of the computation of the LPC parameters will typically be a residual signal U. However, if the parameters are computed by a method which does not automatically pop out the Uas a by-product, the residual can be found simply by using the LPC parameters to configure a finite-impulse-response digital filter which directly computes the residual series Ufrom the input series S.","The residual signal time series Uis now put through a very simple digital filtering operation, which is dependent on the LPC parameters for the current frame. That is, the speech input signal Sis a time series having a value which can change once every sample, at a sampling rate of, e.g., 8 KHz. However, the LPC parameters are normally recomputed only once each frame period, at a frame frequency of, e.g., 100 Hz. The residual signal Ualso has a period equal to the sampling period. Thus, the digital filter, whose value is dependent on the LPC parameters, is preferably not readjusted at every residual signal U. In the presently preferred embodiment, approximately 80 values in the residual signal time series Upass through the filter  before a new value of the LPC parameters is generated, and therefore a new characteristic for the filter  is implemented.","More specifically, the first reflection coefficient kis extracted from the set of LPC parameters provided by the LPC analysis section . Where the LPC parameters themselves are the reflection coefficients k, it is merely necessary to look up the first reflection coefficient k. However, where other LPC parameters are used, the transformation of the parameters to produce the first order reflection coefficient is typically extremely simple, for example,\n\n\n","Although the present invention preferably uses the first reflection coefficient to define a 1-pole adaptive filter, the invention is not as narrow as the scope of this principal preferred embodiment. That is, the filter need not be a single-pole filter, but may be configured as a more complex filter, having one or more poles and or one or more zeros, some or all of which may be adaptively varied according to the present invention.","It should also be noted that the adaptive filter characteristic need not be determined by the first reflection coefficient k. As is well known in the art, there are numerous equivalent sets of LPC parameters, and the parameters in other LPC parameter sets may also provide desirable filtering characteristics. Particularly, in any set of LPC parameters, the lowest order parameters are most likely to provide information about gross spectral shape. Thus, an adaptive filter according to the present invention could use aor eto define a pole, can be a single or multiple pole and can be used alone or in combination with other zeros and or poles. Moreover, the pole (or zero) which is defined adaptively by an LPC parameter need not exactly coincide with that parameter, as in the presently preferred embodiment, but can be shifted in magnitude or phase.","Thus, the 1-pole adaptive filter filters the residual signal time series Uto produce a filtered time series u\u2032. As discussed above, this filtered time series Uwill have its high frequency energy greatly reduced during the voiced speech segments, but will retain nearly the full frequency band width during the unvoiced speech segments. This filtered residual signal u\u2032is then subjected to further processing, to extract the pitch candidates and voicing decision.","A wide variety of methods to extract pitch information from a residual signal exist, and any of them can be used. Many of these are discussed generally in the Markel and Gray book incorporated by reference above.","In the presently preferred embodiment, the candidate pitch values are obtained by finding the peaks in the normalized correlation function of the filtered residual signal, defined as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0227","num":"0266"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Ck","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"ujuj"},"mo":"-","mi":"k"},{"msup":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"+","mn":"0"},{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"uj","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":"\/"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"uj","mn":"2"}},"mo":"-","mi":"k"}}}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":"\/"},"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":["for","k","m"]}},{"mi":["n","k"],"mo":["\u2264","\u2264"],"mrow":{"mi":["K","max"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}],"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["j ","min ","max"]},"Optionally a threshold value Cwill be imposed on the goodness measure C(k), and local maxima of C(k) which do not exceed the threshold value Cwill be ignored.

That is, the graph of the \u201cgoodness\u201d values C(k) versus the candidate pitch period k is tracked. Each local maximum is identified as a possible peak. However, the existence of a peak at this identified local maximum is not confined until the function has thereafter dropped by a constant amount. This confirmed local maximum then provides one of the pitch period candidates. After each peak candidate has been identified in this fashion, the algorithm then looks for a valley. That is, each local minimum is identified as a possible valley, but is not confirmed as a valley until the function has thereafter risen by a predetermined constant value. The valleys are not separately reported out, but a confirmed valley is required after a confirmed peak before a new peak will be identified. In the presently preferred embodiment, where the goodness values are defined to be bounded by +1 or \u22121, the constant value required for confirmation of a peak or for a valley has been set at 0.2, but this can be widely varied. Thus, this stage provides a variable number of pitch candidates as output, from zero up to 15.","In the presently preferred embodiment, the set of pitch period candidates provided by the foregoing steps is then provided to a dynamic programming algorithm. This dynamic programming algorithm tracks both pitch and voicing decisions, to provide a pitch and voicing decision for each frame which is optimal in the context of its neighbors.","Given the candidate pitch values and their goodness values C(k), dynamic programming is now used to obtain an optimum pitch contour which includes an optimum voicing decision for each frame. The dynamic programming requires several frames of speech in a segment of speech to be analyzed before the pitch and voicing for the first frame of the segment can be decided. At each frame of the speech segment, every pitch candidate is compared to the retained pitch candidates from the previous frame. Every retained pitch candidate from the previous frame carries with it a cumulative penalty, and every comparison between each new pitch candidate and any of the retained pitch candidates also has a new distance measure. Thus, for each pitch candidate in the new frame, there is a smallest penalty which represents a best match with one of the retained pitch candidates of the previous frame. When the smallest cumulative penalty has been calculated for each new candidate, the candidate is retained along with its cumulative penalty and a back pointer to the best match in the previous frame. Thus, the back pointers define a trajectory which has a cumulative penalty as listed in the cumulative penalty value of the last frame in the project rate. The optimum trajectory for any given frame is obtained by choosing the trajectory with the minimum cumulative penalty. The unvoiced state is defined as a pitch candidate at each frame. The penalty function preferably includes voicing information, so that the voicing decision is a natural outcome of the dynamic programming strategy. In the presently preferred embodiment, the dynamic programming strategy is 16 wide and 6 deep. That is, 15 candidates (or fewer) plus the \u201cunvoiced\u201d decision (stated for convenience as a zero pitch period) are identified as possible pitch periods at each frame, and all 16 candidates, together with their goodness values, are retained for the 6 previous frames.","The decisions as to pitch and voicing are made final only with respect to the oldest frame contained in the dynamic programming algorithm. That is, the pitch and voicing decision would accept the candidate pitch at frame F\u22125 whose current trajectory cost was minimal. That is, of the 16 (or fewer) trajectories ending at most recent frame F, the candidate pitch in frame Fwhich has the lowest cumulative trajectory cost identifies the optimal trajectory. This optimal trajectory is then followed back and used to make the pitch\/voicing decision for frame F-5. Note that no final decision is made as to pitch candidates in succeeding frames (F-4, etc.), since the optimal trajectory may no longer appear optimal after more frames are evaluated. Of course, as is well known to those skilled in the art of numerical optimization, a final decision in such a dynamic programming algorithm can alternatively be made at other times, e.g., in the next to last frame held in the buffer.","In addition, the width and depth of the buffer can be widely varied. For example, as many as 64 pitch candidates could be evaluated, or as few as two; the buffer could retain as few as one previous frame, or as many as 16 previous frames or more, and other modifications and variations can be instituted as will be recognized by those skilled in the art. The dynamic programming algorithm is defined by the transition error between a pitch period candidate in one frame and another pitch period candidate in the succeeding frame. In the presently preferred embodiment, this transition error is defined as the sum of three parts: an error Edue to pitch deviations, an error E, due to pitch candidates having a low \u201cgoodness\u201d value, and an error Edue to the voicing transition.","The pitch deviation error Eis a function of the current pitch period and the previous pitch period as given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0237","num":"0276"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["E","p"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"min","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","D"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["B","p"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":"tau","msub":{"mi":["tau","p"]}}}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","D"]},"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["B","p"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":"tau","msub":{"mi":["tau","p"]}}}}},{"mi":["Bp","ln"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mn":"2"}]}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","D"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["B","p"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mi":"tau","msub":{"mi":["tau","p"]}}}},{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":"\/"}}}],"mo":"+"}}}}}}]}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["p","p","N ","p ","p","D","N "]},"The voicing state error, E, is a function of the \u201cgoodness\u201d value C(k) of the current frame pitch candidate being considered.

Again, the definition of the voicing transition error could be widely varied. The key feature of the voicing transition error as defined here is that, whenever a voicing state change occurs (voiced to unvoiced or unvoiced to voiced) a penalty is assessed which is a decreasing function of the spectral difference between the two frames. That is, a change in the voicing state is disfavored unless a significant spectral change also occurs.","Such a definition of a voicing transition error provides significant advantages in the present invention, since it reduces the processing time required to provide excellent voicing state decisions.","The other errors Eand Ewhich make up the transition error in the presently preferred embodiment can also be variously defined. That is, the voicing state error can be defined in any fashion which generally favors pitch period hypotheses which appear to fit the data in the current frame well over those which fit the data less well. Similarly, the pitch deviation error Ecan be defined in any fashion which corresponds generally to changes in the pitch period. It is not necessary for the pitch deviation error to include provision for doubling and halving, as stated here, although such provision is desirable.","A further optional feature of the invention is that, when the pitch deviation error contains provisions to track pitch across doublings and halvings, it may be desirable to double (or halve) the pitch period values along the optimal trajectory, after the optimal trajectory has been identified, to make them consistent as far as possible.","It should also be noted that it is not necessary to use all of the three identified components of the transition error. For example, the voicing state error could be omitted, if some previous stage screened out pitch hypotheses with a low \u201cgoodness\u201d value, or if the pitch periods were rank ordered by \u201cgoodness\u201d value in some fashion such that the pitch periods having a higher goodness value would be preferred, or by other means. Similarly, other components can be included in the transition error definition as desired.","It should also be noted that the dynamic programming method taught by the present invention does not necessarily have to be applied to pitch period candidates extracted from an adaptively filtered residual signal, nor even to pitch period candidates which have been derived from the LPC residual signal at all, but can be applied to any set of pitch period candidates, including pitch period candidates extracted directly from the original input speech signal.","These three errors are then summed to provide the total error between some one pitch candidate in the current frame and some one pitch candidate in the preceding frame. As noted above, these transition errors are then summed cumulatively, to provide cumulative penalties for each trajectory in the dynamic programming algorithm.","This dynamic programming method for simultaneously finding both pitch and voicing is itself novel, and need not be used only in combination with the presently preferred method of finding pitch period candidates. Any method of finding pitch period candidates can be used in combination with this novel dynamic programming algorithm. Whatever the method used to find pitch period candidates, the candidates are simply provided as input to the dynamic programming algorithm.","In particular, while the embodiment of the present invention using a minicomputer and high-precision sampling is presently preferred, this system is not economical for large-volume applications.

This may form part of a registration process. For example, the user could speak into a microphone connected to his or her computer when prompted to do so during a registration process. The resulting voice data would be sent over the network, e.g., Internet, to a website where it would be stored for later retrieval during a verification process. Then, when a user wanted to access the website, or a certain portion of the website, the user would be prompted for a voice sample, which would be received and compared to the voice data stored at the website. As an option, the voice scan could include a password of the user.","Preferably, the voice scan includes more than one phrase spoken by the user for added security. In such an embodiment, for example, multiple passwords could be stored as part of the voice scan and the user would be required to give a voice sample of all of the passwords. Alternatively, different phrases could be required for different levels of access or different portions of data. The different phrases could also be used as navigation controls, such as associating phrases with particular pages on a website. The user would be prompted for a password. Depending on the password received, the page of the website associated with that password would be displayed.","Allowing the voice scan to include more than one phrase also allows identity verification by comparing alternate phrases, such as by prompting the user to speak an additional phrase if the identity of the user is not verified with a first phrase. For example, if the user's voice sample almost matches the voice scan, but the discrepancies between the two are above a predetermined threshold, the user can be requested to speak another phrase, which would also be used to verify the identity of the user. This would allow a user more than one opportunity to attempt to access the data, and could be particularly useful for a user who has an illness, such as a cold, that slightly alters the user's voice. Optionally, the voice sample of the user and\/or a time and date the voice sample was received from the user may be recorded.","With reference to operation  of , an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is of a system and method for establishing a positive or negative identity of a speaker which employ at least two different voice authentication devices and which can be used for supervising a controlled access into a secured-system.

A speaker, , communicates, either simultaneously or sequentially, with a secured-system  and a security-center . The voice of speaker  is analyzed for authentication by security-center , and if authentication is positively established by security-center , a communication command is transmitted therefrom to secured-system , positive identification (ID) of speaker , as indicated by , is established, and access of speaker  to secured-system  is allowed.","The prior art system of  employs a single voice authentication algorithm. As such, this system suffers the above described tradeoff between false-acceptance and false-rejection rates, resulting in too high false-acceptance and\/or too high false-rejection rates, which render the system non-secured and\/or non-efficient, respectively.","The present invention is a system and method for establishing an identity of a speaker via at least two different voice authentication algorithms. Selecting the voice authentication algorithms significantly different from one another (e.g., text-dependent and text-independent algorithms) ensures that the algorithms are statistically not fully correlated with one another, with respect to false-acceptance and false-rejection events, i.e., r<1.0, wherein \u201cr\u201d is a statistical correlation coefficient.","Assume that two different voice authentication algorithms are completely decorrelated (i.e., r=0) and that the false rejection threshold of each of the algorithms is set to a low value, say 0.5%, then, according to the tradeoff rule, and as predicted by FIG. 1 of J. Guavain, L. Lamel and B. Prouts (March, 1995) LIMSI 1995 scientific report the false acceptance rate for each of the algorithms is expected to be exceptionally high, in the order of 8% in this case.","However, if positive identity is established only if both algorithms positively authenticate the speaker, then the combined false acceptance is expected to be (8%-2), or 0.6%, whereas the combined false rejection is expected to be 0.5%\u00d72, or 1%.","The expected value of the combined false acceptance is expected to increase and the expected value of the false rejection is expected to decrease as the degree of correlation between the algorithms increases, such that if full correlation is experienced (i.e., r=1.0), the combined values of the example given are reset at 0.5% and 8%.","Please note that the best EER value characterized the algorithms employed by B. Prouts was 3.5%. Extrapolating the plots of B. Prouts to similarly represent an algorithm with EER value of 2% (which is, at present, the state-of-the-art) one may choose to set false rejection at 0.3%, then false acceptance falls in the order of 4.6%, to obtain a combined false acceptance of 0.2% and a combined false rejection of 0.6%.","Thus, the concept of \u201cdifferent algorithms\u201d as used herein in the specification and in the claims section below refers to algorithms having a correlation of r<1.0.","With reference now to , presented is a system for establishing an identity of a speaker according to the present invention, which is referred to hereinbelow as system .","Thus, system  includes a computerized system , which includes at least two voice authentication algorithms , two are shown and are marked and ","Algorithms  are selected different from one another, and each serves for independently analyzing a voice of the speaker, for obtaining an independent positive or negative authentication of the voice by each.

The user also inputs his or her voice input through the microphone , and the periodic sampling unit  and the voice characteristic information extraction unit  process the voice input for generating the test voice characteristic information and outputting to the speaker recognition unit . Finally, the speaker recognition unit  determines as to whether the test voice characteristic information substantially match the selected standard voice characteristic information. The determination is indicated by an output determination signal for authorizing the local processing unit - to proceed further transaction involving the administrative processing unit . In summary, the above described preferred embodiment substantially processes the input voice data at the local processing unit.","Voice-Enabled Control And Navigation on the Internet",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0310","num":"0349"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["3500","3502","3504","3506"]},"In one embodiment of the present invention, the data includes a voice-activated application.

This vocabulary provides, for example, for spoken control of a device  and for spoken control of access to the information transmitted by information distribution center . Specifically, terminal unit  receives vocabulary data from information distribution center  and speech (\u201cutterance\u201d) data from a user. Terminal unit  includes a processor for executing a speech recognition algorithm for comparing the vocabulary data and the spoken command data to recognize, for example, commands for controlling device  or commands for accessing information transmitted by information distribution center . Terminal unit  then appropriately generates a command for controlling device  or for accessing information transmitted by information distribution center . As used herein, a speech recognition algorithm refers to an algorithm which converts spoken audio input into text or corresponding commands. A speaker verification algorithm refers to an algorithm which verifies the claimed identity of a speaker based upon a sample of the claimant's speech. A speaker identification algorithm refers to an algorithm which identifies a speaker from a list of previously sampled alternatives based upon audio input from a speaker. A speaker identification algorithm may be used, for example, to limit the ability to control the device and\/or access information to particular speakers.","The vocabulary data transmitted from information distribution center  to terminal unit  may, for example, be phoneme data. A phoneme is a member of the set of the smallest units of speech that serve to distinguish one utterance from another in a language or dialect. Each sound or spoken word in the vocabulary may thus be represented by a combination of phonemes. Alternatively, the vocabulary data may be template data generated by having a person or persons speak each sound or word. Each spoken sound or word in the vocabulary may thus be represented by a respective corresponding template. It should be noted that although the system of  illustrates a system in which information from information providers -, . . . , -and the vocabulary data are transmitted over the same communication link, the invention is not limited in this respect. Thus, information from information service providers -, . . . , -and the vocabulary data may be transmitted over different communications links.","Many different arrangements may be utilized to provide the speech data to terminal unit . In a first illustrative, but non-limiting, arrangement, a remote control is provided which includes a wireless microphone or related transducer for transmitting sounds or words spoken by a user to terminal unit  via electrical, optical, or radio frequency signals. Terminal unit  then includes a receiver, an analog front end for conditioning the received signal, a codec for performing an analog-to-digital conversion of the conditioned signal, and an interface circuit for interfacing to the processor. By conditioning is meant noise cancellation, noise reduction, filtering, and other known techniques for, for example, modifying a received electrical signal originating from a voice transducer. In a second illustrative arrangement, a remote control is provided with a microphone, an analog receiver for conditioning the sound signal from the microphone, a codec for performing an analog-to-digital conversion of the conditioned signal, and a transmitter for transmitting the digitized sound data signal to terminal unit  using, for example, infrared or radio frequency signals. Terminal unit  then includes a receiver for receiving the digitized sound data signal and an interface circuit for interfacing to the processor. The digitized sound data signal will typically require a data transfer rate of at least 64 k bits per second. In a third illustrative arrangement, a remote control is provided with a microphone, an analog receiver for conditioning the sound signal from the microphone, a codec for performing an analog-to-digital conversion of the conditioned signal, a digital signal processor for analyzing the digitized sound signal to extract spectral data, and a transmitter for transmitting the spectral data to terminal unit  using, for example, infrared signals. Terminal unit  then includes a receiver for receiving the spectral data and an interface circuit for interfacing to the processor. Because spectral data is transmitted in this third arrangement as opposed to the digitized sound data in the second arrangement, the data rate is much lower, i.e., less than 3610 k bits per second. Because spectral analysis is performed in the remote control, the loading of the processor of terminal unit  is reduced during the recognition operation by 30-50% as compared with the second arrangement. In a fourth illustrative arrangement, terminal unit  is provided with a microphone, an analog front end to condition the sound signal from the microphone, a codec to perform an analog-to-digital conversion of the conditioned signal, and an interface circuit for interfacing to the processor. In a fifth illustrative arrangement, terminal unit  is provided with a microphone, an analog front end to condition the sound signal from the microphone, a codec to perform an analog-to-digital conversion of the conditioned signal, a digital signal processor for analyzing the digitized sound signal to extract spectral data, and an interface circuit for interfacing to the processor bus. The digital signal processor in the fifth arrangement is used to lower loading on the processor of terminal unit  as compared with the fourth arrangement. These various arrangements are illustrative only and other arrangements may be utilized to provide speech data to terminal unit  within the scope of the instant invention.","The vocabulary data transmitted by information distribution center  may define commands which a user may speak to control device . Device  may be any device which is capable of being operated in response to user-supplied commands and the instant invention is not limited in this respect. Thus, device  may be, for example, a television, a stereo receiver, a video cassette recorder, an audio cassette recorder, a compact disc (CD) player, a video disc player, a video game player, or a computer. As an illustration, assume that device  is a computer which is plugged into a switched power outlet of terminal unit  and that it is desired to allow a user to control the on and off switching of the computer by speaking the commands \u201cPOWER ON\u201d and \u201cPOWER OFF\u201d, respectively. Information distribution center  would then transmit to terminal unit  phonemic or template vocabulary data defining a command vocabulary having the words POWER, ON, and OFF. When the user says either \u201cPOWER ON\u201d or \u201cPOWER OFF\u201d and the speech data corresponding to the command is provided to terminal unit  using any of the arrangements described above, the processor of terminal unit  executes the speech recognition algorithm to compare the spoken command with the phonemic or template data representing the command vocabulary in order to recognize the spoken command. Terminal unit  then appropriately controls device , i.e., either switching the computer on or off. Since the computer is plugged into a switched power outlet of terminal unit  as described above, the on and off switching of the computer is implemented internally to terminal unit . However, the instant invention is also applicable to situations where the recognized command is passed to device  for execution via a communication link. Such a communication link may, for example, be the Internet, an infrared link, an RF link, a coaxial cable, a telephone network, a satellite system, or an optical fiber and the invention is not limited in this respect.","The vocabulary data may alternatively or additionally define words and commands which a user may speak to access information transmitted from information distribution center . This feature permits a user to perform tasks which would be very difficult to perform with a menu driven user interface. For example, this feature can be used to perform a keyword search of the titles of news articles transmitted from information distribution center  using a \u201cSEARCH KEYWORDS\u201d command. Specifically, information distribution center  determines which individual words are to serve as the keywords and generates a phonemic or template \u201cdictionary\u201d which maps these keywords to phonemes or templates. Information distribution center  transmits the news articles and the dictionary to terminal unit  where they are stored in memory. For each keyword, terminal unit  generates the corresponding phonemic or template string using the dictionary. The string is then \u201cregistered\u201d with the speech recognition algorithm as a single recognizable utterance, i.e., it becomes a basic part of the speech recognition algorithm's vocabulary. The registration includes specifying an identifier for the phonemic or template string which could be a numerical value or the keyword itself When the user then speaks the \u201cSEARCH KEYWORDS\u201d command, a display dedicated to this command is provided, for example, on a display device associated with terminal unit  or on a computer connected to terminal unit . The user may then speak a command \u201cONLY KEYWORD\u201d to limit the search by terminal unit  to news articles transmitted by information distribution center  having the spoken KEYWORD in the title. The user may then speak additional keywords to refine the search or may view the news articles having the spoken keyword in the title. It can readily be seen that performing such a task using a conventional menu driven user interface would be extremely difficult.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0320","num":"0359"},"figref":["FIGS. 37A","FIG. 37C","FIG. 37A","FIG. 37A","FIG. 37B","FIG. 37A"],"b":["37","37","3720","1","3720","3714","1","3714","3714","2","3715","3718","3718","3721","3722","2","3714","1","3714","3","3715","3716","3715","3714","1","3714","3","3714","1","3714","3","3716","3716","3718","3721","3716","3714","1","3722","1","3716","3714","3","3722","3","3722","1","3722","2","3722","3","3723","3725","3723","3725","3725","3725"],"i":["n ","n "]},"Referring to , an Internet down-link  at head-end installation  provides received signals -, -, and -. Head-end installation  serves as a communications hub, interfacing to the various information providers, and connecting them on a conditional basis to subscriber locations -, . . . , -. For example, received digital data signal - is supplied to a receiver - and then to a modulator -, where it is modulated onto a distinct cable channel. Modulator - may employ any suitable modulation technique such as quadrature partial response (QPR) modulation. Received analog television signal - is supplied to a receiver -, then to a scrambler  for scrambling, and then to a modulator -, where it is modulated into a distinct cable channel. As will be discussed in detail below, scrambler  also inserts in-band data into analog television signal -. It will be apparent that additional receivers, modulators, and, optionally, scramblers may be similarly provided for digital and analog information signals received from other information providers, either local or remote (not shown).","Received digital data signal - is provided to an information signal processor (ISP)  so that it may be transmitted using so-called in-band or out-of-band transmissions. Other data streams (not shown) from other information providers may also be provided to ISP . ISP  is responsible for receiving the one or more data signals and then transmitting data to the subscriber terminal locations as will now be described. ISP  provides data to scrambler . ISP  may provide data to additional scramblers depending on factors such as the amount of data to be transmitted and the speed at which the data must be supplied and updated. Data is repetitively sent out by scrambler . If there is only one scrambler and a large amount of data, the repetition rate will be slow. Use of more than one scrambler allows the data repetition rate to increase.","Specifically, scrambler  places data in-band for transmission to subscribers, along with scrambling the associated analog television signal -. In one arrangement, data is placed in the vertical blanking interval of the television signal, but data may be placed elsewhere in the signal and the invention is not limited in this respect. For example, data could be amplitude modulated on a sound carrier as is well known. As herein described, in-band transmission means the transmission of data within the video television channel comprising both audio and video carriers. Thus, the data from ISP  may be transmitted by amplitude modulation on the sound carrier, hereinafter in-band audio data, or in the vertical or horizontal blanking periods of an analog television signal, hereinafter in-band video data. ISP  may also be arranged to supply the data for transmission during unused portions a digital data stream such as an MPEG compressed video data stream.","ISP  can also receive and\/or generate information locally. For example, ISP  may generate messages for transmission to subscribers concerning upcoming events or service interruptions or changes. If received from an information service provider, the information may either be transmitted as received or be reformatted by ISP , then supplied to scrambler  for transmission to subscribers.","ISP  also passes information to a head-end controller (\u201cHEC\u201d) , which is connected to scrambler  and an out-of-band transmitter . Although HEC  is illustrated as being connected to the same scrambler as ISP , HEC  may in fact be connected to a different scrambler or scramblers. HEC  may conveniently be a Scientific-Atlanta Model 8658 for controlling transmission of data to scrambler  and out-of-band transmitter . As noted above, scrambler  places data in-band for transmission to subscribers, along with scrambling an associated television signal. Out-of-band transmitter  transmits information on a separate carrier, i.e., not within a channel. In one implementation, the out-of-band carrier is at 108.2 MHz, but other out-of-band carriers may also be used. The information transmitted under the control of HEC  may, for example, be descrambling data. In one arrangement, information is inserted in each vertical blanking interval to indicate the type of scrambling employed in the next video field. Scrambling systems are well known in the art. For example, sync suppression scrambling, video inversion scrambling, and the like, or some combination of scrambling techniques may be used. Further, authorization information can be transmitted. Authorization information authorizes subscribers to receive certain channels or programs. Information from ISP  and\/or HEC  may also be transmitted over non-scrambled channels via data repeaters (not shown) such as a Scientific-Atlanta Model 8556-100 data repeater as either in-band audio or video data.","Some of the transmitted information is global, i.e., it is transmitted to every subscriber. For example, the descrambling data may be a global transmission. It is noted that just because each subscriber receives the descrambling data does not mean that each subscriber terminal unit can descramble a received signal. Rather, only authorized subscriber terminal units are capable of descrambling the received signal. On the other hand, some information transmissions may be addressed transmissions. For example, authorization information would normally be addressed to individual subscribers. That is, when transmitted, the data will have an address (for example, a subscriber terminal unit serial number) associated with it. The addressed subscriber terminal unit receives the information and responds accordingly. Other subscriber terminal units will ignore the data. Further, there can be group addressed data, which will affect groups of subscriber terminal units.","The outputs of modulators -, -, any additional modulators, and out-of-band transmitter  are supplied to a combiner  that combines the individual channels into a single wide-band signal that is then transmitted via distribution network  to a plurality of subscriber locations -, . . . -(see ). Distribution network  may include, for example, one or more optical transmitters , one or more optical receivers , and a coaxial cable .","As indicated in , subscription television system may include a plurality of head-end installations which each provide information to locations in a particular city or geographic region. A central control  may be provided to coordinate the operation of various head-end installations in subscription television system. Central control  is often associated with the central office of a multi-service operator and may communicate with and control head-end installations in many cities. Central control  includes a system control computer  that directs the other components of central control . One example of a system control computer  is a Scientific-Atlanta System Manager  network controller. Central control  may, for example, provide billing services for the service provider, including billing for pay-per-view events. A billing computer  stores billing data and may also format and print bills. Communication between system control computer  and HEC  may be via modem, although the invention is not limited in this respect. Authorization data may be transmitted from system control computer  to HEC . HEC then  appropriately formats the authorization data and transmits the formatted authorization data to subscriber terminal units either in-band through scrambler  or out-of-band through out-of-band data transmitter  as discussed above.","Head-end installation  also includes an RF processor  for receiving reverse path data communications from subscriber locations -, . . . , -. These data communications may include billing information for impulse-pay-per-view purchases which may be forwarded to system control computer  and may also include subscriber requests for database information maintained at head-end installation . For example, a database server  such as an Oracle\u00ae database server may provide access to reference materials such as encyclopedias, atlases, dictionaries, and the like. The subscriber request is forwarded from RF processor  to an information request processor  which accesses database  for the requested information and forwards the requested information to the requesting subscriber, for example, via an addressed in-band or out-of-band transaction as described above. In addition, information request processor  may also access a communications network  in order to provide subscriber access to other services such as Banking Services.","As the amount of the data transmitted between the head-end installation and the subscriber locations increases, increased use will likely be made of out-of-band and digital transmission. For example, 50 MHz of bandwidth may be dedicated to digital data (non-video) transmission, both forward channel (to the subscriber terminal unit) and reverse channel (from the subscriber terminal unit). 200 MHz or more may also allocated to digital video and 300 MHz to 500 MHz may be allocated for analog video. Accordingly, although various illustrative transmission techniques are discussed above, the present invention is not limited in any respect by the manner in which information is communicated between the head-end installation and the subscriber locations.","Referring to , each subscriber location -, . . . , -includes a subscriber terminal unit  connected to distribution network . \u201cSubscriber location\u201d as used herein refers to any location which is remotely located with respect to head-end installation . In accordance with the instant invention, a subscriber terminal may, for example, be located in a home, a classroom, a hotel room, a hospital room, or an office. Each subscriber terminal unit  may be coupled to one or more devices -, . . . , -. Devices -, . . . , -may include devices which are capable of being operated in response to user-supplied commands and the instant invention is not limited in this respect. Thus, the devices may include televisions, stereo receivers, video cassette recorders (VCRs), audio cassette recorders, compact disc (CD) players, video disc players, video game players, computers, and the like. Certain ones of the devices may be operatively connected together. Thus, as shown in , device - is connected to device -. For example, device - may be a television and device - may be a video cassette recorder. For purposes of discussion, it will be assumed that device - is a video cassette recorder and that device - is a television. One or more of devices -, . . . , -may be connected to switched power outlets of subscriber terminal unit , whereby subscriber terminal unit  may internally effect the on and off switching of these devices. A remote control unit  communicates information to subscriber terminal unit  over a communication link . Communication link  may, for example, be an infrared link.","Language Translation","The system of the present invention makes use of a lexicon and a constrained set of grammar rules to translate a language. The lexicon comprises linguistic units divided into four classes. Each linguistic unit is (1) a single word, such as \u201cdog\u201d or \u201cgovernment\u201d; or (2) a combination of words, such as \u201cparking space\u201d or \u201cprime minister\u201d; or (3) a proper name; or (4) a word with a definition unique to the invention; or (5) one form of a word with multiple meanings. In the latter case, each definition of the word represents a different linguistic unit, the various definitions may appear as entries in different form classes. For purposes of automation, each definition is distinguished, for example, by the number of periods appearing at the end of the word. The entry for the first (arbitrarily designated) definition is listed with no period, the entry representing the second definition is listed with one period at its end, and so on. Alternatively, different word senses can be identified numerically, e.g., using subscripts.","Words unique to the invention may make up a very small proportion of the total lexicon, and none of these words is specific to the invention or alien to the natural language upon which it is based. Instead, invention-specific words are broadened in connotation to limit the overall number of terms in the lexicon. For example, in a preferred implementation, the word \u201cuse\u201d is broadened to connote employment of any object for its primary intended purpose, so that in the sentence \u201cJake use book,\u201d the term connotes reading. The word \u201con\u201d may be used to connote time (e.g., (i go-to ballgame) on yesterday). If desired for ease of use, however, the invention-specific words can be eliminated altogether and the lexicon expanded accordingly.","The invention divides the global lexicon of allowed terms into four classes: \u201cthings\u201d or nominal terms that connote, for example, people, places, items, activities or ideas, identified herein by the code T; \u201cconnectors\u201d that specify relationships between two (or more) nominal terms (including words typically described as prepositions and conjunctions, and terms describing relationships in terms of action, being, or states of being), identified herein by C; \u201cdescriptors\u201d modifying the state of one or more nominal terms (including words typically described as adjectives, adverbs and intransitive verbs), identified herein by D; and \u201clogical connectors\u201d establishing sets of the nominal terms, identified herein by C. The preferred logical connectors are \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d","Naturally, the lexicon cannot and does not contain a list of possible proper names; instead, proper names, like other words not recognized by the invention, are returned inside angle brackets to indicate that translation did not occur. The system also does not recognize verb tenses; connectors are phrased in the present tense, since tense is easily understood from context. Tense may nonetheless be indicated, however, by specifying a time, day and\/or date.","Sentences in accordance with the invention are constructed from terms in the lexicon according to four expansion rules. The most basic sentences proceed from one of the following three constructions (any of which can be created from a T term in accordance with the expansion rules set forth hereinbelow). These structures, which represent the smallest possible sets of words considered to carry information, are the building blocks of more complex sentences. Their structural simplicity facilitates ready translation into conversational, natural-language sentences; thus, even complex sentences in accordance with the invention are easily transformed into natural-language equivalents through modular analysis of the more basic sentence components (a process facilitated by the preferred representations described later).","Basic Structure 1 (BS1) is formed by placing a descriptor after a nominal term to form the structure TD. BS1 sentences such as \u201cdog brown\u201d and \u201cBill swim\u201d readily translate into the English sentence \u201cthe dog is brown\u201d (or the phrase \u201cthe brown dog\u201d) and \u201cBill swims.\u201d","BS2 is formed by placing a connector between two nominal terms to form the structure TCT. BS2 sentences such as \u201cdog eat food\u201d readily translate into English equivalents.","BS3 is found by placing a logical connector between two nominal terms to form a series represented by the structure TCT . . . . The series can be a single conjunction, such as \u201cBob and Ted,\u201d or compound structure such as \u201cBob and Ted and Al and Jill\u201d or \u201cred or blue or green.\u201d","A sentence comprising one or more of the basic structures set forth above may be expanded using the following rules:","Rule I: To a nominal term, add a descriptor (T-->TD)","In accordance with Rule I, any linguistic unit from the nominal class can be expanded into the original item followed by a new item from the descriptor class, which modifies the original item. For example, \u201cdog\u201d becomes \u201cdog big.\u201d Like all rules of the invention, Rule I is not limited in its application to an isolated nominal term (although this is how BS1 sentences are formed); instead, it can be applied to any nominal term regardless of location within a larger sentence. Thus, in accordance with Rule I, TD1-->(TD2)D1. For example, \u201cdog big\u201d becomes \u201c(dog brown) big\u201d (corresponding to English sentence, \u201cthe brown dog is big\u201d).","The order of addition may or may not be important in the case of consecutive adjectives, since these independently modify T; for example, in \u201c(dog big) brown,\u201d the adjective \u201cbig\u201d distinguishes this dog from other dogs, and \u201cbrown\u201d may describe a feature thought to be otherwise unknown to the listener. The order of addition is almost always important where a D term is an intransitive verb. For example, expanding the TD sentence \u201cdog run\u201d (corresponding to \u201cthe dog runs\u201d or \u201cthe running dog\u201d) by addition of the descriptor \u201cfast\u201d forms, in accordance with Rule I, \u201c(dog fast) run\u201d (corresponding to \u201cthe fast dog runs\u201d).","To express \u201cthe dog runs fast,\u201d it is necessary to expand the TD sentence \u201cdog fast\u201d with the descriptor \u201crun\u201d in the form \u201c(dog run) fast.\u201d","Applying expansion Rule I to the structure BS2 produces TCT-->(TD)CT. For example, \u201cdog eat food\u201d becomes \u201c(dog big) eat food.\u201d Rule I can also be applied to compound nominal terms of the form TCT, so that a structure of form BS3 becomes TCT-->(TCT)D. For example, \u201cmother and father\u201d becomes \u201c(mother and father) drive.\u201d In this way, multiple nominal terms can be combined, either conjunctively or alternatively, for purposes of modification. It should also be noted that verbs having transitive senses, such as \u201cdrive,\u201d are included in the database as connectors as well as descriptors. Another example is the verb \u201ccapsize,\u201d which can be intransitive (\u201cboat capsize\u201d) as well as transitive (\u201ccaptain capsize boat\u201d).","Rule IIa: To a nominal term, add a connector and another nominal term (T-->TCT).","In accordance with Rule IIa, any linguistic unit from the nominal class can be replaced with a connector surrounded by two nominal entries, one of which is the original linguistic unit. For example, \u201chouse\u201d becomes \u201chouse on hill.\u201d Applying expansion Rule IIa to BS1 produces TD-->(TCT)D; for example, \u201cgloomy house\u201d becomes \u201c(house on hill) gloomy,\u201d or \u201cthe house on the hill is gloomy.\u201d Rule IIa can be used to add a transitive verb and its object. For example, the compound term \u201cmother and father\u201d can be expanded to \u201c(mother and father) drive car.\u201d","Rule IIb: To a nominal term, add a logical connector and another nominal term (T-->TCT).","In accordance with Rule IIb, any linguistic unit from the nominal class can be replaced with a connector surrounded by two nominal entries, one of which is the original linguistic unit. For example, \u201cdog\u201d becomes \u201cdog and cat.\u201d","Again, for purposes of Rule IIa and Rule IIb, a nominal term can be a composite consisting of two or more nominal terms joined by a connector. For example, the expansion \u201c(john and bill) go-to market\u201d satisfies Rule Ia. Subsequently applying Rule I, this sentence can be further expanded to \u201c(john and bill) go-to market) together.","Rule III: To a descriptor, add a logical connector and another descriptor (D-->DCD).","In accordance with Rule III, a descriptor can be replaced with a logical connector surrounded by two descriptors, one of which is the original. For example, \u201cbig\u201d becomes \u201cbig and brown.\u201d Applying expansion Rule III to BS1 produces TD-->T(DCD); for example \u201cdog big\u201d (equivalent to \u201cthe dog is big,\u201d or \u201cthe big dog\u201d) becomes \u201cdog (big and brown)\u201d (equivalent to \u201cthe dog is big and brown\u201d or \u201cthe big brown dog\u201d).","The manner in which these rules are applied to form acceptable sentences in accordance with the invention is shown in . Beginning with a nominal term such as cat, shown at , any of the three basic structures can be formed by following expansion Rules I, IIa and IIb as shown at , , , respectively, to produce \u201ccat striped\u201d (BS1), \u201ccat on couch\u201d (BS2) or \u201ccat and Sue\u201d (BS3). Iterative application of expansion rule Ha at  and  produces structures of the forms TC1 T1-->(TCI T1)C2 T2 or \u201c((cat on couch) eat mouse)\u201d and (TC1 T1)C2 T2-->((TCI T1)C2 T2)C3 T3 or \u201c(((cat on couch) eat mouse) with tail).\u201d Expansion rule I can be applied at any point to a T linguistic unit as shown at  (to modify the original T, cat, to produce \u201c(happy cat) on couch\u201d) and  (to modify \u201ceat mouse\u201d). Rule III can also be applied as shown at  (to further modify cat to produce \u201c(((happy and striped) cat) on couch)\u201d) and  (to further modify \u201ceat mouse\u201d).","Expansion Rule I can be applied iteratively as shown at ,  to further modify the original T (although, as emphasized at , a descriptor need not be an adjective). Expansion Rule IIa is available to show action of the modified T (as shown at ), and Rule I can be used to modify the newly introduced T (as shown at ). Rule I can also be used to modify (in the broad sense of the invention) a compound subject formed by Rule IIb, as shown at . The order in which linguistic units are assembled can strongly affect meaning. For example, the expansion TCI TI-->(TCI T1)C2 T2 can take multiple forms. The construct \u201ccat hit (ball on couch)\u201d conveys a meaning different from \u201ccat hit ball (on couch).\u201d In the former the ball is definitely on the couch, and in the latter the action is taking place on the couch. The sentence \u201cJohn want car) fast\u201d indicates that the action should be accomplished quickly, while \u201cJohn want (car fast))\u201d means that the car should move quickly.

As indicated therein, the system includes a main bi-directional bus , over which all system components communicate. The main sequence of instructions effectuating the invention, as well as the databases discussed below, reside on a mass storage device (such as a hard disk or optical storage unit)  as well as in a main system memory  during operation. Execution of these instructions and effectuation of the functions of the invention is accomplished by a central-processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) . The user interacts with the system using a keyboard  and a position-sensing device (e.g., a mouse) . The output of either device can be used to designate information or select particular areas of a screen display  to direct functions to be performed by the system. The main memory  contains a group of modules that control the operation of CPU  and its interaction with the other hardware components. An operating system  directs the execution of low-level, basic system functions such as memory allocation, file management and operation of mass storage devices . At a higher level, an analysis module , implemented as a series of stored instructions, directs execution of the primary functions performed by the invention, as discussed below; and instructions defining a user interface  allow straightforward interaction over screen display . User interface  generates words or graphical images on display  to prompt action by the user, and accepts user commands from keyboard  and\/or position-sensing device . Main memory  also includes a partition defining a series of databases capable of storing the linguistic units of the invention, and representatively denoted by reference numerals , , , . These databases , which may be physically distinct (i.e., stored in different memory partitions and as separate files on storage device ) or logically distinct (i.e., stored in a single memory partition as a structured list that may be addressed as a plurality of databases), each contain all of the linguistic units corresponding to a particular class in at least two languages. In other words, each database is organized as a table each of whose columns lists all of the linguistic units of the particular class in a single language, so that each row contains the same linguistic unit expressed in the different languages the system is capable of translating. In the illustrated implementation, nominal terms are contained in database , and a representative example of the contents of that database in a single language (English)\u2014that is, the contents of one column in what would be a multi-column working database\u2014appears in Table 9; connectors are contained in database , an exemplary column of which appears in Table 10; descriptors are contained

input buffer  receives from the user, via keyboard , an input sentence that is preferably structured in accordance with the invention and formatted as described below. In this case, analysis module  initially examines the input sentence for conformance to the structure. Following this, module  processes single linguistic units of the input sentence in an iterative fashion, addressing the databases to locate the entries corresponding to each linguistic unit in the given language, as well as the corresponding entries in the target language. Analysis module  translates the sentence by replacing the input entries with the entries from the target language, entering the translation into an output buffer  whose contents appears on screen display .","It must be understood that although the modules of main memory  have been described separately, this is for clarity of presentation only; so long as the system performs all necessary functions, it is immaterial how they are distributed within the system and the programming architecture thereof.","In order to facilitate convenient analysis by module , input sentences are preferably structured in a characteristic, easily processed format that facilitates both straightforward identification of individual linguistic units and simple verification that the sequence of units qualifies as a legitimate sentence in accordance with the expansion rules of the invention. In one approach (\u201cportrait form\u201d), each linguistic unit of a sentence appears in a separate line. If an expansion has been applied, an asterisk (*) is used to mark where the expansion occurred; that is, the * is used to connect basic sentence structures together to form larger sentences. For example, drawing from the entries in ,\n\n","Alternatively, the sentence can be expressed in an algebraic (\u201clandscape\u201d) format where expansions are identified by enclosing the expansion terms in parentheses:\n\n","In either case, the user's input is treated as a character string, and using standard string-analysis routines, module  identifies the separate linguistic units and the expansion points. It then compares these with templates corresponding to the allowed expansion rules to validate the sentence, following which database lookup and translation take place. If the sentence fails to conform to the rules of the invention, module  alerts the user via screen display .","In accordance with either of these representation formats, plurals in English are noted by adding \u201c\/s\u201d to the end of a singular noun (e.g., \u201cnation\/s\u201d). In other languages, the most generic method of forming plurals is used; for example, in French, \u201c\/s\u201d is added as in English, but in Italian, \u201c\/i\u201d is added. Numbers are expressed numerically.","Alternatively, analysis module  can be configured to process unformatted input sentences. To accomplish this, module  looks up each input word (or, as appropriate, groups of words) in databases  and builds a representation of the sentence in terms of the linguistic classes comprising it\u2014that is, replacing each unit with its linguistic class symbol. Module  then assesses whether the resulting sequence of classes could have been generated in accordance with the allowed expansion rules, and if so, groups the linguistic units to facilitate lookup and translation. The output is provided either in an unstructured format corresponding to the input or in one of the formats set forth above. The latter form of output is preferred, since word strings in one language rarely correspond sensibly to word strings in another language produced solely by substitution; it is generally easier to comprehend output in a form that isolates the linguistic units and highlights expansions. The invention may incorporate additional features to simplify operation. For example, as noted above, words having multiple senses are differentiated by ending periods; naturally, the number of periods following a particular sense of the word represents an arbitrary choice. Accordingly, an additional database  can comprise a dictionary of words having multiple meanings, with the invention-recognized format of each sense of the word set next to the various definitions. User interface  interprets the user's clicking on one of the definitions as selection thereof, and enters the proper encoding of the word into input buffer .","Similarly, because considerations of economy and speed of operation limit the overall desirable size of the databases, one of the databases  can be set up as a thesaurus that gives the closest invention-recognized linguistic unit to an unrecognized input word. In operation, when following an unsuccessful attempt by analysis module  to locate a word in the databases, module  can be programmed to consult the thesaurus database  and return a list of words that do, in fact, appear in the linguistic-unit databases.","Module  can also include certain utilities that recognize and correct (e.g., after approval by the user) frequently made errors in sentence construction. For example, the present invention ordinarily indicates possession by a named person using the verb \u201cto have\u201d; thus, the sentence \u201cPaul's computer is fast\u201d is represented (in algebraic format) as \u201cpaul have (computer fast)\u201d or \u201c(computer of paul) fast\u201d; if the person is unnamed, the usual possessive pronouns may be used (e.g., \u201c(computer my) fast\u201d).
