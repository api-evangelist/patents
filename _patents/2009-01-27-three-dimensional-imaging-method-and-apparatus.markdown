title: Three dimensional imaging method and apparatus
abstract: Three-dimensional imaging techniques are used for a visualization method and apparatus. In a preferred embodiment, terrain data is displayed as a series of pixels—areas of terrain elevation data. Individual pixels are analyzed to determine whether they are locally smooth or “warpable” relative to their surrounding neighbor pixels. Those pixels that are locally relatively “smooth,” i.e., those satisfying a given set of criteria, are joined with adjacent neighbor pixels by a process referred to herein as “warping” to create “smooth,” gap-free surfaces. A preferred embodiment includes drawing or generating lines between the centers of two pairs of adjacent pixels to determine a slopes mand mrespectively. The slopes mand mare then analyzed using the following equations/determinations: |m∥≦m; |m∥≦m; and |m−m|≦Δmax; i.e., the slopes mand mmust each be less than or equal to a predetermined threshold mand the difference between the slopes must be less than or equal to a predetermined difference Δmax.

No. 61\/023,961 filed Jan. 28, 2008, entitled \u201cA Novel Technique for Visualizing High-Resolution 3-D Terrain Maps,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","Appendix A contains a partial computer program listing adapted for a preferred embodiment of the present invention.","This invention relates to digital terrain elevation techniques and\/or three dimensional imaging techniques involving scenes, landscapes, ground areas, environmental surroundings (indoors and outdoors), and the like.","With the arrival of GPS in the 1980's, GPS based surveying technology has made airborne surveying and mapping applications practical. Many have been developed, using downward-looking lidar instruments mounted in aircraft or satellites. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is an optical remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to determine the distance to a target and\/or gather other information from a target. The distance to an object or target is measured using the time between the transmission of the initial pulse and receipt of the reflected signal. As used herein, the term Lidar or LIDAR includes ALSM (Airborne Laser Swath Mapping), laser altimetry, and LADAR (Laser Detection and Ranging), Lidar differs from radar in that lidar utilizes much shorter wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum are used, typically in the ultraviolet, visible, or near infrared. An example of lidar usage is the NASA Experimental Advanced Research Lidar. In general, it is possible to image a feature or object only about the same size as the wavelength, or larger. The wavelengths are much smaller than radio (radar) systems, and range from about 10 micrometers to the UV (ca. 250 nm). At such wavelengths, the waves are \u201creflected\u201d very well from small objects, referred to as backscattering. Different types of scattering are used for different lidar applications; most common are Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering and Raman scattering as well as fluorescence.","A laser typically has a very narrow beam which allows the mapping of physical features with very high resolution compared with radar. Suitable combinations of lasers can allow for remote mapping of atmospheric contents by looking for wavelength-dependent changes in the intensity of the returned signal.","For example, B. L. Stann, et al., \u201cIntensity-modulated diode laser radar using frequency-modulation\/continuous-wave ranging techniques,\u201d Optical Engineering, Vol. 35, No. 11, 1996, pp. 3270-3278, discloses an adaptation of frequency modulation (FM) radar ranging principles to an incoherent laser radar (LADAR). The LADAR's laser transmitter output is amplitude-modulated with a radio-frequency subcarrier, which itself is linearly frequency-modulated. The subcarrier signal may have a start frequency in the tens to low hundreds of megahertz and a stop frequency in the hundreds of megahertz to low gigahertz. The difference between the start and stop frequency, F, is chosen to establish the desired range resolution R using, inter alia, the equation R=c\/2 F, where c is the velocity of light. Light reflected from the target is incoherently detected with a photodiode and converted into a voltage waveform which is mixed with an undelayed sample of the original modulation waveform. After \u201cclutter\u201d is removed, the waveform is processed coherently using the discrete Fourier transform to provide target amplitude and range information.","Similarly, B. L. Stann in \u201cResearch Progress on a Focal Plane Array Ladar System Using_Chirped_Amplitude_Modulation,\u201d Proc. SPIE Laser Radar Technology and Applications VIII, Vol. 5086, 2003, disclosed the construction of a 32\u00d732 pixel focal plane array (FPA) LADAR architecture adapted for smart munitions, reconnaissance, face recognition, robotic navigation, etc., using chirped amplitude modulation. Ranging of the LADAR architecture was based on a frequency modulation\/continuous wave technique implemented by directly amplitude modulating a near-IR diode laser transmitter with a radio frequency (rf) subcarrier that was linearly frequency modulated (chirped amplitude modulation). The diode's output was collected and projected to form an illumination field in the downrange image area. The returned signal was focused onto an array of optoelectronic mixing, metal-semiconductor-metal detectors where it was detected and mixed with a delayed replica of the laser modulation signal that modulates the responsivity of each detector. The output of each detector was an intermediate frequency (IF) signal resulting from the mixing process whose frequency was proportional to the target range. Sampling of the IF signal was done continuously over a period of the rf modulation, and a signal processor calculated the discrete fast Fourier transform over the IF waveform in each pixel to establish the ranges and amplitudes of all scatterers.","In addition to an \u201coverhead\u201d view, frequently it is beneficial to visualize the terrain from a perspective of an observer within the surrounding area. Three-dimensional (3-D) terrain mapping technology has been used to provide terrain visualization, with recent improvements being made in resolution, accuracy, quality, and amount of area covered. Resolution has increased to 1 m or better, and accuracy in absolute (world) coordinates of better than 1 m is available. Nonetheless, the transformation of 3-D maps from low resolutions, appropriate only to large areas, to high resolutions, useful at much smaller scales, requires a new approach to terrain visualization. The shortcomings of prior art terrain visualization techniques include those experienced in visualizing data acquired through sensors, such as light detection and ranging (Lidar) devices, that have been employed for applications such as detecting and tracking people and vehicles. Imaging techniques have also incorporated or adapted methods for detection of surface variations. When imaging smaller-scale scenes, conventional devices tend to under-sample small-scale features, such as foliage, fences, railings, and light poles. These features are difficult to identify and distinguish using the commonly employed terrain visualization techniques discussed above. Yet, it is important for a visualization to accommodate this under-sampling and to differentiate between these under-sampled objects and larger, smoother objects like vehicles.","Tracking vehicles and people is of great importance for military efforts. 3-D maps can provide important context information for such tracking, but visualization at both large and small scales is essential. It is important to not only render particular buildings or road intersections, but to meaningfully render the areas immediately surrounding these sites.","One commonly employed technique for terrain visualization involves the generation of single continuous surface. This technique works well for large-scale natural features, such as mountain ranges or canyons, and urban centers dominated by large buildings. Unfortunately, this technique falls short when used to visualize terrain data at smaller scales; natural features such as bushes and trees can become indistinguishable from small hills or man-made objects.","Another commonly available technique for terrain visualization involves the generation of a \u201ccloud\u201d of points. This technique avoids obscuring the rough nature of small-scale natural features, such as bushes and trees. Unfortunately, these natural features are still difficult to identify because the points generated by large-scale features, such as the ground and buildings, tend to predominate and obscure the points generated by small-scale features. Moreover, large-scale features themselves are inadequately rendered with point clouds because point clouds detract from the solid nature of large-scale features.","Examples of conventional three-dimensional (3-D) terrain maps include maps generated by the Rapid Terrain Visualization (RTV) program, now known as the BuckEye, which is run by the Joint Precision Strike Demonstration Project Office, to provide rapid generation of digital terrain data to support emerging crisis or contingency operations. The RTV program maps from an aircraft using both laser radar (ladar) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar sensors. The ladar has higher resolution and produces cleaner and more accurate maps, so ladar data is preferred. This sensor measures the terrain elevation by scanning the area with a laser beam and measuring the time it takes the light to travel from the aircraft sensor to the ground and back. For the ladar, the program advertises a resolution (post spacing) of 1 m, a vertical accuracy of 15-30 cm, and a horizontal accuracy of 30-50 cm. The maps comprise three pieces of information for each 1-mpixel: a backscatter intensity value approximately equivalent to a black and white photograph, the elevation of the first backscatter return from the laser (the highest thing hit), and the elevation of the last return (the lowest thing hit). For most pixels, these two elevations will be the same. But where bushes or trees are present, some of the laser energy will be reflected from the top of the trees as a first-hit return, but some laser energy will also penetrate down to ground to produce the last-hit return. The RTV program also provides a fourth, derived product that is a color image combining the intensity image with hues that are derived from the elevations.","Another currently available three-dimensional imaging software program is \u201c3DEM Software for Terrain Visualization and Flyby Animation,\u201d found at the website http:\/\/www.visualizationsoftware.com\/software.arcgis\/explorer\/index.html. According to the website, the program will produce three dimensional terrain scenes and flyby animations from a wide variety of freely available data sources including: USGS Digital Elevation Model (ASCII DEM) files; USGS Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS DEM) files; NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) files; LIDAR Point Cloud (LAS) files; USGS Global 30 Arc Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30 DEM) files; NOAA Global Land One-km Base Elevation (GLOBE DEM) files; NASA Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) files. Any topographic data file organized by rows and columns of elevation data XYZ, scattered point topographic data files, and terrain data files can be saved in the following formats for use by other GIS programs: USGS ASCII Digital Elevation Model (*.dem), GeoTiff Graphics File (*.tif), GeoTiff Digital Elevation Model (*.tif), Binary terrain matrix (*.bin), VRML world (*.wrl) and Terragen terrain (*.ter). Also according to the website, 3DEM can merge multiple DEMs to provide high-resolution overhead maps and 3D projections of large surface areas, limited only by the computer's memory. Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are shown on all overhead map displays. Both Lat-Lon and UTM coordinates are supported, allowing display and measurement of position to high accuracy. Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver waypoints, routes, and tracks can be read via serial interface and displayed on 3D images and flybys of the terrain, allowing visualization of the path of a trek through the wilderness. 3DEM uses the SGI\/Microsoft OpenGL libraries for high speed 3D rendering. 3DEM will render 24 bit color three dimensional projections or red-blue projections requiring red-blue 3D glasses for viewing. 3DEM scenes can be saved in various formats; including Windows Bitmap (*.bmp) and jpeg. 3DEM allows low resolution flyby of DEM landscapes using OpenGL. The path through space is recorded in memory during flight, allowing subsequent creation of a full resolution mpeg animation along the flight path. Real-time flyby animations can be created in the following formats Flyby animation AVI (*.avi) a and Flyby animation MPEG (*.mpg, *.mpeg). 3DEM provides an intuitive user interface, high reliability, and detailed terrain images and flyby animations created from freely available terrain data. 3DEM is a product of Visualization Software LLC by Richard Home. Maps, three-dimensional terrain images and animations, and GPS waypoints and routes produced by the 3DEM computer program are for general visualization purposes only.","Another example of mapping software is disclosed at Http:\/\/www.esri.com\/softwar-e\/arcgis\/explorer\/index.html. According to the website:\n\n","Another terrain software imaging program is the Google-Earth type local search and exploration task. In addition to larger-scale views to get context, one is often interested in areas of a square block or less in the immediate vicinity of one's destination. Such a search is conventionally done with traditional 2-D maps or, in a very select few areas, with pseudo-3-D maps generated by adding 3-D building models to the 2-D maps.","Aside from the above-described need to better images of small-scale features, such as foliage, fences, railings, and light poles, there are many other applications that require smaller size scales. One particularly important application is site surveillance. The objects of site surveillance are often people and the focus of attention is surveillance of a small area around a specific building for a potential intruder. Locations of individual trees and bushes, hedges, small ravines, banks, and other natural features become relevant in determining access routes and potential cover. After an alarm, they are also important in judging intent and determining the best response. Therefore, a visualization technique is required that portrays both small and large features and as well as natural and manmade features. Accordingly, there exists a need for a terrain map with increased accuracy in revealing three dimensional aspects of the object or terrain.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes 3-D ladar-generated maps. 3-D terrain maps are available from a number of sources, including for example, those generated by the Rapid Terrain Visualization (RTV) program, now known as the BuckEye, run by the Joint Precision Strike Demonstration Project Office, which provides rapid generation of digital terrain data in support of emerging crisis or contingency operations.","The RTV program maps are generated from an aircraft using both laser radar (LADAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar sensors. The LADAR is preferred as it has higher resolution and produces cleaner and more accurate maps. The LADAR sensor measures the terrain elevation by scanning the area with a laser beam and measuring the time it takes the light to travel from the aircraft sensor to the ground and back. For the LADAR sensor, the program advertises a resolution (post spacing) of 1 m, a vertical accuracy of 15-30 cm, and a horizontal accuracy of 30-50 cm. The maps comprise three pieces of information for each 1-mpixel: a backscatter intensity value approximately equivalent to a black and white photograph, the elevation of the first backscatter return from the laser (the highest thing hit), and the elevation of the last return (the lowest thing hit). For most pixels, these two elevations will be the same, but where bushes or trees are present, some of the laser energy will be reflected from the top of the trees as a first-hit return, but some laser energy will also penetrate down to ground to produce the last-hit return. The RTV program also provides a fourth, derived product that is a color image combining the intensity image with hues that are derived from the elevations.","The three-dimensional terrain visualizing method of a preferred embodiment of the present invention generates images of both \u201crough\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d areas in a terrain with increased detail. Terrain mapping data is processed as a series of pixels, with pixels in relatively \u201crough\u201d areas being depicted without modification, while pixels in relatively \u201csmooth\u201d areas are effectively \u201cjoined\u201d together to eliminate the small gaps in the surfaces. The preferred embodiment technique for identifying and joining relatively \u201csmooth\u201d areas as used herein is referred to herein as \u201ctexture-based segmentation.\u201d","A preferred embodiment algorithm, as described in detail below, identifies relatively \u201csmooth\u201d local areas and warps the squares for these areas so that the edges meet and the surface is continuous. Areas that are truly \u201crough,\u201d such as trees, are left as disjoint squares. Overall, the effects on the squares before and after the algorithm is applied is minimal, so that algorithm errors are not conspicuous.","In some preferred embodiments of present invention, the texture-based segmentation algorithm fuses the discrete rectangles to create a continuous surface where the map is relatively \u201csmooth.\u201d It works locally at each pixel within a 3-by-3 neighborhood of the pixel and determines whether the pixel is part of a relatively \u201csmooth\u201d surface by attempting to construct 4 lines through the pixel. If the two halves of a line have sufficiently similar slopes, that is, if the range difference from the center pixel and its neighbor on one side is close enough to the range difference to the neighbor on the other side, then that line is determined to be \u201cvalid.\u201d If 3 out of the 4 possible lines are \u201cvalid,\u201d then the center pixel is identified as locally \u201csmooth,\u201d and a corner vertex in the center pixel is joined with the adjacent vertices in the neighbor pixels that contributed to the pixel being identified as locally \u201csmooth.\u201d","Although the technique is described with respect to vertical imaging from the air, the technique is just as applicable in the horizontal plane (for ground-based ladars, primarily). The key distinction is that the information to be visualized come from a sensor like a ladar that makes discrete measurements of the scene. Synthesizing or modeling has been the most common approach to creating 3-D scenes. However, ladars (both airborne and vehicle-carried) can map huge areas cheaply and quickly; and it is predicted that it will have even more applications in the future. For example, by attaching a ladar to a vehicle, one can obtain a 3-D map of a city in virtually perfect detail. This would provide a viewpoint not just from the viewpoint collected, but anywhere within the perimeter of the area recorded. For example, if one were to be interested in a particular corner, the relevant 3-D image for the particular corner could be downloaded from a repository.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the embodiments of the invention include all such modifications.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same structures or elements. The representations in each of the figures are diagrammatic and no attempt is made to indicate actual scales or precise ratios. Proportional relationships are shown as approximates.","The embodiments of the invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments of the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments of the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skilled in the art to practice the embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments of the invention.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","It will be understood that when an element such as an object, layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","The following are definitions of some of the terms used in the detailed description. This list of terms is not exclusive\u2014additional terms may be defined in or may need to be understood in light of the specification. Although the words appear in capitals, the word(s) need not have capitals for the definition(s) to apply.","COMPUTATIONAL DEVICE or PROCESSOR as used herein includes one or more general purpose computers, CPUs, multiprocessors, microprocessors, processors, special purpose computers, quantum computers, special hardware devices, or other machines that perform computations and\/or process the data used by the preferred embodiment of the present invention. A set of individual computational devices that are linked together through a communications mechanism, such as a network connection, would be treated as a single computational device.","COMPUTER-READABLE MEDIUM as used herein means a storage medium such as a hard drive, floppy drive, CD-ROM, DVD, USB drive, flash memory, read only memory, or some other medium that a computer can readily process. Multiple media can be also be used.","COMPUTER-READABLE PROGRAM CODE as used herein means machine code, compilable source code, or interpretable scripting code.","DISPLAYING as used herein means the rendering of a terrain or other image. Displaying can be performed for the benefit of people through various devices such as computer monitors, stereoscopic displays, plotters, or printers. Displaying can also be performed for the benefit of other systems. Writing a series of coordinates to a file or to memory for used by another system that can use those coordinates to create an image is a method of displaying.","DRAWING as used in this application, is the act of computing where something should go. For example, drawing a line through two coordinates does not mean actually making a line visible, but simply identifying the beginning and ending coordinates.","ELEVATION as used herein is a value indicating how far a point is from a base topography. Meters above sea-level is an example of a unit of elevation based on the average sea level of the earth. Elevation does not have to be on a linear scale. For example, logarithmic elevation values can be used, such that incrementing an elevation in logarithmic scale might mean a doubling of the elevation in absolute terms. Elevation is relative to the base topography. A painting hung on a wall has an elevation when compared with the wall that is different from the elevation when compared with the floor. The base topography itself does not have to be flat. For example, elevation data could be obtained by taking the height above sea level at every point along the equator. This would produce a circular base topography with elevations relative to the sea level along the equator.","As used herein, NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, and combinations such as NORTHEAST and SOUTHWESTERN are directional words that relate to a reference point and\/or orientation. They do not mean absolute directional values. Thus, a test pixel may be oriented so that its northern neighbor pixel is actually south of the test pixel in the real world. Moreover, the directions are not necessary restricted to a particular plane and are equally applicable to a vertical plane. Similarly, the nomenclature of top, top left, top right, bottom, middle, left, bottom left, right, and bottom right, or the equivalent could be utilized with equal effect.","PIXEL as used herein, as it relates to digital imaging, is an elemental piece of information in an image. Pixels may be arranged in a 2-dimensional grid or 3 dimensional grid and may be represented using dots, squares, rectangles, or some other geometric object. An image is formed from a plurality of pixels and each pixel is an element of an image. The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel may have three or four components such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. In the visualization technique of some preferred embodiments of the present invention, a mapped surface is divided into equal-sized squares. Each rendered surface datum or element within a square may be treated as a pixel. Other embodiments of the invention may or may not necessarily use square or uniform pixels. A pixel in the sense used in this application differs from a pixel in the sense of the smallest unit of display on a computer monitor. Computer monitor pixels typically only display the colors red, green, and blue, where each color has a uniform intensity throughout the computer monitor pixel, to the extent that the technology supports such uniformity. A pixel, as used in this application, can contain multiple colors and intensities. For example, elevation data might be more course than image data for a terrain. The pixels used to visualize the elevations might therefore be larger than the colors and intensities representing the terrain image.","SENSOR as used herein means any device that can map terrain. Common terrain mapping devices include light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices, sometimes called laser radar (LADAR), and interferometric synthetic aperture radar sensors. Many other technologies can provide terrain mapping data. For example, sonar can map the terrain of the ocean floor. Stereo photographs can also be used to map terrain.","TERRAIN as used herein means any set of surfaces for which elevation from a base topography can be acquired. This might be a city, a forest, the ocean floor, a wall, an extraterrestrial planet surface, 3-D microscopic imagery or some other set of surfaces.","WARPING as used herein refers to the distortion of the perimeter of a pixel to the extent that it is joined with adjacent pixels. A pixel is \u201cwarped\u201d when one of the vertices of the surface is moved to a new position and the surface is modified so that the surface touches all of the unaltered vertices and the altered vertex. There are many ways of accomplishing this task that are known in the art. One simple way is to generate triangular surfaces such that the triangles connect with all of the required vertices and to each other. Other variations are possible. Many tools readily available to the ordinary practitioner can readily warp a 3-D surface.  shows the warping of the vertices ,  and  such that they make contact with each other.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , the ground  and building rooftops  are readily identifiable. With this particular technique, the sides of the buildings  also appear to be depicted because this rendering technique creates surfaces that connect data points, even when there is a significant gap between the data points. In this case, this depiction is misleading. Terrain data was collected from nearly overhead, so there was little actual data on what was on the sides of buildings.","Creating surfaces to connect data points obscures small-scale features, such as the trees surrounding the buildings in . Tree tops  are rendered, but the surfaces connecting them to the ground  make them look like hills or mountains. This severely undermines efforts to understand the nature of the depicted terrain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Substantially similar information identifiable in  is identifiable in . The ground  and roof tops  are both readily identifiable. The building sides  are also identifiable, but they are identifiable as an area where little information was available to the rendering engine. This approach avoids misleading the viewer into believing that more is known about the terrain than is actually known. The human mind quickly fills in the gaps and understands that there is some structure holding the roof tops , but that the details of the structure are unknown. This conservative approach to rendering data stands out when rendering features that are not connected to the surface below, such as bridges.","Tree tops  may be much easier to interpret using this visualization approach. The sides of the trees  are only depicted where data was actually sampled, and the rough data remains rough.

This algorithm, described in detail below, identifies locally relatively \u201csmooth\u201d areas and \u201cwarps\u201d the squares for these areas so that the edges meet and the surface is continuous. Areas that are truly \u201crough,\u201d such as trees, are left as disjoint squares. One important feature of this procedure is that there is only a small difference between the squares (or pixels) before and after the algorithm is applied, so algorithm errors are not conspicuous. Thus, the algorithm does not need to be extremely reliable and can be fast and simple. The algorithm may occasionally leave a gap in a relatively \u201csmooth\u201d area or occasionally joins several squares in a tree; but such \u201cerrors\u201d or gaps are almost imperceptible. The visual impression is to eliminate most of the small gaps in smooth surfaces making more striking the contrast between roads, grass and buildings that are smooth and disjoint under-sampled objects like trees. Thus, the algorithm does not need to be extremely reliable and can be fast and simple.","For the map colors, the hue is a function of the elevation, with the highest elevations mapping to red, then through yellow and green to blue, which is the lowest map elevation. The display intensity is mapped to the intensity image from the ladar, which is very useful in distinguishing features like roads that do not differ much in elevation from their surroundings but are much darker than the surrounding grass. The 3DEM-RTV viewer, illustrated in , derives intensity from a shading algorithm, which is particularly inappropriate for this scene since it mostly highlights the draping of the surface over the trees. Other viewers, such as ESRI ArcGIS Explorer, paint photographs as texture onto the elevation surface, an approach that produces better quality images than the 3DEM-RTV.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 6 and 7"],"b":["602","603","604"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","702","703","704"]},"Alternative methods of selecting pixel hues and intensities may be employed without deviating from the scope of the claimed invention.
