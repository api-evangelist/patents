title: Geometrical pattern based application passcode
abstract: To authorize an access to an application, a user interface renders a geometrical pattern on receiving a trigger to access the application. The rendered geometrical pattern includes an instance of an arrangement of one or more first nodes and one or more second nodes. The rendered geometrical pattern is associated with an input type to receive a selection of the first nodes and the second nodes. The selection of the first nodes and the second nodes is received as an authorizing key. The authorizing key is matched with an authorizing passcode stored in memory to provide access to the application.

This information may include personal or enterprise information like electronic mails, confidential enterprise data, etc. Unauthorized access to such information may be prevented by customizing a password or a passcode to access the applications. Conventional password schemes include presenting on a touch screen generic numeric keypad layouts to enter numeric characters or a static grid of nodes to enter a visual pattern as the password. Therefore, conventional password schemes are vulnerable to be hacked. Hence there is a need for a password scheme that is not vulnerable to be hacked.","Embodiments of techniques for systems and methods for geometrical pattern based application passcode generation are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","A multifunction electronic device (MED), herein referred to as a \u201cmobile device\u201d, may include a handheld computing device, an enterprise digital assistant (EDA), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a smartphone, an internet appliance, and the like. The mobile device includes a memory (for e.g. flash memory, memory card and the like) for storing data, and a touch screen to display and enable user interaction. The mobile device can access internet services such as World Wide Web (www) or electronic mails (E-mails), and exchange information with a general purpose computer by using known wired or wireless technologies (for e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Universal Serial Bus (USB), infrared and the like). The mobile device accesses information and data using internet services, which is provided for consumption through mobile applications.","Mobile applications, herein referred to as \u201capp\u201d or \u201capps\u201d are customized software applications developed to be deployed or installed on the mobile devices. Apps may be developed and distributed through application distribution platforms owned by mobile operating system providers or corporate enterprises to provide access to data on the go. The data accessible through apps may include personal data, business or corporate related data including contacts, e-mails, calendar, subscriptions to journal and magazine, publications, and the like. These apps can be configured to download data on the mobile device and stored in memory.","The data stored on the mobile device may include confidential and privileged information. Such confidential and privileged information may need to be provided with access restrictions to prevent unauthorized use. Access restrictions can be provided by configuring the app with an authorizing mechanism. The authorizing mechanism includes configuring the app with an authorizing passcode, and storing the authorizing passcode in the memory of the mobile device. On triggering the app, the authorizing mechanism provides a user interface (UI) that renders a geometrical pattern including an instance of arrangement of a plurality of nodes. The nodes may be associated with distinct values. In an embodiment, a type of the rendered geometrical pattern is associated with a unique input type to receive a selection of the nodes. The selection of nodes is received as an authorizing key and the access to the app is authorized by matching the authorizing key with the authorizing passcode stored in the memory. In an embodiment, this authorizing mechanism is used to lock and\/or un-lock an application, a service and a system (or a device).

A drag gesture of the drag-and-drop gesture includes additional attributes like a direction of movement, for example a clockwise direction, a counter clockwise direction, an angular direction, a linear direction, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, for each instance of the arrangement, each first node is associated with a distinct value, for example numeric, alphanumeric, an alphabet character or the like. Each second node may be configured to include a distinct value or a function, and is based on the rendered geometrical pattern. For instance, the second nodes may be configured to include a null value, or configured as a drop zone, or configured to include distinct patterns, colors, semantically distinct characters, or a combination thereof.","In an embodiment, based on the corresponding input type, the user selection of first nodes and the second nodes is received as an authorizing key. The authorizing key is received and stored in a data structure. The authorizing key is compared with the authorizing passcode to find a correlation between each other. If the authorizing key matches the authorizing passcode, the access to the app  is authorized, and the user is allowed to access the app . If the authorizing key fails to match the authorizing passcode, the UI  renders the geometrical pattern  with another instance of the arrangement of the first nodes and the second nodes.","In an embodiment, upon a mismatch between the authorizing key and the authorizing passcode, the authorizing mechanism repeats rendering the geometrical pattern  with distinct instances of the arrangement of the first nodes and the second nodes for a determined number of times, for example three. Upon exceeding the determined number of times of rendering the geometrical pattern  for a mismatch, the authorizing mechanism may prevent access to the app  by locking the app . In another embodiment, upon exceeding the determined number of times of rendering the geometrical pattern  for the mismatch, the authorizing mechanism deletes the data associated with the app  from the memory of the mobile device .
