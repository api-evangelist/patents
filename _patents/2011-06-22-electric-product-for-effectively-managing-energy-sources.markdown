The specific component  may further receive additional information (environment information, time information and the like) by means of the communication unit. In this instance, the information may be received from another component. That is, at least energy information is contained in the received information.","The specific component  may be a component that constitutes the UAN  or a component that constitutes the HAN .","As described above, the energy information  may be one of information related to electricity, water, gas and the like. Hereinafter, information related to electricity will be described as an example of the energy information, but information related to other energy sources may be identically applied.","For example, the kind of information related to the electricity may include time-based pricing, curtailment, grid emergency, grid reliability, energy increment, operation priority, and the like.","The information may be divided into scheduled information previously produced based on previous information, and real-time information changed in real time. The scheduled information and the real-time information may be divided by whether or not predict information after the current time (in the future).","The energy information  may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the energy information  may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","The energy information  may be divided into time of use (TOU) information, critical peak pattern (CPP) information or real time pattern (RTP) information according to the change in the pattern of data with respect to time.","According to the TOU information, a data is changed step by step depending on time. According to the CPP information, a data is changed step by step or in real time depending on time, and emphasis is displayed at a specific point of time. According to RTP information, a data is changed in real time depending on time.","In a case where the energy information is time-based pricing information as an example, the time-based pricing information is changed. The time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","In a case where the specific component  receives a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal, one signal may be recognized as an on-peak signal, and the other signal may be recognized as an off-peak signal.","Alternatively, the specific component  may recognize information on at least one drive, which contains the time-based information, and may recognize an on-peak or off-peak signal by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","For example, in a case where the specific component  recognizes information divided into levels or real pricing information, it recognizes an on-peak or off-peak signals by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","In this case, the value of the information on drive may be at least one of time-based pricing, electric energy, the variation of time-based pricing, the variation of electric energy, the average of time-based pricing and the average of electric energy. The value of reference information may be at least one of an average, the average between maximum and minimum values of power information during a predetermined period of time and the reference variation of power information during the predetermined period of time (e.g., the slope of consumed electric energy per unit time).","The value of reference information may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The value of reference information may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","In a case where the specific component  (e.g., the energy consumption component) recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased. The driving scheme of the specific component may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal posterior to the start of operation.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output is maintained under an operable condition. In this case, the operable condition means that the value of the information on drive is less than a predetermined reference. The value of the information on drive may be time-based pricing, consumed electric energy, operation time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The predetermined reference may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The predetermined reference may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained or increased when the difference between a state information value and a reference value is within a predetermined range. For example, in a case where a compressor of a refrigerator is not operated in a low-cost section, the temperature of a cool chamber or freezing chamber is increased. Therefore, the compressor is necessarily turned on when the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber approaches a reference temperature. In a case where a high-cost section comes after the compressor is turned on, the compressor maintains a current output when the difference between the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber and the reference temperature is within a predetermined range. In a case where a user selects a button for cancelling power saving in the state that the specific component  recognizes the high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. However, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total output amount of the specific component during the entire drive period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level. Alternatively, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total consumed power or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire operation period may be decreased as compared that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output (change in the state of cool air that is a medium for performing the function of the refrigerator). In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated (storage of hot water that is an additional medium for performing the function of the washing machine or washer). Alternatively, in a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, cool air may be stored in a separate supercooling chamber by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","The curtailment information is information related to a mode in which the specific component is stopped or a small amount of time-based pricing is taken. As an example, the curtailment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","If the specific component  recognizes curtailment information, the output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased as described above.","The grid emergency information is information related to a power failure or the like. As an example, the grid emergency information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system. The information related to a power failure or the like has a relation with the reliability of a component using energy.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes grid emergency information, it may be immediately shut down.","The grid reliability information is information related to the supply amount of electricity supplied or information related to the quality of electricity. The grid reliability information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be determined by a component (e.g., an electric home appliance) through the frequency of AC power supplied to the component.","That is, if a frequency lower than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is small (information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied). If a frequency higher than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is large (information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied).","In a case where the specific component recognizes shortage of the amount of electricity or poor quality of electricity in the grid reliability information, an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component recognizes the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied, the output may be increased, or the operation may be converted from an off-state to an on-state.","The energy increment information is information related to a state that surplus electricity is generated because the amount of electricity used by a component is less than that of power generation. As an example, the energy increment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes energy increment information, the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component  is the energy storage component  or , the energy storage component  or  may store electricity by receiving the electricity supplied from the UAN, for example, when electricity storage cost is smaller than a predetermined value.","However, in a case where the energy storage component  is connected to the energy generation component  that constitutes the HAN, it may continuously store energy generated by the energy generation component  until the electricity storage is completed. That is, the energy generated while the energy generation component  generates energy may be stored in the energy storage component .","The presence of completion of the electricity storage is determined while the energy storage component  or  stores electricity. In a case where the electricity storage is completed, the electricity supply for the electricity storage is cut off. Specifically, the presence of completion of the electricity storage may be determined using a sensor that senses the voltage, temperature or current of the energy storage component  or . The cutoff of the electricity supply may be performed using a switch (or circuit breaker) provided to a supply stage through which the electricity is supplied to the energy storage unit  or .","The electricity storage cost may be cost consumed in the electricity storage for a specific time period or electricity cost at a specific time.","As an example, in a case where the electricity storage cost is in an off-peak section (in a case where the specific component recognizes low-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity. Alternatively, in a case where an on-peak section corresponds to an allowance section (in a case where the specific component recognizes high-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store in the on-peak section. In this instance, the allowance section is a section in which a power consumption information value is less than a predetermined reference. The power consumption information value may be a electricity cost, a power consumption amount, a time range, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a predetermined cost, a predetermined power consumption amount, a predetermined time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative value or absolute value, and may be changed automatically or manually.","The energy storage component  or  may store a counter electromotive force generated when an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component is stopped (rotated).","Alternatively, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity using an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component. For example, in a case where the energy consumption component is a refrigerator, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a fan motor provided to the refrigerator is rotated (the fan motor may serve as a power generator or may be connected to the power generator). Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component is a washing machine, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor that rotates a drum for accommodating the laundry is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is a cooking appliance, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a cooling fan is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is an air cleaner, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a fan is rotated. That is, in this embodiment, in a case where a motor is provided regardless of the kind of the energy consumption component, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when the motor is rotated. Alternatively, in a case where a power generator is connected to a fan rotated by the flow of air (natural flow or forcible flow), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated by the power generator.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to one or more energy consumption components . In a case where electricity cost is higher than a reference value, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . As an example, in a case where the electricity cost is an on-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the high-cost information), the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . In a case where the electricity cost is an off-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the low-cost information) but is close to the on-peak, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. If the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  is less than a predetermined value, electricity generated in the energy generation component  is supplied to the energy consumption component. Thus, it is possible to prevent the operation of the energy consumption component from being stopped due to the cutoff of the electricity supply while the energy consumption component is operated.","In a case where the supply of electricity generated in the energy generation component  is cut off by interruption of electric power, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. In a case where the energy consumption component is an electric product, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to a communication unit or control unit provided to the electric product.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to a portion of a plurality of energy consumption components. As an example, the stored electricity may be supplied to an electric product such as a refrigerator required in continuous operation among a plurality of electric products. Alternatively, the stored electricity may be supplied to an energy consumption component with relatively low power among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute one electric product. It will be apparent that the stored electricity is supplied to an energy consumption component with high power. Alternatively, when a course using a relatively small amount of power is performed among a plurality of courses in which an electric product is performed, the stored electricity may be supplied. It will be apparent that the stored electricity may be supplied even when a course using a large amount of power is performed.","Meanwhile, in a case where electricity is generated and stored by a fan or motor as described above, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an energy consumption unit with relatively low power. As an example, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an LED lamp, a display, a control unit, a communication unit, a low-power heater, or the like. Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component performs a plurality of courses, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component in a course that requires low power.","The energy storage component  may be built in connected to one energy consumption component. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to a plurality of energy consumption components, respectively. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to one energy consumption component. The plurality of energy storage components  may be connected to one another to share the stored electricity.","Among the information related to energy, the on-peak information, the curtailment information and information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as high-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively expensive. In this instance, the section in which the high-cost information is recognized by the specific component may referred to as a low-cost section.","On the other hand, among the information related to energy, the off-peak information, the energy increment information and the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as low-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively cheap. In this instance, the section in which the low-cost information is recognized by the specific component may be referred to as a low-cost section.","The information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information) may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component). That is, the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component into at least two or more.","A high period means a high price time period (period of high cost) or a high pricing period and a low period means a low price time period (period of low cost) and a low pricing period.","As an example, in a case where the information related to energy is recognized as a Boolean signal, the time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component may be divided into two. In a case where the information related to energy is divided into a plurality of levels or recognized as real-time information, the time period or pricing period may be divided into three or more.","Meanwhile, the information related to energy cost corresponding to at least time may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component. That is, the information related to energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) or pricing zone (time period) into at least two or more. As described above, the divided time period or pricing period may be determined based on the kinds of the recognized information (the Boolean signal, the plurality of levels and the real-time information).","In other words, the information related to fluctuation of energy cost may be recognized by dividing a determination factor for driving the specific component into two or more, and functions on time and energy cost may be included in the determination factor.","In a case where the information related to energy cost is divided into two levels or more, the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined according to the information divided into levels.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized information related to energy cost is not divided based on a specific reference (e.g., real-time cost information), it is compared with predetermined information, and the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined based on the compared result.","Here, the predetermined information may be reference information (e.g. reference value) for dividing the information related to energy cost, and the compared result may be whether not the information related to energy cost is more or less than the reference value.","Specifically, each of the kinds of information related to energy may be divided into first information  that is raw information, second information  that is refined information, and third information  that is information for performing the function of the specific component. That is, the first information is a raw data, the second information is a refined data, and the third information is a command for performing the function of the specific component.","The information related to energy is included a signal, and the signal is transmitted. In this instance, one or more of the first to third information may be transmitted several times while the content of the information is not converted but only the signal including the information is converted.","For example, as shown in , a component that receives a signal including the first information may convert only the signal and transmit a new signal including the first information to another component.","Therefore, it is described in this embodiment that the conversion of signal is a different concept from the conversion of information. In this instance, it can be readily understood that when the first information is converted into the second information, the signal including the first information is also converted into the signal including the second information.","However, the third information may be transmitted several times in the state that the content of the third information is converted or in the state that only the signal including the third information is converted while the content of the third information is identically maintained.","Specifically, in a case where the first information is raw information on time-based pricing, the second information may be refined information on the time-based pricing. The refined information on the time-based pricing is information in which the time-based pricing is divided into a plurality of levels or analysis information. The third information is a command generated based on the second information.","The specific component may generate, transmit or receive one or more of the first to third information. The first to third information are not necessarily transmitted or received in sequence. Only a plurality of pieces of third information without the first and second information may be transmitted in sequence or parallel. Alternatively, the first and third information may be transmitted or received together, the second and third information may be transmitted or received together, or the first and second information may be transmitted or received together.","As an example, in a case where the specific component receives the first information, it may transmit the second information or may transmit the second and third information.","In a case where the specific information receives only the third information, it may generate and transmit new third information.","Meanwhile, in the relation between two pieces of information, one is a message and the other is a response for the message. Thus, each of the components that constitute the network system may transmit or receive a message. In a case where each of the components receives a message, it may respond to the message. Therefore, in the case of an individual component, the transmission of a message is a relative concept with the response for the message.","The message may include a data (first or second information) and\/or a command (third information).","The command (third information) may include a command for storing the data, a command for generating the data, a command for processing the data (including the generation of an additional data), a command for generating an additional command, a command for transmitting the additionally generated command, a command for transmitting a received command, and the like.","In this specification, the response for the received message means storage of the data, processing of the data (including generation of an additional data), generation of a new command, transmission of the newly generated command, simple transmission of a received command (including generation of a command for transmitting the received command to another component), operation, transmission of the stored information, transmission of an acknowledge message (acknowledge character or negative acknowledge character), or the like.","For example, in a case where the message is first information, the specific component that receives the first information may generate second information by processing the first information, or may generate the second information and new third information, as a response for the message.","The specific component that receives the message may provide a response related to energy. Here, the term \u201cresponse\u201d may be understood as a concept including an operation through which the specific component can perform a function. As an example, the HAN  may perform an operation related to energy by receiving a message.","The response (operation) related to energy, provided by the specific component, will be described in detail. For example, the specific component may be an energy consumption component.","The energy consumption component may be driven so that the energy cost when it is driven based on the recognition for energy information is reduced as compared with that when it is driven without the recognition for energy information.","The specific component may include a plurality of modes in which it is driven to perform its own function. The plurality of modes are a first mode and a second mode in which energy cost is relatively saved as compared with that in the first mode. The specific component may be driven in at least one of the first and second modes.","Here, the first mode may be a general mode and the second mode may be a power saving mode. Alternatively, the first and second modes may all be power saving modes.","The general mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed without recognition of energy information. On the other hand, the power saving mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed based on the recognition of energy information so as to save energy cost.","In a case where the first and second modes are power saving modes, the first mode may be specified as a driving scheme for saving energy cost and the second mode may be specified as a driving scheme in which the energy cost in the second mode is more saved than that in the first mode.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component) is driven, at least a portion is recognized in a driving scheme including at least drive time and course. In this case, an unrecognized portion may be generated so as to save energy cost, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme.","For example, at least a portion of the driving scheme may be recognized under the control of the energy management component, the control of the energy consumption component, or the like. In a case where a specific driving scheme is further required so as to save energy cost, an unrecognized portion of the driving scheme may be newly generated, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme so as to save energy.","It will be apparent that the process of generating the unrecognized portion may be omitted. In this case, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme. On the other hand, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme may be omitted. In this case, the process of newly generating the unrecognized portion may be performed.","The drive time may include a drive start time or drive end time. The course may include a drive period of the specific component and the power of the specific component.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be a scheme recommended by the specific component so as to save energy cost. Here, the specific component may be an energy consumption component (control component) or the energy management component.","As an example, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific drive time, the specific drive time may be converted into another time so as to save energy cost, and a specific course may be generated.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific course, the specific course may be converted into another course so as to save energy cost, and a specific time may be generated.","Under the control described above, a change in time or power may be made with respect to the output function of the specific component based on time.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be performed within a set range. That is, in the process of recognizing at least a portion of the driving scheme, the generation or conversion of the driving scheme may be performed within a predetermined reference in which the recognized portion appears (e.g., restriction set by a user, constraint set under the control of the energy management component or energy consumption component, or the like).","Therefore, in a case where the set range is out of the predetermined reference, it is restricted to generate the unrecognized portion or to convert the recognized portion into another scheme.","Another embodiment is proposed.","Cost information may further included in the recognized driving scheme. That is, in a case where the cost information is recognized, a portion related to the drive time or course may be generated. The generated driving scheme may be recommended.","Meanwhile, a response of the specific component based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), e.g., a power control for power saving driving, may be performed. An output decrease (including an output of zero) or output increase may be included in the output control.","It is as described above that the output is decreased or zero, maintained or increased based on the recognition for the information (on-peak or off-peak) related to energy cost.","If high-cost information is recognized, the output may be zero or decreased. Specifically, the output in the recognition of the high-cost information may be decreased as compared with that in the recognition of low-cost information. As described above, the decrease of the output may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the high-cost information is recognized posterior to the start of the operation of the specific component.","In a case where the output of the specific component is zero or decreased, the function to be performed by the specific component may be lost as compared with a normal case. Therefore, a response for restoring the lost function may be performed.","As an example, after the output of the specific component is decreased, the specific component may be controlled so that the total operation time of the specific component is increased or so that the output is increased in at least a time period.","In other words, if specific reference information related to energy information is recognized in a period after the output of the specific component is controlled, the response for controlling the output may be released. Here, the term \u201cperiod\u201d may be divided based on a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized.","The total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a specific target in the process of performing the function of the specific component. As an example, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (washing machine, drying machine, cooking appliance or the like) intermittently driven (or driven in a specific course), the total operation time may be understood as a time until a corresponding course is completed.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (refrigerator, water purifier, or the like) driven at normal times, the total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a target set for performing the function of the specific component. For example, the set target may be a target temperature, a target amount of ice produced, or a target amount of clean water in the refrigerator.","The total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time set before the output of the specific component is decreased. In a case where the output of the specific component is not decreased, the total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time of the specific component. However, although the total operation time of the specific component is increased, the specific component is controlled so that the total energy cost generated through the drive of the specific component can be saved as compared with that when the output of the specific component is not decreased.","If the high-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased.","However, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total output of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated under a normal output. Alternatively, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total power consumption or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased as compared with that when the specific component is operated under the normal output.","If the low-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the driving of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output in a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case of a specific condition (additional condition) is generated based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), the response of the specific component, e.g., the output control for power saving driving, may be limited. That is, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Here, the term \u201climitation\u201d may be understood as the release of the output control performed or not performed.","The specific condition includes a case where influence on energy cost is minute even though the output control of the specific component is not performed or a case where it is necessary to prevent a function to be performed by the specific component from being degraded when the output of the specific component is controlled.","Whether or not the influence on the energy cost is minute may be determined based on a predetermined reference (time-based pricing, power consumption or information on operation time). The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The case where the function to be performed by the specific component is degraded may be considered as a case where the specific component is a defrosting heater, for example.","In a case where it is controlled to decrease the output in a high-cost time period and to increase the output in the low-cost time period, the driving of the defrosting heater is more frequently performed than that during a normal time (setup period). In this case, the temperature of a storage room in the refrigerator is increased, and thus, the control of the output can be limited.","Meanwhile, the specific component  may include a display unit  for displaying information. In this embodiment, the term \u201cinformation display\u201d means that visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile information is known to the outside. The display unit  may include a touch screen for selecting or inputting information. Alternatively, the specific component  may include a separate input unit for inputting information by cable or radio.","All the information (energy information or additional information except the energy information) described above may be displayed in the display unit .

That is, two or more pieces of information may be simultaneously displayed in the display unit . As an example, in a case where two or more pieces of information are simultaneously displayed, any one of the information is selected. Then, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may reduced. As another example, if any one of the two or more pieces of information is selected, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may disappear. In a case where specific information is selected and the selected screen is enlarged, information more specific that the previous information or information different from the previous information may be displayed on the enlarged screen. For example, in a case where the selected information is a character, graphic information may be displayed on the enlarged screen, or two or more pieces of information may be sequentially displayed on the enlarged screen. In a case where two or more pieces of information are displayed in the display unit , two or more relative positions may be varied.","Information except energy cost information and energy cost may be displayed in the display unit .

The information displayed in the display unit  may include one or more of information on graph for each time or period, level, table. One or more of the shape, color, brightness, size, position, alarm period, alarm time of the information displayed in the display unit  may be varied.","A currently operable function (or menu) may be displayed in the display unit . Alternatively, among a plurality of functions, operable and inoperable function may be divided by size, color, position and the like, and then displayed in the display unit . Alternatively, in a case where separate input units are provided, only an input units for selecting an operable function may be activated, or an input unit for selecting an operable function and an input unit for selecting an inoperable function may be displayed in different colors.","The target or display method of information displayed in the display unit  may be set and changed by a user, or may be changed automatically.","In a case where a condition for informing the user of information is satisfied, specific information may be displayed in the display unit . It will be apparent that a portion of a plurality pieces of information may be continuously displayed in the state that a component is turned on. The display time of the information may be changed or set automatically or manually.","If specific information (one or more pieces of information) is selected using the input unit, the selected information may be displayed. If a user contacts a portion of a component, e.g., an input unit, a handle, a display or the like, regardless of information display selection, or operates one or more buttons or knobs that constitute the input unit, a portion of the information may be displayed. In this instance, the information to be displayed may be set or changed. It will be apparent that a sensing unit for sensing a user's contact may be provided to the component. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed by installation environment or variation of outdoor environment. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the specific component receives new information.

On the other hand, in a case where the display unit  is not communicated with the component  or information is not included in the communication signal due to the weak intensity of the signal, the display unit may be in an unavailable state. One of the display unit  and the component  transmits a communication signal, and the other of the display unit  and the component  transmits a response signal. The presence of use of the display unit  may be determined by the presence of reception of the communication and response signals and the signal intensity. That is, in a case where any one of the display unit  and the component  does not receive a signal or the intensity of received signal is less than a reference intensity, it may be determined that the display unit  is unavailable. Any one of the display unit  and the component  may increase the intensity of a transmission signal until it receives a response signal of which intensity is more than the reference intensity.","Information for informing the user of the presence of use of the display unit  may be displayed in the display unit  or the component .

Therefore, in a case where the difference between the values of vibrations respectively sensed by the sensors is less than a predetermined value, it may be recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component . If it is recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component , the operation of the component  may be controlled so that vibration or noise generated in the operation of the component  is decreased.

The optimal driving time information or time except information is determined so that electricity usage cost or power consumption is decreased.

The change of the driving time section refers to a change of at least one of the driving start time and the driving end time. If the driving time section is changed, the component may not be operated in at least a portion of the high-cost section.

In the power saving mode, energy information related to the information through the input unit or additional information and energy information not inputted through the input unit or additional information may be displayed.","The general or power saving mode may be manually set or changed by the user through the input unit, or the component  may automatically set or change the general or power saving mode based on the energy information.

That is, the component  may be operated in any one of the plurality of power saving modes so as to reduce energy consumption or energy usage cost according to the kind of at least the energy information.","The plurality of power saving modes may include a manual mode in which information for driving the component  is manually selected, and an automatic mode in which the information for driving the component  is automatically selected.","The component may be operated in a time reduction mode in addition to the general mode and the power saving mode. In the time reduction mode, the operation time of the component is shorter than that of the component in the general mode. In this instance, the energy usage cost (or energy consumption) in the time reduction mode may be equal to or greater than the energy usage cost (or energy consumption) in the general mode. The energy usage cost (or energy consumption) in the time reduction mode may be changed by varying the operation method of the component. The operation time of the component in the power saving mode is equal to or longer than that of the component in the general mode. In this instance, performances (e.g., washing performances, cooking performances or the like) of the component in the general mode, the time reduction mode and the power saving mode may be identical or similar to one another.","As still another example, the plurality of power saving modes may include a mode leveled corresponding to the degree of reduction of electricity cost or power consumption. For example, the power consumption or electricity usage cost when the component is operated in a first power saving mode may be smaller than that when the component is operated in a second power saving mode. Alternatively, the plurality of power saving mode may include at least two modes that share a common control unit or method for the purpose of the power-saving driving of the component . The plurality of power saving modes may be mutually changed manually or automatically. Alternatively, the plurality of power saving modes may control the component using different methods from one another. That is, the control methods of the component are different from one another in the plurality of power saving modes.","As still another example, at least time information related to the driving of the component  is inputted through the input unit , the driving method of the component for reducing a value related to energy may be determined based on the information related to energy and the inputted time information. Then, the determined driving method may be displayed in the display unit , or the component  may be operated using the determined driving method. The value related to energy is a power consumption or electricity usage cost when the component is driven. The time information related to the driving of the component  may be at least one of driving start time, driving end time and driving time range. The determined driving method may include a method in which the component is driven within a time range including the recognized time. Alternatively, the determined driving method may include a method in which the component is driven at a time changed from the inputted time.","As still another example, if the driving method of the component  is inputted through the input unit , the driving method of the component for reducing a value related to energy may be determined based on the information related to energy and the inputted time information.

The value related to energy is a power consumption or electricity usage cost when the component is driven. The determined driving method may include a driving method changed from the inputted driving method or a method in which the component is driven using the inputted driving method of an electric product at a specific time. The specific time may be a time zone different from a desired driving time zone of the component or a time zone after the current time.","As still another example, if reference electricity usage cost or reference power consumption is inputted through the input unit , the driving method of the component may be determined using cost or electric energy lower than the inputted reference cost or electric energy. The determined driving method may be displayed in the display unit  of the component, or the component  may be driven using the determined driving method. The determined driving method may include a method in which the component is operated at a time posterior to the current time and a method in which the component is operated in a specific mode at the current time.","As still another example, the component  may be operated based on information on a priority order in energy information or additional information recognized by the component . The priority order may be set or changed manually or automatically. The presence of consideration of the next priority order may be determined according to the information state of the best order.","For example, in a case where energy cost information as the energy information is a priority order and environment information as the additional information is a posterity order, the component may be operated based on the energy cost information. Alternatively, in a case where the energy information is a priority order and the additional information is a posteriority order, the energy information includes information related to the reduction of energy consumption or energy cost. Then, the component may be operated based on only the energy information. Alternatively, in a case where the additional information is a priority order and the energy information is a posteriority order, the power or operation time of the component is necessarily increased as a determined result of the additional information. Then, the component may be operated in consideration of the energy information.","Alternatively, the component may include a memory unit in which the operation method of the component is determined by reflecting information on a plural kinds of components. If the component recognizes the information on the plural kinds of components, one of operation methods stored in the memory unit is selected.","As still another example, the component  may further include a memory unit in which the operation method obtained by reflecting the energy information and additional information is stored. Therefore, if the information on the plural kinds of components is recognized, one of the operation methods stored in the memory unit may be selected, and the component  may be operated using the selected operation method.","As still another example, if high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , the operation information of the component  is stored in the memory unit, and the component  may be turned off or stopped. Then, if low-cost information is recognized, the component  may be re-operated based on the operation information stored in the memory unit.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , the operation of the component may be changed based on information related to the previous operation of the component. In this instance, the information related to the previous operation of the component may be information related to power consumption of the component, energy usage cost information, average of target values (target temperature, air flow, humidity, dehumidification or the like) set for a specific time, and resource received by the component when the component is operated for a specific time. The power consumption or energy usage cost information may be average power consumption or average energy usage cost when the component is operated once. The resource may be water or ice. The information related to the resource may be information related to average discharge amount of the resource (water or ice discharge amount in a water cleaner or refrigerator) for a specific time.","For example, if the high-cost information is recognized, the operation of the energy consumption component may be changed so that the energy consumption or energy cost of the component is equal to or lower than the previous value of the information related to the operation of the component.","As still another example, the previous operation information of the component may be stored in the memory unit of the component. A specific order in the previous driving method may be displayed in the display unit of the component. For example, the energy consumption or energy usage cost when a specific course of a washing machine is operated under a first condition and a second condition (which is different from the first condition, and has a greater energy consumption or energy usage cost than that when the specific course is operated under the first condition) may be stored in the memory unit. The order of the first and second conditions may be determined and displayed in the display unit. The order may be determined by an order for each energy usage cost or number of times in use. The operation condition of a priority or posteriority order may be stored in the memory unit, and the driving method of the stored order may be selected by the user.","As still another example, in a case where the energy consumption or energy usage cost of the component according to the operation condition of the component, inputted by the user, exceeds a limitation reference, the component may be forcibly controlled so that the energy consumption or energy usage cost is less than the limitation reference, or a driving method for allowing the energy consumption or energy usage cost to be less than the limitation reference may be displayed in the display unit of the component. In a case where the component is forcibly controlled, information for informing the user of the fact may be displayed in the display unit of the component.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized while the component  is operated using the selected driving method, the driving method may be changed or maintained according to the driving method of the component. For example, if the estimated power consumption (or estimated energy usage cost) when the component is operated using the selected driving method is greater than that when the component is operated using a standard driving method, the selected driving method may be changed into the standard driving method. If the estimated power consumption (or estimated energy usage cost) when the component is operated using the selected driving method is equal to or smaller than that when the component is operated using the standard driving method, the selected driving method may be maintained. The standard driving method may be set when the component is manufactured, or may be manually set or changed by the user. Alternatively, the standard driving method may include a plurality of methods, and a specific method may be selected according to the kind of low-cost information.","As still another example, if the high-cost or low-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , the power consumption (or power) of the component  may be changed in a portion or entire of the section in which the high-cost or low-cost information is recognized. In this instance, the power consumption (or power) of the component  in the recognition of the low-cost information is smaller than that of the component  in the recognition of the high-cost information. For example, the power consumption (or power) of the component  may be decreased or increased in the portion or entire of the section. Alternatively, the power consumption (or power) of the component  may be gradually decreased or repeatedly decreased and decreased in the portion or entire of the section.","As still another example, an energy reduction degree (degree of reducing power consumption or electricity cost) may be differently selected according to the kind or state of energy information or additional information. For example, the energy reduction degree may be differently selected based on the length of a time section greater than the level or value of the energy information or additional information. The reduction degree of electricity cost or power consumption when the value of the energy information or additional information is greater than the reference information value is greater than that of electricity cost or power consumption when the value of the energy information or additional information is smaller than the reference information value. The reference information value may be set as a plurality of reference information values. At least one of the plurality of reference information values may be a value for determining an on-peat time section. Specifically, the length of the on-peak time section may be divided into top, middle and bottom, for example. The reduction degree when the length of the on-peak time section is top is greater than that when the length of the on-peak time section is middle or bottom. Alternatively, in a case where the electricity cost is divided into a plurality of levels, the reduction degree when the electricity cost is expensive is greater than that when the electricity cost is cheap.","As still another example, in a case where the component includes a plurality of energy consumption components, the energy consumption components to be controlled may be differently selected according to the kind or state of the energy information or additional information. For example, the energy consumption components to be controlled may be differently selected according to the energy cost value or energy cost level. The reference information may include a first reference information and a second reference information greater than the first reference information. Alternatively, the reference information value may include a single value. For example, if the value of the energy information or additional information is greater than the second reference information value, the power of a first energy consumption component (function performing component that consumes energy) may be controlled (operation limitation). If the value of the energy information or additional information is between the first and second reference information values, the power of a second energy consumption component (function performing component that consumes energy) may be controlled (operation limitation). If the value of the energy information or additional value is smaller than the first reference information value, electricity may be stored in an energy storage component (the operation of a function performing component that stores energy may be started).","That is, any one of a plurality of control objects or methods may be selected according to the kind or state of the energy information or additional information.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , the sum of powers of a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute the component  and perform the same function may be decreased. The plurality of energy consumption components may be the same kind or different kinds from one another. In a case where the high-cost information is recognized, only some energy consumption components may be turned off, or the power of the some energy consumption components may be decreased. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized, the power of each of the power consumption components may be decreased while the plurality of power consumption components maintain an on-state. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost is recognized, the power of the plurality of energy consumption components may be decreased with the same power amount or power reduction rate. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized, the power of the plurality of energy consumption components may be decreased with a different power amount or power reduction rate. Alternatively, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized, the plurality of energy consumption components may be alternately turned on and turned off.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute the component , the function performance of one or more energy consumption components may be limited, and the function of another one or more energy consumption components may be performed. The power consumption of the energy consumption components of which function is limited is greater than that of the energy consumption components of which function is performed. For example, in a case where the high-cost information is recognized while a component with relatively high power is operated, energy consumption components with high power may be turned off, and energy consumption components with low power may be turned on.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , the operation of energy consumption components that satisfy a limitation condition may be limited among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute the component. In this instance, the limitation condition may be power consumption, energy used cost or limitation order. That is, among the plurality of energy consumption components, the operation of energy consumption components of which power consumption or energy use cost exceeds a reference value may be limited. Alternatively, the limitation condition may be power consumption that is relatively large among the plurality of energy consumption components.","As still another example, in a case where the operation mode of the component  includes a plurality of processes, at least one of the plurality of processes may be limited in the section in which the high-cost information is recognized. The limitation means that the process is stopped or the power consumption in the performance of the process is decreased. For example, in a case where the component is a washing machine, the operation mode may be a standard course, quilt course, wool course or the like. The plurality of processes may include at least one of soaking, washing, rinsing, dehydrating and drying processes. The limited process may be automatically set, or may be manually set or changed.","As still another example, if the high-cost information is recognized in the operation of the component , two or more of a plurality of factors related to the operation of one or more energy components (function performing components) that constitute the component may be changed. The factor may include operation speed, operation time, power, operation rate and the like. If the value related to any one of two or more factors is decreased, the value of another factor may be increased.","As an example, when an energy consumption component is a motor, the rotation speed of the motor may decrease, and a rotation time may increase. When the energy consumption component is a heater, the output of the heater may decrease, and an operation time may increase. That is, when high-cost information is recognized, two or more factors associated with the operations of one or more energy consumption components may vary.","Alternatively, when the energy consumption component is a motor, the operation pattern of the motor may vary. Specifically, when the energy consumption component is a motor that rotates a drum included in a washing machine or a washer, the motor may rotate in one direction or another direction. In the case of a washing machine or a washer, the motor is controlled for laundry to be lifted and then dropped. A drum driving motion may be changed according to the rotation speed of the motor and a rotation angle in a specific direction. The drum driving motion may be divided into a general driving motion and one or more special motions (which have a rotation speed faster than the general motion or a large rotation angle in one-time rotation). Furthermore, the power consumption amount of the motor that is driven in the special motion is greater than the power consumption amount of the motor that is driven in the general motion. In this example, when high-cost information is reduced while the motor is being driven in the special motion, the washing machine or the washer may perform the general motion. When the high-cost information is recognized while the general motion is being performed, the washing machine or the washer performs a specific motion to be originally performed at a time when low-cost information is recognized.","As another example, the component  may operate for satisfying a reserved time, and when the low-cost information is recognized before the reserved time is satisfied, the component  may start an operation at any one time of a section in which the low-cost information is recognized. In this case, since the component  starts an operation prior to the reserved time, it may perform a service function for preventing a function from being declined after the operation of the component  is completed. The reserved time may be one of driving start time, driving end time and driving time sections. As an example, when the component  is a washing machine or a washer, the operation of the washing machine or washer is completed, and thereafter the component  may rotate the motor, which rotates a drum accommodating laundry, at certain intervals for preventing the wrinkle of the laundry. As another example, the component  is a cooking appliance, the operation of the cooking appliance is completed, and thereafter a heater may operate at certain intervals or continuously operate at minimum output for preventing a cooked item from cooling.","As another example, the operation may be controlled based on the specific order of a plurality of components which may be operated with respect to energy. The specific order may be any one of the order of components which must be firstly operated, the order of operation start, and the order of energy consumption amount or energy usage cost. For example, the bigger the current energy consumption amount, the current energy usage cost, the energy consumption amount for a predetermined time, and the energy usage cost for a predetermined time are, it may be set at the latter order. Alternatively, the operation order may be manually selected by a user, and a plurality of the same or other species components may be set at the same order.","In a case where high-cost information is recognized during the operation of a plurality of components, the operation of the component in the last order may be limited. Alternatively, the operation of a plurality of components in the latter orders (components in a plurality of orders) may be limited. And, if low-cost information is recognized in the state where the operation of components is limited, the components with their operations limited may be again operated. The reference for limitation on operation may be any one of the number of operable components and available total energy consumption amount or total energy usage cost. At this time, the limitation on operation of components may be immediately performed. Alternatively, in a case where the operation of a component consists of a number of processes, the operation of the component may be limited after one process is completed. Alternatively, the operation of the component may be limited after high-cost information is recognized and a predetermined time is passed. Alternatively, after a component whose operation is to be limited has consumed a predetermined amount of energy or the energy usage cost reaches a certain level, the operation of the component may be limited. Information notifying that the operation is limited may be displayed in the display unit of a component with its operation limited. Alternatively, information notifying that the operation is limited may be displayed in the display unit of other component which may control the component.","As another example, only when the time for recognition of high-cost information (e.g., on-peak time) exceeds a reference time, the control may be performed for reducing the energy which the component has used. Alternatively, high-cost information is recognized, and then the control is immediately performed for reducing energy, and when the time for performing the control has passed a predetermined time, whether the high-cost information may be recognized for maintenance or change of the current state may be again determined. This is intended to prevent the method of operating the component from being often changed.","For another example, although not shown, the network system may include an accessory component or a consumable handling component. The accessory component may be an energy network-only component, which performs an additional function for the energy network. For example, the accessory component may be an energy network-only weather reception antenna.","The consumable handling component may be a component for storing, supplying, and transferring a consumable and confirms or recognizes information about the consumable. For example, the consumable may be a material or product, which is used or handled during the operation of the component. Also, the consumable handling component may be managed in the energy network, e.g., the energy management component.","For example, the consumable may be a washing cloth of a washing machine, a cooking item of a cooking apparatus, or a detergent for cleaning the washing cloth in the washing machine, or a fiber conditioner, or seasoning for cooking item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0379","num":"0378"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"Referring to , a home network  according to an embodiment includes an energy measurement unit  (e.g., a smart meter) capable of measuring the cost of power and\/or electricity, being supplied to each home, in real-time from the utility network , and an energy management unit  connected to the energy measurement unit  and an electric product and controlling the operation thereof.","The energy management unit  is connected to electric products, the energy consumption units , such as a refrigerator , a washing machine , an air conditioner , a drying machine , and a cooking appliance through an in-house network for two-way communication.

Of course, the amount of heat for the food is enough only if it can keep the food warm, and is set in advance less than that for cooking.","If the electrical product is drier, the drier may perform a driving operation to lower the moisture in a tub (a drying space) after drying the laundry. Here, the driving operation for lowering moisture is to circulate air by operating a fan motor, and the number of rotations of the fan motor may be set less than that for a dry cycle. Even if the dry cycle is terminated, since high moisture in the tub is maintained for a predetermined time, the after service mode may be defined as the driving for circulating air in order to uniformly maintain the dryness of the laundry.","If the electronic product is a dish washer, the dish washer may perform a driving operation of a fan motor to low the moisture in a washing space or a UV lamp to sterilize dishes, after a washing cycle. Here, the number of rotations of the fan motor may be set less than that for drying dishes.","As mentioned above, after an operation of the electrical product is completed, in order to prevent the deterioration of a function that the electrical product performs, the electrical product may operate in a specific mode (driving). Thus, if the driving of the electronic product is completed before a reservation time, an after service mode is performed until the reservation time comes, so that satisfaction on electrical product usage may be improved in operation S.","Another embodiment is suggested.","Although it is described above that the after service mode is performed until the reserved end time comes, the after service mode may be continuously performed until a user manipulates the electrical product again. The re-manipulation of the electrical product includes opening the door of an electrical product.","For example, until a user opens the door of each product in order to take out the laundry, the dishes, and the food, the after service mode may be continuously performed. In more detail, each of the washing machine , the cooking appliance , the drier, and the dish washer may include a door switch. When a specific signal (a door open signal) is recognized by the door switch, the after service mode may stop.","When the re-manipulation of the electronic product, for example, an additional user manipulation and an input or display unit manipulation, is made, the after service mode may stop. For example, when a user inputs a driving stop command on an electrical product through the input unit or display unit, the after service mode may stop.","Moreover, if the low cost information interval does not come in operation S, the electrical product may be driven at the set reservation time. Moreover, when the driving of the electrical product is completed, until a door open signal of the electrical product is recognized, the after service mode may be continuously performed.","Another embodiment is suggested.","Although the case that the reservation command of the electrical product is an end time reservation is described in , unlike this, even when the reservation command of the electrical product is a start time reservation or a time interval reservation, the after service mode may be performed. If the reservation command of the electrical product is a start time reservation, the after service mode may be performed from the start time to the reference time obtained by calculating the time of a specific operation of the electrical product.","For example, although starting of an operation of an electrical product (1 hr cycle) at 1:00 p.m. is reserved, the electrical product may operate at 11:00 a.m. due to the arrival of a low cost information interval and its operation may be completed at 12:00 p.m. In this case, the after service mode may be performed until the reference time for original termination, that is, 2:00 p.m. Additionally, if the reservation command is a time interval, when the electrical product is immediately driven due to the arrival of a low cost information interval, the after service mode may be performed until the end time of the time interval.","Another embodiment is suggested.","At the timing of when a driving command of an electrical product is set, the electrical product of the energy management unit  may recommend an operating time or a time interval on the basis of power information. The recommendation may be done through a method of displaying an inexpensive time slot to a user. Even when a user selects a predetermined time or time interval according to the recommendation of the electrical product or the energy management unit , if a low cost information interval comes before that, the electrical product may be immediately driven. Moreover, after the driving is completed, the after service mode may be continuously performed until the end time of the original recommendation time.","As mentioned above, since an electrical product is driven at a low cost information interval, energy cost and management efficiency may be improved. Furthermore, since an after service mode is performed after the driving of the electrical product, user's satisfaction on a product may be improved.","According to the embodiments, an energy source may be effectively managed, and an energy rate may be reduced, so that Industrial applicability is considerable."],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","Technical Field","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION","Technical Problem","Technical Solution","Advantageous Effects","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION","INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
