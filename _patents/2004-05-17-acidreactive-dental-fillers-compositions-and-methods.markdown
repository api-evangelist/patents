Acid-reactive fillers include, for example, metal oxides, metal salts, and glasses. An example of an acid-reactive glass is fluoroaluminosilicate (FAS) glass, which is a known fluoride releasing material. FAS glass particles are typically prepared by a melt fusion process, which effectively limits available particle sizes to particles typically having an average size of at least 0.5 micrometers.","For applications in which the acid-reactive filler is dispersed in a hardenable resin to form a dental composition (e.g., a dental paste), the reactivity of the acid-reactive filler in the composition is generally limited by the available surface area of the acid-reactive filler. Thus, high loadings (e.g., greater than 50% by weight) of acid-reactive filler are often used to achieve compositions with the desired level of reactivity. However, high loadings of acid-reactive fillers sometimes restrict the flexibility to incorporate additional fillers (e.g., non acid-reactive fillers) in the composition.","As such, there remains a need for acid-reactive dental fillers with improved properties including, for example, higher surface areas.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a composition that is a dental filler, and methods of making and using such dental fillers. In one embodiment, the dental filler includes an oxyfluoride material that is acid-reactive, non-fused, and includes a trivalent metal, oxygen, fluorine, and an alkaline earth metal. Preferably the trivalent metal includes aluminum and\/or lanthanum, and in more preferred embodiments the trivalent metal is aluminum. In some embodiments, the oxyfluoride material optionally includes silicon and\/or a heavy metal. Preferably at least a portion of the oxyfluoride material is nanostructured.","In another embodiment, the dental filler includes an oxyfluoride material that is acid-reactive, and includes a trivalent metal, oxygen, fluorine, and an alkaline earth metal, with the proviso that the oxyfluoride material includes at most 25 mole %, and preferably at most 20 mole % silicon, based on the total moles of silicon, trivalent metal, alkaline earth metal, and any additional cations.","In another aspect, the present invention provides dental compositions, and methods of making and using dental compositions, wherein the dental composition includes a dental filler of the present invention and a hardenable resin (e.g., a polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated compound and\/or an acid). The dental composition may be a single-part or a multi-part dental composition. In addition to the dental filler of the present invention, such dental compositions can include additional acid-reactive or non acid-reactive fillers including, for example, nanofillers. The dental compositions of the invention may be dental adhesives, cavity liners, cements, coating, orthodontic adhesives, restoratives, sealants, and combinations thereof. Dental compositions of the present invention can be hardened to prepare dental articles including, for example, crowns, fillings, mill blanks, orthodontic devices, and prostheses.","Preferably, by incorporating acid-reactive fillers of the present invention in resins, dental compositions (e.g., dental restoratives) can be prepared that exhibit improvements in one or more properties including, for example, strength, polish, polish retention, fluoride release, abrasion resistance, aesthetics, and radiopacity.","Definitions","As used herein, a \u201cnon-fused\u201d material means that the material was not formed from a melted state. Non-fused materials may be formed by methods including, for example, chemical syntheses, precipitations, and combinations thereof.","As used herein, a \u201cdental filler\u201d is a particulate material suitable for use in the oral environment. Dental fillers generally have an average particle size of at most 100 micrometers.","As used herein, the term \u201cpaste\u201d refers to a soft, viscous mass of solids dispersed in a liquid.","As used herein, the term \u201cnon-fused\u201d refers to a material that has not been prepared by a melt fusion process.","As used herein, an \u201cacid-reactive\u201d dental filler is a filler that chemically reacts in the presence of an acidic component.","As used herein, an \u201calkaline earth metal\u201d is an element selected from the group consisting of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba.","As used herein an oxyfluoride is a material in which atoms of oxygen and fluorine are bonded to the same atom (e.g., aluminum in an aluminum oxyfluoride). Generally, at least 50% of the fluorine atoms are bonded to an atom bearing an oxygen atom in an oxyfluoride material.","As used herein, a \u201cnanostructured\u201d material refers to a material in a form having at least one dimension that is, on average, at most 200 nanometers (e.g., nanosized particles). Thus, nanostructured materials refer to materials including, for example, nanoparticles as defined herein below; aggregates of nanoparticles; materials coated on particles, wherein the coatings have an average thickness of at most 200 nanometers; materials coated on aggregates of particles, wherein the coatings have an average thickness of at most 200 nanometers; materials infiltrated in porous structures having an average pore size of at most 200 nanometers; and combinations thereof. Porous structures include, for example, porous particles, porous aggregates of particles, porous coatings, and combinations thereof.","As used herein, \u201cnanoparticles\u201d is used synonymously with \u201cnanosized particles,\u201d and refers to particles having an average size of at most 200 nanometers. As used herein for a spherical particle, \u201csize\u201d refers to the diameter of the particle. As used herein for a non-spherical particle, \u201csize\u201d refers to the longest dimension of the particle.","As used herein, \u201cagglomerated\u201d is descriptive of a weak association of primary particles usually held together by charge or polarity. Agglomerated particles can typically be broken down into smaller entities by, for example, shearing forces encountered during dispersion of the agglomerated particles in a liquid.","In general, \u201caggregated\u201d and \u201caggregates\u201d are descriptive of a strong association of primary particles often bound together by, for example, residual chemical treatment, covalent chemical bonds, or ionic chemical bonds. Further breakdown of the aggregates into smaller entities is very difficult to achieve. Typically, aggregated particles are not broken down into smaller entities by, for example, shearing forces encountered during dispersion of the aggregated particles in a liquid.","As used herein, \u201caggregated silica\u201d is descriptive of an association of primary silica particles often bound together by, for example, residual chemical treatment, covalent chemical bonds, or ionic chemical bonds. Although complete breakdown of aggregated silica into smaller entities may be difficult to achieve, limited or incomplete breakdown may be observed under conditions including, for example, shearing forces encountered during dispersion of the aggregated silica in a liquid. As used herein, a \u201csilica cluster\u201d or \u201csilica-zirconia cluster\u201d refers to aggregated silica or silica-zirconia in which a substantial amount of the aggregated primary silica or zirconia particles are loosely bound. \u201cLoosely bound\u201d refers to the nature of the association among the particles present in the silica or silica-zirconia cluster. Typically, the particles are associated by relatively weak intermolecular forces that cause the particles to clump together. Preferably, many of the clusters remain intact during dispersion into a hardenable resin for a dental material, even though some clusters may be fractured into smaller structures during the dispersion process. Thus, silica clusters and silica-zirconia clusters are typically referred to as \u201cloosely bound aggregated silica\u201d or \u201cloosely bound aggregated silica-zirconia.\u201d The clusters disclosed in the present application are preferably substantially spherical and preferably not fully densified. The term \u201cfully dense,\u201d as used herein, is descriptive of a particle that is near theoretical density, having substantially no open porosity detectable by standard analytical techniques such as the B.E.T. nitrogen technique (based upon adsorption of Nmolecules from a gas with which a specimen is contacted). Such measurements yield data on the surface area per unit weight of a sample (e.g. m\/g), which can be compared to the surface area per unit weight for a mass of perfect microspheres of the same size to detect open porosity. The term \u201cnot fully densified\u201d as used herein, is descriptive of a particle that is less than theoretical density, and therefore, has porosity. For porous particles with open porosity, (e.g., clusters of primary particles), the measured surface area is greater than the surface area calculated for solid particles of the same size. Such measurements may be made on a Quantasorb apparatus made by Quantachrome Corporation of Syossett, N.Y. Density measurements may be made using an air, helium or water pycnometer.","As used herein, \u201cparticle size\u201d refers to the longest dimension (e.g., diameter) of a particle.","Silica clusters disclosed in the present application may be manufactured in a process that includes drying and optionally heat treating and\/or calcining. The ratio of the surface area after heat treatment compared to the surface area before heat treatment is preferably greater than 50%, more preferably greater than 80%. Preferably the change in surface area after heating is at most 10% and more preferably at most 5%.","As used herein, a \u201cshelf-stable\u201d composition refers to a composition that has a shelf-life of at least one year, and preferably at least 2 years, at room temperature. Shelf-life of an adhesive composition is typically measured by determining if the aged composition provides acceptable bond strengths when the aged composition is bonded to a dental structure surface.","The present invention provides a dental filler that includes an acid-reactive oxyfluoride material, and methods of making and using the dental filler. As used herein an oxyfluoride is a material in which atoms of oxygen and fluorine are bonded to the same atom (e.g., aluminum in an aluminum oxyfluoride). In some embodiments, at least 50%, sometimes at least 70%, and in other embodiments at least 80%, of the fluorine atoms are bonded to or coordinated by an atom bearing or coordinated by an oxygen atom in an oxyfluoride material. Single- and multi-part dental compositions can include, in addition to a dental filler of the present invention, a hardenable resin and\/or a hardenable polyacid. Such dental compositions are useful as, for example, dental adhesives, artificial crowns, anterior fillings, posterior fillings, casting materials, cavity liners, cements, coating compositions, mill blanks, orthodontic devices, orthodontic adhesives, restoratives, prostheses, and sealants.","Dental Fillers Including Acid-Reactive, Oxyfluoride Materials","The present invention provides a composition including an acid-reactive, oxyfluoride material that is a dental filler. The oxyfluoride material includes a trivalent metal, oxygen, fluorine, and an alkaline earth metal. Preferably the trivalent metal is aluminum, lanthanum, or combinations thereof. More preferably the trivalent metal is aluminum. Preferably the alkaline earth metal is strontium, calcium, barium, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments of the present invention, the oxyfluoride material may further include silicon and\/or heavy metal (e.g., zirconium, lanthanum, niobium, yttrium, or tantalum), or more specifically, oxides, fluorides and\/or oxyfluorides thereof. In some embodiments, the oxyfluoride material includes at most 25 mole % silicon, and preferably at most 20 mole % silicon, based on the total moles of silicon, the trivalent metal, the alkaline earth metal, and any additional cations in the oxyfluoride material. In other embodiments, the oxyfluoride material is non-fused.","The molar ratio of the trivalent metal to the alkaline earth metal in the oxyfluoride material can affect chemical and structural properties including, for example, acid reactivity and efficiency in the hardening reaction of acid-reactive fillers with polyacids. For example, increasing the alkaline earth metal content can result in greater acid reactivity. However, for some embodiments trivalent metal content sufficient to promote the formation of relatively homogeneous oxyfluoride structures is preferred. Increasing the trivalent metal content can increase the efficiency of the oxyfluoride material in hardening polyacids, which can allow one of skill in the art to eliminate or reduce the use of conventional FAS filler in certain dental compositions. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the trivalent metal to the alkaline earth metal in the oxyfluoride material is at least 50:50, and in other embodiments at least 70:30. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the trivalent metal to the alkaline earth metal in the oxyfluoride material is at most 95:5, and in other embodiments at most 90:10.","The ratio of oxygen to fluorine in the oxyfluoride material can affect the physical characteristics and the reactivity of the filler. Typically, increasing the fluoride content of the oxyfluoride materials results in precipitated fillers having decreased surface area, increased primary particle size, and decreased acid reactivity. However, substantial fluorine content is desirable to provide fluoride release from certain dental compositions, and some fluorine is typically required for optimum reactivity. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of oxygen to fluorine in the oxyfluoride material is at least 50:50, sometimes at least 60:40, and in other embodiments at least 65:35. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of oxygen to fluorine in the oxyfluoride material is at most 95:5, sometimes at most 90:10, and in other embodiments at most 85:15.","In some embodiments of the present invention, at least a portion of the oxyfluoride material is nanostructured. Such nanostructured materials include the oxyfluoride material in the form of, for example, nanoparticles, coatings on particles, coatings on aggregates of particles, infiltrate in a porous structure, and combinations thereof. Preferably at least 90% by weight, more preferably at least 95% by weight, and most preferably at least 98% by weight of the oxyfluoride material is nanostructured.","In some embodiments of the present invention, at least a portion of the nanostructured oxyfluoride material can be in the form of aggregated or non-aggregated nanoparticles. In such embodiments, preferably at least 90% by weight, more preferably at least 95% by weight, and most preferably at least 98% by weight of the oxyfluoride material is in the form of nanoparticles. Preferably the nanoparticles have an average size of at most 100 nanometers, more preferably at most 50 nm, even more preferably at most 20 nm.","In embodiments in which the oxyfluoride material is in the form of nanoparticles, the oxyfluoride material preferably has a surface area of at least 10 square meters per gram (m\/g), more preferably at least 25 m\/g, and most preferably at least 50 m\/g.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the nanostructured oxyfluoride material can be in the form of a coating on a particle (e.g., a nanoparticle). Suitable particles include, for example, metal oxide particles (e.g., silica, zirconia, alumina, titania, yttrium oxide, lanthanum oxide and mixed metal oxides including, for example, zirconate or titanate perovskites), glass particles (e.g., dental glass), non-oxide particles (e.g., colloidal metal fluorides such as yttrium fluoride), and combinations thereof.","Coatings can be advantageously formed on conventional size filler particles, nanoparticles, and aggregates. Suitable conventional particles typically have an average size of at least 0.5 micrometer, and often at least 1 micrometer. Suitable conventional particles typically have an average size of at most 50 micrometers, and often at most 10 micrometers.","The average coating thickness is typically at least 20 nanometers, and often at least 50 nanometers. The average coating thickness is typically at most 1000 nanometers, and often at most 500 nanometers.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the nanostructured oxyfluoride material can be in the form of a coating on an aggregate of particles (e.g., an aggregate of nanoparticles). Suitable particles include, for example, metal oxide particles (e.g., silica, zirconia, alumina, titania, yttrium oxide, lanthanum oxide and mixed metal oxides including, for example, zirconate or titanate perovskites), glass particles (e.g., dental glass), non-oxide particles (e.g., colloidal metal fluorides such as yttrium fluoride), and combinations thereof.","Suitable aggregates can be similar in size to conventional fillers (e.g., at least 1 micrometer in some embodiments, and at most 10 micrometers in other embodiments). Useful aggregates of particles smaller than conventional fillers (e.g., nanofillers) typically have a size of at least 50 nanometers in some embodiments, and at most 1 micrometer in other embodiments. The average coating thickness is typically at least 20 nanometers in some embodiments, and often at most half the aggregate size in other embodiments.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the nanostructured oxyfluoride material can be in the form of an infiltrate in a porous structure (e.g., a porous particle, a porous aggregate of particles, a porous coating, or a combination thereof). In embodiments in which the porous structure includes porous particles, the porous particles can include, for example, metal oxide particles (e.g., silica, zirconia, alumina, titania, yttrium oxide, lanthanum oxide and mixed metal oxides including, for example, zirconate or titanate perovskites), glass particles (e.g., dental glass), non-oxide particles (e.g., colloidal metal fluorides such as yttrium fluoride), and combinations thereof. In embodiments in which the porous structure includes a porous aggregate of particles, the particles are preferably nanoparticles. Preferably the average pore size is at least 20 nanometers, and more preferably at least 50 nanometers. Preferably the average pore size is at most 10 micrometers, and more preferably at most 1000 nanometers.","Particles and coatings can be combined to provide dental fillers of the present invention. For example, a porous coating can be formed on conventional filler particles, and infiltrated with the oxyfluoride material of the present invention. Such a structure might include, for example, a dental glass with a colloidal silica coating.","Dental fillers of the present invention include an acid-reactive oxyfluoride material. Preferably the acid-reactive oxyfluoride material can react with an acidic material (e.g., organic acid, inorganic acid, monomeric acid, oligomeric acid, and polymeric acid), and preferably a polyacid as described herein. Typically, dental fillers of the present invention undergo significant surface corrosion or dissolution when exposed to various acids used in dental compositions, such as poly(meth)acrylic acids or phosphonic acids. The corroded or dissolved filler releases fluoride ions into the surrounding liquid or matrix. Multivalent cations useful in curing ionomers are also released. Typically, significant surface corrosion or dissolution occurs at or near body temperature when acid-reactive fluoride materials are contacted with acids commonly used in dental compositions.","Preparations of Dental Fillers","The present invention provides methods of preparing dental fillers including an acid-reactive oxyfluoride material including a trivalent metal, oxygen, fluorine, and an alkaline earth metal.","In one embodiment, the method includes combining a first liquid composition and a second liquid composition, and separating (e.g., filtering) the oxyfluoride material from the combined liquids. The first liquid composition includes a source of a trivalent metal and a source of an alkaline earth metal. The second liquid composition includes a source of fluorine, and optionally, a source of silicon.","Preferably the trivalent metal is aluminum, lanthanum, or combinations thereof. More preferably, the trivalent metal is aluminum. Preferably at least one of the liquid compositions further includes a source of hydroxide as a source of oxygen.","Optionally, at least one of the first or second liquid compositions can include water. Typically at least one of the liquid compositions is an aqueous composition having a pH greater than 7, sometimes having a pH greater than 9.","The first liquid composition includes a source for a trivalent metal. Sources for trivalent metals include, for example, trivalent metal salts and alkoxides. Suitable salts include, for example, lanthanum nitrates and basic or oxy salts thereof, lanthanum carboxylates and basic or oxy salts thereof, lanthanum halides and basic or oxy salts thereof, aluminum nitrates and basic or oxy salts thereof, aluminum carboxylates and basic or oxy salts thereof, aluminum halides and basic or oxy salts thereof, and combinations thereof. Suitable alkoxides include, for example, lanthanum isopropoxide, lanthanum sec-butoxide, aluminum isopropoxide, aluminum sec-butoxide, and combinations thereof.","The concentration of the trivalent metal salt should be low enough to readily promote full dissolution. More dilute solutions are sometimes useful for promoting fine precipitates. The volume of anion solution is a significant portion of the total reaction volume in many embodiments. Typically, the concentration of the trivalent metal source in the first liquid composition is at least 0.1 molar, and in other embodiments at most 2.5 molar.","The first liquid composition also includes a source for an alkaline earth metal. Suitable sources for alkaline earth metals include, for example, strontium nitrates, strontium carboxylates, strontium halides, calcium nitrates, calcium carboxylates, calcium halides, and combinations thereof. Typically, the concentration of the alkaline earth metal source in the first liquid composition is at least 0.1 molar, and in other embodiments at most 2.5 molar.","The molar ratio of trivalent to divalent cations in the reaction product is typically about the same as that in the combined cation solution prior to precipitation. In many embodiments, the preferred ratio in the solution is the same as the preferred ratio in the filler.","The second liquid composition includes a source for fluorine. Suitable sources for fluorine include, for example, ammonium fluoride, ammonium hydrogen difluoride, hexafluorosilicic acid and salts thereof, and combinations thereof. Dilute solutions tend to promote the precipitation of fine particles, whereas concentrated solutions can result in easier separation and recovery of the precipitated filler. Typically, the fluorine concentration is at least 0.1 molar, and in some embodiments at most 5 moles per liter.","Optionally, at least one of the first or second liquid compositions can include a source of hydroxide as a source of oxygen. Suitable hydroxide sources include, for example, ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and combinations thereof.","The amount of second liquid composition (i.e., fluorine containing liquid) is the amount that results in the desired fluoride content of the filler. When both fluoride and hydroxide are present in the second liquid, a two to three times stoichiometric excess (e.g., 9 moles of combined fluoride and hydroxide for every mole of trivalent aluminum is 3 times the stoichiometric amount) is typically used to ensure complete reaction with and precipitation of the cations in the first liquid composition. The fluorine content in the filler is determined by the F:OH ratio, not simply the total F in the second liquid. The ratio of F:O in the filler is not necessarily equal to the ratio of F:OH in the solutions and depends on the reaction chemistry of specific cation solutions. The ratio in solution required to give a desired fluorine content can be readily determined by one of skill in the art with guidance from the Examples described herein.","Optionally, the second liquid composition includes a source for silicon. Suitable sources for silicon include, for example, sodium silicate, hexafluorosilicic acid and salts thereof, silicon alkoxides, and combinations thereof.","If present, the concentration of the silicon source in the second liquid composition is generally similar to the concentration of fluoride and hydroxide described herein above. Useful concentrations of silicon are typically sufficient to provide the desired number of silicon atoms in relation to number of divalent and trivalent atoms in the first liquid composition.","In some embodiments in which silicon is present, preferably the silicon source is present in an amount sufficient to provide an oxyfluoride material including at most 25 mole % silicon, and more preferably at most 20 mole % silicon, based on the total moles of silicon, the trivalent metal, the alkaline earth metal, and any additional cations in the oxyfluoride material.","Preferably the first and second liquid compositions are combined under conditions including efficient agitation (e.g., rapid stirring). For example, the first liquid composition can be added to a vessel containing the second liquid composition with rapid stirring. Typically precipitation is rapid, but agitation can be continued (e.g., for 10 minutes or more in some embodiments, for 60 minutes or more in other embodiments) to ensure complete reaction.","Typically, the reaction is carried out at or near room temperature, but higher or lower temperatures can be used as desired in certain embodiments.","The oxyfluoride material may be separated from the combined liquids by methods known in the art including, for example, filtration, centrifugation, settling, decanting, and combinations thereof. Preferably the oxyfluoride material is filtered. Upon separation, the oxyfluoride can optionally be washed using suitable liquids including, for example, water, alcohols, and combinations thereof.","The method may optionally include drying the separated oxyfluoride material at a temperature of at most 350\u00b0 C., more preferably at most 250\u00b0 C., and most preferably at most 150\u00b0 C. Suitable drying methods are known in the art and include, for example, hot air drying (e.g., oven drying).","Preferably the method provides the oxyfluoride material in a form of, for example, a precipitate, a coating on a particle, a coating on an aggregate of particles, a material infiltrated into a porous structure, or combinations thereof. Optionally, the oxyfluoride material can be redispersed in a liquid medium (e.g., a medium including water) after separation or after drying. Oxyfluoride material particularly useful for dispersion in a dental composition can be formed by milling dried or separated material. Milling can be done in water or other liquids, or can be done in the presence of dental resins or other components.","Methods known in the art for milling ceramic or inorganic particles, including ball milling, attritor or fluid energy mills, jets mills, and the like are suitable for milling oxyfluoride material of the present invention. For dental compositions that include water, a preferred form of the oxyfluoride material to disperse in the composition is separated oxyfluoride material including sufficient water to form wet cakes or plastic solids. Oxyfluoride material in these forms is typically more convenient to disperse when the separated oxyfluoride material is never fully dried. For example, after precipitation and washing, wet oxyfluoride material separated by filtering, centrifuging, or filter pressing can include about 40 to 70% by weight water, and the wet oxyfluoride material can be added to dental compositions in this form.","Alternatively, if the washed precipitate is dried, a similarly dispersible wet cake or plastic mass can be formed by milling the dried precipitate in water, followed by separation by filtering, filter pressing, or centrifugation to form a dispersible wet oxyfluoride material.","After washing or milling in water, the oxyfluoride material can also be coated on a particle, coated on an aggregate of particles, infiltrated into a porous structure, or combinations thereof.","In another embodiment, the method includes providing a porous structure (e.g., porous particles, porous aggregates of particles, and combinations thereof); infiltrating a first liquid composition in the porous structure; and infiltrating a second liquid composition in the porous structure to provide a porous structure infiltrated with an acid-reactive oxyfluoride material. The first liquid composition includes a source of a trivalent metal and a source of an alkaline earth metal. The trivalent metal is preferably aluminum, lanthanum, or combinations thereof. More preferably the trivalent metal is aluminum. The second liquid composition includes a source of fluorine, and optionally, ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or combinations thereof. The second liquid optionally may further include a source of silicon. Preferably at least one of the first or second liquid compositions further includes water. Infiltrating the first liquid composition can be carried out before, during, or after infiltrating the second liquid composition.","Optionally the method further includes drying the porous structure infiltrated with the acid-reactive oxyfluoride material at a temperature of at most 350\u00b0 C., more preferably at most 250\u00b0 C., and most preferably at most 150\u00b0 C.","Acids","Acids for use in the present invention can be inorganic or organic acids, and if organic can be-monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric (e.g., polyacids as described herein below). The acids may be polymerizable or non-polymerizable. If desired, a precursor to the acid such as an acid anhydride, acid halide (including inorganic acid halides such as Lewis acids, e.g., ferric chloride, and organic acid halides), or esters can be used in place of the acid itself, e.g., to generate the desired acid in situ. Suitable acids include mineral acids, carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, alkylsulfonic acids, arylsulfonic acids, and phosphonic acids. The acid can be a liquid or a solid material.","Suitable inorganic acids include HBr, HCl, HNO, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and phosphonic acid. Suitable organic acids include acetic acid, 2-chloropropionic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, (meth)acrylic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, bromoacetic acid, 10-camphorquinonesulfonic acid, 10-camphorsulfonic acid, chloroacetic acid, citraconic acid, citric acid, dibromoacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, di-HEMA ester of 1,2,4,5 benzenetetracarboxylic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenol, formic acid, fumaric acid, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid, maleic acid, 2-naphthalene sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-nitrophenol, phenol, dibutyl phosphite, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphite, hydroxyethyl methacrylate monophosphate, glyceryl dimethacrylate phosphate, glyceryl-2-phosphate, glycerylphosphoric acid, methacryloxyethyl phosphate, pentaerythritol triacrylate monophosphate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate monophosphate, pivalic acid, propionic acid, toluene sulfonic acid, tribromoacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and trihydroxybenzoic acid. Mixtures of such acids can be used if desired.","Polyacids","Dental compositions of the present invention may include at least one polyacid, which may be a non-curable or non-polymerizable polyacid, or a curable or polymerizable polyacid (e.g., a resin-modified polyacid). The polyacid need not be entirely water soluble, but it should be at least sufficiently water-miscible so that it does not undergo substantial sedimentation when combined with other aqueous components. Suitable polyacids are-listed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,209,434 (Wilson et al.), column 2, line 62, to column 3, line 6. The polyacid should have a molecular weight sufficient to provide good storage, handling, and mixing properties. A preferred weight average molecular weight is 5,000 to 100,000, evaluated against a polystyrene standard using gel permeation chromatography.","In one embodiment, the polyacid is a curable or polymerizable resin. That is, it contains at least one ethylenically unsaturated group. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated polyacids are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,872,936 (Engelbrecht), e.g., at columns 3 and 4, and EP 323 120 B1 (Mitra), e.g., at page 3, line 55 to page 5, line 8. Preferably, the numbers of acidic groups and ethylenically unsaturated groups are adjusted to provide an appropriate balance of properties in the dental composition. Polyacids in which 10% to 30% of the acidic groups have been replaced with ethylenically unsaturated groups are preferred.","In other embodiments, the polyacid is hardenable in the presence of, for example, an acid-reactive filler and water, but does not contain ethylenically unsaturated groups.

Suitable polymerizable components and redox agents that are useful in the present invention are described in U.S. patent Publication No. 2003\/0166740 (Mitra et al.) and U.S. patent Publication No. 2003\/0195273 (Mitra et al.).","The reducing and oxidizing agents should react with or otherwise cooperate with one another to produce free-radicals capable of initiating polymerization of the resin system (e.g., the ethylenically unsaturated component). This type of cure is a dark reaction, that is, it is not dependent on the presence of light and can proceed in the absence of light. The reducing and oxidizing agents are preferably sufficiently shelf-stable and free of undesirable colorization to permit their storage and use under typical dental conditions. They should be sufficiently miscible with the resin system (and preferably water-soluble) to permit ready dissolution in (and discourage separation from) the other components of the polymerizable composition.","Useful reducing agents include, for example, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid derivatives, and metal complexed ascorbic acid compounds as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,727 (Wang et al.); amines, especially tertiary amines, such as 4-tert-butyl dimethylaniline; aromatic sulfinic salts, such as p-toluenesulfinic salts and benzenesulfinic salts; thioureas, such as 1-ethyl-2-thiourea, tetraethyl thiourea, tetramethyl thiourea, 1,1-dibutyl thiourea, and 1,3-dibutyl thiourea; and mixtures thereof. Other secondary reducing agents may include cobalt (II) chloride, ferrous chloride, ferrous sulfate, hydrazine, hydroxylamine (depending on the choice of oxidizing agent), salts of a dithionite or sulfite anion, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the reducing agent is an amine.","Suitable oxidizing agents will also be familiar to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, persulfuric acid and salts thereof, such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, cesium, and alkyl ammonium salts. Additional oxidizing agents include, for example, peroxides such as benzoyl peroxides, hydroperoxides such as cumyl hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and amyl hydroperoxide, as well as salts of transition metals such as cobalt (III) chloride and ferric chloride, cerium (IV) sulfate, perboric acid and salts thereof, permanganic acid and salts thereof, perphosphoric acid and salts thereof, and combinations thereof.","It may be desirable to use more than one oxidizing agent or more than one reducing agent. Small quantities of transition metal compounds may also be added to accelerate the rate of redox cure. In some embodiments it may be preferred to include a secondary ionic salt to enhance the stability of the hardenable composition as described, for example, in U.S. patent Publication No. 2003\/0195273 (Mitra et al.).","The reducing and oxidizing agents are present in amounts sufficient to permit an adequate free-radical reaction rate. This can be evaluated by combining all of the ingredients of the hardenable composition except for the filler, and observing whether or not a hardened mass is obtained.","Preferably, the reducing agent is present in an amount of at least 0.01% by weight, and more preferably at least 0.1% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the hardenable composition. Preferably, the reducing agent is present in an amount of no greater than 10% by weight, and more preferably no greater than 5% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the polymerizable composition.","Preferably, the oxidizing agent is present in an amount of at least 0.01% by weight, and more preferably at least 0.10% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the polymerizable composition. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is present in an amount of no greater than 10% by weight, and more preferably no greater than 5% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the hardenable composition.","The reducing or oxidizing agents can be microencapsulated as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,154,762 (Mitra et al.). This will generally enhance shelf stability of the polymerizable composition, and if necessary permit packaging the reducing and oxidizing agents together. For example, through appropriate selection of an encapsulant, the oxidizing and reducing agents can be combined with an acid-functional component and optional filler and kept in a storage-stable state. Likewise, through appropriate selection of a water-insoluble encapsulant, the reducing and oxidizing agents can be combined with an FAS glass and water and maintained in a storage-stable state.","In a further alternative, heat may be used to initiate the hardening, or polymerization, of free radically active groups. Examples of heat sources suitable for the dental materials of the invention include inductive, convective, and radiant. Thermal sources should be capable of generating temperatures of at least 40\u00b0 C. and at most 150\u00b0 C. under normal conditions or at elevated pressure. This procedure is preferred for initiating polymerization of materials occurring outside of the oral environment.","Yet another alternative class of initiators capable of initiating polymerization of free radically active functional groups in the hardenable resin are those that include free radical-generating thermal initiators. Examples include peroxides (e.g., benzoyl peroxide and lauryl peroxide) and azo compounds (e.g., 2,2-azobis-isobutyronitrile (AIBN)).","Photoinitiator compounds are preferably provided in dental compositions disclosed in the present application in an amount effective to initiate or enhance the rate of cure or hardening of the resin system. Useful photopolymerizable compositions are prepared by simply admixing, under safe light conditions, the components as described above. Suitable inert solvents may be used, if desired, when preparing this mixture. Any solvent that does not react appreciably with the components of the inventive compositions may be used. Examples of suitable solvents include, for example, acetone, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile.","Other Fillers","In addition to the dental filler that includes an acid-reactive oxyfluoride material, the compositions of the present invention can also optionally contain one or more other fillers.

Preferably, the maximum particle size (the largest dimension of a particle, typically, the diameter) of the other filler is less than 5 micrometers, more preferably less than 0.5 micrometers, and most preferably less than 0.1 micrometers. Preferably, the average particle size of the filler is less than 0.1 micrometers, and more preferably less than 0.075 micrometer.","The other filler can be an inorganic material. It can also be a crosslinked organic material that is insoluble in the resin component of the composition, and is optionally filled with inorganic filler. The filler should in any event be nontoxic and suitable for use in the mouth. The filler can be radiopaque or radiolucent. The filler typically is substantially insoluble in water.","Examples of suitable inorganic fillers are naturally occurring or synthetic materials including, but not limited to: quartz; nitrides (e.g., silicon nitride); glasses derived from, for example, Zr, Sr, Ce, Sb, Sn, Ba, Zn, and Al; feldspar; borosilicate glass; kaolin; talc; titania; low Mohs hardness fillers such as those described in U.S. Pat.

Mixtures of these non-acid-reactive fillers are also contemplated, as well as combination fillers made from organic and inorganic materials.","The surface of the filler particles can also be treated with a coupling agent in order to enhance the bond between the filler and the resin. The use of suitable coupling agents include gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and the like.","Other suitable fillers are disclosed in U.S. Pat.

For some applications, the dental composition is preferably in the form of a paste. Dental compositions of the present invention can be chemically curable, heat curable, or light curable compositions. Light curable materials should have an appropriate initiator system. Chemically curable materials can be auto-cure (e.g. via redox initiators). Alternatively, the compositions can be hardened by a combination of auto- and light-cure. Dental compositions of the present invention can be single-part or multi-part dental compositions. Preferably, the compositions are shelf-stable compositions, that is, they have a room-temperature shelf-life stability of at least 1 year, and preferably at least 2 years.","In other embodiments, dental compositions disclosed in the present application include a dental filler that includes an acid-reactive oxyfluoride material disposed in the resin. The amount of filler used depends on the type of composition and on the desired properties.","In further embodiments, dental fillers of the present invention are useful in ionomer type compositions, such as conventional glass ionomers, which typically include a polyacid, an acid-reactive filler, and water; and resin modified glass ionomers, which typically include a polyacid, an acid-reactive filler, a hardenable resin (i.e. a polymerizable component), and water. Dental fillers of the present invention can be used as partial or complete replacements for conventional FAS glass fillers, which are typically used as acid-reactive fillers.","Preferably dental fillers of the present invention have a high surface area, allowing them to be used in relatively small amounts, but still providing fluoride release and ionomer curing comparable to higher loadings of conventional FAS glasses. The use of relatively small amounts of dental fillers of the present invention allows for the formulation of ionomer and\/or fluoride releasing dental compositions including larger amounts of additional desired fillers, such as radiopaque fillers, indexed matched fillers, and\/or nanofillers. In some embodiments, such compositions can have less than 15% by weight of dental fillers of the present invention, or less than 10% in other embodiments, or less than 5% in still other embodiments. In some embodiments, the dental fillers in such compositions can provide a filler surface area of at least 2 square meters, in other embodiments at least 5 square meters, and in still other embodiments at least 10 square meters, per gram of dental composition, despite the relatively low loadings.","Dental compositions of the present invention can optionally include, in addition to the dental filler of the present invention, relatively large amounts of additional fillers.

In a preferred aspect, the dental composition is a dental restorative. The restoratives of the invention can be placed directly in the mouth and cured (hardened) in situ, or alternatively, may be fabricated into a prosthesis outside the mouth and subsequently adhered in place inside the mouth.","Preferably, the present invention provides dental compositions that are capable of being hardened to provide a balance of desirable properties as detailed below (e.g., a high diametral tensile strength, a high compressive strength, and a high adhesion value) while retaining excellent handling and rheological properties (e.g., no substantial settling after 5 days of storage at 25\u00b0 C.). Preferably, the dental composition is non-sticky when handled using well known procedures by one of skill in the art.","Multi-Part Dental Compositions","In one embodiment, the invention provides a multi-part (e.g., two or more part) dental composition. Each part may independently be, for example, a powder, a liquid, a gel, or a paste. Such multi-part dental systems include, for example, compositions that include an acid-reactive filler and a hardenable resin, and iononmeric compositions that include an acid-reactive filer, polyacid, and optional hardenable resin (i.e., a polymerizable component). As described herein, the acid-reactive fillers of the present invention can replace all or a portion of an FAS glass filler that are typically included in such compositions.","For example, a two-part ionomer system can include a part A, which includes an acid-reactive filler, and a part B, which includes a polyacid. Part A and Part B can be combined to form a mixed ionomer composition. The viscosity of part A is typically greater than 50,000 centipoise (cps), preferably between 150,000 to 300,000 cps when measured at or near room temperature (nominally 25\u00b0 C.) using a Brookfield viscometer using a T-D spindle with a conversion factor equal to 32,000. Typically, a dental practitioner mixes the two parts immediately prior to use. As the two parts are mixed, an acid-base hardening reaction begins. Preferably the mixture has a working time, as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,715 (Mitra), of at least 30 seconds, and more preferably at least 60 seconds. Optionally, if a polymerizable component is present, subsequent hardening of the polymerizable component can be facilitated by curing agents and\/or by light. Each component used to formulate parts A and B is discussed in detail herein. Certain components such as polymerizable components and initiator components may reside in either part A, part B, or both part A and part B as further explained below. The polyacid and the polymerizable component may be the same or different.","In one embodiment, the dental fillers disclosed in the present invention may be used in a part A of an ionomer composition. Part A may optionally include a polymerizable component. When used in part A of an ionomer composition, the composition preferably includes at least 5% by weight, more preferably at least 10% by weight, and most preferably at least 15% by weight of the dental filler of the present invention, based on the total weight of part A of the composition. When used in a part A of an ionomer composition, the composition preferably includes at most 85% by weight, more preferably at most 82% by weight, and most preferably at most 80% by weight of the dental filler of the present invention, based on the total weight of part A of the composition.","The amount of polyacid in the dental composition, whether as part of a hardenable polymerizable resin or a non-polymerizable hardenable polyacid, should be sufficient to provide a desired balance of properties. Part B preferably includes at least 5% by weight of the polyacid and more preferably at least 10% by weight of the polyacid, based on the total weight of part B. Part B preferably includes at most 70% by weight of the polyacid and more preferably at most 60% by weight of the polyacid, based on the total weight of part B.","Parts A and\/or B can optionally contain water, which can be present in the product as sold or added by the dental practitioner just prior to use. The water can be distilled, deionized (DI), or tap water, with deionized water being preferred. Just prior to use, the total dental composition preferably includes at least 1% by weight water, more preferably at least 3% by weight water, and most preferably at least 5% by weight water. Just prior to use, the total dental composition preferably includes at most 35% by weight water, and more preferably at most 25% by weight water. In general, the amount of water used should be sufficient to provide adequate handling and mixing properties for the dental composition and to permit the transport of ions in the acid-reactive dental filler-polyacid reaction. When water and filler of the present invention are both included in part A, an aqueous paste or stiff clay-like form of the filler can be used in the formulation of part A.","Optionally, multi-part dental systems of the present invention can include additional non acid-reactive or acid-reactive fillers including, for example, nanofillers.","In some implementations of the invention, at least 90% by weight of the non acid-reactive dental filler is in the form of nanoparticles.","In some embodiments, two-part dental compositions of the present invention can be provided in a dual barrel syringe having a first barrel and a second barrel, wherein the part A resides in the first barrel and the part B resides in the second barrel. In other embodiments, two-part dental compositions of the present invention can be provided in a unit-dose capsule. In some embodiments, each part of a multi-part dental system can be mixed together using a static mixer.","Hardened Dental Compositions","Dental compositions disclosed in the present application include a dental filler of the present invention disposed in a hardenable resin (e.g., a polymerizable component), have especially desirable handling (e.g., rheological) properties in an unhardened state and high strength in a hardened state.","Strength can be characterized by mechanical measurements such as compressive strength (CS) and diametral tensile strength (DTS). High compressive strength in a dental material is advantageous due to the forces exerted by mastication on dental repairs, replacements and restorations. Diametral tensile strength indicates the dental material's ability to withstand compression forces that introduce a tensile stress in the material. Tests for each strength measurement are set out below in the Examples.","The dental compositions disclosed in the present application, when hardened, preferably have a compressive strength of at least 60 MPa; more preferably, a compressive strength of at least 80 MPa; and most preferably, a compressive strength of at least 90 MPa. Hardened dental compositions of the invention preferably have a diametral tensile strength of at least 10 MPa; more preferably at least 15 MPa; and most preferably at least 20 MPa.","Dental Articles","The dental compositions of the present invention may be hardened to form, for example, dental articles (e.g., crowns, fillings, mill blanks, and prostheses) and orthodontic devices. In a preferred method of using dental compositions including a hardenable resin and dental fillers of the present invention, the composition may be placed near or on a tooth surface, followed by a manipulation by the practitioner or laboratory to change the topography of the composition, followed by hardening of the composition. These steps can be followed sequentially or in a different order. For example, in a preferred embodiment where the dental composition is a mill blank or a prosthesis, the hardening step is generally completed prior to changing the topography of the composition. Changing the topography of the composition can be accomplished in various ways including, for example, carving or manual manipulation using hand held instruments, or by machine or computer aided apparatus (e.g., a CAD\/CAM milling machine) in the case of prostheses and mill blanks. Optionally, a finishing step can be performed to polish, finish, or apply a coating on the dental article.","Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are on a weight basis, all water is deionized water, and all molecular weights are weight average molecular weight.","Surface Area Determination","Surface area is related to the \u201cprimary particle size\u201d of precipitated powders. The primary particle size refers to the small, individually nucleated particles that form during precipitation. The primary particles can agglomerate to form larger particles, and might or might not be individually dispersible. The surface area (S) of uniform, spherical dense primary particles, and agglomerates or structures made from them, is approximately 3 m\/\u03c1r, where m is mass, r is the primary particle radius, \u03c1 is the density, and S\/m is the specific surface area. Therefore r=3 m\/\u03c1S.","Filler powder specific surface area (surface area per unit weight) was determined by using a Micromeritics Gemini Surface Area Analyzer and a Micromeritics Flow Prep outgassing unit (Micromeritics, Norcross, Ga.). A powder sample was weighed out then placed into a glass sample tube. The weights of both a powder sample and a glass sample tube and stopper were weighed out and recorded. The powder sample was placed into the glass sample tube, weighed, and recorded. The nitrogen flow to the probe in the outgassing unit was turned on and then gently placed to the bottom on the glass sample tube. The stopper was loosely inserted to the top of the glass sample tube and the tube was placed into the heating zone of the prep outgassing unit. The sample was then allowed to outgas for 1 hour at 250\u00b0 C. The tube was then removed from the heating zone and placed in the cooling rack to cool for 5 minutes. The stopper and probe were then removed from the glass tube. The stopper was then immediately replaced to the top of the glass tube. The tube plus stopper was then weighed and the weight subtracted from the initial weight of the glass tube and stopper only. Next-the glass tube with outgassed powder inside was placed up into the surface area analyzer. A Dewar flask was then filled with liquid nitrogen and placed into the surface area analyzer. The vacuum pump attached to the analyzer was then turned on. The Gemini control box was then used to input the powder weight, saturation pressure, evacuation rate, date, and time. The analysis was then started by pressing the enter button. Several cycles of analysis occurred and the surface area measurement was calculated by the program.","Particle Size Determination","Average Particle Size by Particle Size Analyzer: Particle size (including cluster size) distribution (based on volume percent) was determined using a Coulter LS 230 Particle Size Analyzer (Coulter Corporation, Hialeah, Fla.). The Analyzer was equipped with a Polarization Intensity Differential Scanning (PIDS) software. A 300-mg sample of filler was added into a glass vial with enough MICRO-90 surfactant (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, N.Y.) to wet all the filler. A 30-ml aliquot of Calgon Solution (made by thoroughly mixing 0.20 g sodium fluoride, 4.00 g sodium pyrophosphate, 40.00 g sodium hexametaphosphate, 8.00 g MICRO-90 surfactant, and 3948 ml of DI water) was added and the resulting mixture shaken for 15 minutes and sonicated by a probe sonicator (Model W-225 Sonicator, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Farmingdale, N.Y.) for 6 min at an output control knob setting of 9. Particle analysis was conducted using Coulter LS 230 Particle Characterization Software Version 3.01. Testing conditions were 90 seconds for Run Length, 0 seconds for Wait Length, and the test sample was added dropwise into the sample orifice until the PIDS reading was between 45% and 55%. Three sets of data per sample were averaged to obtain the average particle or cluster size.","Average Particle Size by TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy): Samples approximately 80-nm thick were placed on 200-mesh copper grids with carbon stabilized formvar substrates (SPI Supplies, a division of Structure Probe, Inc., West Chester, Pa.). A transmission electron micrograph (TEM) was taken using a JEOL 200CX Instrument (JEOL, Ltd. of Akishima, Japan and sold by JEOL USA, Inc.) at 200 Kv. A population size of about 50\u2013100 particles was measured and an average particle size was determined.","Fluoride Release Test Method","The amount of fluoride released from a filler powder sample was determined by the following procedure. Disc-shaped (1-mm thick\u00d720-mm diameter) paste samples were cured by exposing them to illumination from a VISILUX 2 curing light (3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.) for 60 seconds. The hardened disc was then weighed and added to 25 ml of DI water in a plastic vial. The vial was then placed in a 37\u00b0 C. oven for 24 hours. The vial was then taken out of the oven and 10 ml of the water solution was added to 10 ml of TISAB (Total Ionic Strength Adjustment Buffer containing DI water, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, acetic acid, and CDTA (1,2-cyclohexane diaminetetraacetic acid) (Thermo Orion, Beverly, Mass.). A magnetic stir bar was added and the solution was mixed on a stir plate. The Orion Fluoride Combination electrode model 96-09 was then standardized using Orion IonPlus standard solutions (Orion, Boston, Mass.) of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100 ppm. Once calibrated, the electrode was placed in the stirring water\/TISAB solution and the value in ppm was measured. Fluoride release was calculated considering the total amount of water initially used for a disc sample (25 ml) and the individual weight of the disc sample. This calculation resulted in units of \u03bcg F\/g and represented the average of three replicates.","Total Fluoride Content Test Method","The total amount of fluoride present in a filler powder sample was determined by the following procedure. A filler powder sample was analyzed for fluoride release as described in the above Fluoride Release Test Method, except that the sample was fully dissolved in an acetic acid solution in order to release all of the fluoride present in the sample. The results were reported as weight-percent fluoride and represented the average of three replicates.","Curing Efficiency Test Method","The Curing Efficiency of a filler powder sample was determined by the following procedure. A Test Resin was prepared by premixing and homogenizing a combination of VBCP (43 parts), HEMA (22.6 parts), and water (34.4 parts). A filler powder sample (variable amounts) was added to the Test Resin (0.5 g) and the resulting mixture was mixed with a spatula on a mixing pad until homogeneous and then formed into a disc-shaped sample approximately 2 cm in diameter and 1 mm thick using a TEFLON mold. The resulting disc sample was periodically examined and graded for extent of cure using the following scale:\n\n","Adhesive strength to enamel or dentin for a given test sample was evaluated by the following procedure.","Preparation of Teeth. For each test sample, five bovine teeth of similar age and appearance were partially embedded in circular acrylic discs. The exposed portion of each tooth was ground flat and parallel to the acrylic disc using Grade 120 silicon carbide paper-backed abrasive mounted on a lapidary wheel, in order to expose the dentin or enamel. During this and subsequent grinding and polishing steps, the teeth were continuously rinsed with water. Further grinding and polishing of the teeth was carried out by mounting Grade 600 silicon carbide paper-backed abrasive on the lapidary wheel. The polished teeth were stored in deionized water and used for testing within 2 hours after polishing. The polished teeth were removed from the water and blotted dry.","Application to Teeth: Previously made molds of 2-mm thick TEFLON sheeting with a 5-mm diameter hole were lined with a plastic ring so that the test sample (once cured) would release from them. The molds were clipped to the blotted dry teeth, prepared by grinding\/polishing previously. Paste A and Paste B test samples were weighed out and mixed together for 25 seconds to afford a mixed paste test sample that was then spatulated into the mold. Slight pressure was applied to the mixed paste test sample to insure that it was at the mold\/tooth intersection. After all the molds were filled, the samples were exposed to radiation from a XL 3000 dental curing light (3M Company) for 60 seconds. The samples were then placed in a humidity chamber set at 97% relative humidity and 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. The samples were then taken out of the chamber and the clips were removed from the assembly. The resultant tooth with the mold still attached was then placed into 37\u00b0 C. deionized water for 24 hours in an over set at 37\u00b0 C.","Adhesive Bond Strength Testing. The adhesive strength of a cured test sample was evaluated by mounting the assembly (described above) in a holder clamped in the jaws of an Instron testing machine (Instron 4505, Instron Corp. Canton, Mass.) with the polished tooth surface oriented parallel to the direction of pull. The sample molds were taken off prior to the testing. A loop of orthodontic wire (0.44-mm diameter) was placed around the button sample adjacent to the polished tooth surface. The ends of the orthodontic wire were clamped in the pulling jaw of the Instron apparatus and pulled at a crosshead speed of 5 mm\/min, thereby placing the adhesive bond in shear stress. The force in kilograms (kg) at which the bond failed was recorded, and this number was converted to a force per unit area (units of kg\/cmor MPa) using the known surface area of the button. Each reported value of adhesion to enamel or adhesion to dentin represents the average of 5 replicates.","Comprehensive Strength (CS) Test Method","Compressive strength was evaluated by first injecting a test sample into a glass tube having a 4 mm inner diameter and length of 4 cm. The ends of the glass tube were plugged with silicone plugs. The filled tubes were subjected to 0.275 megapascal (MPa) pressure for 5 minutes and irradiated with a XL 1500 curing light (3M Company) for 60 seconds. The tube samples were then placed in 37\u00b0 C. water container for 24 hours. The tubes were cut at a length of 7 mm and the samples were pushed out of the glass tubes. Compressive strength was determined according to ISO Standard 7489 using an INSTRON universal tester (Instron Corp., Canton, Mass.) operated at a crosshead speed of 1 millimeter per minute (mm\/min). Results were reported as the average of 5 replicates.","Diametral Tensile Strength (DTS) Test Method","Diametral tensile strength was measured using the above-described CS procedure, but using samples were cut to a length of 2 mm. Results were reported as the average of 5 replicates.","Flexural Strength (FS) Test Method","Flexural strength was evaluated by first injecting a test sample into a glass square tube having a 1-mm inner diameter. The square tubes were irradiated with a XL 1500 curing light (3M Company) for 30 seconds then rotated 180 degrees and irradiated for another 30 seconds. The samples were taken out of the square tubes and placed in 37\u00b0 C. water for 1 day. Flexural strength was measured using the above-described CS procedure. Results were reported as the average of 5 replicates.","Visual Opacity (MacBeth Values) Test Method","Disc-shaped (1-mm thick\u00d720-mm diameter) paste samples were cured by exposing them to illumination from a VISILUX 2 curing light (3M Company) for 60 seconds. Hardened samples were measured for direct light transmission by measuring transmission of light through the thickness of the disk using a MacBeth transmission densitometer Model TD-903 equipped with a visible light filter, available from MacBeth (MacBeth, Newburgh, N.Y.). Lower MacBeth Values indicate lower visual opacity and greater translucency of a material. The reported values are the average of 3 measurements.","Radiopacity (MacBeth Values) Test Method","The same disc shaped samples used in visual opacity measurements were used in making radiopacity measurements. A piece of x-ray film was placed on a sheet of lead which was 6.394-mm thick. Next, the sample and an aluminum step wedge were placed on top of the x-ray film. The sample, aluminum step wedge, and film were then irradiated with X-rays at 62 kV at a target film distance of 400 mm. The film was then developed using an Air Techniques Peri-Pro X-Ray film developer (Air Techniques, Hicksville, N.Y.). The developed film was then measured using a MacBeth transmission densitometer Model TD-903. The measurements were then plotted against the aluminum step measurements and calculated compared to the thickness of the each aluminum step.","Polish Retention (Toothbrush Abrasion\/Gloss) Test Method","Polish Retention: The polish retention of a hardened sample was measured by the following method. Rectangular-shaped paste samples (20-mm long\u00d79-mm wide\u00d73-mm thick) were cured with a VISILUX 2 unit for 60 seconds. The samples were mounted with double-sided adhesive tape (Scotch Brand Tape, Core series 2-1300, St. Paul, Minn.) to a holder and were polished according to the following series of steps that were performed sequentially as shown in the chart below. A Buehler ECOMET 4 Polisher with an AUTOMET 2 Polishing Head was used with clockwise rotation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0153"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Polishing Sequence of Steps"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Procedure",{},{},"Load (Kg)","Time"]},{"entry":["Step No.","(Abrasive-Grit)","Lubricant","RPM","per sample","(Seconds)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Polish (SiC-320)","Water","150","0.45","40"]},{"entry":["2","Rinse","Water"]},{"entry":["3","Polish (SiC-600)","Water","150","0.45","60"]},{"entry":["4","Rinse","Water"]},{"entry":["5","Polish (Master","Water","120","0.34","100"]},{"entry":[{},"Polish Solution)"]},{"entry":["6","Rinse","Water"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A micro-tri-gloss instrument (BYK Gardner, Columbia, Md.) was used to collect photoelectric measurements of specularly reflected light from the sample surface after polishing and after toothbrushing.

A solution of 130.5 g HEMA, 101.5 g triethylamine (TMA) and 87 g of THF was placed in the addition funnel. The flask was cooled via an ice-water-salt bath to approximately \u22125\u00b0 C. The solution was added dropwise with stirring over a period of 25 minutes during which the temperature was maintained between 0\u00b0 C. and \u22125\u00b0 C. The mixture was stirred for three hours allowing the temperature to rise to room temperature. To the flask was added an additional 200 ml of THF to facilitate stirring. To the addition funnel was added a solution of 51 g of TEA and 6.8 g water in 50 ml of THF. After cooling the flask to 0\u20135\u00b0 C. via the ice-water-salt bath, the solution was added dropwise during 16 minutes. The mixture was allowed to come to room temperature and stirred for 18 hours. The mixture was filtered to remove the precipitated salts and the THF removed in vaccuo. The product, 168 g, was a light orange liquid which was characterized by H, C and P NMR to be a mixture of mono-, di-, and tri-HEMA phosphate and tetraHEMA pyrophosphate.","Filler A (Silane-Treated Nano-Sized Silica Particles)","Silane-treated, non-aggregated, nano-sized silica particles in the form of a dry powder were prepared according to the following procedure. Nalco 2329 silica sol (400.82 g) was charged to a one-quart jar. Methoxy-2-propanol (250.28 g) and A174 (6.15 g) were mixed together and added to the silica sol with stirring for about 5 minutes. The jar was sealed and heated to 80\u00b0 C. for 16 hours. The resulting white dispersion was dried using a gap drying process according to the procedures described in U.S. Pat.

The former showed significant curing in 1\u20134 hours at only 20% loading (1:4 ratio), whereas the latter took 3 days to fully cure. Examples 16\u201318 (milled samples) were also fully cured at 3 hours. Full curing of Example 3 prepared with grinding and sieving was observed in 1 hour at the 33% loading (1:2 ratio) as compared to 1 day for Example 3 without grinding and sieving.","Hence, comparison of the data in Tables 3A and 3B shows that the precipitated acid-reactive oxyfluoride filler materials (following grinding or milling) have high curing efficiency in comparison with conventional melt processed glass fillers or oxyfluoride materials that have not been ground or milled. Therefore, it is concluded that at least some degree of dispersion is required to observe the high curing efficiency imparted by the high surface area fillers. Coarse, heat-treated granules of oxyfluoride materials exhibited curing efficiency similar to the conventional glasses. Simple grinding and sieving (150 mesh) of the coarse granules (i.e., agglomerates) significantly increased the curing efficiencies of the acid-reactive oxyfluoride filler materials. Milled acid-reactive oxyfluoride filler materials with La or Y cations (instead of Al) or with Ca cations (instead of Sr) also exhibited high curing efficiencies.","First Paste Compositions (Pastes A1\u2013A20)","Acid-reactive oxyfluoride filler material was prepared as described in Example 13.
