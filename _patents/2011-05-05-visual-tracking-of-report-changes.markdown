{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field relates to business intelligence (BI) reporting. More precisely, the field relates to visually tracking data changes in report documents.","BI refers to computer-based techniques used in identifying, extracting and analyzing business data, such as sales revenue by products and\/or departments, or by associated costs and incomes. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Common functions of BI technologies are reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, and predictive analytics. BI aims to support better business decision-making. Thus a BI system can be called a decision support system.","BI reporting is a common function used in visually presenting business data for business decision making. Typically, a report consists of data that a BI user is interested in. The data in the report is typically static, and when the BI user modifies the presented data, the updated data is presented in a new page without keeping track of the previous state of the data. Thus, by performing actions on the data such as \u201csort\u201d, \u201cexpand\u201d, \u201ccollapse\u201d, etc., the updated report data is typically given in a new screen without a transition state. A transition state might help the BI user in tracking what changes to the data has been done. There is a need for visually tracking the data changes in report documents.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for visual tracking of report changes are described herein. In one embodiment, the method includes receiving a user interaction for modification of at least one report element in a report document and classifying the modification of the at least one report element. The method also includes identifying a visual effect based on the classified modification of the at least one report element and updating the report document by applying the identified visual effect together with the modification of the at least one report element.","In other embodiments, the system includes at least one processor for executing program code and memory, a report document, and an input device to receive user interaction for modification of at least one report element in the report document. The system also includes a classification module to classify the modification of the at least one report element and an identification module to identify a visual effect based on the classified modification of the at least one report element. The system further includes a display to show updates on the report document by applying the identified visual effect together with the modification of the at least one report element.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for visual tracking of report changes are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","105","120","125","130","135","125","145","140","150","140","130","150","175","135"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","140","150"]},"Turning back to , at block , the modification of the element of the report document is classified. In one embodiment, the classification is performed by receiving a unique identifier of the modified element in the report document, matching the unique identifier with the user action for modification of the report element, and identifying a class based on the unique identifier and the user interaction for modification.","In one embodiment, a unique identifier (ID) is generated for each cell in a report document. This unique ID identifies the cell value together with the structural coordinates of the table that determines this value. Such unique ID identifies precisely the content (value) of the cell and the path to it (structural coordinates). Whatever the user interaction for modification is (e.g. refresh, filter, sort, etc), the unique ID will point to the same value if the value still exists. In one embodiment, the unique ID consists of report ID, report element ID, and complete path to the value. The complete path to the value may be defined, for example, by data provider object identifiers and their values.","Referring again to , at block , a visual effect based on the classified modification of the report element is identified. In one embodiment, a visual effect is automatically selected from a set of predefined visual effects. Such visual effects may be motions such as flying away or flying in, fading effects, and the like. Thus the user is given the opportunity to track the changes being performed to the elements of the report document. In one embodiment, the automatic selection of the visual effect is performed by following a rule set. In one embodiment, the rule set may be arranged as a table. In one embodiment, the table may be one such as the exemplary table presented in . When a class  is defined for the modification, a certain visual effect  is selected.","The method further continues at block  by updating the report document by applying the identified visual effect together with the modification of the at least one report element. Thus, a user is able to track the changes in the report document by visualizing the exact elements being changed.","In one embodiment the modifications to the report document are recorded so that they may be reproduced at a later stage. The reproduction may also include the visual effects identified based on the modifications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","310","300","350","320"]},"A report document  is in communication with the memory  and consists of BI data. An input device  is connected to the system . The input device  is intended to receive user interaction for modification of elements in the report document . In one embodiment, the input device  is a pointing input device. In yet another embodiment, the pointing input device is a mouse, a touch pad or a touch screen. In one embodiment, the input device  is a keyboard or a touch screen display providing opportunity for typing.","The memory  also includes a classification module  and an identification module . The classification module is intended to classify the modification of the elements, the modification received by the input device . In one embodiment, the classification module  receives a unique identifier of each report element being modified and matches the unique identifier with the user interaction for modification of the report element. Then, the classification module  identifies a class based on the unique identifier and the user interaction for modification.","The identification module  is intended to identify a visual effect based on the classified modification of the report elements. In one embodiment, the identification module  is operable to automatically select the visual effect from a set of predefined visual effects. In one embodiment the set of predefined visual effects are persisted in the repository . In yet another embodiment, the identification module  selects a visual effect from a set of predefined visual effects by following a rule set.","The system  further includes a display  to show updates on the report document  by applying the identified visual effect together with the modification of the report elements.","In one embodiment, a tracker module  is also present in the memory , the tracker module intended to record the modifications to the report document  so that the recorded modifications to be available for reproducing on the display .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","420","430","440","410","420","430","430","410","420","440","430"]},"For example, for a report element being modified, a report element ID  is received, such as report element ID . For this report element, the modifications delete , expand , and collapse  are allowed. The combination of report element ID , and a modification , defines a class . It is possible to make different modifications to one report element and to define the same or different class. For example the modification delete  and collapse  for the report element having ID  is in both cases class 1A . The modifications delete  and collapse  for report element having ID  are different being 3A  and 1A  correspondingly.","By having a class  identified, a visual effect  is also identified following the table . In an embodiment as presented in , each type of class  corresponds to exact type of visual effect . For example, class 1A  corresponds always to the fade out effect . In one embodiment, the data in the rule set table  is customizable according to the BI needs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","510","520"]},"The opposite effect may be used for data that is going to appear in a newer state of the report. In such case data that is initially invisible, appears as faded data as presented in screenshot  and then eventually becomes at the state given in screenshot . This effect is known as fade in effect.","Some embodiments of the invention may include other techniques for visual tracking of modified report data such as adjusting font size, font thickness, brightness, color, and contrast of the modified report data. In one embodiment, decreasing the font size or the font thickness gradually till disappearance of the modified data is used for tracking report data that is removed. Gradually increasing the font size or the font thickness is used for novel data appearing in a report. In another embodiment, a visual effect for appearance or disappearance of modified report data is achieved by adjusting hue, saturation, or brightness of the color of the modified report data.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions.
