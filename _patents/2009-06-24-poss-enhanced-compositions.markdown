The application of nanotechnology has enabled expansion of the end-use envelope of many organic materials. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) has proven to be a remarkably effective class of additive nanoparticles due to their inherent size, shape, rigidity, and versatility in functionality. The ability to chemically tailor POSS through synthetic control of its organic periphery offers a unique design tool for controlling particle dispersion in host materials.","However, current commercially available POSS compounds, such as POSS-dianilines either contain thermally labile aliphatic groups or excessive amine functionality. For example, octa-aminophenyl POSS is the only purely aromatic version but contains eight reactive groups which can be detrimental to polymer performance due to excessive cross-linking, thereby inhibiting assembly.","Accordingly, there is need and market for a suitable POSS composition which can overcome the above prior art shortcomings.","There has now been developed a new form of POSS dianilines, which can be reactively incorporated into polyimides, polyamides, cyanate esters, and epoxies for enhanced performance thereof as described below.","Broadly, the present invention provides a method comprising, the synthesis and application of novel high temperature POSS-dianiline monomers, namely heptaphenylbis(aminophenyl)methylsiloxy POSS, which can be reactively incorporated into polyimides and epoxies for enhanced performance.","By nanoparticles, as used herein, is meant those of a size of 1 micron or less, i.e., 1000 nanometers down to 1 nanometer. For example, a POSS cage is considered to be about 1.5 nanometers wide.","By POSS-dianiline monomer(s), as used herein, is meant such monomers having para or meta amino substituents.","Referring to the present invention in detail, the inventive POSS-dianiline monomers are made by following synthesis:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"143.26mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08058380-20111115-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The invention further provides the POSS-dianiline MONOMER B as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"41.23mm","wi":"49.53mm","file":"US08058380-20111115-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The invention also provides MONOMER A (same as above but having para NHs) and method therefor, similar to the above method","The invention also provides a method for incorporating POSS-dianiline monomer, having para or meta amino substituents into polymeric Kapton\u00ae comprising:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"144.86mm","wi":"158.41mm","file":"US08058380-20111115-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In like manner, the invention further provides a method for reactively incorporating POSS-dianiline monomer into polyimides, polyamides, cyanate esters, and epoxies to enhance the properties of same.","The invention thus describes the synthesis and subsequent application of novel polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane dianilines, namely heptaphenylbis(aminophenyl)methylsiloxy POSS, through a relatively cost-effective manufacturing method, where the amine groups can be placed in the meta or para positions.

From the viewpoint of chemical architecture, heptaphenylbis(aminophenyl)methylsiloxy POSS features a T8 silsesquioxane cage surrounded by seven aromatic groups and a dianiline moeity that equips the molecule for facile attachment to host systems that accept amines through chemical reaction, such as polyimides through linear copolymerization and epoxies where the dianiline can act as a crosslinking agent.
