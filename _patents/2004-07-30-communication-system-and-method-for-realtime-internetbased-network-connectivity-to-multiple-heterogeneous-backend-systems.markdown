{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to the field of network communication of information. In particular, the present invention is directed to a communication system and method for real-time Internet-based network connectivity to multiple heterogeneous backend systems.","The healthcare software market has traditionally been dominated by large, complex, workflow-based applications that help healthcare employees perform their jobs in a more efficient manner. These applications are very good at providing services to the internal staff at the organization that purchased\/installed them. However, they are less successful at providing services to people indirectly affiliated with the organization\u2014examples are patients or satellite clinicians who refer in to the large organizations. The applications are simply too complex to provide strong benefit to these affiliated users, who just need high-level or overview information.","With the advent of the Internet, vendors began to see the opportunity to provide applications to reach out to these affiliated users. Web-based products can sit on top of the large core applications, and provide a simpler user interface which has more value to the end user. Vendors connected their web application and their core application, and were able to bring the web applications to market.","As these Internet applications began hitting the market, a new problem emerged. Most healthcare organizations deploy clinical\/administrative systems from more than one vendor (best-of-breed approach). As the vendors created their Internet applications, customers found that they would have to deploy separate web-based applications to gain access to data across the enterprise. The affiliated users would have to log into to separate applications to view related data. This clearly was not ideal, and demand rose for a web-based product that would provide a single view over all the data in the enterprise, no matter where it resided.","Vendors attempted to tackle this problem via the use of interfaces. In these interfaces, the web application would not communicate with the large core applications directly. Instead, the web application communicated directly with a duplicated database under its control. That duplicated database was fed information from the core applications via interfaces. This approach allowed the web application to display information from multiple sources, providing the single view that the affiliated users were looking for. However, there are problems with this approach, such as the interfaces are typically non-trivial to maintain\u2014there are support\/implementation costs, as well as personnel costs; the web-application-owned database now has a copy of data from other systems with elaborate efforts being made to ensure that the duplicated data is up-to-date, and does not age. For example, if a change is made to data in the core product, that change needs to be uploaded into the web-owned database. Otherwise, users of the web application will view inaccurate data\u2014a critical problem in the healthcare industry. Additionally, the duplicated database typically runs on a less reliable system than that of backend systems and uses a higher level code, that is generally less efficient than the operating system level code of backend systems, for maintaining the duplication of data.","HIPAA regulations govern privacy and security of patient-related healthcare information. All applications displaying such information need to make sure that infrastructure is in place to comply with HIPAA regulations. Since the web application has a database of healthcare data, that application needs to build even more infrastructure to handle the security of that database. The vendor may have to replicate security that already exists in their core application.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a communication system for connecting in real-time an Internet-based network interface to a plurality of backend systems, each of the plurality of backend systems having an associated backend communications protocol and requiring an associated backend data format. The system includes a router for receiving a job having a front-end data format and a front-end communications protocol from the Internet-based network interface.

The system also includes a plurality of service agents, each in communication with an associated one of the plurality of backend systems and configured to translate the job prior to delivery to the one or more backend systems.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a communication system is provided for connecting in real-time an Internet-based network interface to a plurality of backend systems, each of the plurality of backend systems having an associated backend communications protocol and requiring an associated backend data format. The system includes a router for receiving a job having a front-end data format and a front-end communications protocol from the Internet-based network interface, wherein the router selects one or more backend systems from the plurality of backend systems as a function of attributes of the job for delivery of the job to the one or more backend systems; and a plurality of service agents, each of which is associated with a respective one of the plurality of backend systems, wherein each of the plurality of service agents being configured (1) to translate the job received from the router from the front-end data format to the associated backend data format, (2) to translate the job from the front-end communications protocol to the associated backend communications protocol, (3) to communicate the job to the associated one of the plurality of backend systems, (4) to receive a response from the associated one of the plurality of backend systems, (5) to translate the response from the associated backend communications protocol to the front-end communications protocol, (6) to translate the response from the associated backend data format to the front-end data format, and (7) to communicate a translated response to the Internet-based network interface.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a communication system is provided for connecting in real-time an Internet-based network interface to a first backend system having a first backend communications protocol and requiring a first backend data format and a second backend system having a second backend communications protocol and requiring a second backend data format.

The system includes means for receiving a job having a front-end communications protocol and a front-end data format from the Internet-based network interface; means for selecting one or more backend systems from the plurality of backend systems as a function of attributes of the job for delivery of the job to the one or more backend systems; means for delivering the job to each of the one or more backend systems in the associated backend communications protocol and associated backend data format for each of the one or more backend systems; means for translating a response from each of the one or more backend systems from the associated backend communications protocol to the front-end communications protocol and from the associated backend data format to the front-end data format; and means for delivering a translated response to the Internet-based network interface.","Referring to , in one embodiment, the present invention provides a system  for connecting in real-time an Internet-based network interface to a plurality of backend systems.  illustrates in an appropriate computing environment in which system , and its communication system  may be used. Communication system  is discussed further in detail in , with examples of specific implementations in  and .","System  includes a router  in communication with a plurality of service agents , , and . System  can include one or more helper objects  and one or more format translation objects , each of which can communicate with the plurality of service agents , , and . As discussed further below, router  receives a job  from an Internet-based network interface . Typically, job  includes information input via a graphical user interface  in communication with an Internet-based network . The information is related to, and is intended for communication with, one or more of a plurality of backend systems . Each of plurality of backend systems  is associated with one of plurality of service agents , , and . This association is typically predefined at the time of configuring system . Examples of information contained in a job  according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, data for entry in one or more of a plurality of backend systems  and a query for information stored in one or more of a plurality of backend systems .","Router  selects one or more of said plurality of backend systems  to which to communicate job . Router  makes this selection based on attributes of job  and the information contained therein. The attributes of job  typically include information that indicates, when referenced against configuration information, which of backend systems  are implicated by job , for example which of backend systems  have data being requested by job . Router  then communicates job  to each of those service agents , , and  that are associated with the selected backend systems  for translation, reformatting, and communication to such backend systems. Each of the selected backend systems  processes job  and communicates a response  to the appropriate service agents , , and  for translation, reformatting, and communication to Internet-based network interface . Internet-based network interface  typically communicates response  to graphical user interface  for display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["114","116","118","136"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","110","150","150","152","154","110","154","150","136"]},"Backend systems  typically reside in memory of a server having a processor. An example of backend systems  include, but are not limited to, a database. When backend system  is a database, the backend system typically includes information, such as data. It is contemplated that an individual backend system  or multiple backend systems may reside on a single server, although multiple servers may be used in certain distributed computing environments. A single application programming interface (API) is typically used to communicate with each backend system .","Referring again to , Internet-based network interface  is executed by server . Server  typically includes a processor  and memory . Internet-based network interface  resides in memory . The example shown in  illustrates system  and Internet-based network interface  on different servers. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that system  and Internet-based network interface  can reside on one server. Server  is in communication with Internet-based network . Internet-based network  is generally a global communication network, such as the Internet and its predecessors, or a network that includes a segment of a global communication network.","Graphical user interface  is typically displayed on a display device  of a computing device  using a browser object , such as a web browser. Computing device  typically includes processor ; memory , in which browser object  resides; input device , such as a keyboard and\/or a pointing device; and display controller . Examples of computing devices that are contemplated to display information from the system of the present invention include, but are not limited to, a personal computer, a terminal, a thin-client device, a personal data assistant (PDA), a mobile communication device, kiosks, appliances, and any combinations thereof.","Typically, Internet-based network interface , system , and backend systems  reside within a facility, such as a healthcare facility. The Internet-based network interface  in one example connects to the Internet. Remote users, such as clients and remote care providers, can connect to the various backend systems  using a browser object , such as a web browser. Typically, a healthcare facility will have one or more clinical backend systems  and one or more administrative backend systems (often from different vendors) that a particular remote user will have a need to access.","System  provides several benefits. System  allows the remote user to communicate using one interface , a web interface for example, with multiple types of healthcare information technology systems (e.g. clinical and administrative) having heterogeneous data formats that communicate with external systems using different protocols. The communication is in real-time without the creation of an intermediate database and duplicated data that can be inaccurate. Real-time describes an application that requires a process to respond to inputs while the application waits for the result. Typically, the process involves retrieval or filing of data. In this case, interface  makes a request or posts information through system  directly to one or more of backend systems  while the interface  waits for the result . Any changes made to the active databases of a backend system are instantaneously available to the remote user. The response time should be on the order of about 2 seconds or less, although somewhat longer response times fall within the meaning of \u201creal time.\u201d System  of the present invention connects to one or more actual backend systems  in real time. In one aspect, this real time communication occurs without the use of an intermediate database that replicates information from the backend systems for the purpose of providing that information through the replicated database to users via an Internet interface. System  also permits a user to instigate repeated real-time jobs accessing information on different backend systems  and display the information using the same user interface . The security of any data is provided by and maintained by each of the backend systems , eliminating any intermediate management of security provisions.","Referring now to , in one embodiment of the present invention, a communication system  for connecting in real-time an Internet-based network interface  to a plurality of backend systems  is illustrated. System  is a more detailed depiction of system . Each of the plurality of backend systems  has an associated backend communications protocol  and requires an associated backend data format . System  includes a router  and a plurality of service agents . Examples of backend communications protocols  used by typical backend systems  include, but are not limited to, simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based web service, HTTP-based, ACTIVE-X data objects (ADO), open database connectivity (ODBC), and Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP).","Backend data formats  vary greatly from backend system  to backend system . For example, each backend system  may arrange information in different orders, require queries in a certain format, and\/or label fields in which data is stored with different terms. These variances exist within products from the same vendor, but are exacerbated when products are from different vendors. Although, backend data formats  are complexly varied, each may be based on a common underlying structure, such as extensible markup language (XML)-based formats, onto which the complexity or propriety is built.","Referring again to , router  receives a job  having a front-end communications protocol  and a front-end data format  from the Internet-based network interface . Router  selects one or more of the plurality of backend systems  as a function of attributes of job . Typically, router  includes routing table  for selecting which of plurality of backend systems  are implicated by the attributes of the information included in job . Routing table  typically includes a table of information relating certain types of information that job  may include to the particular information included in each of backend systems , and provides the relationship that allows the router to direct job  to the appropriate backend system . Such attributes of job  indicate which of the plurality of backend systems  should be communicated job  for execution. In one example, router table  categorizes job attributes, and links the categories to service agents  that can handle those jobs (set up during configuration). When a job, such as sob , is submitted to router , the attributes are compared to table  to determine the category, which will in turn reveal the list of appropriate service agents . Router  then forwards the job on to the one or more service agents .","As stated above, job  can include, for example, information such as data for entry in one or more of the plurality of backend systems  or a query for response information from one or more of the plurality of the backend systems . If, for example, job  includes a query for a certain type of clinical information, router  may use routing table  to determine which of plurality of backend systems  have that certain type of clinical information.","The front-end communications protocol  according to the present invention is typically hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP). Front-end communications protocol  may be other standard front-end communication protocols including, but not limited to, HTTP, component object model (COM), and .NET.","The front-end data format  according to the present invention is generally one that supports information being entered by a user and the display of response information, such that the response information can be displayed through the Internet-based network interface , for example using a browser object , to the user. Front-end data format  is typically a standard data format, although proprietary formats may be used in some applications. Examples of standard data formats for use as a front-end data format  include, but are not limited to, XML-based format, such as HL-7 standard; delimited strings, and position-based strings.","Each of backend systems  is associated with at least one of the plurality of service agents . For example, in , service agents , , , , , and are each associated with, respectively, backend systems , , , , , and . Service agent is also associated with backend system . The association of a service agent  with a backend system  typically occurs during the configuration of system  and is part of configuration files in router . Each of service agents  can communicate with router  and can translate a particular job, such as job , received from router  from front-end data format  to the associated backend data format  of the backend system associated with the individual service agent. The translation occurs using methods that are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. An example of a translation mechanism for handling transforms includes, but is not limited to, extensible stylesheet language transformations (XSLT). Configuration of translation mechanisms, such as XSLT can occur during the configuration of the system .","In one aspect, system  can also include a format translation object  in communication with plurality of service agents . Format translation object  includes computer-executable code, often in the form of a module, configured to assist a particular one of service agents  in translating to and from the associated backend data format  of a particular backend system . A format translation object  can be separate from service agents  or can be included in a particular one of service agents . For example, service agents and include format translation objects and , respectively. Although, format translation objects  according the present invention are generally used for both to and from translation, it is contemplated that a separate format translation object would be used for translation to a particular backend data format  and another format translation object would be used for translation from that particular backend data format.","Example system  includes format translation objects , , and separate from backend systems . It should be noted that a system according to the present invention can have any number of format translation objects . A person of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the appropriate number of format translation objects  required for a particular system based on the number of known and\/or required backend data formats . It should also be noted that a particular format translation object  may also be utilized by more than one service agent . For example, in , service agents  and  each utilize format translation object . This situation may possibly arise where two or more backend systems , in this example backend systems , , and , have identical required backend data formats .","Each of service agents  can also translate a job, such as job , from front-end communications protocol  to the associated backend communications protocol  of the backend system  associated with the individual service agent. In another aspect, system  can also include a helper objects  in communication with plurality of service agents . Helper objects  includes computer-executable code, often in the form of a module, configured to assist a particular one of plurality of service agents  in translating to and from the associated backend communications protocol  of a particular backend system. Helper objects  assist in translation by having code that knows exactly how to communicate on a certain protocol. Helper objects  can remain available for use by any service agent . Helper object  assists service agent  by serving as a communication \u201cproxy\u201d for service agent . Instead of service agent  implementing code to talk on the necessary protocol, the service agent simply invokes helper object , which knows how to talk on the protocol inherently. A helper object  can be separate from plurality of service agents  or can be included in a particular one or plurality of service agents . For example, service agents , , and include helper objects , , and , respectively.","Example system  also illustrates helper objects , , and . It should be noted that a system according to the present invention can have any number of helper objects. A person of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the appropriate number of helper objects required for a particular system based on the number of known and\/or required backend communications protocols. It should also be noted that a particular helper object may also be utilized by more than one service agent. This situation may possibly arise where two or more backend systems have identical required backend communications protocols. Although, helper objects according the present invention are generally used for both to and from translation, it is contemplated that a separate helper object would be used for translation to a particular backend communications protocol and another helper object would be used for translation from that particular backend communications protocol.","With continuing reference to , each of plurality of service agents  can also communicate a translated job, such as translated job  to the associated one of plurality of backend systems  and receive a response, for example response  having associated backend communications protocol  and associated backend data format , from the associated one of the plurality of backend systems . Each of plurality of service agents  can also translate a response, such as response , from the associated backend communications protocol  to the front-end communications protocol , and translate a response, such as response , from the associated backend communications protocol to said front-end communications protocol. Each of plurality of service agents  can utilize communication with a helper object  and\/or a format translation object , as discussed above to assist with such translation. Further, each of plurality of service agents  can communicate a translated response  to Internet-based network interface . In one aspect, the communication of translated response  may occur directly from each of plurality of service agents  to Internet-based network interface . In another aspect, the communication of translated response  from each of plurality of service agents  to Internet-based network interface  may occur as a passive pass through of router . In still another aspect, translated response  may be communicated from Internet-based network interface  to browser object , such as an Internet web browser. In yet another aspect, translated response  may be communicated by browser object  in the form of graphical user interface .","In a further aspect, job  may include information that is related to two or more of plurality of backend systems , such that router  communicates job  to two or more of plurality of service agents . In such a case, a plurality of translated responses (such as a first translated response  and a second translated response ) may be produced by plurality of service agents . Thus, system  may include a merger object  configured to receive translated result  from plurality of service agents , to merge first translated response  from a first of plurality of backend systems  with a second translated response  from a second of plurality of backend systems into a combined response  prior to communicating first response  and second response  to Internet-based network interface , and to communicate combined response  to Internet-based network interface . Merger object  may include computer executable instructions for merging a plurality of responses into a combined response. Such computer executable instructions for merging are well known to persons skilled in the art. Merger object  uses processes that are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art to merge two or more responses into a combined response . In one example, two or more XML responses are merged into a single XML stream using XSLT and specialized object code.","Each of the plurality of service agents, helper objects, format translation objects, and router are configurable to provide information related to each of the plurality of backend servers that are used at a particular facility.","Operation of system  is described below in connection with the flow diagram of  First, at step , a job  having a front-end communications protocol  and a front-end data format  from the Internet-based network interface  is received. In one example, the job is received by a router, such as router . Then, at step , one or more backend systems are selected as a function of attributes of the job from the plurality of backend systems for delivery of the job to the one or more backend systems. In one example, the selecting of step  is performed by a router, such as router , using a routing table, such as routing table . Next, at step , the job is delivered to each of the one or more backend systems in the associated backend communications protocol and associated backend data format for each of the one or more backend systems. In one aspect, the job is delivered by one of a plurality of service agents, (such as plurality of service agents ), which translate, as discussed above, the front-end communications protocol to the associated backend protocol and translate the front-end data format to the associated backend data format prior to delivering to the associated one or more backend systems. Then, at step , a response (such as response ) from each of the one or more backend systems is translated, for example by one of the plurality of service agents, from the associated backend communications protocol to the front-end communications protocol and from the associated backend data format to the front-end data format. Next, at , if only one translated response (such as translated response ) is generated it is delivered in step , for example by one of the plurality of service agents, to the Internet-based network interface. In one aspect, step  may be implemented prior to delivering the translated response to the Internet-based network interface when two or more backend systems each produce a response. In step , a first translated response from a first of the one or more backend systems is merged (for example, by a merger object, such as merger object ) with a second translated response from a second of said one or more backend systems into a combined response (such as combined response ).","Turning now to , one example of the application of the system of  and method of the present invention is provided. A job  is input by a remote user via graphical user interface  and browser object , and communicated to Internet-based network interface .

Turning now to , graphical user interface  includes a first portion  showing first information  from a first one of the plurality of backend systems and a second portion  showing second information  from a second one of the plurality of backend systems.  also illustrates a third portion  showing merged information  merged from a fourth-information  from a fourth one of the plurality of backend systems and a fifth information  from a fifth one of the plurality of backend systems. In another aspect, graphical user interface  is displayed using a browser object, such as browser object .","Turning now to , one example of a graphical user interface  according to the present invention is provided. Graphical user interface  is displayed using a browser object , in this case the web browser INTERNET EXPLORER available from MICROSOFT. Graphical user interface  includes a first portion  displaying a first menu information  and a second portion  displaying a second menu information , each for example representing information about a given patient \u201cDebra Dollars\u201d . First menu information  is communicated to graphical user interface  via an Internet-based network interface (in this case IDX Systems Corporation's PATIENT ONLINE system) from a first backend system dedicated to administrative information of a healthcare facility (in this case IDX Systems Corporation's FLOWCAST system). Second menu information  is communicated to graphical user interface via the same Internet-based network interface from second backend system dedicated to clinical information of the same healthcare facility. First backend system and second backend system have different communications protocols and require different data formats.","A user of graphical user interface  who is remote from the healthcare facility can access information from each of first and second backend systems in real-time. For example, if a user were to select the \u201cAppointments\u201d information item from first portion , a job (such as job ) will be communicated to a system according to the present invention (such as system ), a response (such as response ) will be returned in real-time from one or more administrative backend systems (in this case the FLOWCAST system) through the Internet-based network interface, and graphical user interface  in  would be displayed. Graphical user interface  includes a first portion  having future appointment information  and a second portion  having past appointment information , each for patient , \u201cDebra Dollars.\u201d","Referring again to , in another example, if a user were to select the \u201cMedications\u201d information item from second portion  a job will be communicated to the system, a response will be returned in real-time from one or more clinical backend systems through the Internet-based network interface, and graphical user interface  in  would be displayed. Graphical user interface  includes first portion  having medication information  for patient , \u201cDebra Dollars.\u201d","Although the invention has been described and illustrated with respect to [an] exemplary embodiment[s] thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and additions may be made therein and thereto, without parting from the spirit and scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For the purpose of illustrating the invention, the drawings show a form of the invention that is presently preferred.
