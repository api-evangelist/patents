title: Cysteine engineered antibodies and conjugates
abstract: Antibodies are engineered by replacing one or more amino acids of a parent antibody with non cross-linked, highly reactive cysteine amino acids. Antibody fragments may also be engineered with one or more cysteine amino acids to form cysteine engineered antibody fragments (ThioFab). Methods of design, preparation, screening, and selection of the cysteine engineered antibodies are provided. Cysteine engineered antibodies (Ab), optionally with an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) sequence, are conjugated with one or more drug moieties (D) through a linker (L) to form cysteine engineered antibody-drug conjugates having Formula I:

Ab-(L-D)  I

where p is 1 to 4. Diagnostic and therapeutic uses for cysteine engineered antibody drug compounds and compositions are disclosed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 11\/233,258 filed on Sep. 22, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541 issued Apr. 21, 2009, and also claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/612,468 filed on Sep. 23, 2004 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/696,353 filed on Jun. 30, 2005, each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates generally to antibodies engineered with reactive cysteine residues and more specifically to antibodies with therapeutic or diagnostic applications. The cysteine engineered antibodies may be conjugated with chemotherapeutic drugs, toxins, affinity ligands such as biotin, and detection labels such as fluorophores. The invention also relates to methods of using antibodies and antibody-drug conjugate compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer, immunological and angiogenic disorders. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy with antibodies, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of cancer cells as compared to normal, non-cancerous cell(s). The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides, i.e. tumor associated antigens (TAA), has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies.","The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), i.e. immunoconjugates, for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Lambert, J. (2005) Curr. Opinion in Pharmacology 5:543-549; Wu et al (2005) Nature Biotechnology 23(9):1137-1146; Payne, G. (2003) Cancer Cell 3:207-212; Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278) theoretically allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) \u201cAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\u201d in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as drug-linking and drug-releasing properties (Lambert, J. (2005) Curr. Opinion in Pharmacology 5:543-549. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) J. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.","An antibody-radioisotope conjugate has been approved. ZEVALIN\u00ae (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen\/Idec) is composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and In or Y radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN\u00ae has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG\u2122 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,079,233; 5,585,089; 5,606,040; 5,693,762; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1 (Xie et al (2004) J. of Pharm. and Exp. Ther. 308(3):1073-1082), is advancing into Phase TI trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors.","The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin (WO 02\/088172), have been conjugated to: (i) chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas); (ii) cAC10 which is specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies (Klussman, et al (2004), Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4):765-773; Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784; Francisco et al (2003) Blood 102(4):1458-1465; US 2004\/0018194; (iii) anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituxan (WO 04\/032828) for the treatment of CD20-expressing cancers and immune disorders; (iv) anti-EphB2R antibodies 2H9 and anti-IL-8 for treatment of colorectal cancer (Mao et al (2004) Cancer Research 64(3):781-788); (v) E-selectin antibody (Bhaskar et al (2003) Cancer Res. 63:6387-6394); and (vi) other anti-CD30 antibodies (WO 03\/043583). Variants of auristatin E are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,237 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,431. Monomethyl auristatin E conjugated to monoclonal antibodies are disclosed in Senter et al, Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research, Volume 45, Abstract Number 623, presented Mar. 28, 2004. Auristatin analogs MMAE and MMAF have been conjugated to various antibodies (WO 2005\/081711).","Conventional means of attaching, i.e. linking through covalent bonds, a drug moiety to an antibody generally leads to a heterogeneous mixture of molecules where the drug moieties are attached at a number of sites on the antibody. For example, cytotoxic drugs have typically been conjugated to antibodies through the often-numerous lysine residues of an antibody, generating a heterogeneous antibody-drug conjugate mixture. Depending on reaction conditions, the heterogeneous mixture typically contains a distribution of antibodies with from 0 to about 8, or more, attached drug moieties. In addition, within each subgroup of conjugates with a particular integer ratio of drug moieties to antibody, is a potentially heterogeneous mixture where the drug moiety is attached at various sites on the antibody. Analytical and preparative methods are inadequate to separate and characterize the antibody-drug conjugate species molecules within the heterogeneous mixture resulting from a conjugation reaction. Antibodies are large, complex and structurally diverse biomolecules, often with many reactive functional groups. Their reactivities with linker reagents and drug-linker intermediates are dependent on factors such as pH, concentration, salt concentration, and co-solvents. Furthermore, the multistep conjugation process may be nonreproducible due to difficulties in controlling the reaction conditions and characterizing reactants and intermediates.","Cysteine thiols are reactive at neutral pH, unlike most amines which are protonated and less nucleophilic near pH 7. Since free thiol (RSH, sulfhydryl) groups are relatively reactive, proteins with cysteine residues often exist in their oxidized form as disulfide-linked oligomers or have internally bridged disulfide groups. Extracellular proteins generally do not have free thiols (Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London, at page 55). The amount of free thiol in a protein may be estimated by the standard Ellman's assay. Immunoglobulin M is an example of a disulfide-linked pentamer, while immunoglobulin G is an example of a protein with internal disulfide bridges bonding the subunits together. In proteins such as this, reduction of the disulfide bonds with a reagent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or selenol (Singh et al (2002) Anal. Biochem. 304:147-156) is required to generate the reactive free thiol. This approach may result in loss of antibody tertiary structure and antigen binding specificity.","Antibody cysteine thiol groups are generally more reactive, i.e. more nucleophilic, towards electrophilic conjugation reagents than antibody amine or hydroxyl groups. Cysteine residues have been introduced into proteins by genetic engineering techniques to form covalent attachments to ligands or to form new intramolecular disulfide bonds (Better et al (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269(13):9644-9650; Bernhard et al (1994) Bioconjugate Chem. 5:126-132; Greenwood et al (1994) Therapeutic Immunology 1:247-255; Tu et al (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:4862-4867; Kanno et al (2000) J. of Biotechnology, 76:207-214; Chmura et al (2001) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 98(15):8480-8484; U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,564). However, designing in cysteine thiol groups by the mutation of various amino acid residues of a protein to cysteine amino acids is potentially problematic, particularly in the case of unpaired (free Cys) residues or those which are relatively accessible for reaction or oxidation. In concentrated solutions of the protein, whether in the periplasm of , culture supernatants, or partially or completely purified protein, unpaired Cys residues on the surface of the protein can pair and oxidize to form intermolecular disulfides, and hence protein dimers or multimers. Disulfide dimer formation renders the new Cys unreactive for conjugation to a drug, ligand, or other label. Furthermore, if the protein oxidatively forms an intramolecular disulfide bond between the newly engineered Cys and an existing Cys residue, both Cys groups are unavailable for active site participation and interactions. Furthermore, the protein may be rendered inactive or non-specific, by misfolding or loss of tertiary structure (Zhang et al (2002) Anal. Biochem. 311:1-9).","The compounds of the invention include cysteine engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of a parent antibody are replaced with a free cysteine amino acid. A cysteine engineered antibody comprises one or more free cysteine amino acids having a thiol reactivity value in the range of 0.6 to 1.0. A free cysteine amino acid is a cysteine residue which has been engineered into the parent antibody and is not part of a disulfide bridge.","In one aspect, the cysteine engineered antibody is prepared by a process comprising:\n\n","The cysteine engineered antibody may be more reactive than the parent antibody with the thiol-reactive reagent.","The free cysteine amino acid residues may be located in the heavy or light chains, or in the constant or variable domains. Antibody fragments, e.g. Fab, may also be engineered with one or more cysteine amino acids replacing amino acids of the antibody fragment, to form cysteine engineered antibody fragments.","Another aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing (making) a cysteine engineered antibody, comprising:\n\n","wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is more reactive than the parent antibody with the thiol-reactive reagent.","Step (a) of the method of preparing a cysteine engineered antibody may comprise:\n\n","Step (b) of the method of preparing a cysteine engineered antibody may comprise expressing the cysteine engineered antibody on a viral particle selected from a phage or a phagemid particle.","Step (b) of the method of preparing a cysteine engineered antibody may also comprise:\n\n","Another aspect of the invention is a method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies with highly reactive, unpaired cysteine amino acids for thiol reactivity comprising:\n\n","Step (a) of the method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies may comprise:\n\n","Step (b) of the method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies may comprise expressing the cysteine engineered antibody on a viral particle selected from a phage or a phagemid particle.","Step (b) of the method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies may also comprise:\n\n","Cysteine engineered antibodies may be useful in the treatment of cancer and include antibodies specific for cell surface and transmembrane receptors, and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such antibodies may be used as naked antibodies (unconjugated to a drug or label moiety) or as Formula I antibody-drug conjugates (ADC).","Embodiments of the methods for preparing and screening a cysteine engineered antibody include where the parent antibody is an antibody fragment, such as hu4D5Fabv8. The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide sequence (ABP). The parent antibody may also be a humanized antibody selected from huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (trastuzumab).","Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be site-specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol-reactive reagent. The thiol-reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent, a capture label reagent, a fluorophore reagent, or a drug-linker intermediate.","The cysteine engineered antibody may be labeled with a detectable label, immobilized on a solid phase support and\/or conjugated with a drug moiety.","Another aspect of the invention is an antibody-drug conjugate compound comprising a cysteine engineered antibody (Ab), and a drug moiety (D) wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is attached through one or more free cysteine amino acids by a linker moiety (L) to D; the compound having Formula I:\n\nAb-(L-D)\u2003\u2003I\n\nwhere p is 1, 2, 3, or 4; and wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is prepared by a process comprising replacing one or more amino acid residues of a parent antibody by one or more free cysteine amino acids.

While the invention will be described in conjunction with the enumerated embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.","One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described.","Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs, and are consistent with: Singleton et al (1994) Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed., J. Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y.; and Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immunobiology, 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York.","Unless stated otherwise, the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings:","When trade names are used herein, applicants intend to independently include the trade name product formulation, the generic drug, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) of the trade name product.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) Jour. of Immunology 170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immuno Biology, 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin disclosed herein can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species. In one aspect, however, the immunoglobulin is of human, murine, or rabbit origin.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; minibodies (Olafsen et al (2004) Protein Eng. Design & Sel. 17(4):315-323), fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see for example: U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597; for example.","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey, Ape etc) and human constant region sequences.","An \u201cintact antibody\u201d herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc constant region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses.\u201d There are five major classes of intact immunoglobulin antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Ig forms include hinge-modifications or hingeless forms (Roux et al (1998) J. Immunol. 161:4083-4090; Lund et al (2000) Eur. J. Biochem. 267:7246-7256; US 2005\/0048572; US 2004\/0229310).","An \u201cErbB receptor\u201d is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the ErbB receptor family whose members are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. The ErbB receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, HER1), HER2 (ErbB2 or p185neu), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). A panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies has been characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SKBR3 (Hudziak et al (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9(3):1165-1172. Maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56%. Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-a (U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171). The anti-ErbB2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al (1990) Cancer Research 50:1550-1558; Kotts et al. (1990) In Vitro 26(3):59A; Sarup et al.

(1997) Oncogene 15:1385-1394.","The ErbB receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an ErbB ligand; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may be a \u201cnative sequence\u201d ErbB receptor or an \u201camino acid sequence variant\u201d thereof. Preferably, the ErbB receptor is native sequence human ErbB receptor.

Antibodies against HER4 are described, for example, in WO 02\/18444.","Antibodies to ErbB receptors are available commercially from a number of sources, including, for example, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., California, USA.","The term \u201camino acid sequence variant\u201d refers to polypeptides having amino acid sequences that differ to some extent from a native sequence polypeptide. Ordinarily, amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70% sequence identity with at least one receptor binding domain of a native ErbB ligand or with at least one ligand binding domain of a native ErbB receptor, and preferably, they will be at least about 80%, more preferably, at least about 90% homologous by sequence with such receptor or ligand binding domains. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions at certain positions within the amino acid sequence of the native amino acid sequence. Amino acids are designated by the conventional names, one-letter and three-letter codes.","\u201cSequence identity\u201d is defined as the percentage of residues in the amino acid sequence variant that are identical after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity.

The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, (1991) \u201cAnnu. Rev. Immunol.\u201d 9:457-92. To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al (1998) PROC. NAT. ACAD. SCl. (USA) (USA) 95:652-656.","\u201cHuman effector cells\u201d are leukocytes which express one or more constant region receptors (FcRs) and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least Fc\u03b3RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g., from blood or PBMCs as described herein.","The terms \u201cFc receptor\u201d or \u201cFcR\u201d are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc constant region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (See review M. in Da{tilde over (e)}ron, \u201cAnnu. Rev. Immunol.\u201d 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, \u201cAnnu. Rev. Immunol\u201d., 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al (1994) Immunomethods 4:25-34; and de Haas et al (1995) J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41. Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \u201cFcR\u201d herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al (1976) J. Immunol., 117:587 and Kim et al (1994) J. Immunol. 24:249).","\u201cComplement dependent cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cCDC\u201d refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g., an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al 202:163 (1996), may be performed.","\u201cNative antibodies\u201d are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).","The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al supra) and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (e.g., residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917). \u201cFramework Region\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab\u2032)2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.","\u201cFv\u201d is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen-binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the V-Vdimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.","The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear at least one free thiol group. F(ab\u2032)2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab\u2032 fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.","The \u201clight chains\u201d of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (\u03ba) and lambda (\u03bb), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.","\u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d antibody fragments comprise the Vand Vdomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pl\u00fcckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). Anti-ErbB2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO 93\/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (VH) connected to a variable light domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH\u2212VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization is a method to transfer the murine antigen binding information to a non-immunogenic human antibody acceptor, and has resulted in many therapeutically useful drugs. The method of humanization generally begins by transferring all six murine complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human antibody framework (Jones et al, (1986) Nature 321:522-525). These CDR-grafted antibodies generally do not retain their original affinity for antigen binding, and in fact, affinity is often severely impaired. Besides the CDRs, select non-human antibody framework residues must also be incorporated to maintain proper CDR conformation (Chothia et al (1989) Nature 342:877). The transfer of key mouse framework residues to the human acceptor in order to support the structural conformation of the grafted CDRs has been shown to restore antigen binding and affinity (Riechmann et al (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224, 487-499; Foote and Winter, (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499; Presta et al (1993) J. Immunol. 151, 2623-2632; Werther et al (1996) J. Immunol. Methods 157:4986-4995; and Presta et al (2001) Thromb. Haemost. 85:379-389). For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213; Jones et al (1986) Nature, 321:522-525; Riechmann et al (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta, (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596.","A \u201cfree cysteine amino acid\u201d refers to a cysteine amino acid residue which has been engineered into a parent antibody, has a thiol functional group (\u2014SH), and is not paired as an intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bridge.","The term \u201cthiol reactivity value\u201d is a quantitative characterization of the reactivity of free cysteine amino acids. The thiol reactivity value is the percentage of a free cysteine amino acid in a cysteine engineered antibody which reacts with a thiol-reactive reagent, and converted to a maximum value of 1. For example, a free cysteine amino acid on a cysteine engineered antibody which reacts in 100% yield with a thiol-reactive reagent, such as a biotin-maleimide reagent, to form a biotin-labelled antibody has a thiol reactivity value of 1.0. Another cysteine amino acid engineered into the same or different parent antibody which reacts in 80% yield with a thiol-reactive reagent has a thiol reactivity value of 0.8. Another cysteine amino acid engineered into the same or different parent antibody which fails totally to react with a thiol-reactive reagent has a thiol reactivity value of 0. Determination of the thiol reactivity value of a particular cysteine may be conducted by ELISA assay, mass spectroscopy, liquid chromatography, autoradiography, or other quantitative analytical tests.","A \u201cparent antibody\u201d is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence from which one or more amino acid residues are replaced by one or more cysteine residues. The parent antibody may comprise a native or wild type sequence. The parent antibody may have pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions and\/or substitutions) relative to other native, wild type, or modified forms of an antibody. A parent antibody may be directed against a target antigen of interest, e.g. a biologically important polypeptide. Antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated glycolipid antigens; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,178) are also contemplated.","Exemplary parent antibodies include antibodies having affinity and selectivity for cell surface and transmembrane receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAA).","Other exemplary parent antibodies include those selected from, and without limitation, anti-estrogen receptor antibody, anti-progesterone receptor antibody, anti-p53 antibody, anti-HER-2\/neu antibody, anti-EGFR antibody, anti-cathepsin D antibody, anti-Bcl-2 antibody, anti-E-cadherin antibody, anti-CA125 antibody, anti-CA15-3 antibody, anti-CA19-9 antibody, anti-c-erbB-2 antibody, anti-P-glycoprotein antibody, anti-CEA antibody, anti-retinoblastoma protein antibody, anti-ras oncoprotein antibody, anti-Lewis X antibody, anti-Ki-67 antibody, anti-PCNA antibody, anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD4 antibody, anti-CD5 antibody, anti-CD7 antibody, anti-CD8 antibody, anti-CD9\/p24 antibody, anti-CD10 antibody, anti-CD11c antibody, anti-CD13 antibody, anti-CD14 antibody, anti-CD15 antibody, anti-CD19 antibody, anti-CD20 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD23 antibody, anti-CD30 antibody, anti-CD31 antibody, anti-CD33 antibody, anti-CD34 antibody, anti-CD35 antibody, anti-CD38 antibody, anti-CD41 antibody, anti-LCA\/CD45 antibody, anti-CD45RO antibody, anti-CD45RA antibody, anti-CD39 antibody, anti-CD100 antibody, anti-CD95\/Fas antibody, anti-CD99 antibody, anti-CD106 antibody, anti-ubiquitin antibody, anti-CD71 antibody, anti-c-myc antibody, anti-cytokeratins antibody, anti-vimentins antibody, anti-HPV proteins antibody, anti-kappa light chains antibody, anti-lambda light chains antibody, anti-melanosomes antibody, anti-prostate specific antigen antibody, anti-S-100 antibody, anti-tau antigen antibody, anti-fibrin antibody, anti-keratins antibody and anti-Tn-antigen antibody.","An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","An antibody \u201cwhich binds\u201d a molecular target or an antigen of interest, e.g., ErbB2 antigen, is one capable of binding that antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful in targeting a cell expressing the antigen. Where the antibody is one which binds ErbB2, it will usually preferentially bind ErbB2 as opposed to other ErbB receptors, and may be one which does not significantly cross-react with other proteins such as EGFR, ErbB3 or ErbB4. In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody to these non-ErbB2 proteins (e.g., cell surface binding to endogenous receptor) will be less than 10% as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). Sometimes, the anti-ErbB2 antibody will not significantly cross-react with the rat neu protein, e.g., as described in Schecter et al. (1984) Nature 312:513 and Drebin et al (1984) Nature 312:545-548.","Molecular targets for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD proteins and their ligands, such as, but not limited to: (i) CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD40, CD79\u03b1 (CD79a), and CD79\u03b2 (CD79b); (ii) members of the ErbB receptor family such as the EGF receptor, HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; (iii) cell adhesion molecules such as LFA-1, Mac1, p150, 95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM and \u03b1v\/\u03b23 integrin, including either alpha or beta subunits thereof (e.g. anti-CD11a, anti-CD18 or anti-CD11b antibodies); (iv) growth factors such as VEGF; IgE; blood group antigens; flk2\/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB) receptor; mpl receptor; CTLA-4; protein C, BR3, c-met, tissue factor, \u03b27 etc; and (v) cell surface and transmembrane tumor-associated antigens (TAA).","Unless indicated otherwise, the term \u201cmonoclonal antibody 4D5\u201d refers to an antibody that has antigen binding residues of, or derived from, the murine 4D5 antibody (ATCC CRL 10463).

For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient.

More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (\u201cNSCLC\u201d), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","An \u201cErbB-expressing cancer\u201d is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell surface. An \u201cErbB2-expressing cancer\u201d is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of cells thereof, such that an anti-ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.","A cancer which \u201coverexpresses\u201d an antigenic receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of the receptor, such as ErbB2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the receptor protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of receptor-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO 98\/45479), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR).","The tumors overexpressing ErbB2 (HER2) are rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding to the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell, and can been determined biochemically: 0=0-10,000 copies\/cell, 1+=at least about 200,000 copies\/cell, 2+=at least about 500,000 copies\/cell, 3+=about 1\u22122\u00d710copies\/cell. Overexpression of HER2 at the 3+ level, which leads to ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase (Hudziak et al (1987) 84:7159-7163), occurs in approximately 30% of breast cancers, and in these patients, relapse-free survival and overall survival are diminished (Slamon et al (1989) 244:707-712; Slamon et al (1987) 235:177-182).","The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At, I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, P, C, and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof.","An \u201cautoimmune disease\u201d herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual's own tissues or organs or a co-segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom. In many of these autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, a number of clinical and laboratory markers may exist, including, but not limited to, hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of autoantibodies, antigen-antibody complex deposits in tissues, benefit from corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments, and lymphoid cell aggregates in affected tissues. Without being limited to any one theory regarding B-cell mediated autoimmune disease, it is believed that B cells demonstrate a pathogenic effect in human autoimmune diseases through a multitude of mechanistic pathways, including autoantibody production, immune complex formation, dendritic and T-cell activation, cytokine synthesis, direct chemokine release, and providing a nidus for ectopic neo-lymphogenesis. Each of these pathways may participate to different degrees in the pathology of autoimmune diseases. An autoimmune disease can be an organ-specific disease (i.e., the immune response is specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system, the hematopoietic system, the skin, the cardiopulmonary system, the gastrointestinal and liver systems, the renal system, the thyroid, the ears, the neuromuscular system, the central nervous system, etc.) or a systemic disease which can affect multiple organ systems (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, etc.).","The term \u201ccytostatic\u201d refers to the effect of limiting the function of cells, such as limiting cellular growth or proliferation of cells.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

See, e.g., Wilman, \u201cProdrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy\u201d Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al \u201cProdrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,\u201d , Borchardt et al (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985).

One utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins, typically through fusions to either pIII or pVIII of filamentous phage (Wells and Lowman, (1992) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., 3:355-362, and references cited therein). In monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a phage coat protein or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type protein. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, 3:205-0216 (1991). Phage display includes techniques for producing antibody-like molecules (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York, p627-628; Lee et al).","A \u201cphagemid\u201d is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.","\u201cLinker\u201d, \u201cLinker Unit\u201d, or \u201clink\u201d means a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches an antibody to a drug moiety. In various embodiments, a linker is specified as L. Linkers include a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an arylene, a heteroarylene, moieties such as: \u2014(CR)O(CR)\u2014, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino (e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine\u2122); and diacid ester and amides including succinate, succinamide, diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide.","The term \u201clabel\u201d means any moiety which can be covalently attached to an antibody and that functions to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or second label, e.g. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer); (iii) stabilize interactions or increase affinity of binding, with antigen or ligand; (iv) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility, or cell-permeability, by charge, hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (v) provide a capture moiety, to modulate ligand affinity, antibody\/antigen binding, or ionic complexation.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt,\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of an ADC. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis -(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counterion.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable solvate\u201d refers to an association of one or more solvent molecules and an ADC. Examples of solvents that form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.","The following abbreviations are used herein and have the indicated definitions: BME is beta-mercaptoethanol, Boc is N-(t-butoxycarbonyl), cit is citrulline (2-amino-5-ureido pentanoic acid), dap is dolaproine, DCC is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DCM is dichloromethane, DEA is diethylamine, DEAD is diethylazodicarboxylate, DEPC is diethylphosphorylcyanidate, DIAD is diisopropylazodicarboxylate, DIEA is N,N-diisopropylethylamine, dil is dolaisoleucine, DMA is dimethylacetamide, DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine, DME is ethyleneglycol dimethyl ether (or 1,2-dimethoxyethane), DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide, DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, doe is dolaphenine, dov is N,N-dimethylvaline, DTNB is 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, DTT is dithiothreitol, EDCI is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, EEDQ is 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, ES-MS is electrospray mass spectrometry, EtOAc is ethyl acetate, Fmoc is N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl), gly is glycine, HATU is O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, HPLC is high pressure liquid chromatography, ile is isoleucine, lys is lysine, MeCN(CHCN) is acetonitrile, MeOH is methanol, Mtr is 4-anisyldiphenylmethyl (or 4-methoxytrityl),nor is (1S,2R)-(+)-norephedrine, PAB is p-aminobenzylcarbamoyl, PBS is phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7), PEG is polyethylene glycol, Ph is phenyl, Pnp is p-nitrophenyl, MC is 6-maleimidocaproyl, phe is L-phenylalanine, PyBrop is bromo tris-pyrrolidino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, SEC is size-exclusion chromatography, Su is succinimide, TFA is trifluoroacetic acid, TLC is thin layer chromatography, UV is ultraviolet, and val is valine.","Cysteine Engineered Antibodies","The compounds of the invention include cysteine engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of a wild-type or parent antibody are replaced with a cysteine amino acid. Any form of antibody may be so engineered, i.e. mutated. For example, a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a cysteine engineered Fab, referred to herein as \u201cThioFab.\u201d Similarly, a parent monoclonal antibody may be engineered to form a \u201cThioMab.\u201d It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered cysteine residue in a ThioFab, while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a ThioMab, due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. Mutants with replaced (\u201cengineered\u201d) cysteine (Cys) residues are evaluated for the reactivity of the newly introduced, engineered cysteine thiol groups. The thiol reactivity value is a relative, numerical term in the range of 0 to 1.0 and can be measured for any cysteine engineered antibody. Thiol reactivity values of cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention are in the ranges of 0.6 to 1.0; 0.7 to 1.0; or 0.8 to 1.0.","The design, selection, and preparation methods of the invention enable cysteine engineered antibodies which are reactive with electrophilic functionality. These methods further enable antibody conjugate compounds such as antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compounds with drug molecules at designated, designed, selective sites. Reactive cysteine residues on an antibody surface allow specifically conjugating a drug moiety through a thiol reactive group such as maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino acid functionality in a protein, such as amino group of lysine residues or the N-terminal amino group. Thiol specific functionality in iodoacetyl and maleimide reagents may react with amine groups, but higher pH (>9.0) and longer reaction times are required (Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London).","Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention preferably retain the antigen binding capability of their wild type, parent antibody counterparts. Thus, cysteine engineered antibodies are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to antigens. Such antigens include, for example, tumor-associated antigens (TAA), cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules, transmembrane proteins, signalling proteins, cell survival regulatory factors, cell proliferation regulatory factors, molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) tissue development or differentiation, lymphokines, cytokines, molecules involved in cell cycle regulation, molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) angiogenesis. The tumor-associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor (i.e., a CD protein). An antigen to which a cysteine engineered antibody is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above-mentioned categories, wherein the other subset(s) of said category comprise other molecules\/antigens that have a distinct characteristic (with respect to the antigen of interest).","The parent antibody may also be a humanized antibody selected from huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (Trastuzumab, HERCEPTIN\u00ae) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337, expressly incorporated herein by reference; humanized 520C9 (WO 93\/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies as described herein.","Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be site-specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol-reactive reagent. The thiol-reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent, a capture, i.e. affinity, label reagent (e.g. a biotin-linker reagent), a detection label (e.g. a fluorophore reagent), a solid phase immobilization reagent (e.g. SEPHAROSE\u2122, polystyrene, or glass), or a drug-linker intermediate. One example of a thiol-reactive reagent is N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). In an exemplary embodiment, reaction of a ThioFab with a biotin-linker reagent provides a biotinylated ThioFab by which the presence and reactivity of the engineered cysteine residue may be detected and measured. Reaction of a ThioFab with a multifunctional linker reagent provides a ThioFab with a functionalized linker which may be further reacted with a drug moiety reagent or other label. Reaction of a ThioFab with a drug-linker intermediate provides a ThioFab drug conjugate.","The exemplary methods described here may be applied generally to the identification and production of antibodies, and more generally, to other proteins through application of the design and screening steps described herein.","Such an approach may be applied to the conjugation of other thiol-reactive agents in which the reactive group is, for example, a maleimide, an iodoacetamide, a pyridyl disulfide, or other thiol-reactive conjugation partner (Haugland, 2003, Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, Molecular Probes, Inc.; Brinkley, 1992, Bioconjugate Chem. 3:2; Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London; Means (1990) Bioconjugate Chem. 1:2; Hermanson, G. in Bioconjugate Techniques (1996) Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 40-55, 643-671). The partner may be a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a toxin such as doxorubicin or pertussis toxin), a fluorophore such as a fluorescent dye like fluorescein or rhodamine, a chelating agent for an imaging or radiotherapeutic metal, a peptidyl or non-peptidyl label or detection tag, or a clearance-modifying agent such as various isomers of polyethylene glycol, a peptide that binds to a third component, or another carbohydrate or lipophilic agent.","The sites identified on the exemplary antibody fragment, hu4D5Fabv8, herein are primarily in the constant domain of an antibody which is well conserved across all species of antibodies. These sites should be broadly applicable to other antibodies, without further need of structural design or knowledge of specific antibody structures, and without interference in the antigen binding properties inherent to the variable domains of the antibody.","Cysteine engineered antibodies which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such antibodies may be used as naked antibodies (unconjugated to a drug or label moiety) or as Formula I antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type(s) of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non-cancerous cell(s). Often, such tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies.","Examples of TAA include, but are not limited to, TAA (1)-(36) listed below. For convenience, information relating to these antigens, all of which are known in the art, is listed below and includes names, alternative names, Genbank accession numbers and primary reference(s), following nucleic acid and protein sequence identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Nucleic acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA (1)-(36) are available in public databases such as GenBank. Tumor-associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references, or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example, a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.","Tumor-associated Antigens (1)-(36):","(1) BMPR1B (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-type IB, Genbank accession no.

These methods include, but are not limited to, preparation by site-directed (or oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared DNA encoding the polypeptide. Variants of recombinant antibodies may be constructed also by restriction fragment manipulation or by overlap extension PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides. Mutagenic primers encode the cysteine codon replacement(s). Standard mutagenesis techniques can be employed to generate DNA encoding such mutant cysteine engineered antibodies. General guidance can be found in Sambrook et al Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989; and Ausubel et al Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., 1993.","Site-directed mutagenesis is one method for preparing substitution variants, i.e. mutant proteins. This technique is well known in the art (see for example, Carter (1985) et al Nucleic Acids Res. 13:4431-4443; Ho et al (1989) Gene (Amst.) 77:51-59; and Kunkel et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488). Briefly, in carrying out site-directed mutagenesis of DNA, the starting DNA is altered by first hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a single strand of such starting DNA. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second strand, using the hybridized oligonucleotide as a primer, and using the single strand of the starting DNA as a template. Thus, the oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation is incorporated in the resulting double-stranded DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis may be carried out within the gene expressing the protein to be mutagenized in an expression plasmid and the resulting plasmid may be sequenced to confirm the introduction of the desired cysteine replacement mutations (Liu et al (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20252-20260). Site-directed of protocols and formats, including those commercially available, e.g. QuikChangeR Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.).","PCR mutagenesis is also suitable for making amino acid sequence variants of the starting polypeptide. See Higuchi, (1990) in PCR Protocols, pp. 177-183, Academic Press; Ito et al (1991) Gene 102:67-70; Bernhard et al (1994) Bioconjugate Chem. 5:126-132; and Vallette et al (1989) Nuc. Acids Res. 17:723-733. Briefly, when small amounts of template DNA are used as starting material in a PCR, primers that differ slightly in sequence from the corresponding region in a template DNA can be used to generate relatively large quantities of a specific DNA fragment that differs from the template sequence only at the positions where the primers differ from the template.","Another method for preparing variants, cassette mutagenesis, is based on the technique described by Wells et al (1985) Gene 34:315-323. The starting material is the plasmid (or other vector) comprising the starting polypeptide DNA to be mutated. The codon(s) in the starting DNA to be mutated are identified. There must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutation site(s). If no such restriction sites exist, they may be generated using the above described oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis method to introduce them at appropriate locations in the starting polypeptide DNA. The plasmid DNA is cut at these sites to linearize it. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction sites but containing the desired mutation(s) is synthesized using standard procedures, wherein the two strands of the oligonucleotide are synthesized separately and then hybridized together using standard techniques. This double-stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly ligated to the plasmid.

Mutant DNA containing the encoded cysteine replacements can be confirmed by DNA sequencing.","Single mutations are also generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis using double stranded plasmid DNA as template by PCR based mutagenesis (Sambrook and Russel, (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition; Zoller et al (1983) Methods Enzymol. 100:468-500; Zoller, M.

Biol. 321:851-62) was used for experiments as a model system. Cysteine mutations were introduced in hu4D5Fabv8-phage, hu4D5Fabv8, and ABP-hu4D5Fabv8 constructs. The hu4D5-ThioFab-Phage preps were carried out using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method as described earlier (Lowman, Henry B. (1998) Methods in Molecular Biology (Totowa, N.J.) 87 (Combinatorial Peptide Library Protocols) 249-264).","Oligonucleotides are prepared by the phosphoramidite synthesis method (U.S. Pat.

The phosphoramidite method entails cyclical addition of nucleotide monomer units with a reactive 3\u2032 phosphoramidite moiety to an oligonucleotide chain growing on a solid-support comprised of controlled-pore glass or highly crosslinked polystyrene, and most commonly in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction in which the 3\u2032 terminus nucleoside is attached to the solid-support at the beginning of synthesis (U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,524; U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,530). The method is usually practiced using automated, commercially available synthesizers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Oligonucleotides can be chemically labelled with non-isotopic moieties for detection, capture, stabilization, or other purposes (Andrus, A. \u201cChemical methods for 5\u2032 non-isotopic labelling of PCR probes and primers\u201d (1995) in PCR 2: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 39-54; Hermanson, G. in Bioconjugate Techniques (1996) Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 40-55, 643-671; Keller, G. and Manak, M. in DNA Probes Second Edition (1993), Stockton Press, New York, pp. 121-23).","PHESELECTOR Assay","The PHESELECTOR (Phage ELISA for Selection of Reactive Thiols) assay allows for detection of reactive cysteine groups in antibodies in an ELISA phage format. The process of coating the protein (e.g. antibody) of interest on well surfaces, followed incubation with phage particles and then HRP labeled secondary antibody with absorbance detection is detailed in Example 2. Mutant proteins displayed on phage may be screened in a rapid, robust, and high-throughput manner. Libraries of cysteine engineered antibodies can be produced and subjected to binding selection using the same approach to identify appropriately reactive sites of free Cys incorporation from random protein-phage libraries of antibodies or other proteins. This technique includes reacting cysteine mutant proteins displayed on phage with an affinity reagent or reporter group which is also thiol-reactive.  illustrates the PHESELECTOR Assay by a schematic representation depicting the binding of Fab or ThioFab to HER2 (top) and biotinylated ThioFab to streptavidin (bottom).","Protein Expression and Purification","DNA encoding the cysteine engineered antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or other mammalian host cells, such as myeloma cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715; US 2005\/0048572; US 2004\/0229310) that do not otherwise produce the antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The yields of hu4D5Fabv8 cysteine engineered antibodies were similar to wild type hu4D5Fabv8.

Revs. 130:151-188.","After design and selection, cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g. ThioFabs, with highly reactive unpaired Cys residues, may be produced by: (i) expression in a bacterial, e.g. , system or a mammalian cell culture system (WO 01\/00245), e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO); and (ii) purification using common protein purification techniques (Lowman et al (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266(17):10982-10988).","ThioFabs were expressed upon induction in 34B8, a non-suppressor strain (Baca et al (1997) Journal Biological Chemistry 272(16):10678-84). See Example 3a. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (phosphate buffered saline), total cell lysis was performed by passing through a microfluidizer and the ThioFabs were purified by affinity chromatography with protein G SEPHAROSE\u2122 (Amersham). ThioFabs were conjugated with biotin-PEO-maleimide as described above and the biotinylated-ThioFabs were further purified by Superdex-200\u2122 (Amersham) gel filtration chromatography, which eliminated the free biotin-PEO-maleimide and the oligomeric fraction of ThioFabs.","Mass Spectroscopy Analysis","Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) analysis was employed for the accurate molecular weight determination of biotin conjugated Fab (Cole, R. B. Electro Spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry: Fundamentals, Instrumentation And Applications. (1997) Wiley, New York). The amino acid sequence of biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8 (A121C) peptide was determined by tryptic digestion followed by LC-ESI-Tandem MS analysis (Table 4, Example 3b).","The antibody Fab fragment hu4D5Fabv8 contains about 445 amino acid residues, including 10 Cys residues (five on the light and five on the heavy chain). The high-resolution structure of the humanized 4D5 variable fragment (Fv4D5) has been established, see: Eigenbrot et al \u201cX-Ray Structures Of The Antigen-Binding Domains From Three Variants Of Humanized Anti-P185her2 Antibody 4D5 And Comparison With Molecular Modeling\u201d (1993) J Mol. Biol. 229:969-995). All the Cys residues are present in the form of disulfide bonds, therefore these residues do not have any reactive thiol groups to conjugate with drug-maleimide (unless treated with a reducing agent). Hence, the newly engineered Cys residue, can remain unpaired, and able to react with, i.e. conjugate to, an electrophilic linker reagent or drug-linker intermediate, such as a drug-maleimide.  shows a three-dimensional representation of the hu4D5Fabv8 antibody fragment derived by X-ray crystal coordinates. The structure positions of the engineered Cys residues of the heavy and light chains are numbered according to a sequential numbering system.

Phagemid-ThioFab binding to antigen and to streptavidin can be tested by coating HER2 and streptavidin, respectively, onto ELISA plates followed by probing with anti-Fab-HRP (Horse radish peroxidase) as described in Example 2 and depicted in . This method allowed simultaneous monitoring of the effect on the antigen binding and the reactivity of the thiol group by the engineered Cys residue\/conjugated biotin molecule. Also, the method can be applied to screen the reactive thiol groups for any protein displayed on M13 phage. Conjugated or unconjugated phagemid-ThioFabs are purified by simple PEG precipitation.","The antigen-binding fragment of humanized 4D5 (hu4D5Fab) is well expressed in and has been displayed on bacteriophage (Garrard et al (1993) Gene 128: 103-109). The antibody Fab fragment hu4D5Fabv8 was displayed on M13 phage as a model system in the ELISA based assay to probe thiol reactivity.  is a graphical representation of the PHESELECTOR assay, depicting binding of a biotinylated ThioFab phage and an anti-phage HRP antibody to HER2 (top) and Streptavidin (bottom). Five amino acid residues (L-Ala43, H-Ala40, H-Serl 19, H-Ala121 and H-Ser122) were initially selected from crystal structure information as remote from the antigen binding surface (Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J Mol Biol. 229:969-995). The Protein Database X-ray crystal structure was designated as 1FVC. Cys residues were engineered at these positions by site directed mutagenesis. ThioFab-phage preparations were isolated and reacted with the biotinylation reagent.","Biotin conjugated and unconjugated variants were tested for HER2 and streptavidin binding using an ELISA based PHESELECTOR assay (, Example 2) with an HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated anti-phage antibody. The interaction of non-biotinylated phage-hu4D5Fabv8 () and biotinylated phage-hu4D5Fabv8 () with BSA (open box), HER2 (grey box) or streptavidin (solid box) were monitored through anti-M13-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody by developing a standard HRP reaction and measuring absorbance at 450 nm. The absorbance produced by turnover of a colorimetric substrate was measured at 450 nm. The reactivity of ThioFab with HER2 measures antigen binding. The reactivity of ThioFab with streptavidin measures the extent of biotinylation. The reactivity of ThioFab with BSA is a negative control for nonspecific interaction. As seen in , all the ThioFab-phage variants have similar binding to HER2 compared to that of wild type hu4D5Fabv8-phage. Furthermore, conjugation with biotin did not interfere in the ThioFab binding to HER2 ().","Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the ThioFabs-phage samples showed varying levels of streptavidin binding activity. From all the tested phage-ThioFabs, the A121C cysteine engineered antibody exhibited maximal thiol reactivity. Even though wild type hu4D5Fabv8-phage was incubated with the same amounts of biotin-maleimide, these phage had little streptavidin binding indicating that preexisting cysteine residues (involved in disulfide bond formation) from the hu4D5Fabv8 and M13 phage coat proteins did not interfere with the site-specific conjugation of biotin-maleimide. These results demonstrate that the phage ELISA assay can be used successfully to screen reactive thiol groups on the Fab surface.","The PHESELECTOR assay allows screening of reactive thiol groups in antibodies. Identification of the A121C variant by this method is exemplary. The entire Fab molecule may be effectively searched to identify more ThioFab variants with reactive thiol groups. A parameter, fractional surface accessibility, was employed to identify and quantitate the accessibility of solvent to the amino acid residues in a polypeptide. The surface accessibility can be expressed as the surface area (\u212b) that can be contacted by a solvent molecule, e.g. water. The occupied space of water is approximated as a 1.4 \u212b radius sphere.

Richards (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 55:379-400. AREAIMOL defines the solvent accessible surface of a protein as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the protein. AREAIMOL calculates the solvent accessible surface area by generating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms. AREAIMOL finds the solvent accessible area of atoms in a PDB coordinate file, and summarizes the accessible area by residue, by chain and for the whole molecule. Accessible areas (or area differences) for individual atoms can be written to a pseudo-PDB output file. AREAIMOL assumes a single radius for each element, and only recognizes a limited number of different elements. Unknown atom types (i.e. those not in AREAIMOL's internal database) will be assigned the default radius of 1.8 \u212b.

can be engineered to replace with Cys residues:","1. Amino acid residues that are completely buried are eliminated, i.e. less than 10% fractional surface accessibility. Table 1 shows there are 134 (light chain) and 151 (heavy chain) residues of hu4D5Fabv8 that are more than 10% accessible (fractional surface accessibility). The top ten most accessible Ser, Ala and Val residues were selected due to their close structural similarity to Cys over other amino acids, introducing only minimal structural constraints in the antibody by newly engineered Cys. Other cysteine replacement sites can also be screened, and may be useful for conjugation.","2. Residues are sorted based on their role in functional and structural interactions of Fab. The residues which are not involved in antigen interactions and distant from the existing disulfide bonds were further selected. The newly engineered Cys residues should be distinct from, and not interfere with, antigen binding nor mispair with cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation.","The following residues of hu4D5Fabv8 possessed the above criteria and were selected to be replaced with Cys: L-V15, L-A43, L-V110, L-A144, L-S168, H-A88, H-A121, H-S122, H-A175 and H-S179 (shown in ).","Thiol reactivity may be generalized to any antibody where substitution of amino acids with reactive cysteine amino acids may be made within the ranges in the light chain selected from: L-10 to L-20; L-38 to L-48; L-105 to L-115; L-139 to L-149; L-163 to L-173; and within the ranges in the heavy chain selected from: H-35 to H-45; H-83 to H-93; H-114 to H-127; and H-170 to H-184, and in the Fc region within the ranges selected from H-268 to H-291; H-319 to H-344; H-370 to H-380; and H-395 to H-405.","Thiol reactivity may also be generalized to certain domains of an antibody, such as the light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Cysteine replacements resulting in thiol reactivity values of 0.6 and higher may be made in the heavy chain constant domains \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively, including the IgG subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2.","It is evident from the crystal structure data that the selected 10 Cys mutants are far away from the antigen-combining site, such as the interface with HER2 in this case. These mutants can be tested experimentally for indirect effects on functional interactions. The thiol reactivities of all the Cys Fab variants were measured and calculated as described in Examples 1 and 2, and presented in Table 2. The residues L-V15C, L-V110C, H-A88C and H-A121C have reactive and stable thiol groups (). Mutants V15C, V110C, A144C, S168C are light chain Cysvariants. Mutants A88C, A121C, A175C, S179C are heavy chain Cys variants. It was surprising and unexpected that the sites with high fractional surface accessibility did not have the highest thiol reactivity as calculated by the PHESELECTOR assay (Table 2). In other words, fractional surface accessibility (Tables 1, 2) did not correlate with thiol reactivity (Table 2). In fact, the Cys residues engineered at the sites with moderate surface accessibility of 20% to 80% (, Table 1), or partially exposed sites, like Ala or Val residues, exhibited better thiol reactivity, i.e. >0.6, (, Table 2) than the Cys introduced at Ser residues, thus necessitating the use of PHESELECTOR assay in the screening of thiol reactive sites since the crystal structure information alone is not sufficient to select these sites ().","Thiol reactivity data is shown in  for amino acid residues of 4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants: (3A) non-biotinylated (control) and (3B) biotinylated phage-ThioFabs. Reactive thiol groups on antibody\/Fab surface were identified by PHESELECTOR assay analyses for the interaction of non-biotinylated phage-hu4D5Fabv8 (3A) and biotinylated phage-hu4D5Fabv8 (3B) with BSA (open box), HER2 (grey box) or streptavidin (solid box). The assay was carried out as described in Example 2. Light chain variants are on the left side and heavy chain variants are on the right side. The binding of non-biotinylated 4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants is low as expected, but strong binding to HER2 is retained. The ratio of binding to streptavidin and to HER2 of the biotinylated 4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants gives the thiol reactivity values in Table 2. Background absorbance at 450 nm or small amounts of non-specific protein binding of the biotinylated 4D5 ThioFab Cys mutants to BSA is also evident in . Fractional Surface Accessibility values of the selected amino acid residues that were replaced with a Cys residue are shown in . Fractional surface accessibility was calculated from the available hu4D5Fabv7 structure and shown on Table 1 (Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J Mol Biol. 229:969-995). The conformational parameters of the hu4D5Fabv7 and hu4D5Fabv8 structures are highly consistent and allow for determination of any correlation between fractional surface accessibility calculations of hu4D5Fabv7 and thiol reactivity of hu4D5Fabv8 cysteine mutants. The measured thiol reactivity of phage ThioFab Cys residues introduced at partially exposed residues (Ala or Val) have better thiol reactivity compared to the ones introduced at Ser residues (Table 2). It can be seen from the ThioFab Cys mutants of Table 2 that there is little or no correlation between thio reactivity values and fractional surface accessibility.","Amino acids at positions L-15, L-43, L-110, L-144, L-168, H-40, H-88, H-119, H-121, H-122, H-175, and H-179 of an antibody may generally be mutated (replaced) with free cysteine amino acids. Ranges within about 5 amino acid residues on each side of these positions may also be replaced with free cysteine acids, i.e. L-10 to L-20; L-38 to L-48; L-105 to L-115; L-139 to L-149; L-163 to L-173; H-35 to H-45; H-83 to H-93; H-114 to H-127; and H-170 to H-184, as well as the ranges in the Fc region selected from H-268 to H-291; H-319 to H-344; H-370 to H-380; and H-395 to H-405, to yield the cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0203"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Thiol reactivity of phage-ThioFabs"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Fractional Surface"]},{"entry":[{},"Phage-ThioFab","Thiol","Accessibility (%)"]},{"entry":[{},"construct","Reactivity*","(from Table 1)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"hu4D5Fabv8-wt","0.125","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"L-V15C","0.934","52.46"]},{"entry":[{},"L-A43C","0.385","26.80"]},{"entry":[{},"L-V110C","0.850","44.84"]},{"entry":[{},"L-A144C","0.373","23.65"]},{"entry":[{},"L-S168C","0.514","79.68"]},{"entry":[{},"H-A40C","0.450","21.97"]},{"entry":[{},"H-A88C","0.914","51.60"]},{"entry":[{},"H-S119C","0.680","18.88"]},{"entry":[{},"H-A121C","0.925","33.05"]},{"entry":[{},"H-S122C","0.720","72.87"]},{"entry":[{},"H-A175C","0.19","23.80"]},{"entry":[{},"H-S179C","0.446","99.48"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"L = light chain,"]},{"entry":[{},"H = heavy chain,"]},{"entry":[{},"A = alanine,"]},{"entry":[{},"S = serine,"]},{"entry":[{},"V = valine,"]},{"entry":[{},"C = cysteine"]},{"entry":[{},"*Thiol reactivity is measured as the ratio of ODfor streptavidin binding to ODfor HER2 (antibody) binding (Example 2).

The attached label may function to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or second label, e.g. to give FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer); (iii) stabilize interactions or increase affinity of binding, with antigen or ligand; (iv) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility or cell-permeability, by charge, hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (v) provide a capture moiety, to modulate ligand affinity, antibody\/antigen binding, or ionic complexation.","Labelled cysteine engineered antibodies may be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum. For diagnostic applications, the antibody will typically be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:","(a) Radioisotopes (radionuclides), such as H, C C, F, P, S, Cu, Ga, Y, Tc, In, I, I, I, I, Xe, Lu, At, or Bi. Radioisotope labelled antibodies are useful in receptor targeted imaging experiments. The antibody can be labeled with ligand reagents that bind, chelate or otherwise complex a radioisotope metal where the reagent is reactive with the engineered cysteine thiol of the antibody, using the techniques described in , Volumes 1 and 2, Coligen et al, Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991). Chelating ligands which may complex a metal ion include DOTA, DOTP, DOTMA, DTPA and TETA (Macrocyclics, Dallas, Tex.).

(Rockford, Ill.).","(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available or disclosed (U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149). The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of a chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), \u03b2-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al (1981) \u201cMethods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay\u201d, in . (ed J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic Press, New York, 73:147-166.","Examples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example:","(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate,","wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride (TMB));","(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and","(iii) \u03b2-D-galactosidase (\u03b2-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-galactosidase.","Numerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general review, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,980.","A label may be indirectly conjugated with a cysteine engineered antibody. For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin or streptavidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to streptavidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant, the polypeptide variant is conjugated with a small hapten (e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten polypeptide variant (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant can be achieved (Hermanson, G. (1996) in Academic Press, San Diego).","The polypeptide variant of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such as ELISA, competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays (Zola, (1987) , pp. 147-158, CRC Press, Inc.).","A detection label may be useful for localizing, visualizing, and quantitating a binding or recognition event. The labelled antibodies of the invention can detect cell-surface receptors. Another use for detectably labelled antibodies is a method of bead-based immunocapture comprising conjugating a bead with a fluorescent labelled antibody and detecting a fluorescence signal upon binding of a ligand. Similar binding detection methodologies utilize the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect to measure and detect antibody-antigen interactions.","Detection labels such as fluorescent dyes and chemiluminescent dyes (Briggs et al (1997) \u201cSynthesis of Functionalised Fluorescent Dyes and Their Coupling to Amines and Amino Acids,\u201d J. Chem. Soc., Perkin-Trans. 1:1051-1058) provide a detectable signal and are generally applicable for labelling antibodies, preferably with the following properties: (i) the labelled antibody should produce a very high signal with low background so that small quantities of antibodies can be sensitively detected in both cell-free and cell-based assays; and (ii) the labelled antibody should be photostable so that the fluorescent signal may be observed, monitored and recorded without significant photo bleaching. For applications involving cell surface binding of labelled antibody to membranes or cell surfaces, especially live cells, the labels preferably (iii) have good water-solubility to achieve effective conjugate concentration and detection sensitivity and (iv) are non-toxic to living cells so as not to disrupt the normal metabolic processes of the cells or cause premature cell death.","Direct quantification of cellular fluorescence intensity and enumeration of fluorescently labelled events, e.g. cell surface binding of peptide-dye conjugates may be conducted on an system (FMAT\u00ae 8100 HTS System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) that automates mix-and-read, non-radioactive assays with live cells or beads (Miraglia, \u201cHomogeneous cell- and bead-based assays for high throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology\u201d, (1999) J. of Biomolecular Screening 4:193-204). Uses of labelled antibodies also include cell surface receptor binding assays, immunocapture assays, fluorescence linked immunosorbent assays (FLISA), caspase-cleavage (Zheng, \u201cCaspase-3 controls both cytoplasmic and nuclear events associated with Fas-mediated apoptosis in vivo\u201d, (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:618-23; U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,907), apoptosis (Vermes, \u201cA novel assay for apoptosis. Flow cytometric detection of phosphatidylserine expression on early apoptotic cells using fluorescein labelled Annexin V\u201d (1995) J. Immunol. Methods 184:39-51) and cytotoxicity assays. Fluorometric microvolume assay technology can be used to identify the up or down regulation by a molecule that is targeted to the cell surface (Swartzman, \u201cA homogeneous and multiplexed immunoassay for high-throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology\u201d, (1999) Anal. Biochem. 271:143-51).","Labelled cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention are useful as imaging biomarkers and probes by the various methods and techniques of biomedical and molecular imaging such as: (i) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging); (ii) MicroCT (computerized tomography); (iii) SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography); (iv) PET (positron emission tomography) Chen et al (2004) Bioconjugate Chem. 15:41-49; (v) bioluminescence; (vi) fluorescence; and (vii) ultrasound. Immunoscintigraphy is an imaging procedure in which antibodies labeled with radioactive substances are administered to an animal or human patient and a picture is taken of sites in the body where the antibody localizes (U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,624). Imaging biomarkers may be objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers may be of several types: Type 0 are natural history markers of a disease and correlate longitudinally with known clinical indices, e.g. MRI assessment of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis; Type I markers capture the effect of an intervention in accordance with a mechanism-of-action, even though the mechanism may not be associated with clinical outcome; Type II markers function as surrogate endpoints where the change in, or signal from, the biomarker predicts a clinical benefit to \u201cvalidate\u201d the targeted response, such as measured bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis by CT. Imaging biomarkers thus can provide pharmacodynamic (PD) therapeutic information about: (i) expression of a target protein, (ii) binding of a therapeutic to the target protein, i.e. selectivity, and (iii) clearance and half-life pharmacokinetic data. Advantages of in vivo imaging biomarkers relative to lab-based biomarkers include: non-invasive treatment, quantifiable, whole body assessment, repetitive dosing and assessment, i.e. multiple time points, and potentially transferable effects from preclinical (small animal) to clinical (human) results. For some applications, bioimaging supplants or minimizes the number of animal experiments in preclinical studies.","Radionuclide imaging labels include radionuclides such as H, C, C, F, P, S, Cu, Ga, Y, Tc, In, I, I, I, I, Xe, Lu, At, or Bi The radionuclide metal ion can be complexed with a chelating linker such as DOTA. Linker reagents such as DOTA-maleimide (4-maleimidobutyramidobenzyl-DOTA) can be prepared by the reaction of aminobenzyl-DOTA with 4-maleimidobutyric acid (Fluka) activated with isopropylchloroformate (Aldrich), following the procedure of Axworthy et al (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97(4):1802-1807). DOTA-maleimide reagents react with the free cysteine amino acids of the cysteine engineered antibodies and provide a metal complexing ligand on the antibody (Lewis et al (1998) Bioconj. Chem. 9:72-86). Chelating linker labelling reagents such as DOTA-NHS (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid mono (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) are commercially available (Macrocyclics, Dallas, Tex.). Receptor target imaging with radionuclide labelled antibodies can provide a marker of pathway activation by detection and quantitation of progressive accumulation of antibodies in tumor tissue (Albert et al (1998) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8:1207-1210). The conjugated radio-metals may remain intracellular following lysosomal degradation.","Peptide labelling methods are well known.

Reporter groups are typically fluorescent dyes that are excited by light at a certain wavelength and transfer energy to an acceptor, or quencher, group, with the appropriate Stokes shift for emission at maximal brightness. Fluorescent dyes include molecules with extended aromaticity, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and their derivatives. The fluorescent reporter may be partially or significantly quenched by the quencher moiety in an intact peptide. Upon cleavage of the peptide by a peptidase or protease, a detectable increase in fluorescence may be measured (Knight, C.

In this process, the labelled antibody is immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized polypeptide variant. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the antigen from the polypeptide variant.","Labelling reagents typically bear reactive functionality which may react (i) directly with a cysteine thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody to form the labelled antibody, (ii) with a linker reagent to form a linker-label intermediate, or (iii) with a linker antibody to form the labelled antibody. Reactive functionality of labelling reagents include: maleimide, haloacetyl, iodoacetamide succinimidyl ester (e.g. NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide), isothiocyanate, sulfonyl chloride, 2,6-dichlorotriazinyl, pentafluorophenyl ester, and phosphoramidite, although other functional groups can also be used.","An exemplary reactive functional group is N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS) of a carboxyl group substituent of a detectable label, e.g. biotin or a fluorescent dye. The NHS ester of the label may be preformed, isolated, purified, and\/or characterized, or it may be formed in situ and reacted with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Typically, the carboxyl form of the label is activated by reacting with some combination of a carbodiimide reagent, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or a uronium reagent, e.g. TSTU (O\u2014(N-Succinimidyl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate, HBTU (O-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), or HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), an activator, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and N-hydroxysuccinimide to give the NHS ester of the label. In some cases, the label and the antibody may be coupled by in situ activation of the label and reaction with the antibody to form the label-antibody conjugate in one step. Other activating and coupling reagents include TBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazo-1-yl)-1-1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), TFFH(N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2032\u2033-tetramethyluronium 2-fluoro-hexafluorophosphate), PyBOP (benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, EEDQ (2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydro-quinoline), DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide); DIPCDI (diisopropylcarbodiimide), MSNT (1-(mesitylene-2-sulfonyl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole, and aryl sulfonyl halides, e.g. triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.","Conjugation of Biotin-maleimide to Thiofabs","The above-described ThioFab properties were established in the presence of phage because fusion of the Fab to the phage coat protein could potentially alter Cys thiol accessibility or reactivity. Therefore, the ThioFab constructs were cloned into an expression vector under alkaline phosphatase promoter (Chang et al (1987) Gene 55:189-196) and the ThioFab expression was induced by growing cells in the phosphate-free medium. ThioFabs were purified on a Protein G SEPHAROSE\u2122 column and analyzed on reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels. These analyses allow assessment of whether ThioFabs retained their reactive thiol group or were rendered inactive by forming intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds. ThioFabs L-V15C, L-V110C, H-A88C, and H-A121C were expressed and purified by Protein-G SEPHAROSE\u2122 column chromatography (see methods sections for details). Purified proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gel in reducing (with DTT) and non-reducing (without DTT) conditions. Other reducing agents such as BME (beta-mercaptoethanol) can used in the gel to cleave interchain disulfide groups. It is evident from SDS-PAGE gel analysis that the major (\u02dc90%) fraction of ThioFab is in the monomeric form, while wild type hu4D5Fabv8 is essentially in the monomeric form (47 kDa).","ThioFab (A121C) and wild type hu4D5Fabv8 were incubated with 100 fold excess of biotin-maleimide for 3 hours at room temperature and the biotinylated Fabs were loaded onto a Superdex-200\u2122 gel filtration column. This purification step was useful in separating monomeric Fab from oligomeric Fab and also from excess free biotin-maleimide (or free cytotoxic drug).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0215","num":"0232"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Biotinylated A121C ThioFab retained comparable HER2 binding to that of wild type hu4D5Fabv8 (). Wild type Fab and A121C-ThioFab were purified by gel filtration column chromatography. The two samples were tested for HER2 and streptavidin binding by ELISA using goat anti-Fab-HRP as secondary antibody. Both wild type (open box) and ThioFab (dotted box) have similar binding to HER2 but only ThioFab retained streptavidin binding. Only a background level of interaction with streptavidin was observed with non-biotinylated wild type hu4D5Fabv8 (). Mass spectral (LC-ESI-MS) analysis of biotinylated-ThioFab (A121C) resulted in a major peak with 48294.5 daltons compared to the wild type hu4D5Fabv8 (47737 daltons). The 537.5 daltons difference between the two molecules exactly corresponds to a single biotin-maleimide conjugated to the ThioFab. Mass spec protein sequencing (LC-ESI-Tandem mass spec analysis) results further confirmed that the conjugated biotin molecule was at the newly engineered Cys residue (Table 4, Example 3).","Site Specific Conjugation of Biotin-maleimide to Albumin Binding Peptide (ABP)-Thiofabs","Plasma-protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of short lived molecules. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma. Serum albumin binding peptides (ABP) can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins, including alteration of tissue uptake, penetration, and diffusion. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence (US 20040001827). A series of albumin binding peptides were identified by phage display screening (Dennis et al. (2002) \u201cAlbumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins\u201d J Biol. Chem. 277:35035-35043; WO 01\/45746). Compounds of the invention include ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002) J Biol.

It was shown that association of these ABP-Fabs with albumin increased their half life by more than 25 fold in rabbits and mice. The above described reactive Cys residues can therefore be introduced in these ABP-Fabs and used for site-specific conjugation with cytotoxic drugs followed by in vivo animal studies.  shows a graphical albumin binding peptide-Fab fusion (ABP-Fab) linker drug conjugate.","Exemplary albumin binding peptide sequences include, but are not limited to the amino acid sequences listed in SEQ ID NOS: 1-5:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0220","num":"0237"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"0pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"CDKTHTGGGSQRLMEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF","SEQ ID NO: 1",{}]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"QRLMEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF","SEQ ID NO: 2"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"QRLIEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF","SEQ ID NO: 3"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"RLIEDICLPRWGCLWEDD","SEQ ID NO: 4"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"DICLPRWGCLW","SEQ ID NO: 5"]}]}}}}},"The albumin binding peptide (ABP) sequences bind albumin from multiple species (mouse, rat, rabbit, bovine, rhesus, baboon, and human) with Kd (rabbit)=0.3 \u03bcM.

L-V15C can be expressed and purified but with relatively low yields. However the expression and purification yields of L-V110C, H-A88C and H-A121C variants were similar to that of hu4D5Fabv8. Therefore these mutants can be used for further analysis and recombined to get more than one thiol group per Fab. Towards this objective, one thiol group on the light and one on heavy chain were constructed to obtain two thiol groups per Fab molecule (L-V110C\/H-A88C and L-V110C\/H-A121C). These two double Cys variants were expressed in an expression system and purified.

Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates with disulfide linkers have been reported (WO 04\/016801; U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,874; US 2004\/039176 A1; WO 03\/068144; US 2004\/001838 A1; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,441,163, 5,208,020, 5,416,064; WO 01\/024763). The disulfide linker SPP is constructed with linker reagent N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate.","Under certain conditions, the cysteine engineered antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.). Full length, cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies (ThioMabs) expressed in CHO cells were reduced with about a 50 fold excess of TCEP for 3 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. to reduce disulfide bonds which may form between the newly introduced cysteine residues and the cysteine present in the culture media. The reduced ThioMab was diluted and loaded onto HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, and eluted with PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. Disulfide bonds were reestablished between cysteine residues present in the parent Mab with dilute (200 nM) aqueous copper sulfate (CuSO) at room temperature, overnight. Other oxidants, i.e. oxidizing agents, and oxidizing conditions, which are known in the art may be used. Ambient air oxidation is also effective. This mild, partial reoxidation step forms intrachain disulfides efficiently with high fidelity. An approximate 10 fold excess of drug-linker intermediate, e.g. BM(PEO)4-DM1 was added, mixed, and let stand for about an hour at room temperature to effect conjugation and form the ThioMab antibody-drug conjugate. The conjugation mixture was gel filtered and loaded and eluted through a HiTrap S column to remove excess drug-linker intermediate and other impurities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0381","num":"0398"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"A variety of ThioFab and ThioMab antibody-drug conjugates were prepared (Examples 4-8).

Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the ADC of the invention.","The in vitro potency of antibody-drug conjugates was measured by a cell proliferation assay (, Example 9). The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,583,024; 5,674,713 and 5,700,670). This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo Assay was conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC, or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally, cells treated briefly, i.e. 3 hours, showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats, e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units (RLU), measured over time. Alternatively, photons from luminescence can be counted in a scintillation counter in the presence of a scintillant. The light units can be represented then as CPS\u2014counts per second.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0386","num":"0403"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00036","num":"00036"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00036","he":"17.19mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08309300-20121113-C00036.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The anti-proliferative effects of antibody-drug conjugates were measured by the cell proliferation, in vitro cell killing assay above against the SK-BR-3 breast tumor cell line ().

Each of the ten mice in the four groups above received a single injection at day 1. The parent trastuzumab-SMCC-DM1 conjugate was loaded with more than twice (3.4 DM1\/Ab) the number of drug moieties than the cysteine engineered thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1 conjugate (1.6 DM1\/Ab). The effective amount of DM1 was thus approximately equal between parent trastuzumab-SMCC-DM1 and the higher dose (21 mg Ab) thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1. These two sample showed the most potency. After 14 days post-injection, most of the animals receiving these conjugates were in partial or complete remission. The lower efficacy of the lower dose thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1 sample confirmed a DM1 dose-related response. Thio-Trastuzumab-DM1 either dosed in equivalent antibody (10 mg\/kg) or DM1 drug (21 mg\/kg) quantity to that of control trastuzumab-SMCC-DM1 conjugate. As seen from the , Thio-BMPEO-DM1 (21 mg\/kg) showed slightly better response than that of trastuzumab-SMCC-DM1 group as some of the animals showed complete response with Thiomab-DM 1 whereas there was only partial response with trastuzumab-SMCC-DM 1.","Administration of Antibody-Drug Conjugates","The antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention are typically prepared for parenteral administration, i.e. bolus, intravenous, intratumor injection with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). For example, lyophilized anti-ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97\/04801, expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile, which is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are disfavored due to hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut, formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Antibody-drug Conjugate Treatments","It is contemplated that the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders, e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary conditions or hyperproliferative disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies. Others include neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic, including autoimmune, disorders.","The ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed similar to the clinical trials testing the efficacy of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody HERCEPTINO\u00ae in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that had received extensive prior anti-cancer therapy as reported by Baselga et al. (1996) J. Clin. Oncol. 14:737-744. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an ADC in combinations with known therapeutic regimens, such as radiation and\/or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and\/or cytotoxic agents.","Generally, the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","The cancer may comprise HER2-expressing cells, such that the ADC of the present invention are able to bind to the cancer cells. To determine ErbB2 expression in the cancer, various diagnostic\/prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment, ErbB2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC, e.g. using the HERCEPTEST (Dako). Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a ErbB2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows: Score 0, no staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of tumor cells; Score 1+, a faint\/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10% of the tumor cells, the cells are only stained in part of their membrane; Score 2+, a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells; Score 3+, a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells. Those tumors with 0 or 1+ scores for ErbB2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not overexpressing ErbB2, whereas those tumors with 2+ or 3+ scores may be characterized as overexpressing ErbB2.","Alternatively, or additionally, FISH assays such as the INFORM\u2122 (Ventana Co., Ariz.) or PATHVISION\u2122 (Vysis, Ill.) may be carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent (if any) of ErbB2 overexpression in the tumor.","Autoimmune diseases for which the ADC compounds may be used in treatment include rheumatologic disorders (such as, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, scleroderma, lupus such as SLE and lupus nephritis, polymyositis\/dermatomyositis, cryoglobulinemia, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis), osteoarthritis, autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disorders (such as, for example, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and celiac disease), vasculitis (such as, for example, ANCA-associated vasculitis, including Churg-Strauss vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and polyarteriitis), autoimmune neurological disorders (such as, for example, multiple sclerosis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune polyneuropathies), renal disorders (such as, for example, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and Berger's disease), autoimmune dermatologic disorders (such as, for example, psoriasis, urticaria, hives, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus), hematologic disorders (such as, for example, thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion purpura, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia), atherosclerosis, uveitis, autoimmune hearing diseases (such as, for example, inner ear disease and hearing loss), Behcet's disease, Raynaud's syndrome, organ transplant, and autoimmune endocrine disorders (such as, for example, diabetic-related autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), Addison's disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease and thyroiditis)). More preferred such diseases include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Graves' disease, IDDM, pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, and glomerulonephritis.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight.","For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg\/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg\/kg of an anti-ErbB2 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","Combination Therapy","An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anti-cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.","The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, and\/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC of the invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin-forming inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.","Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","In one embodiment, treatment with an ADC involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes (such as paclitaxel and docetaxel) and\/or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturer's instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in \u201cChemotherapy Service\u201d, (1992) Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md.","The ADC may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (EP 616812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer, the patient may previously have been subjected to anti-hormonal therapy and, after the cancer becomes hormone independent, the ADC (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and\/or radiation therapy.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","Metabolites of the Antibody-Drug Conjugates","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. C or H) ADC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds of the invention.","Labelled Antibody Imaging Methods","In another embodiment of the invention, cysteine engineered antibodies may be labelled through the cysteine thiol with radionuclides, fluorescent dyes, bioluminescence-triggering substrate moieties, chemiluminescence-triggering substrate moieties, enzymes, and other detection labels for imaging experiments with diagnostic, pharmacodynamic, and therapeutic applications. Generally, the labelled cysteine engineered antibody, i.e. \u201cbiomarker\u201d or \u201cprobe\u201d, is administered by injection, perfusion, or oral ingestion to a living organism, e.g. human, rodent, or other small animal, a perfused organ, or tissue sample. The distribution of the probe is detected over a time course and represented by an image.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an ADC. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","ThioFab-phage (5\u00d710phage particles) were reacted with 150 fold excess of biotin-PEO-maleimide ((+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctainediamine, Oda et al (2001) Nature Biotechnology 19:379-382, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) for 3 hours at room temperature.

The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in PBS (phosphate buffered saline), total cell lysis was performed by passing through a microfluidizer and the ThioFabs were purified by affinity chromatography with protein G SEPHAROSE\u2122 (Amersham).","ThioFabs L-V15C, L-V110C, H-A88C, and H-A121C were expressed and purified by Protein-G SEPHAROSE\u2122 column chromatography. Oligomeric-Fab was present in fractions 26 to 30, and most of the monomeric form was in fractions 31-34. Fractions consisting of the monomeric form were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE along with wild type hu4D5Fabv8 and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gel in reducing (with DTT or BME) and non-reducing (without DTT or BME) conditions. Gel filtration fractions of A121C-ThioFab were analyzed on non-reducing SDS-PAGE.","ThioFabs were conjugated with biotin-PEO-maleimide as described above and the biotinylated-ThioFabs were further purified by Superdex-200\u2122 (Amersham) gel filtration chromatography, which eliminated the free biotin-PEO-maleimide and the oligomeric fraction of ThioFabs. Wild type hu4D5Fabv8 and hu4D5Fabv8 A121C-ThioFab (0.5 mg in quantity) were each and separately incubated with 100 fold molar excess of biotin-PEO-maleimide for 3 hours at room temperature and loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration column to separate free biotin as well as oligomeric Fabs from the monomeric form.","Enzymatic digest fragments of biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8 (A121C) ThioFab and wild type hu4D5Fabv8 were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (LS-ESI-MS) The difference between the 48294.5 primary mass of biotinylated hu4D5Fabv8 (A121C) and the 47737.0 primary mass of wild type hu4D5Fabv8 was 557.5 mass units. This fragment indicates the presence of a single biotin-PEO-maleimide moiety (CHNOS).

Technical Bulletin TB288; Mendoza et al (2002) Cancer Res. 62:5485-5488):","1. An aliquot of 100 \u03bcl of cell culture containing about 10cells (SKBR-3, BT474, MCF7 or MDA-MB-468) in medium was deposited in each well of a 96-well, opaque-walled plate.","2. Control wells were prepared containing medium and without cells.","3. ADC was added to the experimental wells and incubated for 3-5 days.","4. The plates were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.","5. A volume of CellTiter-Glo Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium present in each well was added.","6. The contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis.","7. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescence signal.","8. Luminescence was recorded and reported in graphs as RLU=relative luminescence units.","Certain cells are seeded at 1000-2000\/well (PC3 lines) or 2000-3000\/well (OVCAR-3) in a 96-well plate, 50 uL\/well. After one (PC3) or two (OVCAR-3) days, ADC are added in 50 \u03bcL volumes to final concentration of 9000, 3000, 1000, 333, 111, 37, 12.4, 4.1, or 1.4 ng\/mL, with \u201cno ADC\u201d control wells receiving medium alone.

Many strains are suitable, but FVB female mice are preferred because of their higher susceptibility to tumor formation. FVB males were used for mating and vasectomized CD.1 studs were used to stimulate pseudopregnancy. Vasectomized mice can be obtained from any commercial supplier. Founders were bred with either FVB mice or with 129\/BL6xFVB p53 heterozygous mice. The mice with heterozygosity at p53 allele were used to potentially increase tumor formation. However, this has proven unnecessary. Therefore, some F1 tumors are of mixed strain. Founder tumors are FVB only. Six founders were obtained with some developing tumors without having litters.","Animals having tumors (allograft propagated from Fo5 mmtv transgenic mice) were treated with a single or multiple dose by IV injection of ADC. Tumor volume was assessed at various time points after injection.","Tumors arise readily in transgenic mice that express a mutationally activated form of neu, the rat homolog of HER2, but the HER2 that is overexpressed in human breast cancers is not mutated and tumor formation is much less robust in transgenic mice that overexpress nonmutated HER2 (Webster et al (1994) Semin. Cancer Biol. 5:69-76).","To improve tumor formation with nonmutated HER2, transgenic mice were produced using a HER2 cDNA plasmid in which an upstream ATG was deleted in order to prevent initiation of translation at such upstream ATG codons, which would otherwise reduce the frequency of translation initiation from the downstream authentic initiation codon of HER2 (for example, see Child et al (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274: 24335-24341). Additionally, a chimeric intron was added to the 5\u2032 end, which should also enhance the level of expression as reported earlier (Neuberger and Williams (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:6713; Buchman and Berg (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:4395; Brinster et al (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:836). The chimeric intron was derived from a Promega vector, Pci-neo mammalian expression vector (bp 890-1022). The cDNA 3\u2032-end is flanked by human growth hormone exons 4 and 5, and polyadenylation sequences. Moreover, FVB mice were used because this strain is more susceptible to tumor development. The promoter from MMTV-LTR was used to ensure tissue-specific HER2 expression in the mammary gland. Animals were fed the AlN 76A diet in order to increase susceptibility to tumor formation (Rao et al (1997) Breast Cancer Res. and Treatment 45:149-158).","Full length, cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies (ThioMabs) expressed in CHO cells were reduced with about a 50 fold excess of TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.) for 3 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. The reduced ThioMab () was diluted and loaded onto a HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, and eluted with PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. The eluted reduced ThioMab was treated with 200 nM aqueous copper sulfate (CuSO) at room temperature, overnight. Ambient air oxidation was also effective.","The reoxidized ThioMabs from Example 11, including thio-trastuzumab (A121C), thio-2H9 (A121C), and thio-3A5 (A121C), were combined with a 10 fold excess of drug-linker intermediate, BM(PEO)4-DM1, mixed, and let stand for about an hour at room temperature to effect conjugation and form the ThioMab antibody-drug conjugates, including thio-trastuzumab (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1, thio-2H9 (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1, and thio-3A5 (A121C)-BMPEO-DM1.
