{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/594,512 filed on Apr. 14, 2005, which application is hereby incorporated by reference.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and, more particularly, to an electrically-fired, gun-launched round that contains a plurality of projectiles therein.","Traditional non-lethal ordnance comprises cartridges containing, for example, metal balls coated with a thin layer of plastic or rubber, fabric bags which are filled with lead shot (so-called \u201cbean bags\u201d), and \u201crubber balls\u201d formed of hard rubber, foam, plastic or wood. When dealing with a large number of people, such as an unruly crowd, many non-lethal cartridges must be fired in a short period of time to have much effect. Traditional delivery systems for non-lethal cartridges may fire one or a few cartridges before reloading is needed. Thus, a large number of weapons and a large number of weapon users are required. When the large number of people comprise an enemy military force that is close in, there is also a need for a short range cartridge that is lethal to a large group of combatants.","Some military operations require use of both lethal and non-lethal force. The U.S. Army has formidable lethal guns, such as tanks and large caliber guns. However, when a non-lethal force is needed, these valuable assets are useless. Therefore, there is a need for a non-lethal round that can be fired from a conventional gun, such as a tank or a large caliber piece, without any modifications to the conventional gun.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,329 discloses barrel assemblies loaded with a plurality of projectiles. However, the disclosed projectiles are not suited for non-lethal applications. Furthermore, the barrels are not suited for use with a conventional large caliber gun. Many of the projectiles require an axial support member, which limits the volume of the payload space available in each projectile.","It is an object of the invention to provide an electrically-fired round that can be used in a conventional large caliber gun, such as, for example, a 120 mm gun.","It is another object of the invention to provide an electrically-fired round that can carry either lethal or non-lethal payload.","It is a further object of the invention to provide an electrically-fired round containing multiple projectiles.","One aspect of the invention is an electrically-fired round comprising a case sized to fit in a conventional large caliber gun; a launch tube disposed in the case; a plurality of projectiles axially stacked in the launch tube; each projectile comprising a cylindrical body having a circular lid that closes the forward end and a circular base that closes the rear end, the circular lid and the circular base defining a payload volume therebetween, the circular base including a cavity formed therein, a propellant charge disposed in the cavity, and an igniter disposed in the propellant charge; a case base plate that closes a rear end of the case; and electrical connections between the case base plate and each igniter.","The round may further comprise additional launch tubes disposed in the case, each additional launch tube containing a plurality of projectiles axially stacked therein; each projectile comprising a cylindrical body having a circular lid that closes the forward end and a circular base that closes the rear end, the circular lid and the circular base defining a payload volume therebetween, the circular base including a cavity formed therein, a propellant charge disposed in the cavity, and an igniter disposed in the propellant charge.","The round may include a lethal or a non-lethal payload disposed in each payload volume.","In one embodiment, the cylindrical body of each projectile includes at least one longitudinal groove formed therein.","Another aspect of the invention is a method comprising providing a conventional large caliber gun having an electrical pulse firing mechanism; loading the gun with the round described herein; and operating the firing mechanism of the gun in a conventional manner.","A further aspect of the invention is an electrically-fired round comprising a case sized to fit in a conventional large caliber gun; a launch tube disposed in the case; a plurality of projectiles axially stacked in the launch tube; each projectile comprising a cylindrical body having a circular lid that closes the forward end and a circular base that closes the rear end, the circular lid and the circular base defining a payload volume therebetween, the circular base including a cavity formed therein with a propellant charge disposed in the cavity; the launch tube including openings in its sidewall, the openings being disposed adjacent propellant charges of the projectiles, each opening including an igniter; a case base plate that closes a rear end of the case; and electrical connections between the case base plate and each igniter.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","14","14","18","14","38","14","36","18","14","20","18","18","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 2"],"b":["20","20","22","24","26","24","26","28","26","30","32","30","32","40","38","18","14","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["50","50","50","10","50","50","14","38","18","14","14","18","50","18","10","12","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIGS. 4A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["50","18","20","20","50","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["20","50","20","22","24","26","24","26","28","26","30","32","30","34","32","40","38","22","24","26"]},"Payload volume  may be filled with a lethal or non-lethal payload. An example of a non-lethal payload is one or more hard rubber balls . An example of a lethal payload is shards of metal. The circular base  of each projectile  includes an opening  for an electrical wire  connected to the igniter . Each launch tube  includes openings  () for the electrical wires  that are connected to the igniters  at first ends and to the case base plate  at second ends.","As shown in , the cylindrical body  of each projectile  may include at least one longitudinal groove  formed therein. Grooves  are formed on the external surface of body  and comprise areas of reduced wall thickness. The grooves  can have a variety of shapes. The purpose of the grooves  is to help body  split and deform after it leaves the launch tube . The body  will split at grooves  and peel back, thereby allowing the payload therein to disperse.  shows the projectile  after exit from the gun muzzle. Of course, projectiles  may be constructed without grooves .","An important advantage of the invention is that the rounds ,  can be used in a conventional gun without any modifications to the gun. For example, in the case of a 120 mm tank gun, the gun operator pushes a button or trigger that sends an electrical pulse to the gun breech. When using rounds  or , this electrical pulse is received by a circuit at the case base plate .  is an enlarged view of a portion of the case base plate . The electric trigger pulse travels through wires  that are connected to a circuit board . Circuit board  is mounted inside case base plate . Wires  from all the igniters  in all the projectiles  also connect to the circuit board .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["20","50","100","20","50","100","20","50","58","18","20","20"]},"In , use of the word \u201cfuse\u201d refers to an igniter  in a projectile . Each igniter or fuse  is wired directly to the circuit board . The rounds ,  fire a single projectile  per pulse . The wires leading to each igniter are sheared off when its respective projectile is fired. In one mode, a launch tube  can have all its projectiles  sequentially fired before moving to another launch tube . In another mode, the forward most projectile in each tube may be sequentially fired, then the next forward most, etc.","An important feature of the circuit board  is its static memory. The static memory requires no power. Thus, a round  may be loaded, fired several times and then removed from the gun and stored. When the round  is taken from storage and reloaded in the gun, the static memory of the circuit board  will \u201cremember\u201d which projectile is to be fired next. Of course, other firing methods may be hard-wired or programmed into the circuit board .","In one exemplary embodiment, seven 40 mm launch tubes  are used in an electrically-fired 120 mm tank gun. Each projectile  contains about 40 dense rubber balls . The propellant charge  is chosen to propel the rubber balls  to a muzzle velocity of about 400-500 ft\/sec. An exemplary volume of propellant is 0.5 grams of smokeless propellant. The rubber balls  are effective as a non-lethal weapon for distances of about 50-100 meters from the tank gun.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["60","60","18","14","60","62","64","66","64","66","28","54","66","72","68","72"]},"The launch tube  including openings  in its sidewall. The openings  are disposed adjacent respective propellant charges  of the projectiles . The circular base  may include a notched portion  also filled with propellant . The propellant in the notched portion  is adjacent the opening  in the tube . An igniter  is disposed in or over each opening . Electrical connections between the case base plate  and each igniter  may comprise wires . In this embodiment, it is not necessary to thread wires  into the launch tube  because the igniters  are not inside the launch tube . One or more launch tubes  may be loaded with projectiles  and inserted in a case , as described before.","While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIGS. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6C","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
