{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61\/350,422, filed on Jun. 1, 2010, the contents of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","At least a portion of the work leading to the disclosed inventions was made using federal support by the National Institute of Health's NIBIB (National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) under grant #R01 EB007117. The government has certain rights in the disclosed inventions.","The disclosed inventions are in the field of devices for detecting pressure amplitude.","Hydrophone devices are capable of detecting pressure amplitude in immersion media such as liquids or gases and in solids as well. Several different types of hydrophone devices are known in the art. New applications for sensing and use of pressure amplitude in liquids, solids and gases, including clinical, sonar, and communication applications require improved hydrophones for calibration, metrology, medical metrology, elasticity of medium, imaging, detection, therapy, diagnosis, and the like.","One type of hydrophone device known in the art is a piezoelectric hydrophone device. Piezoelectric hydrophones may be used for measurement of large frequency bandwidths; however, problems arise from the generation of high temperatures and cavitation effects that are produced by High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) fields, High Intensity Therapeutic Ultrasound (HITU) fields, lithotripter fields or the like. These problems generally could lead to device failure due to high pressure amplitudes. Currently, such devices tend to be costly and cumbersome, and tend to have large apertures which can spatially average certain acoustic fields. For example, existing hydrophone probes have aperture diameters on the order of about 500 \u03bcm or more which introduces spatial averaging of acoustic fields beyond 3 MHz. This spatial averaging can lead to errors in detection and faithful reproduction of the pressure-time waveform of the measured acoustic wave and result in poor spatial resolution.","Other acoustic pressure sensors have been proposed as well, including a limited range of fiber optic based pressure sensors that exploits amplitude variations. There are at least two other broad classifications based on the sensing mechanism for these sensors, namely phase modulated and wavelength modulated pressure sensors. Included in phase modulated sensors are Mach-Zehnder interferometers, Fabry-Perot resonant structures and multilayer resonant structures that act as microinterferometers. These interoferometric phase schemes however, are subject to phase fluctuation which may result in higher amplitude noise of the sensor signal. Phase fluctuations, temperature drift and other problems associated with phase modulated fiber optic hydrophones can cause errors in measurement.","Wavelength modulated phase sensors employing external Bragg's cells, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and distributed Bragg reflectors have also been proposed. These fiber optic hydrophone devices perform acoustic sensing based on an acoustically induced change in the wavelength of optical signals passing through the given sensor. These wavelength modulated sensors are usually distributed along the length of the fiber and have sensing dimensions on the order of a few millimeters. The typical range for sensing regions in wavelength modulated sensors is on the order of about 600 \u03bcm to about 3 mm. This large sensing dimension causes the sensors to suffer from poor spatial resolution thus limiting the resolution bandwidth. For this reason, wavelength modulated fiber optic hydrophones cannot be used in many ultrasound applications.","Thus, what is needed is a novel, high sensitivity sub-micron resolution rugged hydrophone probe that would be able to characterize acoustic fields in the frequency range up to 100 MHz while minimizing spatial averaging, phase fluctuations, or both.","Accordingly, the present invention provides for systems for detecting changes in pressure in an immersion medium such as a liquid, a gas, or a solid, the system comprising: an optical fiber, wherein said optical fiber has a core diameter at an immersion surface contact of the fiber of less than 10 \u03bcm; and a layer of material deposited on said end of the fiber, wherein said layer of material has a thickness of from about 2 nm to about 10 nm. In another embodiment, the fiber may have a diameter of less than about 20 um, and the diameter may be selected based on the frequency of the ultra sound.","The present invention also provides for methods for detecting changes in pressure in an immersion medium, such as a liquid or gas, or in a solid (collectively media or medium), the method comprising: contacting the medium with a fiber optic, wherein said fiber optic integrated with a light source and a detector, and wherein said fiber optic has a diameter of less than 10 \u03bcm at an immersion surface contact of the fiber; providing a thin layer of material on the immersion surface contact, wherein said thin layer of material is of a thickness in a range of from about 2 nm to about 10 nm; and detecting Fresnel back reflections from the immersion end of the fiber.","Also provided are methods of making a device for detecting acoustic waves in an immersion medium such as a liquid, gas, or solid, comprising: providing an optical fiber having a core diameter at an immersion surface contact of less than about 10 \u03bcm; and depositing on said immersion contact surface of the fiber a layer of material having a thickness of from about 2 nm to about 10 nm.","The general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. Other aspects of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the detailed description of the invention as provided herein.","The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying figures and examples, which form a part of this disclosure. It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific devices, methods, applications, conditions or parameters described and\/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting of the claimed invention. Also, as used in the specification including the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include the plural, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular value, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term \u201cplurality\u201d, as used herein, means more than one. When a range of values is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and\/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent \u201cabout,\u201d it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. All ranges are inclusive and combinable.","It is to be appreciated that certain features of the invention which are, for clarity, described herein in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention that are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any subcombination. Further, reference to values stated in ranges include each and every value within that range.","As used herein, an immersion medium is any liquid, solid or gas capable of transmitting acoustic waves. An immersion end of the fiber optic hydrophone is the end of the fiber used in Fresnel back reflection mode and the immersion surface contact is the tip of the immersion end of the fiber having Fresnel back reflections associated therewith.","In an embodiment, an intensity modulated fiber optic hydrophone operating in a Fresnel reflective mode is provided with a fiber having a diameter at the immersion end of the fiber of under about 10 \u03bcm in order to characterize a frequency range of from about 0.5 MHz to about 500 MHz, where, as a specific example, a frequency range of up to about 100 MHz would require a fiber immersion surface contact diameter of about 7 \u03bcm for sampling at 100 MHz without introducing spatial averaging. It is possible that the diameter of the fiber would be less than 20 um, or even less than 30 um, and that the diameter may depend on the frequency of the signal being measured. The immersion end of the fiber may be provided with a thin layer of material having a thickness of from about 2 nm to about 12 nm on the immersion surface contact of the fiber and may also have an associated geometry, such as, for example, tapering, cleaving, or etching. As an example, the fiber optic hydrophones disclosed herein can be configured to measure the p-t waveform of the ultrasound field. These measurements may be used in one or more ways, such as, for example, for calibration of ultrasound devices, as a reference for ultrasound devices during use of the ultrasound device, metrology, medical metrology, determination of complex sensitivity vs. frequency, imaging, detection, sonar, diagnosis, communications, therapy and the like. Such devices may be optimized for sensitivity based on specific wavelengths, geometries, indexes of refraction, composition, diameters, plasmon excitation frequencies, and the like, for the selected thin layer materials.","In an example embodiment, a light source, a detector, and a thin layer of material can be provided. Light from the light source may be transmitted through the fiber. The thin layer of material is deposited on the immersion surface contact of the fiber, wherein the immersion end of the fiber is contacted with an immersion material, wherein the immersion material is any gas, liquid or solid. The immersion surface contact may thusly be contacted with the liquid, solid or gas. The detector may detect Fresnel back reflections due to the change in index of refraction between the immersion contact surface of the fiber, the thin layer of material and the immersion material, or solid. Changes in pressure may cause the index of refraction of the immersion material or solid to change, or it may place strain on the immersion material, as it may also cause the index of refraction of the thin layer of material to change due to strain. The changes in index cause a change in the Fresnel back reflections. The detector detects these changes in Fresnel reflections and correlates them with the change in index of refraction. Pressure measurements of the immersion medium or solid may then be determined. In an embodiment, light from the source passes through the fiber, is reflected from the end of the fiber by the thin film of dielectric material and is detected by a detector. Variations in the amount of reflected light may be used to determine the pressure acting on the thin film, which may be proportionate to the pressure acting on the immersion material or solid material.","In a configuration of the example embodiment mentioned above, the thickness of the thin film may be in the range of from about 1 nm to about 30 nm. Early research in these thin films predicted that a decrease in the thickness of a thin film below 30 nm would not yield an increase in the sensitivity. This view was due in part to the perception that the thin layer was over an order of magnitude thinner than the wavelength of light (1550 nm wavelength with a 50 nm layer of material), so no great variation in sensitivity was expected. Surprisingly, however, new increases in sensitivity and sensitivity maxima were found by decreasing the layer thickness. For example, in one configuration, the thickness of the film may be in the range of from about 1.5 nm to about 25 nm. In another configuration, the thickness of the film may be in the range of from about 2 nm to about 20 nm. In a further configuration, the thickness of the film may be in the range of from about 2.5 nm to about 15 nm. In another configuration, the thickness of the film can be in the range of from about 3 nm to about 10 nm, or even in the range of from about 3.5 nm to about 8 nm.","In an example embodiment, the optimum thickness of the thin film may be determined based on the optimum back reflectance equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["n","c"]}}]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["n","c"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["n","w"]}}]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["n","w"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["n","g"]}}]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["n","g"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["k","g"]}}]},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","msub":{"mi":["k","g"]}},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]}]}],"mo":["+","+","+"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mi":"where"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-3","num":"00001.3"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"R","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u0393","in"]},{"mi":["\u0393","in"]},{"mi":["\u0393","in"]}],"mo":["\u2062","*","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"and"},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["n","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","c"]},{"mi":["n","w"]}],"mo":"-"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","w"]},{"mi":["n","c"]}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":"-","msubsup":{"mi":["n","d"],"mn":"2"}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["tanh","\u03b3","d"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}],"mo":"+"},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["n","d"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","c"]},{"mi":["n","w"]}],"mo":"+"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","w"]},{"mi":["n","c"]}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":"+","msubsup":{"mi":["n","d"],"mn":"2"}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["tanh","\u03b3","d"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}],"mo":"+"}]}}}}}],"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b3","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"\u03c0","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":["j","k"],"mo":"\u00b7"}}}}},"mi":"\u03bb"}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["c","w","d"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"R"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"d"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"d"},{"mo":"\u2202","mi":"p"}]},"mo":"."}}}}}},"Optimum slope value of reflectance and pressure is achieved in optimum change in complex index of coating layer due to pressure.

Acoustic waves acting on the immersion medium may cause a change in the index of refraction of the immersion medium, which in turn would cause a change in the Fresnel reflectance. Moreover, measurements in the change of Fresnel back reflectance may also be correlated with changes in pressure at the immersed end. Other aspects of the principle and use of reflective fiber optic hydrophones will be well known to one having ordinary skill in the art.","In an embodiment, an addition of a thin layer of material on the immersion surface contact of a fiber sensor can provide an improvement in sensitivity over the sensitivity of an uncoated fiber. Initial exploration of this phenomena using transmission line models and other analytical methods provided an estimate of ideal thickness on the order of over about 30 nm Surprisingly, however, improved models, testing, and methods have shown that there is a further increase in sensitivity using thinner layers than previously suggested. In fact, using the previously known models, any decrease from a 30 nm coating layer would not have provided any increase in the sensitivity of the hydrophone. New experiments and analysis have shown, however that there is a surprising increase in sensitivity with even thinner layers of material.","In another embodiment a wavelength of a light source or laser, the taper angle of the immersion end of the fiber, the core and cladding diameter, taper length, fiber index, thin layer material, thin layer thickness and other fiber geometries may be varied in order to change, and in some circumstances to increase the sensitivity of the fiber optic hydrophone.

In another embodiment, the plasmon excitation frequency of the material selected for use as the thin layer material may be considered in determining the ideal thickness of the layer. For example the plasmon resonance frequency for a given material at a given wavelength may be used to determine the optimal thickness for the thin layer. As a further example, a method of manufacture of these materials may optimize a fiber optic hydrophone by varying the above noted elements for a particular use or a range of uses.

As non-limiting examples, the layer may comprise one or more of Ag, Au, Pt, Al, Co, Ni, Ti, Ga, In, Cr, Mo, any other metal and\/or any metallic alloy. Plasmon resonance frequencies of metallic materials having large change in complex index of refraction properties during stress may be used to select a material. A metal or combination of metal materials may be used to form the thin layer of material on the immersion surface contact of the fiber.

Knowledge of the reflectance and strain properties of a metallic material or dielectric material may be used to optimize the sensitivity of a fiber optic hydrophone for a given application or range of applications.","The thin layer of material described above may be coated on the immersion surface contact of the fiber using any method known in the art. As one example, a thin material such as, for example gold may be coated using one or more of sputtering techniques, molecular beam epitaxy, metaorganic chemical vapor deposition, evaporation techniques, wet or dry chemistry techniques, or any other film growth or coating technique. In one embodiment, the fiber optic hydrophones disclosed herein may be placed in harsh environments, that is, environments having very high levels of pressure amplitude. Other known hydrophones may have failed, for example, near or in the focal zones or volumes of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) fields, High Intensity Therapeutic Ultrasound (HITU) fields, or in Lithotripsy calibration. In one embodiment, the fiber optic hydrophone disclosed herein may be particularly suited to measurement of these high levels of pressure amplitude because a failure mode is peeling off of the thin layer of material on the tip of the fiber. In such an example, one or more of the above mentioned layer growth or deposition methods may provide increased adhesion.","In an embodiment the thickness of the layers can be selected such that they are optimized for sensitivity to pressure. As used herein, sensitivity to pressure may comprise the ratio of change in index of refraction of the layer to a change in pressure of the immersion medium or solid. In one embodiment, the more a layer changes index of refraction as changes in pressure in an immersion medium or solid, the more sensitive it is. As an example of the above, changes in index of refraction may cause changes in the amount of light received at the detector, which may thus be proportional to the change in pressure of the immersion medium or solid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306"]},"In an embodiment, the immersion end of a fiber optic hydrophone may also be a tapered immersion end . The tapered fiber may have a taper length  and a taper angle . The taper may be linear, or it may be exponential or it may have any other suitable geometry such as parabolic or hyperbolic. The tapered fiber will have an immersion surface contact  and may comprise a thin layer of material .","In an embodiment, the immersion end of a fiber optic hydrophone may also be an etched end . In one embodiment this will be a cylindrical etch, while in another embodiment it may be an elliptical etch or have a different etching geometry. The immersion end of the fiber will have an immersion surface contact  and may comprise a thin layer of material .","In another embodiment, the immersion end of a fiber optic hydrophone may have be an angle cleaved fiber . This cleave angle  may be any angle in a range of from about 0 degrees to about 45 degrees. The immersion contact surface of the angled cleave may comprise a thin layer of material .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 4("],"i":["a","f","a","b","c","d","e","f","e"]},"The tapering of the fiber may be linear, however, in another embodiment, the tapering may not be linear, but may instead be an exponential tapering or it may be tapered according to any other method known in the art, such as, for example, hyperbolic or parabolic or otherwise non-linear. As an example, the tapering angle may be in a range of between about 0 degrees and about 45 degrees. The tapering length on a fiber optic hydrophone may be any length known in the art and may comprise any length in a range of from about 10 \u03bcm to about 1 mm.","The selection of the tapering angle, tapering length and other geometries of the tip of the fiber may be selected in order to optimize the sensitivity of the fiber optic hydrophone. As shown below with respect to , in one experimental setup, the taper angle and geometry had an effect on the sensitivity. While the taper angle and taper length may be beneficial to the sensitivity of the fiber optic hydrophone in some embodiments, the above is not intended to imply that taper angles and lengths are necessary for any particular embodiment. Further, it should be noted that various aspects of a fiber optic hydrophone have relationships between them. For example, a straight cleaved, non-etched fiber at 980 nm require a thin layer of material at a first thickness in order to optimize the sensitivity of the fiber optic hydrophone. However, a tapered, etched fiber at 980 nm may require a thin layer of material at a second thickness in order to optimize the sensitivity of the fiber optic hydrophone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 4(","i":["a","b"],"b":["402","404","406","408","412","414"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 7(","FIG. 7(","FIG. 7"],"i":["a","b"]},"As noted above, it is expected that the fiber optic hydrophones described may be manufactured or used in a variety of manners.
