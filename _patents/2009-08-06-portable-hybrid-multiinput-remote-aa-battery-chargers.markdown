{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment to us of any royalty thereon.","The present invention relates generally to the field of battery charging devices and apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger.","Each year millions of dollars are spent on rechargeable batteries for use in portable electronics equipment. Due to their low life-cycle costs, rechargeable batteries are the power source of choice for numerous equipment applications, both civilian and military. There is currently no convenient and cost-effective way for recharging such batteries for remote military tactical maneuvers because currently available battery chargers are not generally portable and require other power sources, such a generator or military vehicle, connectors, and so on that would usually be available at a typical military installation, but would not be available during tactical field operations in a remote, dangerous and hostile location. Because of the unavailability of battery charging equipment in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations, our military forces typically do not take full advantage of the battery energy that would be available from a recharged battery. This practice results in the waste of millions of dollars in battery life or energy every year, and aids in the degradation of rechargeable batteries.","Not only does the military user refrain from recharging the battery because of field conditions, they tend to carry multiple spare batteries to ensure that their communications and other equipment are constantly available. Although redundant spare batteries by themselves are not excessively heavy, carrying redundant spare batteries on field maneuvers along with other required equipment can create a difficult weight problem for the individual soldier in the field with a fully loaded back-pack. In those cases, the extra weight could make the soldier susceptible to fatigue and have a detrimental impact on his survivability in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations. Another undesirable result form carrying redundant spare batteries is that the soldier may choose to omit other equipment from the fully-loaded backpack, and depending upon what equipment is left behind, such an omission might have a disastrous impact on the mission, and more importantly, his survivability.","Similarly, the non-military battery user can often be in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations where the ability to charge a rechargeable battery could increase both comfort and survivability. For example, a recreational camper or boater might be lost or stranded with inoperable battery-operated communications equipment suffering from a low state of charge due to the absence of a portable battery charger for a remote location.","Thus there has been a long-felt need for a portable battery charger that will allow the soldier or recreational camper to have portable battery recharging capacity in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations that alleviates the shortcomings, limitations, and disadvantages of currently available battery charging techniques.","In order to satisfy the long-felt need for a portable battery charger that will allow the soldier or recreational user to have portable battery recharging capability in remote, dangerous, and hostile locations without the shortcomings, limitations, and disadvantages of currently available battery charging equipment, the present invention provides a portable electrochemical charger for rechargeable AA batteries. This invention's portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger can recharge as many as four (4) AA batteries at once within 100 minutes. This invention's battery charger for rechargeable batteries can also be powered by a number of the currently available military batteries such as the BA-8180, BA-8140, BA-5590, BA-5390, BB-390, BB-2590, and SP4 batteries.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a portable electrochemical charger for rechargeable AA batteries.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a portable multi-input charger for rechargeable AA batteries.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide to provide a portable hybrid multi-input remote AA charger for rechargeable AA batteries.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method for charging AA rechargeable batteries with a portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger.","These and other objects are advantageously accomplished with this invention's portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger, which comprises a battery chamber, slots for the AA batteries, a charging circuit, a housing, and a pair of female and male connectors. In accordance with this invention, the remotely located user can now recharge as many as four (4) AA batteries at one time within 100 minutes. Other embodiments of this invention provide a portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger apparatus and a method for charging AA rechargeable batteries with a portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger.","This invention's portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger provides an innovative charging application for the military BB-2950 battery and other AA batteries and, in particular, to rechargeable nickel metal hydride AA batteries. The increased use of the rechargeable nickel metal hydride AA batteries in military communications and other applications makes this invention's portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger particularly useful for those applications without suffering from the disadvantages, shortcomings, and limitations of prior art battery chargers. This invention can be used by soldiers in the field or others operating electrical equipment in remote locations such as recreational campers or boaters. This invention's portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger can also be powered with numerous different military portable power sources such as the BA-8180, BA-8140, BA-5590, BA-5390, BB-390, BB-2590, and SP4 batteries.","Referring now to , there is depicted a top breakaway view of this invention's portable hybrid multi-input remote AA battery charger , comprising a battery chamber , slots  for the AA batteries, and a charging circuit represented by a broken line rectangle  positioned underneath the battery chamber . The slots  are dimensioned to accept AA batteries and include the necessary contact points  and . The battery chamber , battery slots , and charging circuit  are installed in a housing  having a pair of means for external power source connection. The female means for external power source connection  can be a BB-2590 charging connector that connects to the BB-2590 rechargeable lithium ion battery.
