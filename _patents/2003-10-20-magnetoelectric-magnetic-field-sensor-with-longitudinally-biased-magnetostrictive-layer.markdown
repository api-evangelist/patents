title: Magnetoelectric magnetic field sensor with longitudinally biased magnetostrictive layer
abstract: A magnetoelectric magnetic field sensor has one or more laminated magnetostrictive layers and piezoelectric layers. The magnetostrictive layers are magnetized by a bias magnetic field in a longitudinal, in-plane direction. The piezoelectric layers can be poled in the longitudinal direction or perpendicular direction. The longitudinal magnetization of the magnetostrictive layers provides greatly increased sensitivity at lower bias fields compared to other magnetoelectric sensors. Perpendicular poling of the piezoelectric layers tends to provide higher sensitivity at lower detection frequency (e.g. less than 1 Hz). Longitudinal poling tends to provide higher sensitivity at high detection frequency (e.g. above 10 Hz). Also included are embodiments having relative thicknesses for the magnetostrictive layers that are optimized for sensitivity. Equations are provided for calculating the best relative thickness for the magnetostrictive layer for maximum sensitivity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/419,102 filed Oct. 18, 2002.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 414167, 430955 and 430948 awarded by the Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to magnetic field sensors. More specifically, the present invention relates to a magnetic field sensor having laminated piezoelectric and magnetostrictive layers in which the magnetostrictive layers are biased in a direction parallel with the layer plane.","Magnetic sensors are used in many applications such as rotational and torque sensors for motors, proximity sensors for anomaly detection and the like. Magnetic sensors can also be used for biomedical imaging if made sensitive enough.","Long-range proximity detectors and biomedical imaging devices require magnetic field sensitivity on the order of 1 picoTesla\/\u221aHz or better. Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) exceed this sensitivity, but are very expensive and power-consumptive since they require cryogenic cooling. Other sensors such as fiber optic magnetometers and fluxgate magnetometers are less expensive than SQUIDs, but in theory have a lower sensitivity on the order of 10 pT\/\u221aHz that in practice has not been achieved.","Also, long-range proximity sensors and magnetic imaging devices would find broader applications if they require very little power or operate passively. This would enable remote and portable operation of magnetic sensors, for which there are applications in proximity sensing and monitoring. Optical magnetometers and fluxgate magnetometers require too much power to be operated remotely; and also, in practice have failed to achieve their theoretical sensitivity levels. Coil type sensors are passive, but have limited frequency operational ranges and low sensitivity.","It would be an advance in the art of magnetic sensing technology to provide a highly sensitive magnetic field sensor that is inexpensive, requires very little operating power, and which can operate at low frequencies.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,675,252 to Podney describes a sensitive, passive magnetic field sensor comprising laminated magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers. When exposed to a varying magnetic field, strain in the magnetostrictive layers is coupled to the piezoelectric layers, thereby creating a voltage that is detected. Podney employs a large number of layers to provide high sensitivity. Podney does not teach any particular direction for the bias magnetic field or magnetization of the device.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,279,406 to Li et al. also teaches a magnetic field sensor comprising a bonded magnetostrictive layer and a piezoelectric layer. Li et al. fails to teach an optimal configuration for a magnetostrictive\/piezoelectric magnetic field sensor.","The present invention includes a magnetoelectric magnetic field sensor having a magnetostrictive layer with a longitudinal magnetization, wherein the magnetostrictive layer has a length in the magnetization direction that is greater than a transverse length. The longitudinal direction is parallel with the layers. A piezoelectric layer is bonded to the magnetostrictive layer.","The sensor may further comprise a means (e.g. permanent magnet or electromagnet) for providing a longitudinal bias magnetic field in the magnetostrictive layer. The bias field can have a strength of about 200\u20131000 Oersteds, for example.","The piezoelectric layer can be poled in a direction perpendicular to the layers, or in the longitudinal direction.","The magnetostrictive layer can be 1.5, 3, 4 5, 10 100 or more times longer in the longitudinal direction than the transverse direction.","The sensor can comprise any number of magnetostrictive layers, and any number of piezoelectric layers.","Additionally, the present invention includes magnetic field sensors wherein adjacent magnetostrictive layers and piezoelectric layers have a thickness ratio selected to provide optimum sensitivity. Equations are provided for calculating the optimum thickness ratio.","The present invention provides a magnetoelectric magnetic field sensor with extremely high sensitivity and low operating power requirements. The present sensor is sensitive enough to potentially provide long range (e.g. 0.01\u20131 km) sensing of vehicles and shorter range (<1 m) biomedical imaging (e.g. magnetoencephalographic imaging and magnetocardiac imaging).","The present sensor has laminated magnetostrictive (MS) and piezoelectric (PZ) layers. An applied magnetic field strains the MS layer, which strains the PZ layer, thereby creating a detected output voltage. Significantly, the MS layer is magnetized by a bias field in a direction parallel to the plane of the MS layer (a longitudinal direction). Also, the magnetization layer has a length in the direction parallel with the magnetization that is greater than the transverse width. Additionally, the MS layers and PZ layers have an optimum thickness ratio for obtaining a maximum sensitivity. These three features provide exceptional sensitivity to magnetic fields, even with a relatively small bias magnetic field. The PZ layer can be poled longitudinally or perpendicularly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["4","2","2","8","2","6","2","2","4","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","22","24","22","24","25","22","24","26","22","24","26","22","24","22","24","26","27","26"]},"Another important parameter is the ratio of the aggregate thickness of the MS layers to the total device thickness. The optimum thickness ratio depends on the MS material and PZ material. Equations for determining the optimal MS thickness\/device thickness ratio are provided below. Typically the optimal MS\/total device thickness ratio is about 0.5\u20130.8.","The longitudinal dimension L and transverse dimension T are not limited. They can each be in the range of about 1\u2013100 mm, for example. The thickness of each layer is also not limited. In typical devices, the thickness of the layers    can be in the range of about 0.01\u20135 mm, for example.","Output wires   are electrically connected to the top and bottom surfaces of the PZ layer , which provides the output voltage. In the embodiment of , the output wires are connected to the MS layers   which are electrically conductive and in electrical contact with the PZ layer .","In the embodiment of , the PZ layer  is poled in the Z direction, perpendicular to the layers. The configuration of  is referred to as a L-P configuration, since the MS magnetization is longitudinal and the PZ poling is perpendicular.","The adhesive layers  can comprise many different kinds of adhesives such as high strength epoxy, braze, solder or the like. If epoxy is used, it should be processed (e.g. exposed to vacuum) so that voids or air bubbles are not present in the adhesive layer . Also, in the embodiment of  the epoxy layer should be thin (\u02dc5 \u03bcm) and conductive (e.g. metal-filled) to provide electrical contact between top and bottom surfaces of the PZ layer  and the MS layers  . It is also noted that a thin epoxy bond is preferred because epoxy tends to absorb and dissipate mechanical energy, thereby reducing sensitivity; a thin epoxy layer (e.g. 10 microns or less) minimizes this undesirable effect.","The MS layers   can be made of many different magnetostrictive materials that have either a positive or negative magnetostrictive coefficient. Preferably, the magnetostrictive coefficient is as high as possible. Examples of suitable MS materials include nickel, iron-gallium alloys, iron-cobalt alloys, and TERFENOL-D (TERFENOL-D is a tradename for a Tb\u2014Dy\u2014Fe intermetallic compound with a large positive magnetostrictive coefficient). The MS layers   can be the same or different materials, and in some applications of this invention only one of the MS layers   may be required.","The PZ layer  can be made of many different piezoelectric materials and can be crystalline or multicrystalline. Examples of suitable PZ materials include PZT (lead zirconium titanate), PMN-PT (crystalline or multicrystalline), PZN-PT, and quartz. The piezoelectric coefficient of the PZ material should be as high as possible. However, it is important to note that PZ materials typically have several piezoelectric coefficients and that the most important coefficient depends upon the device geometry. In the device of , with a perpendicularly-poled PZ layer, the most important piezoelectric coefficient is the d31 coefficient (d31 piezoelectric constant). Preferably, the d31 piezoelectric coefficient is as large as possible in the L-P device of .","In operation, the bias field  is applied, and the output wires   are connected to a high-impedance (e.g. 10 MegaOhm or higher) differential amplifier (not shown) or other device that can detect small induced voltages (e.g. from nV to V for sensing fields). The sensor is located within a time-varying magnetic field to be detected. Preferably, the sensor is oriented so that the detected magnetic field changes the magnetic field component parallel with the longitudinal direction (e.g. varies the amplitude of the bias field ). When the magnetic field in the longitudinal direction changes, the magnetization of the MS layers   changes. As a result, the MS layers   are strained in the longitudinal direction, and the PZ layer  is strained in the longitudinal direction. The PZ layer  creates a voltage at the output wires   indicative of the detected magnetic field.","There are geometric requirements in the laminate design for achieving optimum sensitivity. Providing the laminated magnetostrictive\/piezoelectric layers with a large L\/T aspect ratio (e.g. greater than 2 or 4) and a relatively large cross-sectional area helps to assure enhanced sensitivity. A high L\/T aspect ratio enhances the laminate's sensitivity because it favors the principle vibration mode along the length direction, which is the maximally sensitive direction for the magnetostrictive layers. A high cross-sectional area in the magnetic field direction (i.e. T-dimension multiplied by height in Z-direction for a rectangular device) increases the laminate's sensitivity because the device will capture a larger magnetic flux.","Preferably, the bias field  is adjusted so that the strain in the MS layers   has maximum sensitivity to small fluctuations in the detected magnetic field. In the present sensors, there exists an optimal bias field for maximum sensitivity; a bias field too large or too small will produce less than maximum sensitivity. Typically, the optimal bias field is in the range of about 200\u20131000 Oersteds. However, the optimal bias field depends upon a number of factors including the elastic properties of the piezoelectric material and magnetostrictive material, the magnetostrictive coefficient of the MS material, and the piezoelectric coefficient of the PZ material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["20","22","24","20","28","30","20","30"]},"Any magnetostrictive materials can be used in the L-L configuration including nickel, iron-gallium alloys, iron-cobalt alloys, and TERFENOL-D. Also, any longitudinally-polarizable piezoelectric materials can be used in the L-L configuration including PZT, PMN-PT (crystalline or multicrystalline), PZN-PT, and quartz. The adhesive  in the L-L configuration is preferably electrically insulating and provide electrical isolation between the MS layers   and the PZ layer . This is because the MS layers   are typically conductive and can short-circuit the two ends of the PZ layer.","The L-L configuration of  has a sensitivity even higher than the L-P device of . , for example, shows a graph of sensitivity versus bias field for the present L-L device of . The L-L device used to generate  is made with two TERFENOL-D MS layers and a longitudinally-poled single crystal PMN-PT layer disposed between the MS layers. The sensitivity was measured using a detected magnetic field with a frequency of 1 kHz. At a bias field of 600\u2013800 Oe, the L-L device has an extremely high sensitivity of over 225 mV\/Oe. The extremely high sensitivity of the L-L configuration is partly a result of the d piezoelectric constant, which is typically higher than the d piezoelectric constant employed in the L-P configuration, and partly due to the small capacitance (i.e. capacitance between output wires   ) of this laminate design. Assuming that the induced charge Q from the piezoelectric layer is the same for both the L-T and L-L, a small capacitance C means a higher induced voltage according to V=Q\/C. Also, the piezoelectric material PMN-PT used in the device that generated the graph of  has an exceptionally high d piezoelectric constant.","An important consideration in the design and operation of the present magnetic field sensors is the frequency of the detected magnetic field. In all the data presented above, the detected magnetic field had a frequency of 1 kHz. Different applications will require sensitivity to different frequencies. For example, magnetoencephalography and biomedical imaging applications will typically require sensitivity to frequencies in the range of 10to 10Hz. Proximity detection of vehicles and the like may require sensitivity to frequencies as low as 10Hz. Detecting relatively high frequencies (e.g. 10 or 1000 Hz) is much easier than detecting low frequencies below 1 Hz. This is because the combination of the piezoelectric layer and voltage detector inherently comprises a high-pass R-C filter. For combinations of typical sensor designs (e.g. with L and T dimensions of about 4\u201310 mm and layer thicknesses of about 0.2\u20131 mm) and commercially available differential amplifiers, the RC cutoff frequency is often about several Hertz.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["34","35","36","35","36"]},"The L-P configuration has an advantage in this regard because the top and bottom electrode surfaces provide a relatively high capacitance because they have high surface area and are separated by the thin PZ layer thickness. Typical capacitances for L-P devices (with dimensions of several millimeters per side) are about 1\u20135 nF. The L-L configuration will typically have a lower capacitance because the electrodes are located on the endfaces of the PZ layer, which are widely separated and have small surface area. L-L devices can have capacitances 100 times smaller than a L-P device with similar dimensions. Therefore, although the L-L configuration typically provides higher sensitivity to magnetic fields of frequency 10 Hz and higher, the L-P configuration will probably provide higher sensitivity to fields at low frequency (below 1 Hz). The frequency range of both L-P and L-L devices can be extended to lower frequencies by employing voltage detection amplifiers with higher input impedances or by designing the sensors to have higher capacitances. For example, the sensors can be designed with many PZ layers to increase the capacitance and therefore the sensitivity to low frequencies.","Another important consideration in the design of the present sensors is the relative thickness of the MS and PZ layers. Extremely thin PZ layers will provide relatively low sensitivity, because thin PZ layers produce little electrical charge. Also, extremely thin MS layers will provide poor sensitivity because thin MS layers will not be able to provide enough force to strain the PZ layers. There exists an optimum relative thickness for the MS and PZ layers. The optimum relative thickness is different for the L-P and L-L configurations.","For the L-P configuration, the following equation 1 provides the sensitivity (in volts per Oersted) as a function of the aggregate relative thickness of the MS layers. Equation 1 assumes that the device has N+1 MS layers, and N PZ layers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mrow":[{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"V"},{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":"H","mn":"3"}}]}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["L","P"],"mo":"-"}}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"\u03b2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"n"}}},{"mi":"w","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["t","m"]}},"mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["Nt","p"]}}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mn":"33","mo":",","mi":"m"}},"msubsup":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mn":"31","mo":",","mi":"p"},"mn":"2"}},{"mi":"N","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msubsup":{"mi":["\u025b","T"],"mn":"33"},"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["s","E"],"mn":"11"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["s","E"],"mn":"11"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","msubsup":{"mi":"k","mrow":{"mn":"31","mo":",","mi":"p"},"mn":"2"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mi":"n"}},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["s","H"],"mn":"33"}}],"mo":"+"}}}}]},"mo":"."}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"wherein:","w is the width (transverse dimension T) of the laminate,","tis the thickness of each magnetostrictive layer;","tis the thickness of each piezoelectric layer;","Sis the elastic compliance of the magnetostrictive material under constant magnetic bias field, H.","Sis the elastic compliance of the piezoelectric material under constant electric field, E.","dis the longitudinal magnetostrictive constant,","dis the perpendicular piezoelectric constant,","\u03b5is the permittivity of the piezoelectric material under constant stress,","n is the thickness ratio of (N+1) magnetostrictive layers to the total thickness,","\u03b2 (0<\u03b2\u22661) is a coefficient related to dc magnetic bias.
