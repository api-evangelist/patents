title: Front-end pixel fixed pattern noise correction in imaging arrays having wide dynamic range
abstract: Aspects describe front-end pixel fixed pattern noise correction in imaging arrays having wide dynamic range. A photosensor of a first pixel in a first row of an array is reset and a first reset level of the first pixel is measured. The array comprises a plurality of pixels arranged in rows and columns. In response to a result of the first reset level, a reset bus is altered. A feed-forward adjustment of the photosensor of the first pixel is performed to substantially remove fixed-pattern noise. An external readout from the photosensor can occur with substantially all the fixed-pattern noise removed. In some aspects, the adjustment is performed by a switched capacitor block.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Image sensor arrays are in widespread use in digital cameras, camcorders, and many other products. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) is low cost and versatile and, thus, has become the technology of choice for most of these arrays. Within CMOS itself, many types of devices intended for visible imaging applications are in use. Such devices can be tailored to large-format still cameras, standard video cameras, and compact \u201cweb cam\u201d units, for example, all with varying degrees of size, cost, and performance.","CMOS imaging devices generally have what is known as an \u201celectronic shutter,\u201d which can function as a replacement for a mechanical shutter. An electronic shutter controls the duration of the exposure on an array of pixel sensors, allowing the system to adapt to lighting conditions. Although an electronic shutter increases overhead in the device design, for most applications the electronic shutter can be worth the advantage of avoiding a mechanical shutter.","A \u201crolling shutter\u201d is one type of electronic shutter. The rolling shutter can be provided while incurring almost no costs and, therefore, is widely used. For the rolling shutter, an array is scanned one row at a time for readout. At each row read-out, the pixels in the row have been integrating photocurrent for a certain period of time, T, because the pixels have been reset by a separate scanning event Tago. A vertical scanner can control the separate scanning event. A drawback of the rolling shutter is that while the entire array has a uniform T, the actual start time and end time are different. For example, the top rows of the array may be exposed before the bottom rows of the array are exposed. Thus, horizontally moving objects might be distorted. While Tcan be made to have a short duration, the start time and end time might be separated by up to an entire frame period in some cases.","To overcome the drawbacks of a rolling shutter, an electronic \u201cglobal shutter\u201d can be used. For global shutter, all pixels start and stop integration at the same time, which can avoid the motion artifact of the rolling shutter and can approach the performance of a mechanical shutter. However, the global shutter has more overhead at the pixel, circuit, and system levels. While there are many ways of implementing electronic global shutter, in CMOS a common approach is to use a five transistor (5T) pixel, which is a compact type of shutter that can provide acceptable performance.","The above-described deficiencies of today's image sensor arrays are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional arrays, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional arrays and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.","A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.","An aspect relates to a system for discrete time and feed forward correction of fixed pattern noise in a pixel array. The system includes a reset component configured to reset a pixel of the pixel array and an analyzer component configured to sample a reset level of the pixel. The system also includes an adjustment component configured to adjust a reset bus in response to the sampled reset level, wherein the adjustment to the reset bus facilitates correction of the fixed pattern noise. Additionally, the system includes a detection component configured to sample a signal level of the pixel for external readout from the pixel array.","According to another aspect is a method that includes resetting for a first time a photosensor of a first pixel in a first row of an array and sampling a first reset level of the first pixel. The method also includes adjusting a reset bus in response to a result of sampling the first reset level and resetting for a second time the photosensor of the first pixel. Further, the method includes reading out externally from the photosensor. The array includes a plurality of pixels arranged in rows and columns.","In accordance with another aspect is a pixel-reset system that includes means for resetting a photosensor of a first pixel in a first row of an array and means for measuring a first reset level of the first pixel. Also included in pixel-reset system is means for altering a reset bus in response to a result of the first reset level and means for performing a feed-forward adjustment of the photosensor of the first pixel to substantially remove fixed-pattern noise. Further, pixel-reset system includes means for reading out externally from the photosensor. The array includes a plurality of pixels arranged in rows and columns.","These and other embodiments are described in more detail below.","Conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device designs can experience pixel fixed-pattern noise (FPN), which is mismatch between the characteristics of the pixels that remains fixed. Mismatches in the offsets of the pixel output voltage levels can be quite high, and these should be corrected in order to obtain a quality picture.","Various systems that utilize feedback to improve pixel performance have been developed; however, such systems have inherent disadvantages. For example, some systems utilize a tapered reset and are intended primarily for three transistor (3T) pixels. Tapered reset is a column-based feedback system that is used to lower the temporal noise of the pixel in progressive scanning mode. Although tapered reset could in principle attenuate FPN if low-offset column circuitry is used, there would still be a significant portion of the charge injection that could not be cancelled.","In modern four transistor (4T) pixels (or pixels with more transistors), which have small floating-node capacitance values, the charge injection mismatch materializes as a large FPN in the corresponding voltage signal. To reduce the temporal noise, the tapered reset process consumes time, as it inherently uses narrowband feedback.","Some systems utilize a global reset version. However, the global reset version requires an additional MOS device in the pixel. Further, the global reset version is not adaptable to reduce the FPN.","Yet in another variation, some systems utilize a capacitor in each pixel to make a charge-to-voltage amplifier with low temporal noise reset. In these systems, however, a portion of the charge injection would still contribute to FPN, unabated.","Further, some approaches reset the pixel and an auto-zero feedback loop subsequently removes the noise, storing a correction voltage in the pixel. This can remove FPN if low-offset column circuitry is used, including the FPN from charge injection. However, this approach requires capacitors in the pixel, which is an area issue (e.g., increases device size).","A scheme referred to as capacitor-less Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) can reset a pixel array with reduced FPN as well as temporal noise. After a row of pixels is reset, a weak current source in each pixel is used to bleed the reset node until it reaches a target, mediated by column circuitry. Again, by using low-offset column circuitry, this can eliminate much of the FPN. However, the process is slow, and the original FPN (before correction) is an overhead in the output range.","Thus, it would be beneficial to provide FPN pixel correction in imaging arrays that utilizes a self-contained feed-forward correction (as part of a discrete-time feedback system). Further, it would be beneficial to provide a system that has its speed limited only by the bandwidth of the pixel readout loop (e.g., the pixel and its read bus).","An aspect relates to a system for discrete time and feed forward correction of fixed pattern noise in a pixel array. The system includes a reset component configured to reset a pixel of the pixel array and an analyzer component configured to sample a reset level of the pixel. The system also includes an adjustment component configured to adjust a reset bus in response to the sampled reset level, wherein the adjustment to the reset bus facilitates correction of the fixed pattern noise. Additionally, the system includes a detection component configured to sample a signal level of the pixel for external readout from the pixel array.","In an implementation, the adjustment component is a switched capacitor block and a read bus is connected to the switched capacitor block and column circuitry for readout. In some implementations, the adjustment component is further configured to adjust a power supply level on the reset bus in response to a result of the sampled reset level. According to some implementations, the reset component is configured to reset the pixel of the pixel array a second time.","In another implementation, the system includes a data readout component configured to readout an image from the pixel array. In some implementations, the adjustment component is further configured to subtract a sampled reference level from the sampled reset level and apply gain at a column level.","According to some implementations, the system includes a first storage media configured to retain the reset level and a second storage media configured to retain the signal level, wherein the retained reset level and the retained signal level includes a fixed-pattern noise map. In an implementation, the pixel array includes a five transistor pixel.","According to another aspect is a method that includes resetting for a first time a photosensor of a first pixel in a first row of an array and sampling a first reset level of the first pixel. The method also includes adjusting a reset bus in response to a result of sampling the first reset level and resetting for a second time the photosensor of the first pixel. Further, the method includes reading out externally from the photosensor. The array includes a plurality of pixels arranged in rows and columns.","In an implementation, resetting the photosensor of the first pixel the second time includes performing a feed-forward adjustment. In another implementation, performing the feed-forward adjustment includes compensating for a pixel offset. In some implementations, resetting the photosensor of the first pixel the second time includes removing fixed-pattern noise.","In accordance with some implementations, the method includes sampling a second reset level after resetting for the second time and retaining the second reset level in a retrievable format. Further to this implementation, the method includes utilizing the retained second reset level for correlated double sampling. Additionally or alternatively, the method includes capturing residual fixed-pattern noise based on the retained second reset level.","In an implementation, the method includes subtracting a first reference level from a second reset level, scanning out of a device, and storing a fixed-pattern noise map. Further to this implementation, the method includes applying gain before the scanning out of the device. Additionally or alternatively, the method includes after integration, sampling a reference level, sampling a signal level, subtracting the reference level from the signal level, scanning a raw signal out of the device, and subtracting the raw signal from the fixed-pattern noise map to obtain a clean signal. Further to this implementation, the method includes applying gain after the subtracting the reference level from the signal level.","In accordance with another aspect is a pixel-reset system that includes means for resetting a photosensor of a first pixel in a first row of an array and means for measuring a first reset level of the first pixel. Also included in pixel-reset system is means for altering a reset bus in response to a result of the first reset level and means for performing a feed-forward adjustment of the photosensor of the first pixel to substantially remove fixed-pattern noise. Further, pixel-reset system includes means for reading out externally from the photosensor. The array includes a plurality of pixels arranged in rows and columns.","Herein, an overview of some of the embodiments for front-end pixel FPN correction in imaging arrays having wide dynamic range has been presented above. As a roadmap for what follows next, various exemplary, non-limiting embodiments and features for front-end pixel FPN correction are described in more detail. Then, some non-limiting implementations and examples are given for additional illustration, followed by a representative operating environment in which such embodiments and\/or features can be implemented.","In the various aspects disclosed herein, Negative Channel Field Effect Transistor (NFET) devices can be utilized in the pixels. However, it should be understood that the various aspects can utilize other devices.","In order to fully appreciate the disclosed aspects,  illustrates a four transistor (4T) pixel cell  in a two-dimensional (2-D) array and associated column block or 1-D column array  for FPN correction. FPN refers to the fixed variation from pixel to pixel. In rolling shutter, FPN correction can be implemented by column circuitry adjacent to the pixel array, as shown in .","The 4T pixel cell  can be formed on a semiconductor substrate as part of an imager device pixel array, according to an aspect. The 4T pixel cell  includes a photodiode  connected to a transfer (TX) transistor . The TX transistor  can be connected to a Floating Diffusion (FD) node . A reset transistor  and a gate of a source follower transistor  are also connected to the FD node . The reset transistor  and the source follower transistor  are connected to a reset bus  (supply). A row select transistor  is connected to the source follower transistor  and a read bus . The selected row of the array is read-out, through the read bus , to the column array .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200","sub":["int","int "]},"At time t, a pixel transfer gate TX  is pulsed high. Also at time t, a reset pulse is applied to the reset signal  in order to reset the pixel intended to be sampled. The photodiode starts integrating light, and the pixel is selected  shortly before integration ends. In order to read after integration or after a frame, for example, the reset signal is brought low, at time t after select  has gone high. At time t, a readout  of a reset level  is obtained or sampled. The FD voltage level  is sampled (e.g., through the source follower). The charge from the photodiode is transferred to the FD node during the second TX pulse. Thus, the FD voltage level  drops by a corresponding integrated light intensity. At time t a readout  of the FD voltage level is sampled again. The second sampling of the FD voltage level is referred to as a signal level .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["214","4","302","210","3","304"]},"Optionally, in some aspects, gain  can be applied, after the sample signal level  is subtracted from the sample reset level . The gain can be applied at the column itself before it has the chance to progress further in the signal chain and become corrupted by noise. Because the TX  is brought high between the two samples without reset (as shown in ), the subtraction  can correct the FPN and can also perform Correlated Double Sampling (CDS). CDS removes a source of a temporal, or a time-varying, component known as \u201ckTC reset noise,\u201d which is caused by resetting the pixel. It also attenuates temporal noise from other mechanisms, such as flicker noise from the source follower.","A 5T pixel is constructed from a 4T pixel with global shutter added. In global shutter, FPN correction is not as straightforward, even with a 5T pixel. In the 5T pixel case, one transistor is used to start integration in the array and a second transistor is used to end integration in the array. Utilizing two transistors in such a manner leaves only three transistors that can be utilized for readout. While column circuitry can clean up the FPN, CDS is no longer being performed, and the result can be significantly higher temporal noise. Instead of performing CDS, the column circuitry is performing Uncorrelated Double Sampling (UDS). Operation of a 5T pixel in such a mode is shown in , which illustrates a 5T pixel operation for global shutter with external FPN correction.","Illustrated is a 5T pixel cell  that includes a photodiode  connected to a Global Shutter (GS) transistor  and a transfer (TX) transistor . The GS transistor  is connected to a GS Reset Bus  (supply). The TX transistor  is connected to a floating diffusion (FD) node . A reset transistor  and a gate of a source follower transistor  are also connected to the FD node . The reset transistor  and source follower transistor  are connected to a reset bus  (supply). The source follower transistor  is also connected to a select transistor , which is connected to a read bus .","As shown in the timing diagram , the GS reset bus  is brought low, at time t, and period Tbegins. When GS is off or goes low, it permits the photodiode to integrate. After period T, the pixel is read-out one row at a time. Thus, GS is used to start the integration and after a certain period of time, TX  is pulsed high (at time t). As shown, a reset  operation has occurred, which resets the FD . The row is selected  at time t. A readout  of a signal level  is sampled at time t and a reset level  is sampled at time t. This is similar to the timing diagram  of , however, in this case, there was a reset operation performed between time t and time t, which results in UDS.","Some techniques employ \u201celectronic half-shutter\u201d. For electronic half-shutter, a mechanical shutter is needed and is used only to stop integration. Integration still starts electronically. This allows a 5T pixel device to perform global shutter with CDS, as some burden on the device has been removed. While this may have advantages in some applications, it still requires moving parts (e.g., the mechanical shutter).","Another option for (full) global shutter is to read-out an offset-only (or FPN) map, and store the map outside the readout block, typically after digitization. Then the exposed image is read-out and correction is performed digitally. This allows a 5T pixel device to maintain CDS functionality, as shown in the operational scheme of .","The disclosed aspects address at least one performance issue with the stored FPN map scheme, which is, namely, dynamic range. A pixel has a finite amount of charge-storage capability, limiting the lux-seconds of light that the pixel can measure before saturation occurs. On the dark end, performance is limited by temporal noise from various sources. The latter can be minimized by using a high front-end analog gain, as this can substantially reduce the input-referred noise from the later stages of the chain, including the A-to-D converter and its quantization noise. The FPN inundates the output at a modest gain level. If the pixel FPN can be corrected at the front end, high analog gain can be used. The disclosed aspects can solve this problem through utilization of a pixel reset system, while maintaining CDS functionality. The disclosed aspects can also provide a quality performance, wide dynamic range system with fully electronic global shutter using 5T pixels.","The scheme of  is now described in further detail and with reference to , which illustrates a system  that can be utilized with the timing diagram  of . The signals illustrated refer to the 5T pixel diagram of . The Global Shutter (GS) line  starts out high, connecting the photodiode to the power rail and preventing integration from starting, for all pixels in the array; hence the name Global Shutter for this line. During the GS high period, the pixel FPN is scanned out, one row at a time; this is known as \u201cprogressive\u201d reset and scan. To read the offset value for each pixel (which form FPN collectively), the select line  for the row is brought high, and its corresponding reset line  is brought high, in order to clear out any prior image information. Then the reset line  is brought low, which causes the floating diffusion (FD) node to drop in voltage  from the original level of the reset bus, which, in some aspects, is the power supply. This drop is due to charge injection, and is typically in the hundreds of milliVolts. Mismatches in this can be a source of FPN, though other sources of FPN can include the pixel source follower device and its bias source.","The select line  is still high and, therefore, the read bus  level can be sampled (e.g., sample reset level ). The sampled reset level  contains the information of all (or substantially all) major contributors to pixel FPN, with the exception of dark signal non-uniformity, which cannot be sampled in one event. The sampled reset level  can be read-out of the device and can be retained in a first storage media  (). In some aspects, the information retained in the first storage media  includes FPN as well as temporal noise information that can also be cancelled out. According to some aspects, the first storage media  can be a frame memory, which is a map of all the offsets. In other aspects, the first storage media  is an FPN memory.","After all rows are scanned, the GS line  goes low, and all pixels start integrating. At the end of the integration period, interval Tlater, the global transfer gate (TX) signal S goes high, placing the charge on the FD node and effectively stopping integration when the TX signal S goes low. The read bus  level is sampled (e.g., sample signal level ). In an aspect, the sampled signal level  is scanned into a second storage media  (), with progressive row scanning. According to some aspects, the second storage media  is a signal memory. In accordance with some aspects, the sampled reset level  and the sampled signal level  can be retained in a single storage media (e.g., two storage medias are not needed). In some aspects, the first storage media  and\/or the second storage media  can be internal storage medias, external storage medias, or combinations thereof (e.g., first storage media  is internal and second storage media  is external; or first storage media  is external and second storage media  is internal).","The two stored images are subtracted, by a computation component  that provides an output , which is an FPN-corrected image. In accordance with some aspects, computation component  performs the subtraction digitally. A digitally stored FPN map can provide the advantage of being able to correct for pixel dark signals, provided the system includes an appropriate calibration routine. However, the disclosed aspects are not limited to a digital process and other processes can be utilized. The result of the output  is cancellation of the temporal noise and the FPN. Thus, system  performs FPN correction and is also performing CDS, since the FD node is not reset between the two samples. In an aspect, the GS timing  can be altered to go high after the TX pulse, which may affect pixel performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["702","704","706","702","704","708","710","712"]},"There is a difference between the two pixels, as their charge injections are different. This manifests as FPN, and limits the amount of analog gain that can be applied at the front end without saturating the signal chain, such as subsequent gain stages prior to the A-to-D converter. Note that other device mismatches, such as source follower threshold voltage, would also manifest in the sampled reset level . Further, the read bus levels  in  would be split during the reset pulse as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["802","804","806","808","808"]},"Feed-forward adjustment is performed, at , to compensate for the pixel offset.

The readout of the reset level, at , can be retained in an internal storage media or an external storage media. Retaining the readout can allow the readout to be utilized for CDS. Additionally or alternatively, the retained readout can be utilized to capture any residual FPN due to non-ideal performance of the system.","In accordance with some aspects, if CDS is not used, the readout of the FPN map can be omitted, and instead the FPN map can be derived from calibration using an optically dark image.

In accordance with some aspects, the Amp block can be a standard operational amplifier. The capacitor C is for compensation. In some aspects, the Comp switch  is always closed, connecting capacitor C and providing Miller feedback for the op-amp. A resistor may be put in series with capacitor C, according to an aspect. Mode is a static bit that is normally low, so the Mode switch  is always open (and the Mode-bar switch  is always closed), disconnecting capacitor C and shunting R, according to an aspect. Thus, an Out node  is connected directly to the Read Bus ; in the system, Out node  provides feedback to the input In  of the op-amp through capacitors or a direct connection.","In accordance with some aspects, the op-amp can be operated in a mode with two dominant poles, which can be set up when the static bit Mode is high.

(This means that in , the actual reset bus level at  will vary from pixel-to-pixel, but this is cancelled.) Hence, C ends up with the read bus voltage change as a result of charge injection. Note that the op-amp load is primarily C, which is generally a small fraction of the load of the reset bus. The op-amp output device M is shut off, leaving only M, which can be sized appropriately for the op-amp frequency response.

Recall from above that the reference sample and read bus sample (e.g., the final reset level) are both perturbed by the op-amp offset, so it cancels out.
