The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright 2007-2009 eBay Inc., All Rights Reserved.","2. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to methods and systems supporting computing and data processing systems. More particularly, a system and method supporting microfinance funds aggregation for a retail investor are described.","3. Related Art","Conventional network-based marketplaces (e.g. consumer websites) provide users with functionality to browse a collection of goods or services at a website and make purchases using a variety of means. For example, conventional credit cards can be used for an online purchase. In this case, the user enters the credit card number into a data field on a web form provided by a merchant or third party website. Conventional debit cards can be similarly used. Using these conventional financial systems and processes on the Web, users can shop and make purchases of goods or services over the Internet. However, in some cases, securities cannot be purchased with credit\/debit cards.","The PayPal system is also a popular example of a conventional financial system and process to facilitate online consumer transactions. The PayPal system provides a user account created for each user wherein a user associates his\/her credit card, debit card, or bank account with the PayPal account. Subsequently, the user can make secure purchases using the PayPal account without revealing his\/her credit card number or financial information. When a user makes a purchase at a merchant site, the user can log in to the PayPal site to gain access to their PayPal account in order to complete the consumer transaction at the merchant site.","Conventional methods and systems can also enable consumers to purchase from a set of securities or investments currently available on the Web. The website, ETRADE.COM is an example of a site that provides security trading services on the web. The issuance of securities is highly regulated by several government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC regulations have been applied to the availability of securities on the Web. One problem is that many current systems and processes for facilitating the exchange of securities are only cost-effective if large value or large volume securities are traded in a given transaction. In other words, conventional systems and processes for facilitating the exchange of securities are set up for sophisticated professionals who deal in large value\/volume transactions. As such, current online systems do not efficiently support microfinance investments by small retail investors. A wide variety of securities can be purchased by retail investors through web interfaces through established brokerage houses. However, microfinance as an asset class is still emerging and is therefore not a class of securities available through mainstream brokerages. Because microfinance is emerging, it is targeting institutional and accredited investors and not retail investors. As such, mainstream brokerages do not provide a platform that facilitates retail investment in microfinance. Any security is issued by an issuer. Most organizations raising capital from commercial markets have to issue securities. These organizations tend to focus on large investors because it is more cost effective for them.","Thus, a system and method supporting microfinance funds aggregation for a retail investor are needed.","A computer-implemented system and method supporting microfinance funds aggregation for a retail investor are disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known processes, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the clarity of this description.","As described further below, according to various example embodiments of the disclosed subject matter described and claimed herein, there is provided a computer-implemented system and method supporting microfinance funds aggregation for a retail investor. In other words, various example embodiments of the disclosed subject matter enable cost effective management of small amounts of capital from a large number of retail investors. As described herein, the microfinance funds aggregation system takes the cost out of the equation and facilitates small issuers to consider the retail channel as an option, because the various embodiments described herein make the retail channel cost effective.","An example embodiment of the microfinance funds aggregation platform can include the following networked components:\n\n","The system can include an investment processor to accept an online purchase request for a security from an investor site and automatically initiate communication with a financial site to request authorization and payment from the financial site for the security purchase by the investor. Various embodiments are described below in connection with the figures provided herein.","The computer-implemented system and method supporting microfinance funds aggregation of the various embodiments described herein enable investors to purchase securities as facilitated by a host site. As described herein, the host site can be considered a network-accessible server, server farm, web site, or the like that can enable network access to and between an investor site, a security issuer site, and a financial site via a network (e.g. the Internet).  illustrates an example embodiment of a networked system  in which various embodiments may operate. As shown in , a host site  is in data communication with one or more client (e.g., investor) systems  via a conventional network , such as the Internet. Client systems  can be used by individual investors who can log into the host site  via the network  and become subscribers or members of the service enabled by the various embodiments described herein. Users of client systems  (e.g., investors) can also use the host site  to facilitate the purchase of securities as described in more detail below. Investors at investor sites  can be everyday people who want to invest some of their savings to produce a financial return and a social impact. Investors are typically retail investors who may not have large sums of money to invest in a particular security. Security issuers at security issuer sites  can offer security products (investments)  for sale on the host site . In the embodiments shown in , the security issuer  and financial services provider  are shown as network connected sites. However, the security issuer  can also be an entirely separate entity that is not in direct data communication with the host site  or investor site . Typically, the financial services provider  has both investor and security issuer accounts. As described in more detail below, using host site , investors can purchase investments from security issuers using a list of available securities . Purchased securities are issued by the security issuers  while the host site  provides the list of available securities  for viewing by the investor . Investors can use their accounts  at a financial site, such as a bank or a service like PayPal  to fund their security purchases. The security issuers are responsible for making interest and principal payments to the investors. The security issuers can use the funds generated by the sale of securities to invest in microfinance loan packages  offered to lending organizations. Again, in the embodiments shown in , the lender  and borrower  are shown as entirely separate entities that may not be in direct data communication with the host site , investor site , or security issuer . Lending organizations  are typically located throughout the world, particularly in developing countries. The lender  and security issuer  can also be the same site\/organization. Additionally, the lender  and the issuer site  can be the same entity. The lending organizations specialize in making small loans (i.e., microfinance loans) to the world's working poor, who are often the borrowers . The lending organizations can also provide other services, such as training, counseling, and health care to the borrowers . The security issuers  provide microfinance loan packages  to the lenders , the microfinance loan packages  being funded by aggregated investments received from the investors . The lending organizations can then provide loans  to the borrowers , as funded by the security issuer microfinance loan packages . The borrowers  can use the proceeds of their loan  to fund the growth of small businesses in developing countries and thus improve the social well-being of the country's population. Profits obtained from these borrower businesses can be used to repay the loan . As the loans  are repaid by the borrower  to the lending organizations , the lending organizations  can repay the security issuers  on the microfinance loan packages . The security issuers  can then make interest and principal payments on the securities  to the investors . Although the flow of capital is as described above, there is not necessarily a one-to-one correlation between the pay outs and the pay backs. For example, a security issuer, such as Calvert, could raise a million dollars from investors using the various embodiments described herein and then lend the million dollars to the lenders at 7% interest. The lenders could then make a large number of small loans to borrowers using the money received from Calvert. Calvert can pay 3% interest to the investors quarterly even if the lenders pay the 7% back to Calvert annually.","In a particular embodiment shown in , the microfinance funds aggregation system can be provided in or hosted by host site . It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that an equivalent configuration could include multiple host sites, each managing a portion of the functionality provided by the microfinance funds aggregation system described herein. A particular embodiment includes an additional layer, called the Partner Sites, wherein each Partner Site is hosted on a separate server and each Partner Site communicates with the microfinance funds aggregation system, described in more detail below. In this embodiment, each Partner Site can manage a portion of the functionality provided by the microfinance funds aggregation system described herein. Further, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that another equivalent configuration could include a portion of the functionality provided by the microfinance funds aggregation system being downloaded to sites , , , and  and executed locally at these sites. In any of these alternative configurations, the microfinance funds aggregation system described herein enables and supports a computer-implemented system and method supporting microfinance funds aggregation for a retail investor. The various features of the system and method will be described in more detail below.","Description of the Computer-implemented Microfinance Funds Aggregation Processor of an Example Embodiment","Referring now to , an example embodiment showing the functionality components of investment processor  is shown.
