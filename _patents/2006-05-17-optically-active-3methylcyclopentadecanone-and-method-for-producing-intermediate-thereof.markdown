The present invention also relates to a novel optically active ligand used in the production of optically active 3-methylcyclopentadecane or an intermediate thereof.","In recent years, with a people's growing interest in nature, as for fragrances, those of high preference, which characteristically evoke the image of natural environment, are attracting attention.","Musk is a product obtained by drying the secretion of the musk gland of male musk deer, and has been highly valued since ancient times, as a fragrance or as a natural medicine. Musks having strong scent have been considered as good products, but today, products containing 2% or more of muscone are considered as better products. Musk deer is an animal of family Moschidae, inhabiting a region extending from the mountainous area in Himalaya to the inland China, and currently importation and exportation of the animal is banned under the Washington Convention. Accordingly, only natural musk that was imported prior to the Washington Convention can be used, and unless artificial breeding of musk deer is achieved successfully, natural musk cannot be put into use in the future.","3-Methylcyclopentadecanone (hereinafter, may be referred to as muscone), which is an ingredient of musk, is one species of typical musk-based fragrances, and it is known that there are differences in the scents depending on the configuration of the methyl group. The optically active isomers of muscone, the (R)-(\u2212)-isomer and the (S)-(+)-isomer, are both useful as fragrances, but the (R)-(\u2212)-isomer has stronger and richer scent compared to the (S)-(+)-isomer. For example, while the (S)-(+)-isomer has a threshold value of 223 ppb, the (R)-(\u2212)-isomer has a threshold value of 61 ppb, and thus the (R)-(\u2212)-isomer is reported to be superior (see Non-Patent Document 1).","From the aspect of activity as well as from the aspects of a growing interest in nature and environment, the interest in (R)-isomers which are excellent in biodegradability is growing, and there has been a demand not for racemates, but for optically active isomers. Furthermore, a number of methods for the optical resolution of racemates have been studied (see, for example, Patent Document 1), but in this method, generation of (S)-isomers is unavoidable. Therefore, a study of the method for selectively producing the (R)-isomer of muscone has been extensively carried out. A method of producing the (R)-isomer using an optically active raw material (see, for example, Patent Document 2), a method of subjecting 3-methyl-2-cyclopentadecen-1-one to asymmetric hydrogenation (see Patent Document 3), and the like have been developed. Then, alkylation resulting from 1,4-addition reaction of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone by an alkylating agent such as dimethylzinc has been reported (see Patent Document 4), and attention has been focused on the methylation of 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one. In recent years, there have been reports on the method for stereoselective production of muscone of the (R)-isomer through a reaction of 1,4-conjugate addition of a methyl group with respect to 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one. As an example of the method, it has been reported that favorable results can be obtained by using a chiral auxiliary having a bornane skeleton during the synthesis (Non-Patent Document 2). Further, as another example, methods of using various phosphite compounds as ligand are also known (Non-Patent Document 3). In addition to these examples, there are reports on the production of optically active muscone using a complex of copper and a ligand such as mesomer-derived 4-(cis-2,6-dimethylpiperidine)-(R)-dinaphthodioxaphosphepine (Patent Document 5), synthesis of (R)-muscone in which asymmetric methylation by means of dimethylzinc is performed by making use of deoxycholic acid, and a phosphite compound having a binaphthyl group as the chiral base, as optically active ligands, and combining these with a copper catalyst (Non-patent Document 4), and the like.","Moreover, under such circumstances, new methods for the preparation of the raw material, 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one have also been developed (see Patent Document 6).","[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2005-8555","[Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-30022","[Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 6-192161","[Patent Document 4] Japanese Patent Application National Publication No. 2001-316309","[Patent Document 5] Korean Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-49811","[Patent Document 6] Japanese Patent Application National Publication No. 2001-226306","[Non-Patent Document 1] W.

Furthermore, there is also a problem that large amounts of catalyst need to be used in order to achieve high optical purity. Therefore, the present invention addresses the problems by providing a practical method for producing optically active muscone using a relatively small amount of catalyst, without employing the reaction conditions such as cryogenic temperature or low concentration.","The inventors of the present invention devotedly and repeatedly conducted studies to solve the above-described problems, and as a result, found that when 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one is subjected to an asymmetric methylation reaction in the presence of a copper catalyst and an optically active ligand, an optically active enol derivative is formed by trapping the enol anions that are generated as a reaction intermediate using an appropriate enol anion scavenger, which enol derivative allows the asymmetric methylation reaction to be performed avoiding cryogenic temperature and suppresses the generation of side products, and that, by subsequently subjecting the enol derivative to solvolysis according to a standard method, a desired optically active muscone can be obtained at a high concentration and at a high yield. Thus, the inventors completed the present invention.","Furthermore, the inventors of the present invention found a novel catalyst and a novel optically active ligand compound for this method.","That is, the present invention relates to a method for producing optically active 3-methylcyclopentadecanone, the method comprising reacting 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one with a methylated organic metal in the presence of a copper catalyst, an enol anion scavenger and an optically active phosphoramidite represented by general formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"24.98mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07728177-20100601-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 ","3 ","4 "]},"to perform a reaction of 1,4-conjugate addition of a methyl group, thus to produce an optically active 3-methyl-1-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by general formula (2):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"37.42mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07728177-20100601-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"and subjecting the derivative to solvolysis.","More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for producing optically active 3-methylcyclopentadecanone, wherein the optically active 3-methylcyclopentadecanone to be produced is 3-(R)-methylcyclopentadecanone.","Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for producing an optically active 3-methyl-1-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by general formula (2):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"37.42mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07728177-20100601-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"the method comprising performing a reaction of 1,4-conjugate addition of a methyl group to 2-cyclopentadecen-1-one by means of a methylated organic metal, in the presence of a copper catalyst, an enol anion scavenger and an optically active phosphoramidite represented by general formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"25.15mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07728177-20100601-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 ","3 ","4 "]},"Furthermore, the present invention relates to a compound represented by the following general formula (1\u2032):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"25.15mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07728177-20100601-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4"]},"Also, the present invention relates to an optically active 3-methyl-1-cyclopentadecene derivative represented by the following general formula (2):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"37.42mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US07728177-20100601-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.","2-cyclopentadecen-1-one used in the present invention may be exemplified by (E)-2-cylopentadecen-1-one, but the compound is not limited to this, and may also be (Z)-2-cyclopentadecen-1-one, or a mixture of an (E)-isomer and (Z)-isomer.
