{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/073,842 filed Feb. 11, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,334,251.","This invention relates in general to television systems, and more particularly, to the field of subscriber television systems.","Cable television systems are now capable of providing many services in addition to analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the settop box, has become an important computing device for accessing various video services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of two-way digital services such as video-on-demand.","A DHCT is typically connected to a cable or satellite television network and includes hardware and software necessary to provide various services and functionality. Preferably, some of the software executed by a DHCT is downloaded and\/or updated via the cable television network. Each DHCT also typically includes a processor, communication components and memory, and is connected to a television or other display device. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, a DHCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","A DHCT provides users with television programming and television advertising. Many DHCT users, however, often avoid viewing television advertisements. Television advertisements may be avoided in a number of ways including, for example, by switching television channels during an advertisement or by recording a television program and then using trick mode functionality to skip recorded advertisements. One reason for why a viewer may avoid viewing an advertisement is because the viewer may not be interested in the product or service being advertised. Advertisement avoidance results in lower advertisement exposure for advertisers and, therefore, in lower potential revenue for television service providers. Therefore, there is a need for systems and methods for increasing the viewing of television advertisements.","Systems and methods are provided herein for managing the presentation of television advertisements. As a non-limiting example, among others, a television advertisement may be an audio\/video television commercial. In one embodiment of the invention, a DHCT receives user input for selecting an advertisement or type of advertisement, and then presents the user with an advertisement that corresponds to the user's selection. The advertisement may be presented to the user immediately after the user's selection or may be presented to the user at subsequent times during interruptions in television broadcast presentations.","In another embodiment, a DHCT may keep track of the number of times that an advertisement is presented to a user in order to determine whether the advertisement is to continue being presented. The DHCT may also keep track of the total number of advertisements that have been presented over a predetermined period of time in order to determine whether to present an additional advertisement at a current time.","In yet another embodiment of the invention, an advertisement or type of advertisement is assigned a value by a system operator. A user may then select advertisements and\/or types of advertisements based their respective assigned values as shown via an advertisement selection screen. A DHCT may then manage the presentation of advertisements based on their individual and\/or cumulative values. As a non-limiting example, the frequency and\/or duration of an advertisement or plurality of advertisements may be inversely correlated to the value of the advertisement(s).","The preferred embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. These embodiments are examples, among others, of systems and methods of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention, which may be embodied in many different forms, should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","200","130","200","140","200","110","130","110","130","130","110","200","110","200","140","200","140"]},"In one embodiment of the invention, an advertising counter may be used to track a number of times that a television advertisement is presented by a DHCT . In one implementation, an advertisement continues to be presented via a DHCT  until it has been presented a predetermined number of times via the DHCT  or via a plurality of DHCTs. If the advertisement is stored in a DHCT , then it may be deleted from the DHCT  after it is presented a predetermined number of times. An \u201celectronic advertisement information\u201d (EAI) database  may be used to keep track of advertisements that are to be stored in or deleted from a DHCT . If the advertisement is stored at the headend , then the headend  may discontinue broadcasting the advertisement after it is presented a predetermined number of times. For example, a certain advertisement may be deleted or discontinued after it is presented 10 times by a single DHCT  and\/or after it is presented 15,000 times by a group of DHCTs. In one possible implementation, the advertising counter in a DHCT  may track the number of times that an advertisement is presented to a user or a group of users of a particular DHCT  by soliciting certain user input during, before, or after the presentation of the advertisement and then determining if the solicited input is received. In another implementation, the advertising counter may track the number of times that an advertisement is presented to a user based on whether the television  is turned on while the advertisement is being presented by the DHCT ; if the television is not turned on, then the counter is not incremented. In one possible implementation, a television may be determined to be turned on if certain user input related to the operation of the television (e.g., volume control, channel navigation, among others) had been received by the DHCT  within a preceding predetermined period of time.","In another embodiment, a television advertisement continues to be presented intermittently via a DHCT  until it has been presented a predetermined number of times via the DHCT  or until an expiration date. In yet another embodiment, an advertisement is only shown during enabled viewing periods associated with the advertisement and\/or according to the program category that the viewer is watching at a current time. Hence, an advertisement may feature a set of flags in an EAI database record that indicates when the respective advertisement is enabled for viewing. For example, a car or truck advertisement may be enabled for viewing during periods when a sports or news program is being watched and\/or during certain times of the day. The enabled viewing periods occur between the advertisement's introduction date and the advertisement's expiration date. The enabled viewing periods, the introduction date, and the expiration date may be received from the headend  and stored in the EAI database  in DRAM .","A enabled viewing period associated with a television advertisement may have a recurring schedule such as, for example, among others, a daily recurring schedule and\/or a weekly recurring schedule. As a non-limiting example, liquor or beer advertisements may have enabled viewing periods of 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. during weekdays and 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. during weekend days (weekly recurring schedule); adult movies and products advertisements may have enabled viewing periods from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. every day (daily recurring scheduled); and football advertisements may have enabled viewing periods from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekend days only (weekly recurring schedule).","In another embodiment of the invention, a user is presented with an advertisement that corresponds to an advertisement or type of advertisement that is selected by the user. An advertisement or type of advertisement may be selected by a user significantly in advance (e.g., an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year in advance) and\/or immediately prior to the presentation of a corresponding advertisement. Furthermore, an advertisement selection screen may be provided to a user in response to user input and\/or during an advertisement interruption in a television broadcast presentation. Selection options in an advertisement selection screen may be retrieved from the EAI database .","In yet another embodiment of the invention, an advertisement is associated with a value or weight. The DHCT  may keep track of the total value of the advertisements that are presented via DHCT  based on the value of the individual advertisements that are presented. For example, if the DHCT  presents ten advertisements having a value of 1, ten advertisements having a value of 2, and ten advertisements having a value of 3 over a certain period of time, then the total value of the advertisements presented over that period of time is equal to 60.","A user may be informed of the value of each of a plurality of advertisements and\/or types of advertisements and may be provided with an option of selecting the advertisements and\/or types of advertisements that the user desires to watch. In one implementation, the higher the total value of advertisements that are presented to a user over a certain period of time, the less the total number and\/or duration of advertisements will be. For example, a user who is presented with advertisements having a total value of 1 V may be presented with advertisements having a total duration of 2T, and another user who is presented advertisements having a value of 2V may be presented with advertisements having a total duration of 1T, where V represents a certain total value and T represents a certain total duration. Although the total value of advertisements presented over a certain period of time may be inversely correlated to the total duration of the advertisements, the correlation coefficient is not necessarily \u22121. In this manner, a Multiple System Operator (MSO) may assign values to advertisements based on the levels of advertisement exposure that are desired by the respective advertisers. An MSO may charge advertisers based on the value that is associated with their respective advertisements and\/or based on the estimated number of times that their respective advertisements are presented to viewers via DHCTs that receive the MSO's television programming. In one implementation, an estimated number of times that an advertisement is presented to a user may be based on user inputs that are received by the DHCTs confirming that the advertisement has been, is being, and\/or will be viewed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","200","200","205","110","240","200","280","140","250","250","260"]},"The DHCT  may include one or more wireless or wired interfaces (not shown), also called ports, for receiving and\/or transmitting data to other devices. For instance, the DHCT  may feature a USB (Universal Serial Bus), an Ethernet port (for connection to a computer), an IEEE-1394 connection (for connecting to consumer electronics equipment), a serial port, a parallel port, a radio frequency (RF) interface, and\/or an infra-red (IR) interface. In this manner, user inputs may be provided via, for example, a personal computer, buttons or keys located on the exterior of the DHCT , a hand-held remote control device, and\/or a keyboard that includes user-actuated keys, etc.","The DHCT  may include an advertisement storage unit  for storing advertisements. Stored advertisements are generally referred to herein as advertisement clips or advertisement media streams. The storage unit  may incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and\/or other types of storage media. An advertisement management application  may be used for managing advertisements, including managing content stored in the storage unit . Advertisements may be received from a headend  () and stored in the storage unit  based on instructions contained in the advertisement management application . Electronic advertisement information, or EAI data, associated with stored advertisements may be stored in DRAM  or in storage unit . Although shown as residing within the DHCT , the storage unit  may alternatively be located outside the DHCT  and coupled thereto using a wired or wireless connection. In an alternative embodiment, an advertisement storage unit  is not used in connection with the DHCT , in which case, an advertisement may be presented to a user as it is being received from the headend .","System memory  includes flash memory  and dynamic random access memory (DRAM)  for storing various applications, modules and data for execution and use by the processor . Basic functionality of the DHCT  is provided by an operating system  that is primarily stored in flash memory . The operating system  includes at least one resource manager  that provides an interface to and coordination of resources of the DHCT  such as, for example, computing resources.","One or more programmed software applications, herein referred to as applications, are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT . Applications stored in flash memory  or DRAM  are executed by processor  under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by an application is stored in DRAM  or flash memory  and read by processor  as needed during the course of the application's execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application at the time it was generated as a software application, in which case it is stored in flash memory . Data generated by an application is stored in DRAM  by processor  during the course of the application's execution.","An application referred to as navigator  is also resident in flash memory  and provides a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as television channel up\/down, last television channel, favorite television channel, etc. The client applications may be resident in flash memory  or downloaded into DRAM .","The flash memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, an HTML parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a service application manager (SAM) client .","The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  is also responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and allocation of the limited DHCT  screen resources. Window manager  allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. Window manager  communicates with resource manager  to coordinate available resources (such as display memory) among different resource-consuming processes. Such processes may be directly or indirectly invoked by one or more applications.","The window manager  also maintains, among other things, a user input registry  in DRAM  so that when a user enters a key or a command via a remote control device or another input device such as a keyboard or mouse, the user input registry  may be accessed to determine which of various applications running on the DHCT  should receive data corresponding to the input key and in which order. As an application is executed, it registers a request to receive certain user input keys or commands. When the user presses a key corresponding to one of the commands on the remote control device, the command is received by the receiver  and relayed to the processor . The processor  dispatches the event to the operating system  where it is forwarded to the window manager . The window manager  then accesses the user input registry  and routes data corresponding to the incoming command to the appropriate application.","The SAM client  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component being located on the headend  (). A SAM database  in DRAM  includes a data structure of services and a data structure of television channels that are created and updated by the headend . Many television services can be defined using the same application component, with different parameters. Television services include, without limitation and in accordance with one implementation, the presentation of television broadcast programs, video-on-demand (VOD), and interactive program guides (IPG). In general, the identification of a service includes the identification of an executable application that provides the service along with a set of application-dependent parameters that indicate to the application the service to be provided. As a non-limiting example, a service of presenting a television program could be executed with a set of parameters to view HBO or with a separate set of parameters to view CNN. Each association of the application component (tune video) and one parameter component (HBO or CNN) represents a particular service that has a unique service I.D.","Application clients can be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the SAM client , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend. In this non-limiting example, DRAM  contains an interactive program guide (IPG) application  and an advertisement management application . The IPG application  may use IPG data stored in IPG database  to determine a program's category prior to creating and presenting a graphical user interface containing program information sorted by category. Similarly, the advertisement management application  may use EAI data stored in an EAI database  to select and present an advertisement based on a desired advertisement category previously selected by a user. It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for an embodiment of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may, as an alternative embodiment, be resident in flash memory . These applications, and others provided by a television services system operator, are software entities for providing services to the user.","A broadcast file system (BFS) client  has a counterpart BFS server module (not shown) located at the headend . The BFS server repeatedly sends data that is received by the BFS client  and stored in DRAM . The data is sent on a data carousel over a period of time in cyclical repeated manner so that applications on a DHCT  can use the data as needed. For example, a BFS server may repeatedly send current IPG data and\/or IPG data updates so that an IPG application  is able to provide a user with current television program listings. Likewise, a BFS server may repeatedly send current EAI data and\/or EAI data updates so that advertisement management application  is able to present a user with updated and current advertisement information. The DHCT  may receive EAI data via an out-of-band channel or an in-band channel. Furthermore, EAI data may be received by the DHCT  as MPEG private data in an MPEG transport stream.","Advertisement management application  receives a plurality of media types that serve as television advertisements. Among others, a first type of advertisement comprises graphical and\/or textual information that is overlaid on a displayed video picture. A second type of advertisement comprises video data that is displayed in a full-screen format or in a downscaled video window. A third type of advertisement comprises audio data A fourth type of advertisement comprises a combination of graphical, textual, audio, and\/or video data.","A television advertisement may be packaged into a file and may be delivered to DHCT  via the BFS delivery mechanism. An advertisement that is received by a DHCT  may either be displayed immediately upon receipt or may be stored in the advertisement storage unit  for presentation at a later time. In one embodiment of the invention, a DHCT  receives an advertisement file that is broadcast by the BFS regardless of whether the advertisement corresponds to a user preference. In an alternative embodiment, a DHCT  only receives advertisement files that correspond to a user preference. For instance, subscribers that have indicated via preferences identified by the advertisement preference settings  that they wish to receive and view advertisements related to baby products, may receive BFS files corresponding to baby product advertisements whereas other subscribers may not. Advertisement preference settings  are preferably stored in DRAM , but may also be stored in non-volatile memory so that they may be retrieved in case of a power outage. The non-volatile memory may be flash memory  or memory that is external to the DHCT  such as, for example, the headend  or a storage device (not shown) that is coupled to the DHCT . Advertisement management application  interprets advertisement preferential settings stored in DRAM  and, in communication with BFS client , effects the opening of desired advertisement files on a periodic basis. Each advertisement category may be assigned a respective sub-directory. A DHCT  may open an advertisement category's sub-directory upon receiving a message from the headend  that an update to the advertisement category has occurred.","In one implementation, applications executing on the DHCT  work with the navigator  by abiding by several guidelines. First, an application utilizes the SAM client  for the provision, activation, and suspension of services and service enhancements. Second, an application shares DHCT  resources with other applications and abides by the resource management policies of the SAM client , the operating system , and the DHCT . Third, an application conforms to situations where shared resources are only accessible via the navigator . Fourth, when an application loses service authorization while providing a service, the application suspends the service via the SAM client  (the navigator  will reactivate an individual service application when it later becomes authorized). Finally, an application client is designed to not have access to certain user input keys reserved by the navigator  (e.g., power, channel +\/\u2212, volume +\/\u2212, etc.).","Data and software used in providing a DHCT service to a user may be stored in one or more of the following memory resources: a data storage device located at a headend, a data storage device located at a customer premises, a non-volatile memory internal to the DHCT , and\/or a hard drive internal to the DHCT . For example, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to a client application (e.g. IPG application ), or to respective parts thereof, may reside in and\/or execute out of DRAM  and\/or flash memory , or may reside in a local storage device connected to DHCT  and may be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program or algorithm may reside in DRAM  or in flash memory , or may reside in a local storage device connected to the DHCT  and may be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program or algorithm may be written into DRAM  by the executable program or algorithm and may be transferred to flash memory  or to a local storage device for storage purposes. It should be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited by where or how any data and\/or applications are stored or retrieved.","Each of the above mentioned applications comprises executable instructions for implementing logical functions and can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d can be any means that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection (electronic) having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM) (electronic), a read-only memory (ROM) (electronic), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory) (electronic), an optical fiber (optical), and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM) (optical). Note that the computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, and then stored in a computer memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","200","300","310","311","312","313","314","310","320","395","371","372","373","371","372","373"]},"In an alternative embodiment of the invention, different and\/or additional systems and methods of providing user input may be used including, for example, a remote control device having different keys and\/or key layouts, a keyboard device, a mouse, a voice activated input system, a touch-screen display, etc. The invention described herein is not limited by the type of device used to provide user input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","395","401","200","401","310","320","403","300","371"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","400","501","402","400","400","402","501"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","500","600","402","400","601","502","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["700","600","701","602","602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"],"b":["800","800","395","801","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","901","200","902","200","200","200","902","903","901"]},"After the DHCT  determines whether an advertisement has been or is being viewed, then the DHCT  in step  updates an advertisement tracking database accordingly.
