{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to Prov. U.S. Pat. App. Ser. No. 61\/372,830, filed Aug. 11, 2010 and entitled \u201cSystems and Methods to Identify Carrier Information for Transmission of Premium Messages,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","At least some embodiments of the disclosure relate to mobile communications in general and, more particularly but not limited to, mobile communications to facilitate online transactions.","Short Message Service (SMS) is a communications protocol that allows the interchange of short text messages between mobile telephone devices. SMS messages are typically sent via a Short Message Service Center (SMSC) of a mobile carrier, which uses a store-and-forward mechanism to deliver the messages. When a mobile telephone is not reachable immediately for the delivery of the message, the SMSC stores the message for later retry.","SMS messages can be sent via gateways. Some gateways function as aggregators. An aggregator typically does not have the capacity to deliver the messages directly to the mobile phones. An aggregator typically interfaces with and relies upon the SMSC of a mobile carrier to deliver SMS messages.","Some gateways function as providers that are capable of sending text messages to mobile devices directly, without going through the SMSC of other mobile operators.","Text messaging between mobile telephones can also be performed using other protocols, such as SkyMail and Short Mail in Japan.","Some mobile carriers provide email gateway services to allow text messages to be sent to mobile phones via email. For example, a non-subscriber of the mobile carrier may send a message to an email address associated with a mobile phone of a subscriber of the mobile carrier to have the message delivered to the mobile phone via text messaging.","Emails can also be sent to mobile telephone devices via standard mail protocols, such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) over Internet Protocol Suite (commonly TCP\/IP, named from two of the protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP)).","Short messages may be used to provide premium services to mobile phones, such as news alerts, ring tones, etc. The premium content providers may send the messages to the SMSC of the mobile operator using a TCP\/IP protocol, such as Short Message Peer-to-peer Protocol (SMPP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, for delivery to a mobile phone; and the mobile phone is billed by the mobile operator for the cost of receiving the premium content.","Premium services may also be delivered via text messages initiated from the mobile phone. For example, a televoting service provider may obtain a short code to receive text messages from mobile phones; and when the user sends a text message to the short code, the mobile carrier routes the message to the televoting service provider and charges the user a fee, a portion of which is collected for the televoting service provider.","Systems and methods to collect funds via mobile phones are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.","In one aspect, a system includes: a data storage facility; and an interchange coupled with the data storage facility. The interchange includes a common format processor and a plurality of converters to interface with a plurality of different controllers of mobile communications. The converters are configured to communicate with the controllers in different formats; and the converters are configured to communicate with the common format processor in a common format.","In one embodiment, in response to a request identifying a phone number, a payment amount and a payee, the interchange is to: transmit a pinging message to the phone number; receive a response to the pinging message and identify telecommunication carrier information of the phone number from the response; store in the data storage facility carrier data associating the telecommunication carrier information and the phone number; select a first converter from the converters based on the telecommunication carrier information associated with the phone number; determine at least one premium message based on the payment amount and a set of predetermined prices for premium messages to be transmitted via a telecommunication carrier of a mobile phone at the phone number; and transmit the at least one premium message to the mobile phone using the first converter of the converters.","In another aspect, a method implemented in a computing device includes: receiving in an interchange a request identifying a phone number, a payment amount and a payee; in response to the request, transmitting from the common format processor a first message in accordance with the phone number; receiving at the interchange a response to the first message; identifying telecommunication carrier information of the phone number from the response; determining at least one premium message based on the payment amount and a set of predetermined prices for premium messages to be transmitted via a telecommunication carrier of a mobile phone at the phone number; and transmitting the at least one premium message to the mobile phone using a first converter of the converters according to the telecommunication carrier information.","In one embodiment, the telecommunication carrier of the mobile phone is to collect funds from a user of the mobile phone according to the set of predetermined prices for premium messages and to provide the funds to the interchange according to the at least one premium message; and the interchange is to pay the amount to the payee in accordance with the request.","The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods, including data processing systems which perform these methods, and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.","Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However, in certain instances, well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment; and, such references mean at least one.","Reference in this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.","In one embodiment, an interchange is used to interface with a plurality of different controllers of mobile communications, such as SMS messages. The interchange can be used to associate account information with phone numbers to facilitate electronic payments via mobile devices, such as cellular phones. The interchange is configured to communicate with the mobile phones through the different controllers to provide security and convenience for online transactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","115","117","105"]},"In , a data storage facility () stores user account information () and the corresponding phone numbers () of the mobile phones (). The interchange () is coupled with the data storage facility () to communicate with the mobile phones () at the corresponding phone numbers () to confirm operations that are performed using the account information (). Since the account information () is secured by the interchange (), the account information () can be used to pay for products and services offered by the servers () of various merchants, without being revealed to the merchants.","In one embodiment, the server () offers products and\/or services adapted for a virtual world environment, such as an online game environment, a virtual reality environment, etc. The products may be virtual goods, which can be delivered via the transmission of data or information (without having to physically deliver an object to the user). For example, the virtual goods may be a song, a piece of music, a video clip, an article, a computer program, a decorative item for an avatar, a piece of virtual land in a virtual world, a virtual object in a virtual reality world, etc. For example, an online game environment hosted on a server () may sell services and products via points or virtual currency, which may be consumed by the user while engaging in a game session. For example, a virtual reality world hosted on a server () may have a virtual currency, which may be used by the residents of the virtual reality world to conduct virtual commerce within the virtual reality world (e.g., buy virtual lands, virtual stocks, virtual objects, services provided in the virtual reality world, etc). In other embodiments, the server () may also offer physical goods, such as books, compact discs, photo prints, postcards, etc.","In , the interchange () may communicate with different controllers () of mobile communications via different networks (e.g.,  and ) and\/or protocols. The interchange () processes the requests in a common format and uses a set of converters for communications with the different controllers () respectively.","For example, the controllers () may be different aggregators, providers and\/or SMSCs of different mobile carriers. Based on the phone numbers (), the interchange () interfaces with the corresponding controllers () to communicate with the mobile phones () via text messaging to confirm the operations related to the corresponding account information (), such as bank accounts, credit card numbers, charge card numbers, etc.","In , the user terminals () may use a unified interface to send requests to the interchange (). For example, a website of the interchange () may be used to receive the account information () from the web browsers running in the user terminals (). The user terminals () are typically different from the mobile phones (). However, in some embodiments, users may use the mobile phone () to access the web and submit the account information (). Alternatively, the users may use the mobile phone () to submit the account information () to the interchange () via text messaging, email, instant messaging, etc.","The use of the mobile phones () in the confirmation of activities that involve the account information () increases the security of the transaction, since the mobile phones () are typically secured in the possession of the users.","Further, in one embodiment, the interchange () may use the phone bills of the mobile phones () to pay for purchases, in order to use the account information () to pay for the phone bills, and\/or to deposit funds into the accounts identified by the account information () by charging on the phone bills of the corresponding mobile phones (). In some embodiments, the accounts identified by the account information () are hosted on the data storage facility (). In other embodiments, the accounts are hosted on the account servers () of financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, credit card companies, etc.","In one embodiment, once the account information () is associated with the mobile phones () via their phone numbers () stored in the data storage facility (), the users may use the user terminals () to access online servers () of various merchants or service providers to make purchases. From the user terminals (), the users can use the accounts identified by the account information () to make the payment for the purchases, without revealing their account information () to the operators of the servers ().","In one embodiment, the mobile phones () are used by the corresponding users to make payments and\/or manage funds, such as for making purchases in various websites hosted on the servers () of merchants and service providers and\/or for transferring funds to or from an account identified by the account information (), such as phone bills of land-line telephone services, credit card accounts, debit card accounts, bank accounts, etc., or an account hosted on the data storage facility () or telecommunication accounts of the mobile phones () with telecommunication carriers. The mobile phones () are used to confirm and\/or approve the transactions associated with the account identified by the account information () (or other accounts). The interchange () interfaces the mobile phones () and the servers () to confirm and\/or approve transactions and to operate on the account identified by the account information () (and\/or other accounts associated with the phone number ()).","For example, the user terminal () may provide the phone numbers () to the servers () to allow the servers () to charge the account identified by the account information () associated with the phone number (). The interchange () sends a message to the mobile phone () via the phone number () to confirm the payment request. Once the payment is confirmed or approved via the corresponding mobile phone (), the interchange () charges the account identified by the account information () (e.g., by communicating with the account server () on which the corresponding accounts are hosted) and pays the server () on behalf of the user, using the funds obtained from the corresponding account identified by the account information ().","In one embodiment, the user terminal () may not even provide the phone number () to the server () to process the payment. The server () may redirect a payment request to the interchange (), which then prompts the user terminal () to provide the phone number () to the website of the interchange () to continue the payment process.","For example, the server () may redirect the payment request to the website of the interchange () with a reference indicating the purchase made via the user terminal (). The interchange () can use the reference to subsequently complete the payment with the server () for the purchase, after receiving the phone number () directly from the user terminal () to confirm the payment via the mobile phone ().","In some embodiments, instead of directly providing the phone number () to identify the account information (), the user may provide other information to identify the phone number (), such as an account identifier of the user assigned to the user for obtaining the services of the interchange ().","In one embodiment, the account information () is pre-associated with the phone number () prior to the payment request. The account information () may be submitted to the interchange () via the user terminal () or the mobile phone () via a secure connection.","Alternatively, the user may supply the account information () to the interchange () at the time the payment request is submitted from the user terminal () to the interchange (). Alternatively, the user may supply the account information () to the interchange () at the time the user responds to the confirmation message for the payment request.","In some embodiments, the user may supply the account information () after a transaction using funds collected via the telecommunication carrier of the mobile phone () at the phone number (). For example, after the transaction, the interchange () may send an invitation message, such as a text message to the mobile phone () at the phone number (), to the user to invite the user to register with the interchange () and provide the account information (). The user may register with the interchange () via the mobile phone () (e.g., by a replying text message), or via a web page of the interchange () (e.g., using a link and\/or a unique code provided in the invitation message).","After the user registers with the interchange () (e.g., via the mobile phone () and by providing the account information ()), the user may create a customized personal identification number (PIN) or receive a PIN for enhanced security. Using the PIN, the user may use the account information () to complete an online transaction without having to confirm and\/or approve a transaction using the mobile phone (). In some embodiments, the PIN may be used to reduce unwanted messages to the mobile phone (). For example, once the phone number () and the account information () are associated with a PIN, the interchange () may require the user of the user terminal () to provide the correct PIN to initiate the payment process. Thus, a spammer having only the phone number () (or a different user mistakenly using the phone number ()) may not successfully use the user terminal () to request the interchange () to send confirmation messages to the mobile phone () protected by the PIN. In some embodiments, the interchange () may offer further incentives to the user for registering with the interchange (), such as reduced fees, discounts, coupons, free products and services, etc.","In one embodiment, once the account information () is associated with the phone number () in the data storage facility (), the user does not have to resubmit the account information () in subsequent payment requests.","By delegating the payment task to the interchange () and securing the account information () in the data storage facility (), the system as shown in  can increase the security of using the account information () in an online environment.","In some embodiments, the interchange () can also fulfill the payment requests using the funds collected via the phone bill of the phone numbers (). The interchange () can collect the funds via sending premium messages to the mobile phones () at the phone numbers (), after receiving confirmation from the mobile phone ().","For example, after the confirmation or approval message is received from the mobile phone (), the interchange () performs operations to collect funds via the phone bill of the phone number (). The interchange () may calculate the required premium messages to bill to the mobile phone (). For example, mobile terminated premium SMS messages may have a predetermined set of prices for premium messages. The interchange () determines a combination of the premium messages that has a price closest to the amount required by the transaction, and sends this combination of premium messages to the mobile phone (). For example, mobile originated premium SMS messages may also have a predetermined set of prices for premium messages. The interchange () can calculate the set of messages required for the transaction and transmit a text message to the mobile phone () of the user to instruct the user to send the required number of premium messages to provide the funds.","In one embodiment, the data storage facility () stores the transaction history () associated with the phone number () and uses the transaction history () to approve payment requests and to reduce the time period for processing a subsequent payment request.","For example, from the transaction history () the interchange () may identify a pattern of prior payment requests made via the phone number () and match subsequent requests with the identified pattern. When a subsequent request matches the pattern, the interchange () may skip the communication with the mobile phone () at the phone number (), which communication is otherwise performed after the payment request and before the payment operation for payment confirmation and\/or approval. Skipping such a communication between the payment request and the payment operation can reduce the time period for payment processing and improve user experience.","Examples of transaction patterns may include the use of the individual user terminals (), the typical time period of payment requests, range of payment amounts, and\/or certain characteristics of payees, such as a collection of frequently used payees, payees who provide certain types of products or services, the geographical region of payees, etc.","In one embodiment, when the subsequent payment request is received within a predetermined time limit of a previous confirmed payment request from the same user terminal (), the interchange () may approve the payment request without communicating with the mobile phone () at the phone number () for approval or confirmation.","In one embodiment, when the interchange () skips the communication with the mobile phone () at the phone number () for approval or confirmation and approves a transaction request based on the transaction history (), the interchange () may send a notification message to the mobile phone () at the phone number () for enhanced security but not requiring a response from the user. If the user determines that the notification message corresponds to an unauthorized use of the phone number (), the user may reply to the notification message from the mobile phone () to report the unauthorized use and\/or stop or reverse the payment operation.","In some embodiments, the user may start a session (e.g., a web session) authenticated using a password associated with the phone number (), prior to the payment request. When the payment request is made within the authenticated session (e.g., before the user logs off the session, or before the session times out), the interchange () may skip the confirmation\/approval communication with the mobile phone () at the phone number () to reduce the time period for payment processing.","In one embodiment, the session is authenticated via communications with the mobile phone () at the phone number (). For example, after the user provides the phone number () to log into a session on a user terminal (), the interchange () may generate a code (e.g., a code for one time use) and send the code to the user via the user terminal () (or the mobile phone () at the phone number ()). The interchange () then requests the code back from the user via the mobile phone () at the phone number () (or the user terminal ()), which is not used to send the code. When the code sent by the interchange () matches the code received back from the user, the association between the user terminal () and the mobile phone () at the phone number () can be established; and the identity of the user of the user terminal () can be confirmed. Such confirmation can be logged in the transaction history () for subsequent approval of payment requests.","In one embodiment, the user may specify a time period for the session, or the time period for the association between the user terminal () and the phone number (). The user may specify the time period using the user terminal () when providing the phone number () to initiate the session, or specify the time period using the mobile phone () when providing the one-time code back to the interchange (). During the time period of the confirmed association between the user terminal () and the phone number (), a payment request from the user terminal () can be automatically identified with the phone number () without the user having to explicitly specify the phone number () for the payment request. Alternatively, for enhanced security and\/or flexibility, the interchange () may require the user to identify the phone number () in the payment request, even though the payment request is from the user terminal () that is associated with the phone number ().","In one embodiment, the code for the authentication of the session can be communicated to and\/or from the mobile phone () via short message service (SMS), voice message, voice mail, or other services, such as email, instant messaging, multimedia messaging service (MMS), etc.","In one embodiment, after the user provides the phone number () to log into a session on a user terminal (), the interchange () provides a message to the mobile phone () at the phone number () and receives a reply to the message from the mobile phone () within a predetermined period of time to authenticate the session and associate the user terminal () with the phone number (). If the reply is not received from the mobile phone () with the predetermined period of time, the session is not authenticated.","In one embodiment, the user may provide an advance approval for subsequent payment requests to pay via the phone number (). The advance approval may include a number of limitations, such as the time limit for the expiration of the advance approval, the budget limit for the advance approval, a limit on payees for the advance approval, etc. For example, the advance approval may limit the payees based on their business category, web address, product type, service type, geographic location, etc. For example, the budget limit may include the frequency of subsequent payment requests, limit for individual payment requests, and total limit for subsequent payment requests, etc.","In one embodiment, the advance approval is specific for a user terminal. For example, the advance approval may be obtained via communications with the user via both a specific user terminal () and the mobile phone () at the phone number (). Thus, the advance approval applies only to subsequent payment requests from the specific user terminal () identified by the advance approval.","Alternatively, the advance approval may not be limited to a specific user terminal (). The advance approval may be used for any user terminals () used by the user of the phone number () to request payments via the phone number (). In some embodiments, the advance approval is limited to user terminals () of certain characteristics identified by the advance approval, such as a geographic region of the user terminal () (e.g., determined based on the communication addresses, routing paths, access points for wireless connections, base stations for cellular communications, etc.). In some embodiments, the interchange () automatically identifies these characteristics based on the communications to obtain the advance approval (e.g., based on transaction history ()), without the user explicitly specifying the characteristics.","In one embodiment, the data storage facility () also stores user information () associated with the phone number (). When authorized, the interchange () provides the user information () to the servers () to facilitate transactions between the user terminals () and the servers ().","For example, the user information () may include shipping address, billing address, user preferences, login credentials, etc. In some embodiments, the interchange () may also provide the account information () to the server () to allow the server () to charge the user using the account information (). Thus, the account information () may also be considered as part of the user information () in some embodiments.","In one embodiment, after a request for payment to a merchant is confirmed\/approved via the mobile phone () at the phone number (), the interchange () provides the server () with the user information () that is associated with the phone number () in the data storage facility (), to provide assistance in the transaction. For example, the user may store the shipping address as part of the user information () associated with the phone number () on the data storage facility (). After the interchange () finishes processing the payment request, the interchange () may provide the shipping address to the server () to allow the merchant to ship a product to the user; thus, the user does not have to manually submit the shipping address to various servers ().","In one embodiment, after a request is confirmed\/approved via the mobile phone () at the phone number (), the interchange () may provide at least a portion of the account information () to the server () to allow the server () to process the payment using the account information (). For example, the interchange () may provide the account identifier (e.g., a credit card number, a bank account number, a debit card number), or a portion of the account identifier, to the server () to allow the server () to charge the user using the account identifier. Thus, the user does not have to manually supply the corresponding information to the server (). In one embodiment, the entire account identifier is provided to the server () for the convenience of the user. In one embodiment, a partial account identifier is provided to the server () to balance convenience and security; and the user provides the remaining portion of the account identifier directly to the server () to complete the transaction. In some embodiments, the interchange () provides the server () with information related to account type, expiration date, billing address, etc. to assist the user in the check out process on the server (). In some embodiments, the interchange () does not provide the account identifier to the server () for improved security; and the server () obtains the account identifier from the user directly and obtains other information, such as account type, expiration date, billing address, etc. from the interchange ().","In one embodiment, the interchange () dynamically determines the amount of information that is provided to the server (). For example, the decision may be based on matching the current transaction with a pattern of past transactions (e.g., determined based on the transaction history ()) and\/or the security levels at the server (). When there is a match, some of the information that is not otherwise provided may be provided from the interchange () to the server (), such as a portion of the account information ().","In some embodiments, the interchange () provides the information to the server () based on an advance approval obtained from the mobile phone (), or based on an approval decision made based on the transaction history ().","In one embodiment, the interchange () provides the user information () to sign into an authenticated session with the server (). In some embodiments, the authenticated session is associated with the interchange () and\/or used as an advance approval for payment requests occurring in the session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["101","135","113","113","101","101","123","113","113","101"]},"In , the interchange () includes a common format processor (), which processes various payment options in a common format. In one embodiment, the common format processor () can handle the payments via mobile terminated text message, mobile originated text message, operator bill, credit card, stored value account, and other online payment options. The common format processor () determines the actual amount that is to be billed to the user, based on the payment options (e.g., mobile terminated premium SMS, mobile originated premium SMS, operator billing, credit cards, etc.), and selects a converter () to communicate with a corresponding controller ().","Different converters () are configured to communicate with corresponding controllers () in different languages and protocols. The converters () perform the translation between the common format used by the common format processor () and the corresponding formats used by the controllers ().","The use of the common format processor () simplifies the structure of the interchange () and reduces the development effort required for the interchange () to interface with the increasing number of different controllers, such as SMSC, mobile providers, aggregators, gateways, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["133","157"]},"In one premium message billing method, the interchange () sends mobile terminated premium SMS messages to the mobile phone () to bill the user, or requests the mobile phone () to send mobile originated premium SMS messages to a short code representing the interchange ().","In one operator billing method, the interchange () directly sends a message to the mobile carrier of the mobile phone () to bill the amount on the phone bill of the mobile phone (), without having to send a premium message to the mobile phone ().","The common format processor () includes a decision engine () which decides how to generate a set of one or more messages to the mobile phone () based on a set of rules (), regulations (), limits (), records () and restrictions ().","For example, different countries have different regulations () governing the mobile communications with the mobile phones (). For example, different mobile carriers have different rules () regarding premium messages. For example, past transaction records () can be used to monitor the transactions to discover suspected fraudulent activities. For example, parental limits () and merchant restrictions () can be imposed.","Based on results of the decision engine (), the mobile message generator () generates one or more messages to communicate with the mobile phone () about the transaction (e.g., a request to collect funds via the phone bill of the user for a payment request, or for deposit into an account identified by the account information ()). The converter () then interfaces with the corresponding controller () to transmit the messages to the mobile phones ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["111","171","121","101","123","111","121","111","117","117","111","121"]},"After the user provides the account information () to the interchange () for storage in the data storage facility (), the user can send () a charge request to the server () of a merchant from the user terminal (). The server () of the merchant can send or redirect () the charge request to the interchange (). In response to the charge request, the interchange () sends () a confirmation message to the mobile phone (). If the user sends () an approval, or an appropriate reply, to the confirmation message from the mobile phone (), the interchange () communicates with the account server () to charge an account of the user identified by the account information (), without revealing the account information () to the server (). The interchange () pays the merchant on behalf of the user using the funds collected via charging the account of the user. For example, the interchange () may use its own bank account to pay the merchant operating the server (). Thus, the financial information of the user is not revealed to the merchant.","Upon the completion of the payment process, the interchange () can notify the user via the mobile phone () and\/or the user terminal ().","In some embodiments, the server () of the merchant redirects the charge request to allow the user terminal () to communicate with the interchange () to continue the payment process; and the user terminal () may provide () the account information () directly to the interchange () after the charge request is redirected.","In alternative embodiments, the user may provide the account information () from the mobile phone () together with the approval of the charge request.","In one embodiment, the interchange () communicates with the mobile phone () for the confirmation of the charge request via SMS messages. Alternatively, the confirmation and approval messages can be sent () via emails, instant messages, voice message, live calls from operators, etc.","In some embodiments, the user of the mobile phone () may choose to fulfill the charge request via the phone bill, instead of charging the account identified by the account information (). Thus, after the confirmation, the interchange () sends the premium messages to the mobile phone () to collect funds via the phone bill of the mobile phone (). In other embodiments, the interchange () may send an instruction with the confirmation message to the mobile phone () to instruct the user to send mobile originated premium messages to the interchange () to collect the funds via the phone bill of the mobile phone ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["180","183","123","121","181"]},"In , the user interface () further includes an option list, which allows the user to select various types of accounts, such as credit card accounts, bank accounts, charge card accounts, etc. In the example illustrated in , the checkbox () is selected to specify a credit card account.","In some embodiments, the user interface () may further present a text field (not shown in ) to allow the user to specify an alias for the account information () supplied in the text input field (). For enhanced security, the alias can be used for subsequent communications with the user without revealing the account information ().","In , the user interface () may be presented via a web browser (or a custom application) to submit account information () in the text input field () from a user terminal () to the interchange (). Alternatively, the account number can be submitted from the mobile phone () via a message sent via SMS, WAP, voice mail, or via an interactive voice response (IVR) system.","In one embodiment, the server () presents the payment option () via an online shopping cart system or a third party checkout system. Alternatively or in combination, the server () presents the payment option () via a web widget.

In one embodiment, the I\/O controller () includes a USB (Universal Serial Bus) adapter for controlling USB peripherals, and\/or an IEEE-1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE-1394 peripherals.","The memory () may include ROM (Read Only Memory), volatile RAM (Random Access Memory), and non-volatile memory, such as hard drive, flash memory, etc.","Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. Non-volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive, a magnetic optical drive, an optical drive (e.g., a DVD RAM), or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non-volatile memory may also be a random access memory.","The non-volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non-volatile memory that is remote from the system, such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface, can also be used.","In this description, various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code\/instructions by a processor, such as a microprocessor. Alternatively, or in combination, the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry, with or without software instructions, such as using Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions, or in combination with software instructions. Thus, the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems, various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer-readable media used to actually effect the distribution.","At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache or a remote storage device.","Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions referred to as \u201ccomputer programs.\u201d The computer programs typically include one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer, cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.","A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory and\/or cache. Portions of this software and\/or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further, the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and\/or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively, portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically, just in time, when needed for execution. Thus, it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.","Examples of computer-readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non-recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media (e.g., Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD ROMS), Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), etc.), among others. The computer-readable media may store the instructions.","The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. However, propagated signals, such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.","In general, a tangible machine readable medium includes any apparatus that provides (i.e., stores and\/or transmits) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).","In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order, operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.","In the foregoing specification, the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof.
