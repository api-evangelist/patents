Phase application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 from International Application No. PCT\/US2011\/037718, filed May 24 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/349,065, filed May 27, 2010.","Cyclic GMP (cGMP) is an important intracellular messenger which triggers a multitude of different effects via the modulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases, phosphodiesterases and ion channels. Examples are the relaxation of smooth muscles, the inhibition of thrombocyte activation and the inhibition of the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and of leukocyte adhesion. cGMP is produced by particulate and soluble guanylate cyclases as a response to a number of extracellular and intracellular stimuli. In the case of the particulate guanylate cyclases, stimulation is essentially effected by peptidic messengers, such as the atrial natriuretic peptide or the cerebral natriuretic peptide. The soluble guanylate cyclases (\u201csGC\u201d), which are cytosolic heterodimeric heme proteins, in contrast, are essentially regulated by a family of low-molecular-weight factors which are formed enzymatically. The most important stimulant is nitrogen monoxide (\u201cNO\u201d) or a closely related species. The function of other factors such as carbon monoxide or the hydroxyl radical is still largely unclear. The binding of NO to the heme with formation of a penta-coordinate heme-nitrosyl complex is proposed as the mechanism of the activation by NO. The associated release of the histidine which is bound in the basal state to the iron converts the enzyme into the active conformation.","Active soluble guanylate cyclases are composed of an \u03b1 and a \u03b2 subunit each. Several subunit subtypes have been described which differ from one another with respect to sequence, tissue-specific distribution and expression in different development stages. The subtypes \u03b1and \u03b2are mainly expressed in brain and lung, while \u2296is found in particular in liver and kidney. The subtype \u03b1was shown to be present in human fetal brain. The subunits referred to as \u03b1and \u03b2were isolated from human brain and are homologous to \u03b1and \u03b2. More recent works indicate an \u03b1subunit which contains an insert in the catalytic domain. All subunits show great homologies in the region of the catalytic domain. The enzymes presumably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is bound via \u03b2-Cys-78 and\/or \u03b2-His-105 and is part of the regulatory center.","Under pathologic conditions, the formation of guanylate-cyclase-activating factors can be reduced, or their degradation may be promoted owing to the increased occurrence of free radicals. The resulting reduced activation of the sGC leads, via a weakening of the respective cGMP-mediated cellular response, for example to an increase of the blood pressure, to platelet activation or to increased cell proliferation and cell adhesion. As a consequence, formation of endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, hypertension, stable or unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, myocardial infarction, strokes or erectile dysfunction results. Pharmacological stimulation of sGC offers a possibility to normalize cGMP production and therefore makes possible the treatment and\/or prevention of such disorders.","For the pharmacological stimulation of the sGC, use has been made of compounds whose activity is based on an intermediate NO release, for example organic nitrates. The drawback of this treatment is the development of tolerance and a reduction of activity, and the higher dosage which is required because of this.","Various sGC stimulators which do not act via NO release were described by Vesely in a series of publications. However, the compounds, most of which are hormones, plant hormones, vitamins or natural compounds such as, for example, lizard poisons, predominantly only have weak effects on the cGMP formation in cell lysates.

A stimulation of heme-free guanylate cyclase by protoporphyrin IX was demonstrated by Ignarro et al., Adv. Pharmacol., vol. 26, 1994, p. 35. Pettibone et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., vol. 116, 1985 p. 307, described an antihypertensive action of diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate and attributed this to a stimulation of sGC. According to Yu et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol, vol. 114, 1995, p. 1587, isoliquiritigenin, which has a relaxing action on isolated rat aortas, also activates sGC. Ko et al., Blood vol. 84, 1994, p. 4226, Yu et al., Biochem.

A \u201cstable\u201d compound is a compound which can be prepared and isolated and whose structure and properties remain or can be caused to remain essentially unchanged for a period of time sufficient to allow use of the compound for the purposes described herein (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic administration to a subject).","By \u201coxo\u201d is meant the functional group \u201c\u2550O\u201d which is an oxygen atom connected to the molecule via a double bond, such as, for example, (1) \u201cC\u2550(O)\u201d, that is a carbonyl group; (2) \u201cS\u2550(O)\u201d, that is, a sulfoxide group; and (3) \u201cN\u2550(O)\u201d, that is, an N-oxide group, such as pyridyl-N-oxide.","When any variable (e.g., R, R, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula I or other generic Formulae herein, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and\/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.","Under standard nomenclature used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first, followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment.

Where multiple substituent moieties are disclosed or claimed, the substituted compound can be independently substituted by one or more of the disclosed or claimed substituent moieties, singly or plurally. By independently substituted, it is meant that the (two or more) substituents can be the same or different.","Reference to the compounds of structural Formula I includes the compounds of other generic structural Formulae that fall within the scope of Formula I, including but not limited to Formulae IA, II and III.","Compounds of structural Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereoisomeric mixtures and individual diastereoisomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural Formula I.","Compounds of structural Formula I may be separated into their individual diastereoisomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof, or via chiral chromatography using an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.","Alternatively, any stereoisomer or isomers of a compound of the general structural Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.","If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.","For compounds of Formula I described herein which contain olefinic double bonds, unless specified otherwise, they are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.","Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol foul). are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of Formula I of the present invention.","In the compounds of structural Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominately found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of structural Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H, also denoted as D). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within structural Formula I, can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates.","The present invention includes all stereoisomeric fauns of the compounds of Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have S configuration or R configuration. The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis\/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at the stage of the compounds of Formula I or at the stage of an intermediate during the synthesis.","It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of structural Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

The activation of the sGC by the compounds of Formula I can be examined, for example, in the activity assay described below.","The terms \u201ctherapeutically effective (or efficacious) amount\u201d and similar descriptions such as \u201can amount efficacious for treatment\u201d are intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The terms \u201cprophylactically effective (or efficacious) amount\u201d and similar descriptions such as \u201can amount efficacious for prevention\u201d are intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. As an example, the dosage a patient receives can be selected so as to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure; the dosage a patient receives may also be titrated over time in order to reach a target blood pressure. The dosage regimen utilizing a compound of the instant invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the potency of the compound chosen to be administered; the route of administration; and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of myocardial infarction.","Disorders and pathological conditions which are associated with a low cGMP level or in which an increase of the cGMP level is desired and for whose therapy and prophylaxis it is possible to use compounds of Formula I are, for example, cardiovascular diseases, such as endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, which includes pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), stable and unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, restenoses, myocardial infarction, strokes, cardiac insufficiency or pulmonary hypertonia, or, for example, erectile dysfunction, asthma bronchiale, chronic kidney insufficiency and diabetes. Compounds of Formula I can additionally be used in the therapy of cirrhosis of the liver and also for improving a restricted memory performance or ability to learn.","The compounds of Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans, as pharmaceuticals by themselves, in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes animals, preferably mammals and especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of, or desire, treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may be in need of or desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of said disease or medical condition. As used herein, a patient \u201cin need\u201d of treatment of an existing condition or of prophylactic treatment encompasses both a determination of need by a medical professional as well as the desire of a patient for such treatment.","A subject of the present invention therefore also are the compounds of Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use for activating soluble guanylate cyclase, for normalizing a disturbed cGMP balance and in particular their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes.","A therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of myocardial infarction.","Furthermore, a subject of the present invention are pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which comprise as active component an effective dose of at least one compound of Formula I and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and\/or additives.","Thus, a subject of the invention are, for example, said compound and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use as a pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical preparations which comprise as active component an effective dose of said compound and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and the uses of said compound and\/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the therapy or prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes.","The pharmaceuticals according to the invention can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions, syrups, emulsions or suspensions, or rectally, for example in the form of suppositories. Administration can also be carried out parenterally, for example subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously in the form of solutions for injection or infusion. Other suitable administration forms are, for example, percutaneous or topical administration, for example in the form of ointments, tinctures, sprays or transdermal therapeutic systems, or the inhalative administration in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures, or, for example, microcapsules, implants or rods. The preferred administration form depends, for example, on the disease to be treated and on its severity.","The amount of active compound of Formula I and\/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from 0.2 to 200 mg, preferably from 1 to 200 mg, per dose, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it can also be higher. The pharmaceutical preparations usually comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of Formula I and\/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of the pharmaceutical preparations can be carried out in a manner known per se. For this purpose, one or more compounds of Formula I and\/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier substances and\/or additives (or auxiliary substances) and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds having therapeutic or prophylactic action, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human or veterinary medicine.","For the production of pills, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, starch, for example maize starch, or starch derivatives, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened oils, etc. Suitable carriers for the preparation of solutions, for example of solutions for injection, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, physiologically sodium chloride solution, alcohols such as ethanol, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, mannitol, vegetable oils, etc. It is also possible to lyophilize the compounds of Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to use the resulting lyophilisates, for example, for preparing preparations for injection or infusion. Suitable carriers for microcapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.","Besides the active compounds and carriers, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain customary additives, for example fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.","The dosage of the active compound of Formula I and\/or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to be adminstered depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg, in particular 0.3 to 5 mg\/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose can be administered in a single dose or, in particular when larger amounts are administered, be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses. In some cases, depending on the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. A single daily dose is preferred.","The compounds of Formula I activate soluble guanylate cyclase. On account of this property, apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as an aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on soluble guanylate cyclase is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula I and salts thereof can furthermore be employed, as already mentioned above, as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.","One or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I. An additional active agent (or agents) is intended to mean a pharmaceutically active agent (or agents) that is active in the body, including pro-drugs that convert to pharmaceutically active form after administration, which are different from the compound of Formula I, and also includes free-acid, free-base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said additional active agents. Generally, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-hypertensive agents, anti-atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound, anti-diabetic agents and\/or anti-obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation (a fixed dose drug combination), or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents (co-administration of the separate active agents). Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g. alacepril, benazepril, captopril, ceronapril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril, enalaprilat, fosinopril, imidapril, lisinopril, moveltipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, temocapril, or trandolapril), angiotensin H receptor antagonists (e.g., losartan i.e., COZAAR\u00ae, valsartan, candesartan, olmesartan, telmesartan and any of these drugs used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide such as HYZAAR\u00ae); neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (e.g., thiorphan and phosphoramidon), aldosterone antagonists, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, renin inhibitors (e.g. urea derivatives of di- and tri-peptides (See U.S. Pat.

Deprotonation of ester 5 using a base such as LiHMDS, NaHMDS, NaH or LDA in a solvent such as THF or DMF followed by treatment with methyl iodide affords the ester 6. The esters 5 and 6 may be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acid by treatment with trimethylsilyl diazomethane or methanol with catalytic sulfuric acid. The esters 5 and 6 may be prepared by the alpha arylation\/heteroarylation of esters as described by Buchwald, S. L. et al 2009, 11(8), 1773; or by Shen, H. C. et al 2006, 8(7), 1447. Compounds 5 and 6, where Ris 5-membered ring heterocycle, may be prepared using methods familiar to those skilled in the art. For example, compound 5, where Ris a 2-methyl-1,3-oxazol-4-yl group, may be prepared by the condensation of methyl chloroacetoacetate and acetamide. Compound 6, where Ris a 3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl group, may be prepared from dimethyl methyl malonate using the procedure described by Du, W. et al 2006, 47(25), 4271.

In another example, compound 6, where Ris a 5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl group, may be prepared by the reaction of methyl 2-methylcyanoacetate with hydroxylamine and acetic anhydride. The compound 7 is prepared by treating compound 6 with a brominating reagent such as NBS and AIBN in a solvent such as carbon tetrachloride at refluxing temperatures. Alternatively, the compound 7 may be prepared by reaction with NBS and magnesium perchlorate in acetonitrile solvent at room temperature as described by Yang, D. et al 2002, 67(21), 7429.

converts GTP to secondary messenger cGMP. Increases in cGMP levels affect several physiological processes including vasorelaxation through multiple downstream pathways. The rate by which sGC catalyzes cGMP formation is greatly increased by NO and by recently discovered NO-independent activators and stimulators. Heme-dependent activators (HDAs) preferentially activate sGC containing a ferrous heme group. To determine the effect of sGC activators on enzyme activity, the CASA assay was developed to monitor the generation of cGMP in a cell line that stably expresses the heterodimeric sGC protein.","Methods","A CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing the sGC a up heterodimer was generated using a standard transfection protocol. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with plasmids pIREShyghsGC\u03b11 and pIRESneo-hsGC\u03b21 simultaneously using FUGENE reagent. Clones that stably express both subunits were selected with hygromycin and neomycin for weeks. Clone #7 was chosen for the assay and was designated CHO-K1\/sGC. CHO-K1\/sGC cells were maintained in F-K12 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 \u03bcg\/mL penicillin\/streptomycin, 0.5 mg\/mL hygromycin and 0.25 mg\/mL G418. On the day of the assay, cells were harvested in EBSS Assay Buffer (EAB) containing 5 mM MgCl, 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyppiperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid) and 0.05% BSA (bovine serum albumin) and cell density was adjusted to 2\u00d710\/mL with EAB. IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin, 0.5 mM) was added to inhibit degradation of cGMP. Compounds were diluted from DMSO stock solutions and added to the assay at a final DMSO concentration of 1%. Cells were incubated with compounds in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM of 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0 C. At the end of the incubation period, the reaction was terminated and the cells were lysed. The level of intracellular cGMP was determined using an HTRF-based assay kit (CisBio, 62GM2PEC), which detects the displacement of a fluorescence labeled cGMP from its specific antibody.

The telemetry unit catheter was inserted into the descending aorta via the femoral artery and the telemetry device was implanted subcutaneously in the left flank area. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 14 days before the start of any studies. Blood pressure, heart rate, and activity signals from conscious, freely moving rats were recorded continuously for 30 seconds every 10 minutes. On the day prior to administration of compound, a single oral dose of vehicle (10% transcutol\/20% Cremophor\/70% water) was administered to all animals to establish baseline control data. The blood pressure lowering efficacy of compound (PO) or vehicle was evaluated following a single oral gavage. Data were collected as hourly averages, and changes in blood pressure were calculated by subtracting control baseline data on an hourly basis. Animals were maintained on normal diet with a 12 hour light-dark cycle.","Maximum peak decreases of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in SHR at a particular P.O. dose (mpk milligrams per kilogram) for the
