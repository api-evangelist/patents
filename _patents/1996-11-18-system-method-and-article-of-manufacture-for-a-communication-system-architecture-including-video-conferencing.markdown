THE COMPOSITION OF THE INTERNET","The Internet is a method of interconnecting physical networks and a set of conventions for using networks that allow the computers they reach to interact. Physically, the Internet is a huge, global network spanning over 92 countries and comprising 59,000 academic, commercial, government, and military networks, according to the Government Accounting Office (GAO), with these numbers expected to double each year. Furthermore, there are about 10 million host computers, 50 million users, and 76,000 World-Wide Web servers connected to the Internet. The backbone of the Internet consists of a series of high-speed communication links between major supercomputer sites and educational and research institutions within the U.S. and throughout the world.","Before progressing further, a common misunderstanding regarding the usage of the term \u201cinternet\u201d should be resolved. Originally, the term was used only as the name of the network based upon the Internet Protocol, but now, internet is a generic term used to refer to an entire class of networks. An \u201cinternet\u201d (lowercase \u201ci\u201d) is any collection of separate physical networks, interconnected by a common protocol, to form a single logical network, whereas the \u201cInternet\u201d (uppercase \u201cI\u201d) is the worldwide collection of interconnected networks that uses Internet Protocol to link the large number of physical networks into a single logical network.","II. PROTOCOL STANDARDS","A. Internet Protocols","Protocols govern the behavior along the Internet backbone and thus set down the key rules for data communication. Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) has an open nature and is available to everyone, meaning that it attempts to create a network protocol system that is independent of computer or network operating system and architectural differences. As such, TCP\/IP protocols are publicly available in standards documents, particularly in Requests for Comments (RFCs). A requirement for Internet connection is TCP\/IP, which consists of a large set of data communications protocols, two of which are the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol. An excellent description of the details associated with TCP\/IP and UDP\/IP is provided in TCP\/IP Illustrated, , Addison-Wesley Publishing Company (1996).","B. International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (\u201cITU-T\u201d) Standards","The International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (\u201cITU-T\u201d) has established numerous standards governing protocols and line encoding for telecommunication devices. Because many of these standards are referenced throughout this document, summaries of the relevant standards are listed below for reference.\n\n","The popularity of the TCP\/IP protocols on the Internet grew rapidly because they met an important need for worldwide data communication and had several important characteristics that allowed them to meet this need. These characteristics, still in use today, include:","A common addressing scheme that allows any device running TCP\/IP to uniquely address any other device on the Internet. Open protocol standards, freely available and developed independently of any hardware or operating system. Thus, TCP\/IP is capable of being used with different hardware and software, even if Internet communication is not required.","Independence from any specific physical network hardware, allows TCP\/IP to integrate many different kinds of networks. TCP\/IP can be used over an Ethernet, a token ring, a dial-up line, or virtually any other kinds of physical transmission media.","IV. INFORMATION TRANSPORT IN COMMUNICATION NETWORKS","A. Switching Techniques","An understanding of how information travels in communication systems is required to appreciate the recent steps taken by key players in today's Internet backbone business. The traditional type of communication network is circuit switched. The U.S. telephone system uses such circuit switching techniques. When a person or a computer makes a telephone call, the switching equipment within the telephone system seeks out a physical path from the originating telephone to the receiver's telephone. A circuit-switched network attempts to form a dedicated connection, or circuit, between these two points by first establishing a circuit from the originating phone through the local switching office, then across trunk lines, to a remote switching office, and finally to the destination telephone. This dedicated connection exists until the call terminates.","The establishment of a completed path is a prerequisite to the transmission of data for circuit switched networks. After the circuit is in place, the microphone captures analog signals, and the signals are transmitted to the Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) Central Office (CO) in analog form over an analog loop. The analog signal is not converted to digital form until it reaches the LEC Co, and even then only if the equipment is modern enough to support digital information. In an ISDN embodiment, however, the analog signals are converted to digital at the device and transmitted to the LEC as digital information.","Upon connection, the circuit guarantees that the samples can be delivered and reproduced by maintaining a data path of 64 Kbps (thousand bits per second). This rate is not the rate required to send digitized voice per se. Rather, 64 Kbps is the rate required to send voice digitized with the Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) technique. Many other methods for digitizing voice exist, including ADPCM (32 Kbps), GSM (13 Kbps), TrueSpeech 8.5 (8.5 Kbps), G.723 (6.4 Kbps or 5.3 Kbps) and Voxware RT29HQ (2.9 Kbps). Furthermore, the 64 Kbps path is maintained from LEC Central Office (CO) Switch to LEC CO, but not from end to end. The analog local loop transmits an analog signal, not 64 Kbps digitized audio. One of these analog local loops typically exists as the \u201clast mile\u201d of each of the telephone network circuits to attach the local telephone of the calling party.","This guarantee of capacity is the strength of circuit-switched networks. However, circuit switching has two significant drawbacks. First, the setup time can be considerable, because the call signal request may find the lines busy with other calls; in this event, there is no way to gain connection until some other connection terminates. Second, utilization can be low while costs are high. In other words, the calling party is charged for the duration of the call and for all of the time even if no data transmission takes place (i.e. no one speaks). Utilization can be low because the time between transmission of signals is unable to be used by any other calls, due to the dedication of the line. Any such unused bandwidth during the connection is wasted.","Additionally, the entire circuit switching infrastructure is built around 64 Kbps circuits. The infrastructure assumes the use of PCM encoding techniques for voice. However, very high quality codecs are available that can encode voice using less than one-tenth of the bandwidth of PCM. However, the circuit switched network blindly allocates 64 Kbps of bandwidth for a call, end-to-end, even if only one-tenth of the bandwidth is utilized. Furthermore, each circuit generally only connects two parties. Without the assistance of conference bridging equipment, an entire circuit to a phone is occupied in connecting one party to another party. Circuit switching has no multicast or multipoint communication capabilities, except when used in combination with conference bridging equipment.","Other reasons for long call setup time include the different signaling networks involved in call setup and the sheer distance causing propagation delay. Analog signaling from an end station to a CO on a low bandwidth link can also delay call setup. Also, the call setup data travels great distances on signaling networks that are not always transmitting data at the speed of light. When the calls are international, the variations in signaling networks grows, the equipment handling call setup is usually not as fast as modem setup and the distances are even greater, so call setup slows down even more. Further, in general, connection-oriented virtual or physical circuit setup, such as circuit switching, requires more time at connection setup time than comparable connectionless techniques due to the end-to-end handshaking required between the conversing parties.","Message switching is another switching strategy that has been considered. With this form of switching, no physical path is established in advance between the sender and receiver; instead, whenever the sender has a block of data to be sent, it is stored at the first switching office and retransmitted to the next switching point after error inspection. Message switching places no limit on block size, thus requiring that switching stations must have disks to buffer long blocks of data; also, a single block may tie up a line for many minutes, rendering message switching useless for interactive traffic.","Packet switched networks, which predominate the computer network industry, divide data into small pieces called packets that are multiplexed onto high capacity intermachine connections. A packet is a block of data with a strict upper limit on block size that carries with it sufficient identification necessary for delivery to its destination. Such packets usually contain several hundred bytes of data and occupy a given transmission line for only a few tens of milliseconds. Delivery of a larger file via packet switching requires that it be broken into many small packets and sent one at a time from one machine to the other. The network hardware delivers these packets to the specified destination, where the software reassembles them into a single file.","Packet switching is used by virtually all computer interconnections because of its efficiency in data transmissions. Packet switched networks use bandwidth on a circuit as needed, allowing other transmissions to pass through the lines in the interim. Furthermore, throughput is increased by the fact that a router or switching office can quickly forward to the next stop any given packet, or portion of a large file, that it receives, long before the other packets of the file have arrived. In message switching, the intermediate router would have to wait until the entire block was delivered before forwarding. Today, message switching is no longer used in computer networks because of the superiority of packet switching.","To better understand the Internet, a comparison to the telephone system is helpful. The public switched telephone network was designed with the goal of transmitting human voice, in a more or less recognizable form. Their suitability has been improved for computer-to-computer communications but remains far from optimal. A cable running between two computers can transfer data at speeds in the hundreds of megabits, and even gigabits per second. A poor error rate at these speeds would be only one error per day. In contrast, a dial-up line, using standard telephone lines, has a maximum data rate in the thousands of bits per second, and a much higher error rate. In fact, the combined bit rate times error rate performance of a local cable could be 11 orders of magnitude better than a voice-grade telephone line. New technology, however, has been improving the performance of these lines.","B. Gateways and Routers","The Internet is composed of a great number of individual networks, together forming a global connection of thousands of computer systems. After understanding that machines are connected to the individual networks, we can investigate how the networks are connected together to form an internetwork, or an internet. At this point, internet gateways and internet routers come into play.","In terms of architecture, two given networks are connected by a computer that attaches to both of them. Internet gateways and routers provide those links necessary to send packets between networks and thus make connections possible. Without these links, data communication through the Internet would not be possible, as the information either would not reach its destination or would be incomprehensible upon arrival. A gateway may be thought of as an entrance to a communications network that performs code and protocol conversion between two otherwise incompatible networks. For instance, gateways transfer electronic mail and data files between networks over the internet.","IP Routers are also computers that connect networks and is a newer term preferred by vendors. These routers must make decisions as to how to send the data packets it receives to its destination through the use of continually updated routing tables. By analyzing the destination network address of the packets, routers make these decisions. Importantly, a router does not generally need to decide which host or end user will receive a packet; instead, a router seeks only the destination network and thus keeps track of information sufficient to get to the appropriate network, not necessarily the appropriate end user. Therefore, routers do not need to be huge supercomputing systems and are often just machines with small main memories and little disk storage. The distinction between gateways and routers is slight, and current usage blurs the line to the extent that the two terms are often used interchangeably. In current terminology, a gateway moves data between different protocols and a router moves data between different networks. So a system that moves mail between TCP\/IP and OSI is a gateway, but a traditional IP gateway (that connects different networks) is a router.","Now, it is useful to take a simplified look at routing in traditional telephone systems. The telephone system is organized as a highly redundant, multilevel hierarchy. Each telephone has two copper wires coming out of it that go directly to the telephone company's nearest end office, also called a local central office. The distance is typically less than 10 km; in the U.S. alone, there are approximately 20,000 end offices. The concatenation of the area code and the first three digits of the telephone number uniquely specify an end office and help dictate the rate and billing structure.","The two-wire connections between each subscriber's telephone and the end office are called local loops. If a subscriber attached to a given end office calls another subscriber attached to the same end office, the switching mechanism within the office sets up a direct electrical connection between the two local loops. This connection remains intact for the duration of the call, due to the circuit switching techniques discussed earlier.","If the subscriber attached to a given end office calls a user attached to a different end office, more work has to be done in the routing of the call. First, each end office has a number of outgoing lines to one or more nearby switching centers, called toll offices. These lines are called toll connecting trunks. If both the caller's and the receiver's end offices happen to have a toll connecting trunk to the same toll office, the connection may be established within the toll office. If the caller and the recipient of the call do not share a toll office, then the path will have to be established somewhere higher up in the hierarchy. There are sectional and regional offices that form a network by which the toll offices are connected. The toll, sectional, and regional exchanges communicate with each other via high bandwidth inter-toll trunks. The number of different kinds of switching centers and their specific topology varies from country to country, depending on its telephone density.","C. Using Network Level Communication for Smooth User Connection","In addition to the data transfer functionality of the Internet, TCP\/IP also seeks to convince users that the Internet is a solitary, virtual network. TCP\/IP accomplishes this by providing a universal interconnection among machines, independent of the specific networks to which hosts and end users attach. Besides router interconnection of physical networks, software is required on each host to allow application programs to use the Internet as if it were a single, real physical network.","D. Datagrams and Routing","The basis of Internet service is an underlying, connectionless packet delivery system run by routers, with the basic unit of transfer being the packet. In internets running TCP\/IP, such as the Internet backbone, these packets are called datagrams. This section will briefly discuss how these datagrams are routed through the Internet.","In packet switching systems, routing is the process of choosing a path over which to send packets. As mentioned before, routers are the computers that make such choices. For the routing of information from one host within a network to another host on the same network, the datagrams that are sent do not actually reach the Internet backbone. This is an example of internal routing, which is completely self-contained within the network. The machines outside of the network do not participate in these internal routing decisions.","At this stage, a distinction should be made between direct delivery and indirect delivery. Direct delivery is the transmission of a datagram from one machine across a single physical network to another machine on the same physical network. Such deliveries do not involve routers. Instead, the sender encapsulates the datagram in a physical frame, addresses it, and then sends the frame directly to the destination machine.","Indirect delivery is necessary when more than one physical network is involved, in particular when a machine on one network wishes to communicate with a machine on another network. This type of communication is what we think of when we speak of routing information across the Internet backbone. In indirect delivery, routers are required. To send a datagram, the sender must identify a router to which the datagram can be sent, and the router then forwards the datagram towards the destination network. Recall that routers generally do not keep track of the individual host addresses (of which there are millions), but rather just keeps track of physical networks (of which there are thousands). Essentially, routers in the Internet form a cooperative, interconnected structure, and datagrams pass from router to router across the backbone until they reach a router that can deliver the datagram directly.","V. TECHNOLOGY INTRODUCTION","The changing face of the internet world causes a steady inflow of new systems and technology. The following three developments, each likely to become more prevalent in the near future, serve as an introduction to the technological arena:","A. ATM","Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a networking technology using a high-speed, connection-oriented system for both local area and wide area networks. ATM networks require modern hardware including:\n\n","ATM incorporates features of both packet switching and circuit switching, as it is designed to carry voice, video, and television signals in addition to data. Pure packet switching technology is not conducive to carrying voice transmissions because such transfers demand more stable bandwidth.","B. Frame Relay","Frame relay systems use packet switching techniques, but are more efficient than traditional systems. This efficiency is partly due to the fact that they perform less error checking than traditional X.25 packet-switching services. In fact, many intermediate nodes do little or no error checking at all and only deal with routing, leaving the error checking to the higher layers of the system. With the greater reliability of today's transmissions, much of the error checking previously performed has become unnecessary. Thus, frame relay offers increased performance compared to traditional systems.","C. ISDN","An Integrated Services Digital Network is an \u201cinternational telecommunications standard for transmitting voice, video, and data over digital lines,\u201d most commonly running at 64 kilobits per second. The traditional phone network runs voice at only 4 kilobits per second. To adopt ISDN, an end user or company must upgrade to ISDN terminal equipment, central office hardware, and central office software. The ostensible goals of ISDN include the following:\n\n","The MCI Intelligent Network is a call processing architecture for processing voice, fax and related services. The Intelligent Network comprises a special purpose bridging switch with special capabilities and a set of general purpose computers along with an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD). The call processing including number translation services, automatic or manual operator services, validation services and database services are carried out on a set of dedicated general purpose computers with specialized software. New value added services can be easily integrated into the system by enhancing the software in a simple and cost-effective manner.","Before proceeding further, it will be helpful to establish some terms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0485"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ISP","Intelligent Services Platform"]},{"entry":[{},"NCS","Network Control System"]},{"entry":[{},"DAP","Data Access Point"]},{"entry":[{},"ACD","Automatic Call Distributor"]},{"entry":[{},"ISN","Intelligent Services Network (Intelligent"]},{"entry":[{},"Network)"]},{"entry":[{},"ISNAP","Intelligent Services Network Adjunct"]},{"entry":[{},"Processor"]},{"entry":[{},"MTOC","Manual Telecommunications Operator"]},{"entry":[{},"Console"]},{"entry":[{},"ARU","Audio Response Unit"]},{"entry":[{},"ACP","Automatic Call Processor"]},{"entry":[{},"NAS","Network Audio Server"]},{"entry":[{},"EVS","Enhanced Voice Services"]},{"entry":[{},"POTS","Plain Old Telephone System"]},{"entry":[{},"ATM","Asynchronous Transfer Mode"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The Intelligent Network Architecture has a rich set of features and is very flexible.

MCI Switching Network","The MCI switching network is comprised of special purpose bridging switches . These bridging switches  route and connect the calling and the called parties after the call is validated by the intelligent services network . The bridging switches have limited programming capabilities and provide the basic switching services under the control of the Intelligent Services Network (ISN) .","2. Network Control System\/Data Access Point (NCS\/DAP)","The NCS\/DAP  is an integral component of the MCI Intelligent Network. The DAP offers a variety of database services like number translation and also provides services for identifying the switch ID and trunk ID of the terminating number for a call.","The different services offered by NCS\/DAP  include:\n\n","3. Intelligent Services Network (ISN) ","The ISN  includes an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) for routing the calls. The ACD communicates with the Intelligent Switch Network Adjunct Processor (ISNAP)  and delivers calls to the different manual or automated agents. The ISN includes the ISNAP and the Operator Network Center (ONC). ISNAP  is responsible for Group Select and Operator Selection for call routing. The ISNAP communicates with the ACD for call delivery to the different agents. The ISNAP is also responsible for coordinating data and voice for operator-assisted calls. The ONC is comprised of Servers, Databases and Agents including Live Operators or Audio Response Units (ARU) including Automated Call Processors (ACPs) , MTOCs  and associated NAS . These systems communicate with each other on an Ethernet LAN and provide a variety of services for call processing.","The different services offered by the ONC include:\n\n","4. Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) ","Enhanced Voice Services offer menu-based routing services in addition to a number of value-added features. The EVS system prompts the user for an input and routes calls based on customer input or offers specialized services for voice mail and fax routing.

Additional Components","In addition to the above mentioned components, a set of additional components are also architected into the MCI Intelligent Network. These components are:\n\n","B. Intelligent Network System Overview","The MCI Call Processing architecture is built upon a number of key components including the MCI Switch Network, the Network Control System, the Enhanced Voice Services system and the Intelligent Services Network. Call processing is entirely carried out on a set of general purpose computers and some specialized processors thereby forming the basis for the MCI Intelligent Network. The switch is a special purpose bridging switch with limited programming capabilities and complex interface. Addition of new services on the switch is very difficult and sometimes not possible. A call on the MCI Switch is initially verified if it needs a number translation as in the case of an  number. If a number translation is required, it is either done at the switch itself based on an internal table or the request is sent to the DAP which is a general purpose computer with software capable of number translation and also determining the trunk ID and switch ID of the terminating number.","The call can be routed to an ACD which delivers calls to the various call processing agents like a live operator or an ARU. The ACD communicates with the ISNAP which does a group select to determine which group of agents are responsible for this call and also which of the agents are free to process this call.","The agents process the calls received by communicating with the NIDS (Network Information Distributed Services) Server which are the Validation or the Database Servers with the requisite databases for the various services offered by ISN. Once the call is validated by processing of the call on the server, the agent communicates the status back to the ACD . The ACD in turn dials the terminating number and bridges the incoming call with the terminating number and executes a Release Link Trunk (RLT) for releasing the call all the way back to the switch. The agent also generates a Billing Detail Record (BDR) for billing information. When the call is completed, the switch generates an Operation Services Record (OSR) which is later matched with the corresponding BDR to create total billing information. The addition of new value added services is very simple and new features can be added by additional software and configuration of the different computing systems in the ISP. A typical call flow scenario is explained below.","C. Call Flow Example","The Call Flow example illustrates the processing of an 800 Number Collect Call from phone  in  to phone . The call is commenced when a calling party dials 1-800-COLLECT to make a collect call to phone  the Called Party. The call is routed by the Calling Party's Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), which is aware that this number is owned by MCI, to a nearest MCI Switch Facility and lands on an MCI switch .","The switch  detects that it is an 800 Number service and performs an 800 Number Translation from a reference table in the switch or requests the Data Access Point (DAP)  to provide number translation services utilizing a database lookup.","The call processing is now delegated to a set of intelligent computing systems through an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) . In this example, since it is a collect call, the calling party has to reach a Manual or an Automated Operator before the call can be processed further. The call from the switch is transferred to an ACD which is operational along with an Intelligent Services Network Adjunct Processor (ISNAP) . The ISNAP  determines which group of Agents are capable of processing the call based on the type of the call. This operation is referred to as Group Select. The agents capable of call processing include Manual Telecommunications Operator Console (MTOC)s  or Automated Call Processors (ACP)s  with associated Network Audio Servers (NAS)s . The ISNAP  determines which of the Agents is free to handle the call and routes the voice call to a specific Agent.","The Agents are built with sophisticated call processing software. The Agent gathers all the relevant information from the Calling Party including the telephone number of the Called Party. The Agent then communicates with the database servers with a set of database lookup requests. The database lookup requests include queries on the type of the call, call validation based on the telephone numbers of both the calling and the called parties and also call restrictions, if any, including call blocking restrictions based on the called or calling party's telephone number. The Agent then signals the ISNAP-ACD combination to put the Calling Party on hold and dial the called party and to be connected to the Called Party. The Agent informs the called party about the Calling Party and the request for a Collect Call. The Agent gathers the response from the Called Party and further processes the call.","If the Called Party has agreed to receive the call, the Agent then signals the ISNAP-ACD combination to bridge the Called Party and the Calling Party.","The Agent then cuts a BDR which is used to match with a respective OSR generated by the switch to create complete billing information.","The ISNAP-ACD combination then bridges the Called Party and the Calling Party and then releases the line back to the switch by executing a Release Trunk (RLT). The Calling Party and the Called Party can now have a conversation through the switch. At the termination of the call by either party, the switch generates a OSR which will be matched with the BDR generated earlier to create complete billing information for the call. If the Called Party declines to accept the collect call, the Agent signals the ACD-ISNAP combination to reconnect the Calling Party which was on hold back to the Agent. Finally, the Agent informs the Calling Party about the Called Party's response and terminates the call in addition to generating a BDR.","MCI Intelligent Network is a scaleable and efficient network architecture for call processing and is based on a set of intelligent processors with specialized software, special purpose bridging switches and ACD's. The Intelligent Network is an overlay network coexisting with the MCI Switching Network and is comprised of a large number of specialized processors interacting with the switch network for call processing. One embodiment of Intelligent Network is completely audio-centric. Data and fax are processed as voice calls with some specialized, dedicated features and value-added services.","In another embodiment, the Intelligent Network is adapted for newly emerging technologies, including POTS-based video-phones and internet telephony for voice and video. The following sections describe in detail the architecture, features and services based on the emerging technologies.","The following sections describe in detail the architecture, features and services based on several emerging technologies, all of which can be integrated into the Intelligent Network.","VII. ISP FRAMEWORK","A. Background","The ISP is composed of several disparate systems. As ISP integration proceeds, formerly independent systems now become part of one larger whole with concomitant increases in the level of analysis, testing, scheduling, and training in all disciplines of the ISP.","1. Broadband Access","A range of high bandwidth services are supported by a preferred embodiment. These include: Video on Demand, Conferencing, Distance Learning, and Telemedicine.","ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) pushes network control to the periphery of the network, obviating the trunk and switching models of traditional, circuit-based telephony. It is expected to be deployed widely to accommodate these high bandwidth services.","2. Internet Telephony System","The Internet and with it, the World Wide Web, offers easy customer access, widespread commercial opportunities, and fosters a new role for successful telecommunications companies.

Some current examples are ISA, EISA, VME, SCbus, MVIP bus, Memory Channel, and TDM buses.

Scope of Effort","The ISP Service Model supports all activities associated with Services, including the following aspects:\n\n","This model covers both marketable services and management services.\n\n","The Service Model also defines interactions with other parts of the ISP Architecture, including Data Management, Resource Management, and Operational Support.","3. Service Model Overview","Central to the Intelligent Services Platform is the delivery of Services  (FIG. ). Services are the most critical aspect in a telecommunication service provider's ability to make money. The following definition of services is used throughout this service model: A service  is a set of capabilities combined with well-defined logic structures and business processes which, when accessed through a published interface, results in a desired and expected outcome on behalf of the user.","One of the major differences between a Service  and an Application  or  () is that a Service  includes the business processes that support the sale, operation, and maintenance of the Service. The critical task in developing a Service is defining what can be automated, and clearly delineating how humans interact with the Service.","4. Service Structure","The vocabulary we will use for describing services includes the services themselves, service features, and capabilities. These are structured in a three-tier hierarchy as shown in FIG. .","A service  is an object in a sense of an object-oriented object as described earlier in the specification. An instance of a service  contains other objects, called service features . A service feature  provides a well defined interface which abstracts the controlled interaction of one or more capabilities  in the ISP Service Framework, on behalf of a service.","Service features , in turn, use various capability  objects. Capabilities  are standard, reusable, network-wide building blocks used to create service features . The key requirement in Service Creation is for the engineers who are producing basic capability objects to insure each can be reused in many different services as needed.","a) Services ","Services  are described by \u201cservice logic,\u201d which is basically a program written in a very high-level programming language or described using a graphical user interface. These service logic programs identify:\n\n","The service logic itself is generally not enough to execute a service  in the network. Usually, customer data is needed to define values for the points of flexibility defined in a service, or to customize the service for the customer's particular needs. Both Management and Marketable Services are part of the same service model. The similarities between of Management and Marketable Services allow capabilities to be shared. Also, Management and Marketable Services represent two viewpoints of the same network: Management Services represent and operational view of the network, and Marketable Services represent an external end-user or customer view of the network. Both kinds of services rely on network data which is held in common.","Every Marketable Service has a means for a customer to order the service, a billing mechanism, some operational support capabilities, and service monitoring capabilities. The Management Services provide processes and supporting capabilities for the maintenance of the platform.","b) Service Features ","Service features  provide a well-defined interface of function calls. Service features can be reused in many different services , just as capabilities  are reused in many different service features . Service features have specific data input requirements, which are derived from the data input requirements of the underlying capabilities. Data output behavior of a service feature is defined by the creator of the service feature, based upon the data available from the underlying capabilities. Service Features  do not rely on the existence of any physical resource, rather, they call on capabilities  for these functions, as shown in FIG. .","Some examples of service features are:\n\n","c) Capabilities ","A capability  is an object, which means that a capability has internal, private state data, and a well-defined interface for creating, deleting, and using instances of the capability. Invoking a capability  is done by invoking one of its interface operations. Capabilities  are built for reuse. As such, capabilities have clearly defined data requirements for input and output structures. Also, capabilities have clearly defined error handling routines. Capabilities may be defined in object-oriented class hierarchies whereby a general capability may be inherited by several others.","Some examples of network-based capability objects are:\n\n","Some capabilities are not network-based, but are based purely on data that has been deployed into our platform. Some examples of these capabilities are:\n\n","d) Service Data","There are three sources for data while a service executes:\n\n","5. Service  Execution","Services  execute in Service Logic Execution Environments (SLEEs). A SLEE is executable software which allows any of the services deployed into the ISP  to be executed. In the ISP Architecture, Service Engines  () provide these execution environments. Service Engines  simply execute the services  that are deployed to them.","Service templates and their supporting profiles are deployed onto database servers  (FIG. ). When a SLEE is started on a Service Engine , it retrieves its configuration from the database server . The configuration instructs the SLEE to execute a list of services . The software for these services is part of the service templates deployed on the database servers. If the software is not already on the Service Engine , the software is retrieved from the database server . The software is executed, and service  begins to run.","In most cases a service  will first invoke a service feature  () which allows the service to register itself with a resource manager  or . Once registered, the service can begin accepting transactions. Next, a service  will invoke a service feature  which waits on an initiating action. This action can be anything from an internet logon, to an  call, to a point of sale card validation data transaction. Once the initiating action occurs in the network, the service select function  () uses the Resource Manager  function to find an instance of the executing service  to invoke. The initiating action is delivered to the service  instance, and the service logic (from the service template) determines subsequent actions by invoking additional service features .","During service  execution, profile data is used to determine the behavior of service features . Depending on service performance requirements, some or all of the profile data needed by a service may be cached on a service engine  from the ISP  database server  to prevent expensive remote database lookups. As the service executes, information may generated by service features  and deposited into the Context Database. This information is uniquely identified by a network transaction identifier. In the case of a circuit-switched call, the already-defined Network Call Identifier will be used as the transaction identifier. Additional information may be generated by network equipment and deposited into the Context Database as well, also indexed by the same unique transaction identifier. The final network element involved with the transaction deposits some end-of-transaction information into the Context Database. A linked list strategy is used for determining when all information has been deposited into the Context Database for a particular transaction. Once all information has arrived, an event is generated to any service which has subscribed to this kind of event, and services may then operate on the data in the Context Database. Such operations may include extracting the data from the Context Database and delivering it to billing systems or fraud analysis systems.","6. Service Interactions","In the course of a network transaction, more than one service can be invoked by the network. Sometimes, the instructions of one service may conflict with the instructions of another service. Here's an example of such a conflict: a VNET caller has a service which does not allow the caller to place international calls. The VNET caller dials the number of another VNET user who has a service which allows international dialing, and the called VNET user places an international call, then bridges the first caller with the international call. The original user was able to place an international call through a third party, in defiance of his company's intention to prevent the user from dialing internationally. In such circumstances, it may be necessary to allow the two services to interact with each other to determine if operation of bridging an international call should be allowed.","The ISP service model must enable services  to interact with other services. There are several ways in which a service  must be able to interact with other services (see FIG. ):\n\n","In the example of interacting VNET services above, the terminating VNET service could have queried the originating VNET service using the synchronous service interaction capability. The interesting twist to this idea is that service logic can be deployed onto both network-based platforms and onto customer premises equipment. This means that service interaction must take place between network-based services and customer-based services.","7. Service Monitoring","Services  must be monitored from both the customer's viewpoint and the network viewpoint. Monitoring follows one of two forms:\n\n","The Context Database collects all event information regarding a network transaction. This information will constitute all information necessary for network troubleshooting, billing, or network monitoring.","I. ISP Data Management Model","This section describes the Data Management  aspects of the Intelligent Services Platform (ISP)  Target Architecture.","1.

Logical Description","The behavior of each Architecture component is described separately below:","a) Data Applications (dbAppl) ","This includes any ISP applications which require database access. Examples are the ISN NIDS servers, and the DAP Transaction Servers, The applications obtain their required data from the dbClient  by attaching to the desired databases, and providing any required policy instructions. These applications also provide the database access on behalf of the external systems or network element such as Order Entry or Switch requested translations. Data applications support the following functionality:\n\n","b) Data Management ","(1) Client Databases (dbclient) ","The dbClients represent satellite copies of data. This is the only way for an application to access ISP data. Satellite copies of data need not match the format of data as stored on the dbServer .","The dbClients register with master databases (dbServer)  for Subscriptions or Cache Copies of data. Subscriptions are automatically maintained by dbServer , but Cache Copies must be refreshed when the version is out of date.","A critical aspect of dbClient  is to ensure that data updates by applications are serialized and synchronized with the master copies held by dbServer . However, it is just as reasonable for the dbClient to accept the update and only later synchronize the changes with the dbServer (at which time exception notifications could be conveyed back to the originating application). The choice to update in lock-step, or not, is a matter of application policy not Data Management .","Only changes made to the dbServer master copies are forwarded to other dbClients.","If a dbClient  becomes inactive or loses communications with the dbServer; it must resynchronize with the master. In severe cases, operator intervention may be required to reload an entire database or selected subsets.","The dbClient  offers the following interface operations:\n\n","(2) Data Masters (dbServer) ","The dbServers  play a central role in the protection of data. This is where data is \u2018owned\u2019 and master copies maintained. At least two copies of master data are maintained for reliability. Additional master copies may be deployed to improve data performance.","These copies are synchronized in lock-step. That is each update is required to obtain a corresponding master-lock in order to prevent update conflicts. The strict implementation policies may vary, but in general, all master copies must preserve serial ordering of updates, and provide the same view of data and same integrity enforcement as any other master copy. The internal copies of data are transparent to the dbClients .","The dbServer  includes the layers of business rules which describe or enforce the relationships between data items and which constrain particular data values or formats. Every data update must pass these rules or is rejected. In this way dbServer ensures all data is managed as a single copy and all business rules are collected and applied uniformly.","The dbServer  tracks when, and what kind of, data changes are made, and provides logs and summary statistics to the monitor (dbMon) . Additionally these changes are forwarded to any active subscriptions and Cache-copies are marked out of date via expiration messages.","The dbServer also provides security checks and authorizations, and ensures that selected items are encrypted before storage. The dbServer supports the following interface operations:\n\n","(3) Data Administration (dbAdmin) ","Data Administration (dbAdmin)  involves setting data policy, managing the logical and physical aspect of the databases, and securing and configuring the functional components of the Data Management  domain. Data Management policies include security, distribution, integrity rules, performance requirements, and control of replications and partitions. dbAdmin  includes the physical control of data resources such as establishing data locations, allocating physical storage, allocating memory, loading data stores, optimizing access paths, and fixing database problems. dbAdmin  also provides for logical control of data such as auditing, reconciling, migrating, cataloguing, and converting data.","The dbAdmin  supports the following interface operations:\n\n","(4) Data Monitoring (dbMon) ","The dbMon  represents a monitoring function which captures all data-related events and statistical measurements from the ISP boundary gateways, dbClients  and dbServers . The dbMon  mechanisms are used to create audit trails and logs.","The dbMon typically presents a passive interface; data is fed to it. However monitoring is a hierarchical activity and further analysis and roll-up (compilation of data collected at intervals, such as every minute, into longer time segments, such as hours or days) occurs within dbMon. Additionally dbMon will send alerts when certain thresholds or conditions are met.","The rate and count of various metrics are used for evaluating quality of Service (QOS), data performance, and other service level agreements. All exceptions and date errors are logged and flow to the dbMon for inspection, storage, and roll-up.","dbMon  supports the following interface operations:\n\n","(5) Data Management operations (Ops) ","The Operations consoles (Ops)  provide the workstation-interface for the personnel monitoring, administering, and otherwise managing the system.

Data encryption is required for all stored passwords, PINS (personal identification numbers), private personnel records, and selected financial, business, and customer information. Secured data must not be transmitted in clear-text forms.","9. Meta-Data","Meta-data is a form of data which comprises the rules for data driven logic. Meta-data is used to describe and manage (i.e. manipulate) operational forms of data. Under this architecture, as much control as possible is intended to be driven by meta-data. Meta-data (or data-driven logic) generally provides the most flexible run-time options. Meta-data is typically under the control of the system administrators.","10. Standard Database Technologies","Implementation of the proposed Data Management Architecture should take advantage of commercially available products whenever possible. Vendors offer database technology, replication services, Rules systems, Monitoring facilities, Console environments, and many other attractive offerings.","ISP Resource Management Model","This section describes the Resource Management  Model as it relates to the ISP  Architecture.","a) Scope","The Resource Management Model covers the cycle of resource allocation and de-allocation in terms of the relationships between a process that needs a resource, and the resource itself. This cycle starts with Resource Registration and De-registration and continues to Resource Requisition, Resource Acquisition, Resource Interaction and Resource Release.","b) Purpose","The Resource Management  Model is meant to define common architectural guidelines for the ISP development community in general, and for the ISP Architecture in particular.","c) Objectives","In the existing traditional ISP architecture, services control and manage their own physical and logical resources. Migration to an architecture that abstracts resources from services requires defining a management functionality that governs the relationships and interactions between resources and services. This functionality is represented by the Resource Management  Model. The objectives of the Resource Management Model are designed to allow for network-wide resource management and to optimize resource utilization, to enable resource sharing across the network:\n\n","d) Background Concepts","Generally, the Resource Management  Model governs the relationships and interactions between the resources and the processes that utilize them. Before the model is presented, a solid understanding of the basic terminology and concepts used to explain the model should be established. The following list presents these terms and concepts:","(1) Definitions","Resource: A basic unit of work that provides a specific and well-defined capability when invoked by an external process. Resources can be classified as logical, like a service engine and a speech recognition algorithm, or physical, like CPU, Memory and Switch ports. A resource may be Shared like an ATM link bandwidth or Disk space, or Dedicated like a VRU or a Switch port.","Resource Pool: A set of registered resource members that share common capabilities.","Service: A logical description of all activities and the interaction flow between the user of the network resources and the resources themselves.","Policy: A set of rules that governs the actions taken on resource allocation and de-allocation, resource pool size thresholds and resource utilization thresholds.","(2) Concepts","The Resource Management Model is a mechanism which governs and allows a set of functions to request, acquire and release resources to\/from a resource pool through well-defined procedures and policies. The resource allocation and deallocation process involves three phases:","Resource Requisition is the phase in which a process requests a resource from the Resource Manager .","Resource Acquisition: If the requested resource is available and the requesting process has the privilege to request it, the Resource Manager  will grant the resource and the process can utilize it. Otherwise, the process has the choice to either abandon the resource allocation process and may try again later, or it may request that the Resource Manager  grant it the resource whenever it becomes available or within a specified period.","Resource Release: The allocated resource should be put back into the resource pool once the process no longer needs it. Based on the resource type, the process either releases the resource and the resource informs the Resource Manager of its new status, or the process itself informs the Resource Manager that the resource is available. In either case, the Resource Manager will restore the resource to the resource pool.","The Resource Management Model allows for the creation of resource pools and the specification of the policies governing them. The Resource Management Model allows resources to register and de-register as legitimate members of resource pools.","Resource Management Model policies enforce load balancing, failover and least cost algorithms and prevent services from monopolizing resources. The Resource Management Model tracks resource utilization and automatically takes corrective action when resource pools are not sufficient to meet demand. Any service should be able to access and utilize any available resource across the network as long as it has the privilege to do so.","The Resource Management Model adopted the OSI Object Oriented approach for modeling resources. Under this model, each resource is represented by a Managed Object (MO). Each MO is defined in terms of the following aspects:","Attributes: The attributes of a MO represent its properties and are used to describe its characteristics and current states. Each attribute is a associated with a value, for example the value CURRENT_STATE attribute of a MO could be IDLE.","Operations: Each MO has a set of operations that are allowed to be performed on it. These operations are:","Create: to create a new MO","Delete: to delete an existing MO","Action: to perform a specific operation such as SHUTDOWN.","Get Value: to obtain a specific MO attribute value","Add Value: to add specific MO attribute value","Remove Value: to delete a specific MO attribute value from a set of values.","Replace Value: to replace an existing MO attribute value(s) with a new one.","Set Value: to set a specific MO attribute to its default value.","Notification: Each MO can report or notify its status to the management entity. This could be viewed as triggers or traps.","Behavior: The behavior of an MO is represented by how it reacts to a specific operation and the constraints imposed on this reaction. The MO may react to either external stimuli or internal stimuli. An external stimuli is represented by a message that carries an operation. The internal stimuli, however, is an internal event that occurred to the MO like the expiration of a timer. A constraint on how the MO should react to the expired timer may be imposed by specifying how many times the timers has to expire before the MO can report it.","All elements that need to utilize, manipulate or monitor a resource need to treat it as a MO and need to access it through the operations defined above. Concerned elements that need to know the status of a resource need to know how to receive and react to events generated by that resource.","Global and Local Resource Management:","The Resource Management Model is hierarchical with at least two levels of management: Local Resource Manager (LRM)  and Global Resource Manager (GRM) . Each RM, Local and Global, has its own domain and functionality.","2. The Local Resource Manager (LRM):","Domain: The domain of the LRM is restricted to a specific resource pool (RP) that belongs to a specific locale of the network. Multiple LRMs could exist in a single locale, each LRM may be responsible for managing a specific resource pool.","Function: The main functionality of the LRM is to facilitate the resource allocation and de-allocation process between a process and a resource according the Resource Management Model guidelines.","3. The Global Resource Manager (GRM) :","Domain: The domain of the GRM  covers all registered resources in all resource pools across the network.","Function: The main function of the GRM is to help the LRM  locate a resource that is not available in the LRM domain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0404","num":"1096"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":["2188","2190","2270"]},"4. The Resource Management Model (RMM)","The Resource Management Model is based on the concept of Dynamic Resource Allocation as opposed to Static Configuration. The Dynamic Resource Allocation concept implies that there is no pre-defined static relationship between resources and the processes utilizing them. The allocation and de-allocation process is based on supply and demand. The Resource Managers  will be aware of the existence of the resources and the processes needing resources can acquire them through the Resource Managers . On the other hand, Static Configuration implies a pre-defined relationship between each resource and the process that needs it. In such a case, there is no need for a management entity to manage these resources. The process dealing with the resources can achieve that directly. Dynamic Resource Allocation and Static Configuration represent the two extremes of the resource management paradigms. Paradigms that fall between these extremes may exist.","The Resource Management Model describes the behavior of the LRM  and GRM  and the logical relationships and interactions between them. It also describes the rules and policies that govern the resource allocation and de-allocation process between the LRM\/GRM and the processes needing the resources.","a) Simple Resource Management Model","Realizing that resource allocation and de-allocation could involve a complex process, a simple form of this process is presented here as an introduction to the actual model. Simple resource allocation and de-allocation is achieved through six steps.  depicts these steps.\n\n","b) The Resource Management Model Logical Elements:","The Resource Management Model is represented by a set of logical elements that interact and co-operate with each other in order to achieve the objectives mentioned earlier. These elements are shown in FIG.  and include: Resource Pool (RP) , LRM , GRM  and Resource Management Information Base (RMIB) .","(1) Resource Pool (RP) ","All resources that are of the same type, share common attributes or provide the same capabilities, and are located in the same network locale may be logically grouped together to form a Resource Pool (RP) . Each RP will have its own LRM .","(2) The Local Resource Manager (LRM) ","The LRM  is the element that is responsible for the management of a specific RP . All processes that need to utilize a resource from a RP that is managed by a LRM should gain access to the resource through that LRM and by using the simple Resource Management Model described above.","(3) The Global Resource Manager (GRM) ","The GRM  is the entity that has a global view of the resource pools across the network. The GRM gains this global view through the LRMs . All LRMs update the GRM with RP  status and statistics. There are cases where a certain LRM can not allocate a resource because all local resources are busy or because the requested resource belongs to another locale. In such cases, the LRM can consult with the GRM to locate the requested resource across the network.","(4) The Resource Management Information Base (RMIB) ","As mentioned above, all resources will be treated as managed objects (MO). The RMIB  is the database that contains all the information about all MOs across the network. MO information includes object definition, status, operation, etc. The RMIB is part of the ISP Data Management Model. All LRMs and the GRM can access the RMIB and can have their own view and access privileges of the MO's information through the ISP Data Management Model.","5. Component Interactions","To perform their tasks, the Resource Management Model elements must interact and co-operate within the rules, policies and guidelines of the Resource Management Model. The following sections explain how these entities interact with each other.","a) Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram (FIG. ):","In , each rectangle represents one entity, the verb between the \u201c<>\u201d implies the relationship between two entities and the square brackets \u201c[]\u201d imply that the direction of the relationship goes from the bracketed number to the non bracketed one. The numbers imply is the relationship is 1-to-1, 1-to-many or many-to-many.  can be read as follows:\n\n","b) Registration and De-registration","Resource registration and de-registration applies only on the set of resources that have to be dynamically managed. There are some cases where resources are statically assigned.","LRMs  operate on resource pools  where each resource pool contains a set of resource members. In order for the LRM to manage a certain resource, the resource has to inform the LRM of its existence and status. Also, the GRM  needs to be aware of the availability of the resources across the network in order to be able to locate a certain resource. The following registration and de-registration guidelines should be applied on all resources that are to be dynamically managed:","All resources must register to their LRM  as members of a specific resource pool .","All resources must de-register from their LRM  if, for any reason, they need to shutdown or be taken out of service.","All resources must report their availability status to their LRM .","All LRMs must update the GRM  with the latest resource availability based on the registered and de-registered resources.","c) GRM, LRM and RP Interactions","Every RP  will be managed by an LRM . Each process that needs a specific resource type will be assigned an LRM that will facilitate the resource access. When the process needs a resource it must request it through its assigned LRM. When the LRM receives a request for a resource, two cases may occur:","1. Resource is available: In this case, the LRM allocates a resource member of the pool and passes a resource handle to the process. The process interacts with the resource until it is done with it. Based on the resource type, once the process is done with the resource, it either informs the resource that it is done with it, and the resource itself informs its LRM that it is available, or it releases the resource and informs the LRM that it is no longer using the resource.\n\n2. Resource is not available: In this case, the LRM  consults with the GRM  for an external resource pool that contains the requested resource. If no external resource is available, the LRM informs the requesting process that no resources are available. In this case, the requesting process may:\n\n","If an external resource is available, the GRM  passes location and access information to the LRM . Then the LRM either:\n\n","d) GRM, LRM and RMIB Interactions","The RMIB  contains all information and status of all managed resources across the network. Each LRM  will have a view of the RMIB  that maps to the RP  it manages. The GRM , on the other hand, has a total view of all resources across the network. This view consists of all LRMs views. The GRM's total view enables it to locate resources across the network.","In order for the RMIB  to keep accurate resource information, each LRM  must update the RMIB with the latest resource status. This includes adding resources, removing resources and updating resource states.","Both the LRM  and GRM  can gain their access and view of the RMIB  through the ISP Data Management en tity. The actual management of the RMIB data belongs to the ISP Data Management entity. The LRM and GRM are only responsible for u pd at ing the RMIB.","K. Operational Support Model","1. Introduction","Most of the existing ISP service platforms were developed independently, each with it's own set of Operational Support features. The amount of time required to learn how to operate a given set of platforms increases with the number of platforms. The ISP service platforms need to migrate to an architecture with a common model for all of its Operational Support features across all of its products. This requires defining a model that will support current needs and will withstand or bend to the changes that will occur in the future. The Operational Support Model (OSM) defines a framework for implementation of management support for the ISP .","a) Purpose","The purpose of the Operational Support Model is to:\n\n","b) Scope","The OSM described here provides for the distributed management of ISP physical network elements and the services that run on them. The management framework described herein could also be extended to the management of logical (software) resources. However, the architecture presented here will help map utilization and faults on physical resources to their resulting impact on services.","The management services occur within four layers\n\n","Information within the layers falls into four functional areas:\n\n","The use of a common Operational Support Model for all of the ISP will enhance the operation of the ISP, and simplify the designs of future products and services within the ISP. This operational support architecture is consistent with the ITU Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) standards.","c) Definitions","Managed Object: A resource that is monitored, and controlled by one or more management systems Managed objects are located within managed systems and may be embedded in other managed objects. A managed object may be a logical or physical resource, and a resource may be represented by more than one managed object (more than one view of the object).","Managed System: One or more managed objects.","Management Sub-Domain: A Management domain that is wholly located within a parent management domain.","Management System: An application process within a managed domain which effects monitoring and control functions on managed objects and\/or management sub-domains.","Management Information Base: A MIB contains information about managed objects.","Management Domain: A collection of one or more management systems, and zero or more managed systems and management sub-domains.","Network Element: The Telecommunications network consist of many types of analog and digital telecommunications equipment and associated support equipment, such as transmission systems, switching systems, multiplexes, signaling terminals, front-end processors, mainframes, cluster controllers, file servers, LANs, WANs, Routers, Bridges, Gateways, Ethernet Switches, Hubs, X. links, SS links, etc. When managed, such equipment is generally referred to as a network element (NE).","Domain: The management environment may be partition in a number a ways such as functionally (fault, service. . .), geographical, organizational structure, etc.","Operations Systems: The management functions are resident in the Operations System.","2.

Customers will have a restricted view of the SM layer  to monitor and control their services. The SM layer provides a manager(s) that interacts with the agents in the NLMs. The SM layer also provides an agent(s) that interacts with the manager(s) in the Planning layer . Managers within the SM layer may also interact with other managers in the SM layer. In that case there are manager-agent relationships at the peer level.\n\n","The ISP Network Layer Management (NLM) Layer  has the responsibility for the management of all the network elements, as presented by the Element Management, both individually and as a set. It is not concerned with how a particular element provides services internally. The NLM layer  provides a manager(s) that interacts with the agents in the EMs . The NLM layer also provides an agent(s) that interacts with the manager(s) in the SM layer . Managers within the NLM layer  may also interact other managers in the NLM layer.

The Protocol Model","a) Protocols","The exchange of information between manager and agent relies on a set of communications protocols. TMN, which offers a good model, uses the Common Management Information Services (CMIS) and Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) as defined in Recommendations X.710, and X.711. This provides a peer-to-peer communications protocol based on ITU's Application Common Service Element (X.217 service description & X.227 protocol description) and Remote Operation Service Element (X.219 service description & X.229 protocol description). FTAM is also supported as an upper layer protocol for file transfers. The use of these upper layer protocols is described in Recommendation X.812. The transport protocols are described in Recommendation X.811. Recommendation X.811 also describes the interworking between different lower layer protocols. This set of protocols is referred to as Q3.","b) Common context","In order to share information between processes there needs to be a common understanding of the interpretation of the information exchanged.

General","The Operational Support Model provides a conceptual framework for building the operational Support System.  represents an ISP realization of this conceptual model. In this implementation of t hat model all the ISP Network Elements would be represented to the Operational Support System by a Management Information Base (MIB)  and the agent process that acts upon the objects in the MIB.","Field support personnel have two levels from which the ISP  will be managed.","1. For trouble-shooting, the Network Layers Manager  gives field support a picture of the ISP as a whole. The process of detecting, isolating, and correcting problems begins from there. From that layer, problems could be isolated to a single Network Element. Individual Network Elements are accessible from the Network Element Managers  and would allow a more detailed level of monitoring, control, configuration, and testing. The centralized view of the ISP is missing from today's ISP, but many recognize its importance.","For configuration the Network Layers Manager  provides an ISP-wide view, and interacts with the Network Element Managers  to configure Network Elements in a consistent manner. This will help insure that the ISP configuration is consistent across all platforms. The ability to change a piece of information in one place and have it automatically distributed ISP-wide is a powerful tool that has not been possible with the current ISP management framework.","Once a service definition has been created from the Service Creation Environment, the Service Manager  is used to place it in the ISP network, and provision the network for the new service. Customers for a service are provisioned through the Service Manager . As a part of provisioning customers the Service Manager predicts resource utilization, and determines if new resources need to be added to handle the customer's use of a service. It uses the current utilization statistics as a basis for that determination. Once a customer is activated, the Service Manager monitors the customer's usage of the service to determine if the quality of service agreement is being met. As customer utilization of the services increases the Service Manager  predicts the need to add resources to the ISP network. This Service Management, with appropriate restrictions, can be extended to customers as another service. While Service Creation is the talk of the IN world, it needs a Service Manager that is integrated with the rest of the system, and that is one of the purposes of this model.","Finally, for planning personnel (non-field support), the Planning Manager  analyzes the ISP-wide resource utilization to determine future needs, and to allocate cost to different services to determine the cost of a service as the basis for future service pricing.","L. Physical Network Model","1. Introduction","This section describes the Physical Network aspects of the Intelligent Services Platform (ISP)  Architecture.","a) Purpose","The Physical Network Model covers the:\n\n","b) Scope","This model defines the terminology associated with the physical network, describes the interactions between various domains and provides examples of realizations of the architecture.","c) Objectives","The objectives of this model are to:\n\n","2. Information Flow","One of the key aspects of the intelligent network (IN) is the Information Flow across various platforms installed in the network. By identifying types of information and classifying them, the network serves the needs of IN.","Customers interact with IN in a series of call flows. Calls may be audio-centric (as in the conventional ISP products), multimedia-based (as in internetMCI user using the web browser), video-based (as in video-on-demand) or a combination of contents.","Information can be classified as follows:\n\n","a) Content","Content flows contain the primary information being transported. Examples of this are analog voice, packet switched data, streamed video and leased line traffic. This is customer's property that IN must deliver with minimum loss, minimum latency and optimal cost. The IN elements are standardized such that the transport fabric supports more connectivity suites, in order to allow content to flow in the same channels with flow of other information.","b) Signaling","Signaling flows contain control information used by network elements. ISUP RLT\/IMT, TCP\/IP domain name lookups and ISDN Q.931 are all instances of this. The IN requires, uses and generates this information. Signaling information coordinates the various network platforms and allows intelligent call flow across the network. In fact, in a SCE-based IN, service deployment will also require signaling information flowing across the fabric.","c) Data","Data flows contain information produced by a call flow, including crucial billing data records often produced by the fabric and certain network platforms.","3. Terminology","Network: A set of interconnected network elements capable of transporting content, signaling and\/or data. MCI's IXC switch fabric, the ISP extended WAN, and the Internet backbone are classic examples of networks. Current installations tend to carry different contents on different networks, each of which is specialized for specific content transmission. Both technology and customer requirements (for on-demand high bandwidth) will require carriers to use more unified networks for the majority of the traffic. This will require the fabric to allow for different content characteristics and protocols along the same channels. Another aspect of this will be more uniform content-independent signaling.","Site: A set of physical entities collocated in a geographically local area. In the current ISP architecture, instances of sites are Operator Center, ISNAP Site (which also has ARU's) and an EVS site. By the very definition, the NT and DSC switches are NOT part of the site. They are instead part of the Transport Network (see below). In the architecture, a group of (geographically collocated) Service Engines (SE), Special Resources (SR), Data Servers (DS) along with Network Interfaces and Links form a site.","Network Element: A physical entity connecting to the Transport Networks through Network Interfaces. Examples of this are ACP, EVS SIP, MTOC, Videoconference Reservation Server, DAP Transaction Server, and NAS. In the next few years, elements such as web servers, voice authentication servers, video streamers and network call record stores will join the present family of network elements.","Network Interface: Equipment enabling connectivity of Network Elements to the Transport Networks. DS1 CSU\/DSU, 10BaseT Ethernet interface card and ACD ports are network interfaces. With the architecture of the preferred embodiment, network interfaces will provide a well-understood uniform set of API's for communication.","Link: Connection between 2 or more Network Interfaces which are at different sites. A link may be a segment of OC-12 SONET Fiber or 100 mbps dual ring FDDI section. In the coming years, IN must handle network links such as ISO Ethernet WAN hub links and gigabit rate OC-48's.","Connection: an attachment of two or more Network Interfaces which are at the same site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0528","num":"1278"},"figref":"FIG. 38","b":["2400","2401","2402","2404","2406","2408"]},"4. Entity Relationships","Entity relationships as shown in  have been arrived at as part of the physical network modeling rules. Some of these rules allow for generalities that future demands and some will constrain definitions to avoid conflicts.\n\n","The preferred embodiment integrates product and service offerings for MCI's business customers. The initial embodiment focuses on a limited product set. Requirements for an interface have been identified to capitalize on the integration of these services. The interface provides user-manageability of features, distribution list capabilities, and a centralized message database.","VIII. INTELLIGENT NETWORK","All of the platform's support services have been consolidated onto one platform. The consolidation of platforms enables shared feature\/functionality of services to create a common look and feel of features.","A. Network Management","The architecture is designed such that it can be remotely monitored by an MCI operations support group. This remote monitoring capability provides MCI the ability to:","Identify degraded or broken connectivity between:\n\n","Identify degraded application processes and isolate the process that is degraded;","Identify hardware failure; and","Generate alarms that can be detected and received by an internal MCI monitoring group for all application process, hardware or interface failures.","In addition, remote access to system architecture components is provided to the remote monitoring and support group such that they can perform remote diagnostics to isolate the cause of the problem.","B. Customer Service","Customer Service teams support all services. Customer support is provided to customers in a seamless manner and encompasses the complete product life cycle including:\n\n","Comprehensive and coordinated support procedures ensure complete customer support from inception to termination. Customer service is provided from the time the Account Team submits the order until the customer cancels the account. Comprehensive and coordinated customer support entails the following:","A one-stop, direct access, customer service group to support ARU or VRU problems, WWW Browser problems or PC Client problems.","A staff that is well trained on diagnosing problems associated with access (ARU, WWW Browser or PC Client), the user interface (ARU, WWW Browser or PC Client), the application (Message Center or Profile Management) or the back-end system interfaces (universal inbox, directlineMCI voicemail\/faxmail platform, Fax Broadcast System, SkyTel Paging server, order entry systems, billing systems, etc.)","A staff that has on-line access to databases with information about ARU or VRU capabilities, WWW Browser capabilities, identified hardware issues and identified application issues\n\n","C. Accounting","Accounting is supported according to current MCI procedures.","D. Commissions","Commissions are supported according to current MCI procedures.","E. Reporting","Reporting is required for revenue tracking, internal and external customer installation\/sales, usage and product\/service performance. Weekly and monthly fulfillment reports are required from the fulfillment house(s). These fulfillment reports correlate the number of orders received and number of orders delivered. In addition, reporting identifies the number of different subscribers accessing Profile Management or the Message Center through the WWW Site.","F. Security","Security is enforced in accordance with MCI's published policies and procedures for Internet security. In addition, security is designed into the WWW Browser and ARU interface options to verify and validate user access to directlineMCI profiles, Message Center, Personal Home Page calendars and Personal Home Page configurations.","G. Trouble Handling","Trouble reporting of problems is documented and tracked in a single database. All troubles are supported according to the Network Services Trouble Handling System (NSTHS) guidelines. Any Service Level Agreements (SLAs) defined between MCI organizations are structured to support NSTHS.","Any troubles that require a software fix are closed in the trouble reporting database and opened as a Problem Report (PR) in the Problem Tracking System.

Web Server Architecture","The Web Servers are located in a DMZ. The DMZ houses the Web Servers and associated Database Clients as required. The database clients do not hold any data, but provide an interface to the data repositories behind the corporate firewall.","The Web space uses Round-Robin addressing for name resolution. The Domain name is registered with the administrators of mci.com domain, with a sub-netted (internally autonomous) address space allocated for galileo.mci.com domain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0561","num":"1337"},"figref":"FIG. 40"},"1. Welcome Server ","This Web Server runs both the secure and normal HTTP daemons. The primary function of this server is to authenticate user  at login time. The authentication requires the use of Java and a switch from normal to secure m od e operation. Th ere are one or more Welcome servers  in the DMZ. The information provided by the Welcome server  is stateless. The statelessness means that there is no need to synchronize multiple Welcome Servers .","The Welcome server's first task is to authenticate the user. This requires the use of single use TOKENS, Passcode authentication and Hostile IP filtering. The first is done using a Token Server , while the other two will be done using direct database  access.","In case of failed authentication, the user  is shown a screen that mentions all the reasons (except Hostile-IP) why the attempt may have failed. This screen automatically leads the users back to the initial login screen.","Welcome Server's  last task, after a successful authentication, is to send a service selection screen to the user . The Service Selection screen directs the user to an appropriate Application Server. The user selects the Application, but an HTML file in the Server Section page determines the Application Server. This allows the Welcome Servers  to do rudimentary load balancing.","All the Welcome Servers  in the DMZ are mapped to www.galileo.mci.com. The implementation of DNS also allows galileo.mci.com to map to www.galileo.mci.com.","2. Token Server ","This is a database client and not a Web Server. The Token servers  are used by Welcome Servers  to issue a TOKEN to login attempts. The issued TOKEN, once validated, is used to track the state information for a connection by the Application Servers. The TOKEN information is be maintained in a database on a database server  (repository) behind the corporate firewall. The Token Servers  do the following tasks:","1. Issue single use TOKEN during authentication phase.","2. Validate single use TOKEN (mark it for multi use).","3. Validate multi-use TOKEN.","4. Re-validate multi-use TOKEN.","The Token Servers  are required to issue a unique TOKEN on every new request. This mandates a communication link between multiple Token Servers in order to avoid conflict of TOKEN values issued. This conflict is eliminated by assigning ranges to each Token Server .","The TOKEN is a sixteen character quantity made up of 62 possible character values in the set [0-9A-Za-z]. The characters in positions 0,1 and 2 for each TOKEN issued by the Token Server are fixed. These character values are assigned to each Token Server at configuration time. The character at position 0 is used as physical location identifier. The character at position 1 identifies the server at the location while the character at position 2 remains fixed at \u20180\u2019. This character could be used to identify the version number for the Token Server.","The remaining 13 characters of the TOKEN are generated sequentially using the same 62 character set described above. At startup the TOKEN servers assign the current system time to the character positions 15-10, and set positions 9-3 to \u20180\u2019. The TOKEN values are then incremented sequentially on positions - with position  being least significant. The character encoding assumes the following order for high to low digit values : \u2018z\u2019-\u2018a\u2019, \u2018Z\u2019-\u2018A\u2019, \u20189\u2019-\u20180\u2019.","The above scheme generates unique tokens if the system time is computed in 4 byte values, which compute to 6 base-62 characters in positions 15-10. The other assumption is that the scheme does not generate more than 62^7 (35*10^12) TOKENS in one second on any given Token Server in any embodiment.","The use of TOKEN ranges allows the use of multiple Token Servers in the Domain without any need for explicit synchronization. The method accommodates a maximum 62 sites, each having no more than 62 Token Servers. An alternate embodiment would accommodate more sites.","All of the Token Servers in the DMZ are mapped to token.galileo.mci.com. The initial embodiment contains two Token Servers . These Token Servers  are physically identical to the Welcome Servers , i.e., the Token Service daemon will run on the same machine that also runs the HTTP daemon for the Welcome service. In another embodiment, the two run on different systems.","The Welcome Server(s)  use the Token Server(s)  to get a single use TOKEN during the authentication phase of the connection. Once authenticated, the Welcome Server  marks the TOKEN valid and marks it for multiple use. This multi-use TOKEN accompanies the service selection screen sent to the user by the Welcome Server.","The design of TOKEN database records is discussed in detail below.","3. Application Servers","The Application servers are Web servers that do the business end of the user transaction. The Welcome Server's last task, after a successful authentication, is to send a service selection screen to the user. The service selection screen contains the new multi-use TOKEN.","When the user selects a service, the selection request, with its embedded TOKEN, is sent to the appropriate Application Server. The Application Server validates the TOKEN using the Token Server  and, if valid, serves the request. A Token Server can authenticate a TOKEN issued by any one of the Token Servers on the same physical site. This is possible because the Token Servers  are database clients for the data maintained on a single database repository behind the corporate firewall.","An invalid TOKEN (or a missing TOKEN) always leads to the \u201cAccess Denied\u201d page. This page is served by the Welcome Server(s) . All denial of access attempts are logged.","The actual operation of the Application Server depends on the Application itself. The Application Servers in the DMZ are mapped to <appName><num>.galileo.mci.com. Thus, in an embodiment with multiple applications (e.g., Profile Management, Message Center, Start Card Profile, Personal Web Space etc.), the same Welcome and Token servers  and  are used and more Applications servers are added as necessary.","Another embodiment adds more servers for the same application. If the work load on an application server increases beyond its capacity, another Application Server is added without any changes to existing systems. The SERVERS and TOKEN_HOSTS databases (described below) are updated to add the record for the new server. The <num> part of the host name is used to distinguish the Application Servers.","There is no need to use DNS Round-robin on these names. The Welcome server  uses a configuration table (The SERVERS database loaded at startup) to determine the Application Server name prior to sending the service selection screen.","B. Web Server System Environment","All the Web servers run the Netscape Commerce Server HTTP daemon. The Welcome Servers  run the daemon in normal as well as secure mode, while the Application Servers only run the secure mode daemon.","The Token Server(s) run a TCP service that runs on a well known port for ease of connection from within the DMZ. The Token Service daemon uses tcp_wrapper to deny access to all systems other than Welcome and Application server(s). In order to speed this authentication process, the list of addresses is loaded by these servers at configuration time, instead of using reverse name mapping at every request. The use of tcp_wrapper also provides the additional tools for logging Token Service activity.","The Application servers mostly work as front-ends for database services behind the firewall. Their main task is to validate the access by means of the TOKEN, and then validate the database request. The database requests are to Create, Read, Update or Delete exiting records or data fields on behalf of the user. The Application Servers do the necessary validation and authority checks before serving the request.","1. Welcome Servers","The Welcome Servers serve the HTML pages described below to the user at appropriate times. The pages are generated using Perl-based Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. The Scripts reside in a directory which is NOT in the normal document-root directory of the HTTP daemon. The normal precautions regarding disabling directory listing and removing all backup files etc. are taken to ensure that CGI scripts are not readable to the user.  shows the directory structure  on the Welcome Server  (of FIG.  and referred to throughout this following paragraphs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0595","num":"1371"},"figref":"FIG. 41","b":["456","458"]},"The HTTP Server maps all requests to the \u201ccgi\u201d directory  based on the URL requested. The CGI scripts use the HTML templates from the \u201ctemplate\u201d directory  to create and send the HTML output to the users on fly.","The use of the URL to map to a CGI script out of the <document_root> blocks access to the <document_root> directory  by a malicious user. Since every access to the Welcome Server  maps to a CGI script in the cgi directory  of the Welcome Server , security is ensured by calling the authentication function at start of every script.","The user Authentication libraries are developed in Perl to authenticate the user identity. NSAPI's authentication phase routines also add features for TOKEN verification and access mode detection in the servers themselves.","The Welcome Servers  read their operating parameters into their environment from the database  at startup. It is necessary to keep this information in the common database in order to maintain the same environment on multiple Welcome Servers .","a) Welcome Page","The welcome page is sent as the default page when the Welcome Server  is first accessed. This is the only page that is not generated using a cgi script, and it is maintained in the <document_root> directory . This page does the following:\n\n","The last action by the Welcome page is done using the Java applet embedded in page. This also switches the user's browser from normal to secure mode.","b) Login Page","The Login Page is a cgi-generated page that contains an embedded single use TOKEN, a Java applet, and form fields for the user to enter a User Id and Passcode. The page may display a graphic to emphasize service.","The processing of this page is padded to introduce an artificial delay. In the initial embodiment, this padding is set to zero.","The response from this page contains the TOKEN, a scrambled TOKEN value generated by the applet, User Id and Passcode. This information is sent to the Welcome server using a POST HTTP request by the Java applet. The POST request also contains the Applet signature.","If the login process is successful the response to this request is the Server Selection page. A failure at this stage results in an Access Failed page.","c) Server Selection Page","The Server Selection Page is a cgi-generated page which contains an embedded multi-use TOKEN. This page also shows one or more graphics to indicate the types of services available to the user. Some services are not accessible by our users. In other embodiments, when more than one service exists, a User Services Database keyed on the User Id is used to generate this page.","The Welcome server uses its configuration information to embed the names of appropriate Application Servers with the view to sharing the load among all available Application Servers. This load sharing is done by using the configuration data read by the Welcome Server(s) during startup.","The Welcome Server selects an Application Server based upon entries in its configuration file for each of the services. These entries list the names of Application Server(s) for each application along with their probability of selection. This configuration table is loaded by the Welcome Servers at startup.","d) Access Failed Page","The Access Failed Page is a static page. That displays a message indicating that the login failed because of an error in User Id, Passcode or both. This page automatically loads the Login Page after a delay of 15 seconds.","e) Access Denied Page","The Access Denied Page is a static page that displays a message indicating that an access failed due to authentication error. This page automatically loads the Login Page after a delay of  seconds. The Access Denied page is called by the Application Servers when their authentication service fails to recognize a TOKEN. All loads of this page will be logged and monitored.","2. Token Servers ","The TOKEN service on the Web site is the only source of TOKEN generation and authentication. The Tokens themselves are stored in a shared Database. This database can be shared among all Token servers. The Token Database is behind the firewall out of the DMZ.","The Token service provides the services over a well-known (>1024) TCP port. These services are provided only to a trusted host. The list of trusted hosts is maintained in a configuration database. This database is also maintained behind the firewall outside of the DMZ. The Token servers read their configuration database only on startup or when they receive a signal to refresh. The Token services are:\n\n","TOKEN aging is implemented by a separate service to reduce the work load on the Token servers.","All access to the Token Server(s) is logged and monitored. The Token Service itself is written using the tcp_wrapper code available from MCI's internal security groups.","3. Profile Management Application Servers","The profile management application server(s) are the only type of Application servers implemented in the first embodiment. These servers have the same directory layout as the Welcome Servers. This allows the same system system to be used for both services if necessary.","C. Security","The data trusted by subscribers to the Web server is sensitive to them. They would like to protect it as much as possible. The subscribers have access to this sensitive information via the Web server(s). This information may physically reside on one or more database servers, but as far as the subscribers are concerned it is on Server(s) and it should be protected.","Presently only the following information needs to be protected in an embodiment:","In other embodiments, profile information for directline account additional information is protected, including Email, Voice Mail, Fax Mail, and Personal Home Page information.","The protection is offered against the following type of attackers:\n\n","The project implements the security by using the following schemes:\n\n","In addition to the security implemented by TOKEN as described above, the Web Server(s) are in a Data Management Zone for further low level security.

The Token is still associated with the Browser's IP address, but it now has an expiration time."]}},"E. Service Selection","When the user selects an option from the Service selection screen, the request is accompanied by the Token. The token is validated before the service is accessed, as shown in FIG. .","F. Service Operation","The screens generated by the Application Servers all contain the Token issued to the user when the Login process was started. This Token has an embedded expiration time and a valid source IP Address. All operation requests include this token as a part of the request.","The service requests are sent by the browser as HTML forms, APPLET based forms or plain Hyper Links. In the first two instances, the Token is sent back as a Hidden field using the HTTP-POST method. The Hyper-Links use either the HTTP-GET method with embedded Token or substitute the Cookie in place of a Token. The format of the Token is deliberately chosen to be compatible with this approach.","1. NIDS Server","The NIDS server in the system is isolated from the Web Servers by a router-based firewall. The NIDS server runs the NIDSCOMM and ASCOMM services that allow TCP clients access to databases on the NIDS server. The NIDSCOMM and ASCOMM services do not allow connectivity to databases not physically located on the NIDS Server.","The following databases (C-tree services) on the NIDS server are used by the Welcome Server, Token Server and Profile Management Application Server:\n\n","In addition to the C Tree services named above the following new C tree services will be defined in the SERVDEF and used only on the NIDS server dedicated to the system:\n\n","The following descriptions for these databases do not show the filler field required at the first byte of each record, nor do they attempt to show any other filler fields that may be required for structure alignment along the -byte boundaries. This omission is made only for clarity. The numbers in parentheses next to the field definitions are the number of bytes required to hold the field value.","2. TOKEN database service.","The TOKEN database service is accessed by the Token Servers. The primary operations on this service are Create a new record, read a record for a given Token value and update a record for the given Token value.","A separate chron job running on the NIDS Server itself also accesses this database and deletes obsolete records on a periodic basis. This chron job runs every hour. It does a sequential scan of the database and deletes records for expired tokens.","The TOKEN database service contains the TOKEN records.

HOSTILE_IP database service.","This database is accessed by the Welcome servers to create new records or read existing records based on IP address as the key. The read access is very frequent. This database contains the following fields:\n\n","The key field is the IP Address. All three values are set by the Welcome Server when creating this record. If the entry is to be over-ridden, the service doing the over-ride will only be allowed to change the Time expires value to <epoch_start>, thus flagging the entry as over-ride.","This database is also accessed by the Web Administrators to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records. Access is via the ASCOMM interface. The Web Administrators use the HTML form and CGI script for their administration tasks. Customer Service uses a specially developed tool to access this database and access is allowed only from within the corporate firewall.","A chron job running on the NIDS server also accesses this database and deletes all obsolete records from this database. This job logs all its activity. The log of this job is frequently examined by the Web Administrators all the time.","5. TOKEN_HOSTS database service.","This database service lists IP Addresses of the hosts trusted by the Token Servers. This database is read by the Token Service at configuration time. The records in this database contain the following fields:\n\n","The key field is the IP Address. The Authority binary flag determines the access level.

Product\/Enhancement","A preferred embodiment enables directlineMCI customers additional control over their profile by providing a graphical user interface, and a common messaging system. The capability to access the power of a preferred embodiment exists in the form of a directlineMCI profile and common messaging system. The user is able to modify his account, customizing his application by making feature\/functionality updates. The application enables the power of the future capabilities that a preferred embodiment integration will provide by allowing the user to run his application.","The user is able to access all of his messages by connecting with just one location. FAX, email, page and voice messages will be accessed through a centralized messaging interface. The user is able to call into the centralized messaging interface through his message center interface to retrieve messages. A centralized message interface provides the user the capability to manage his communications easily and effectively.","The user interface has two components, the user's application profile and message center. The interface is accessible through PC software (i.e., PC Client messaging interface), an ARU or a VRU, and a World Wide Web (WWW) Browser. The interface support s the customization of applications and the management of messages.","The feature\/functionality requirements for an embodiment will be presented below. The first piece to be described is the ARU interface and its requirements for the user interface , me ssage management and profile management. Following the ARU requirements, requirements a re als o provided for the WWW Browser and PC Client interfaces.","J. Interface Feature Requirements (Overview)","A front-end acts as an interface between the user and a screen display server in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The user is able to access the system and directly access his profile and messages. The user interface is used to update his profile and to access his messages. The user's profile information and the user's messages may reside in different locations, so the interface is able to connect to both places. Profile and messaging capabilities are separate components of the interface and have different requirements.","Through his interface, the user is able to update his profile in real-time through profile management. The application profile is the front-end to the user account directory, which is where all of the user account information resides in a virtual location. Also, a user is able to manage his messages (voicemail, faxmail, email, pager recall) through his message center. The message center is the front-end to the centralized messaging database, which is where all of the user's messages may reside, regardless of message content.","Three user interfaces are supported:\n\n","From the ARU, the users are able to update their profiles (directlineMCI only), retrieve voicemail messages and pager recall messages, and retrieve message header (sender, subject, date\/time) information for faxmail and email messages. Through the PC Client, the user is limited to message retrieval and message manipulation. The WWW Browser provides the user a comprehensive interface for profile management and message retrieval. Through the WWW Browser, the users are able to update their profiles (directlineMCI, Information Services, List Management, Global Message Handling and Personal Home Pages) and retrieve all message types.","1. The User Account Profile","The user is able to access account information through the application profile. The application profile provides an intelligent interface between the user and his account information, which resides in the user account directory. The User Account Directory accesses the individual account information of users. Users are able to read and write to the directory, making updates to their accounts. The directory allows search capabilities, enabling customer service representatives to search for a specific account when assisting a customer.","When a customer obtains a phone number, the user account directory reflects the enrollment, and the user is able to access and update features through his user account profile. If a customer withdraws, the user directory will reflect the deactivation, and the service will be removed from the user's application profile.","In summary, the user account directory provides account information for each of the user's services. However, the user account directory is limited to: directlineMCI profile, Information Services profile, Global Message Handling, List Management and Personal Home Page profiles. This information determines the feature\/functionality of the user's application and provides the user with the flexibility that is necessary to customize his application, allowing MCI to meet his continuously changing communication needs.","2. The Database of Messages","An important feature that is offered is the integration of messages. Messages of similar and dissimilar content are consolidated in one virtual location. Through a call, the message center provides the user with a review of all of his messages, regardless of content or access. Through the interface messaging capabilities, the user is also able to maintain an address book and distribution lists.","This message database is a centralized information store, housing messages for users. The message database provides common object storage capabilities, storing data files as objects. By accessing the message database, users retrieve voicemail, faxmail, email and pager recall messages from a single virtual location. In addition, by using common object storage capabilities, message distribution is extremely efficient.","K. Automated Response Unit (ARU) Capabilities","1. User Interface","The ARU interface is able to perform directlineMCI Profile Management, Information Services Profile Management, message retrieval and message distribution. The DTMF access provided through the ARU is applied consistently across different components within the system. For example, entering alphabetic characters through the DTMF keypad is entered in the same manner regardless if the user is accessing Stock Quote information or broadcasting a fax message to a distribution list.","Voicemail Callback Auto Redial provides the capability to prompt for and collect a DTMF callback number from a guest leaving a voicemail and automatically launch a return call to the guest call back number when retrieving messages. Upon completing the callback, the subscriber will be able to return to the same place where they left off in the mailbox.","Music On-Hold provides music while a guest is on-hold.","Park and Page provides a guest an option to page a directlineMCI subscriber, through the directlineMCI gateway, then remain on-hold while the subscriber is paged. The subscriber receives the page and calls their directlineMCI number, where they can select to be connected with the guest on hold. Should the subscriber fail to connect a call with the guest, the guest will receive an option to be forwarded to voicemail. If the subscriber does not have voicemail as a defined option, then the guest a final message will be played for the guest.","Note: The guest has the ability to press an option to be forwarded to voicemail at any time while on hold.","Call Screening with Park and Page An embodiment provides the subscriber with functionality for responding to a park and page, the identity of the calling party (i.e., guest). This provides the subscribers the ability to choose whether they wish to speak to the guest or transfer the guest to voicemail, prior to connecting the call. Specifically, guests are ARU prompted to record their names when they select the park and page option. When the subscriber respond to the park and page, they will hear an ARU prompt stating, \u201cYou have a call from RECORDED NAME\u201d, then be presented with the option to connect with the calling party or transfer the party to voicemail. If the subscriber does not have voicemail as a defined option, then the guest will be deposited to a final message. The guest also will have the ability to press an option to be forwarded to voicemail at any time while on hold.","Two-way Pager Configuration Control and Response to Park and Page","The system also allows a subscriber to respond to a park and page notification by instructing the ARU to route the call to voicemail or final message or continue to hold, through a command submitted by a two-way pager.","Text Pager Support","The system allows a subscriber to page a directlineMCI subscriber, through the directlineMCI gateway, and a leave a message to be retrieved by a text pager. Specifically, upon choosing the appropriate option, the guest will be transferred to either the networkMCI Paging or the SkyTel message center where an operator will receive and submitcreate a text-based message to be retrieved by the subscriber's text pager.","Forward to the Next Termination Number","The system provides the capability for the party answering the telephone, to which a directlineMCI call has been routed, to have the option to have the call routed to the next termination number in the directlineMCI routing sequence. Specifically, the called party will receive a prompt from the directlineMCI ARU gateway, which indicates that the call has been routed to this number by directlineMCI and providing the called party with the option to receive the incoming call or have the call routed to the next termination number or destination in the routing sequence. The options presented to a called party include:\n\n","An embodiment also provides the capability to reoriginate an outbound call, from the directlineMCI gateway, by pressing the pound (# ) key for less than two seconds. Currently, directlineMCI requires the # key to be depressed for two seconds or more before the subscriber can reoriginate a call.","L. Message Management","1. Multiple Media Message Notification","The subscriber can receive an accounting of current messages across a number of media, to include voicemail, faxmail, email, paging. Specifically, the subscriber will hear an ARU script stating, for example, \u201cYou have 3 new voicemail messages, 2 new faxmail messages, and 10 new email messages.\u201d","2. Multiple Media Message Manipulation","A subscriber is allowed to access the Universal Inbox to perform basic message manipulation, of messages received through multiple media (voicemail, faxmail, email, paging), through the directlineMCI ARU gateway. Subscribers are able to retrieve voicemail messages and pager messages, and retrieve message header (priority, sender, subject, date\/time, size) information for faxmail and email messages. In addition, subscribers are able to save, forward or delete messages reviewed from the ARU interface. The forward feature is limited to distributing messages as either voicemails or faxmails. Only voicemail messages can be forwarded as voicemails. Email, faxmnail and pager messages can be forwarded as faxmails; however, it may be necessary to convert email and pager messages to a G format. When forwarding messages as faxmails, subscribers have the ability to send messages to distribution lists and Fax Broadcast lists.","3. Text to Speech","The system converts text messages, received as email, faxmail or pager messages, into audio, which can be played back through the directlineMCI gateway. Initially, the text-to-speech capability will be limited to message header (priority, sender, subject, date\/time, size) information.","Subscribers are provided the option to select whether they want to hear message headers first and then select which complete message they want to be played. The only message type that does not support a text-to-speech capability for the complete message will be faxmail messages. The capability only exists to play faxmail headers. FAXmail header information includes sender's ANI, date\/time faxmail was received and size of faxmail.","4. Email Forwarding to a Fax Machine","Subscribers can forward an email, retrieved and reviewed through the directlineMCI ARU gateway, to a subscriber-defined termination number. Specifically, the subscriber has the ability to review an email message through the directlineMCI ARU. After reviewing the message, the subscriber receives, among the standard prompts, a prompt requesting whether he would like to forward the email message to a specified termination number or have the option to enter an impromptu number. Upon selecting this option and indicating the termination number, the email message is converted to a G3 format and transmitted to the specified termination number. Email attachments that are binary files are supported. If an attachment cannot be delivered to the terminating fax machine, a text message must be provided to the recipient that the binary attachment could not be forwarded. Forwarding of emails to a fax machine does not result in the message being deleted from the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d.","5. Pager Notification of Messages Received","A subscriber can receive a pager notification, on a subscriber-defined interval, indicating the number of messages, by message media, that currently reside in the subscriber's \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d. Specifically, the subscriber will have the ability to establish a notification schedule, through the directlineMCI ARU, to receive a pager message which indicates the number of voicemail, faxmail, email and pager messages that reside in the subscriber's \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d.","6. Delivery Confirmation of Voicemail","The system provides the subscriber the ability to receive a confirmation voicemail message when a subscriber-initiated voicemail message was not successfully delivered to the terminating party(s).","7. Message Prioritization","The system provides the guest the ability to assign either regular or urgent priority to a message. When the subscriber receives an accounting of messages, the prioritization will be indicated, and all urgent messages will be indexed before regular messages. This requirement only applies to voicemails, not faxmails. This will require that the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d present the proper message priority for directlineMCI voicemails.","M. Information Services","Through the ARU interface, users will be able to receive content from information services which are configurable through the WWW Browser interface. Information content will be provided as an inbound service and an outbound service. The information content that is defined through the WWW Browser (i.e., Profile Management) is defined as the inbound information content and will be limited to:\n\n","Subscribers also have the ability to access additional information content through the ARU interface; however, this information is not configurable through the WWW Browser (i.e., Profile Management). This additional information content will be referred to as outbound information content and will consist of:\n\n","The configurable parameters of the inbound information content is defined below. Retrieval of outbound information content will support the entry of alphabetic characters through a DTMF keypad. Entering of alphabetic characters must be consistent with the manner that alphabetic characters are entered through DTMF for list management.","Access to Traveler's Assist will be bundled with the other outbound information services such that the subscriber only has to dial a single 800\/8XX number. The 800\/8XX call may extend to different termination depending upon the information content selected.","N. Message Storage Requirements","The message storage requirements are consistent with the message storage requirements defined below.","O. Profile Management","directlineMCI Profile Management","Subscribers can also review, update and invoke their directlineMCI account profiles. The directlineMCI profile management capabilities through the ARU interface are consistent with the presentation provided through the WWW Browser and support the following requirements:\n\n","P. Call Routing Menu Change","The system also provides the capability for subscribers to modify their call routing termination numbers without having to re-enter termination numbers which they do not wish to change. Specifically, the directlineMCI routing modification capability requires the subscriber to re-enter all termination numbers in a routing sequence should they wish to change any of the routing numbers. This capability permits the subscriber to change only the termination numbers they wish to change, and indicate by pressing the \u201c#\u201d key when they do not wish to change a specific number in the routing sequence.","Q. Two-way Pager Configuration Control and Response to Park and Page","The system can also enable or disable predefined directlineMCI profiles through a command submitted by a two-way pager.","R. Personalized Greetings","The system provides subscribers the ability to review and update the personalized greeting that will be played from the ARU or displayed from their Personal Home Page. Each greeting is maintained separately and customized to the features available through each interface (ARU or Personal Home Page).","S. List Management","The system also provides the subscriber the ability to create and update lists, and create a voice annotation name for a list. Fax Broadcast list management capabilities are integrated with directlineMCI list management capabilities to provide a single database of lists. From the ARU interface, subscribers have the ability to review, update, add or delete members on a list. In addition, subscribers are able to delete or create lists. The ARU interface is able to use the lists to distribute voicemail and faxmail messages.","Access to distribution lists supports alphabetic list names such that lists are not limited to list code names. Entering of alphabetic characters through DTMF to the ARU for list names is consistent with the manner that alphabetic characters are entered through DTMF for Information Services. The List Management requirements are discussed in greater detail below.","In addition to providing message manipulation capabilities, the PC Client also provides an address book and access to lists. The user is able to make modifications to the address book and manage distribution lists for voice, fax, email and paging messages. In one embodiment, lists created or maintained through the PC Client interface are not integrated with lists created or maintained through the WWW Browser or ARU interfaces, but such integration can be implemented in an alternative embodiment. The subscriber is able to send a message to a distribution list from the PC Client. This requires a two-way interface between the PC Client and the List Management database whereby the PC Client can export a comma delimited or DBF formatted file to the database of lists.","The user is able to create and modify recipient address information through his interface PC software. The user is able to record multiple types of addresses in his address book, including 10 digit ANIs, voice mailbox ids, fax mailbox ids, paging numbers and email addresses (MCIMail and Internet). This information should is saved onto the PC. The address information retained on the PC Client is classified and sorted by recipient's name.","T. Global Message Handling","From the ARU interface, subscribers are able to define which message types can be accessed from the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d. The global message handling requirements are consistent with the requirements defined below.","X. INTERNET TELEPHONY AND RELATED SERVICES","The discussion thus far has provided an introduction to the Internet, and therefore Internet telephony, but Internet telephony encompasses quite a few areas of development. The following is a summary of Internet telephony, divided into seven key areas. The first area consists of access to Internet telephony services. This area involves accessing and utilizing the Internet using such mechanisms as satellites, dialup services, T1, T3, DS3, OC3, and OC12 dedicated lines, SMDS networks, ISDN B-channels, ISDN D-channels, multirate ISDN, multiple B-channel bonded ISDN systems, Ethernet, token ring, FDDI GSM, LMDS, PCS, cellular networks, frame relay, and X.25.","The second area involves sharing Internet telephony. Multimedia data can utilize circuit-switched networks quite readily due to the high reliability and throughput potential. Issues include shared data, pushing URL data between parties, data conferencing, shared whiteboarding, resource collaboration, and ISDN user-user signaling.","The third area deals with routing Internet telephony. Issues include the time-of-day, the day-of-week, the day-of-month, and the day-of-year, in addition to geographic points of origin, network point of origin, and time zone of origin. Analysis of routing also includes user data, destination parties, telephone numbers, lines of origin, types of bearer service, presubscribed feature routing, ANI, and IP addresses. Also, VNET plans, range privileges, directory services, and Service Control Points (SCP)s fall into routing Internet telephony.","The fourth category deals with quality of service. Analysis must include switched networks, ISDN, dynamic modifications, Internet telephony, RSVP, and redundant network services. In addition, this category includes hybrid Internet\/telephony switches, Ethernet features, ISDN features, analog local loops and public phones, and billing for reserved and\/or utilized services.","The fifth category is composed of directory services, profiles, and notifications. Examples are distributed directories, finding-me and follow-me services, directory management of telephony, and user interfaces. Calling party authentication security is also included. Hierarchical and object-oriented profiles exist, along with directory service user profiles, network profile data structures, service profiles, and order entry profiles.","The sixth category consists of hybrid Internet telephony services. Areas include object directed messaging, Internet telephony messaging, Internet conferencing, Internet faxing, information routing (IMMR), voice communications, and intranets (such as those that exist within a company). Other services include operator services, management service, paging services, billing services, wireless integration, message broadcasts, monitoring and reporting services, card services, video-mail services, compression, authorization, authentication, encryption, telephony application builders, billing, and data collection services.","The seventh category consists of hybrid Internet media services, which include areas of collaborative work which involve a plurality of users. Users can collaborate on Audio, Data and Video. This area includes media conferencing within the Hybrid network. Then there is a broadly related area of Reservations mechanism, Operator-assisted conferencing, and the introduction of content into conferences. The Virtual locations of these conferences will assume importance in the future. The next-generation Chat Rooms will feature virtual conference spaces with simulated Office Environments.","A. System Environment for Internet Media","1. Hardware","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as the IBM PS\/2, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation  in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) , printer and a disk storage unit  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC System\/7 OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","2. Object-Oriented Software Tools","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architectural mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each other's capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture.","It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cderived from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cderives from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with them (e.g., number of pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would identify the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, our logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built, objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, common lisp object system (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer must write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs with custom code being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically provides objects that define default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","B. Telephony Over The Internet","Voice over the Internet has become an inexpensive hobbyist commodity. Several firms are evolving this technology to include interworking with the PSTN. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for established carriers like MCI and BT especially in the International Direct Distance Dialing IDDD arena. This discussion explores how a carrier class service could be offered based on this evolving technology. Of particular interest are ways to permit interworking between the PSTN and the Internet using 1 plus dialing.","The introductory discussion considers the technical requirements to support PC to PC connectivity in a more robust manner than presently offered, in addition to the technical requirements for a PSTN to Internet voice gateway. Consideration is given to how calls can be placed from PCs to a PSTN destination and visa versa. The case of PSTN to PSTN communications, using the Internet as a long distance network is also explored.","It is shown how such services can be offered in a way that will complement existing PSTN services, offering lower prices for a lower quality of service. At issue in the longer term is the steady improvement in quality for Internet telephony and whether this will ultimately prove competitive with conventional voice services.","1. Introduction","In the mid-late 1970s, experiments in the transmission of voice over the Internet were conducted as part of an ongoing program of research sponsored by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In the mid-1980s, UNIX-based workstations were used to conduct regular audio\/video conferencing sessions, in modest quantities, over the Internet. These experimental applications were extended in the late 1980s with larger scale, one-way multicasting of voice and video. In 1995 a small company, VocalTec (www.vocaltec.com), introduced an inexpensive software package that was capable of providing two way voice communications between multi-media PCs connected to the Internet. Thus was born a new generation of telephony over the Internet.","The first software package, and its immediate followers, provided a hobbyist tool. A meeting place based on a Internet Relay Chat \u201croom\u201d (IRC) was used to establish point to point connections between end stations for the voice transfer. This resulted in chance meetings, as is common in chat rooms, or a prearranged meeting, if the parties coordinated ahead of time, by email or other means.","a) How it Works","A user with a multi-media PC and an Internet connection can add the Internet Telephony capability by loading a small software package. In the case of VocalTec, the package makes a connection to the meeting place (IRC server), based on a modified chat server. At the IRC the user sees a list of all other users connected to the IRC.","The user calls another user by clicking on his name. The IRC responds by sending the IP address of the called party. For dial in users of the Internet, an IP address is assigned at dial in time, and consequently will change between dial in sessions. If the destination is not already engaged in a voice connection, its PC beeps a ring signal. The called user can answer the phone with a mouse click, and the calling party then begins sending traffic directly to the IP address of the called party. A multi-media microphone and speakers built into or attached to the PC are used as a speakerphone. The speaker's voice is digitized, compressed and packetized for transmission across the Internet. At the other end it is decompressed and converted to sound through the PC's speakers.","b) Implications","Telephony over the Internet offers users a low cost service, that is distance and border insensitive. For the current cost of Internet access (at low hourly rates, or in some cases unlimited usage for a flat fee) the caller can hold a voice conversation with another PC user connected to the Internet. The called party contributes to the cost of the conversation by paying for his Internet access. In the case that one or both ends are LAN connected to the Internet by leased lines the call is free of additional charges. All of this is in contrast to the cost of a conventional long distance, possibly international, call.","c) Quality of Service","The voice quality across the Internet is good, but not as good as typical telephone toll quality. In addition, there are significant delays experienced during the conversation. Trying to interrupt a speaker in such an environment is problematic. Delay and quality variations are as much a consequence of distance and available capacity as they are a function of compression, buffering and packetizing time.","Delays in the voice transmission are attributable to several factors. One of the biggest contributors to delays is the sound card used. The first sound cards were half duplex and were designed for playback of recorded audio. Long audio data buffers which helped ensure uninterrupted audio playback introduced real time delays. Sound card based delays are being reduced over time as full duplex cards designed for \u201cspeakerphone\u201d applications are brought to the market.","Other delays are inherent in the access line speeds (typically 14.4-28.8 kbps for dial-up internet access) and in the packet forwarding delays in the Internet. Also there is delay inherent in filling a packet with digitized encoded audio. For example, to fill a packet with 90 ms of digitized audio, the application must wait at least 90 ms to receive the audio to digitize. Shorter packets reduce packet-filling delays, but increase overhead by increasing the packet header to packet payload data ratio. The increased overhead also increases the bandwidth demands for the application, so that an application which uses short packets may not be able to operate on a 14.4 kbps dial-up connection. LAN-based PCs suffer less delay, but everyone is subject to variable delays which can be annoying.","Lastly, there are delays inherent in audio codecs. Codec delays can vary from 5 to 30 ms for encoding or decoding. Despite the higher latencies associated with internet telephony, the price is right , and this form of voice communication appear s to be gaining in popularity.","2. IP Phone as a Commercial Service","IP telephony technology is here whether the established carriers like it or not. Clearly the use of the Internet to provide international voice calls is a potential threat to the traditional International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD) revenue stream. Although it may be several years before there is an appreciable revenue impact, it cannot be stopped, except perhaps within national borders on the basis of regulation. The best defense by the carriers is to offer the service themselves in an industrial strength fashion. To do this requires an improved call setup facility and an interface to the PSTN.","Facilitating PC to PC connections is useful for cases in which the voice conversation needs to be conducted during a simultaneous Internet data packet communication, and the parties don't have access to separate telephone facilities. Dial-up Internet subscribers with only one access circuit might find themselves in that position. Cost considerations may also play a role in dictating the use of PC to PC telephony. The larger use of this technology will occur when the Internet can be used in place of the long distance network to interconnect ordinary telephone hand sets. The number of multi-media Internet connected PCs in the world (estimated at 10 million) is minuscule compared to the number of subscriber lines worldwide (estimated at 660 million). This service is in the planning stages of several companies.","In the sections below we look at each of the end point combinations possible in a full Internet telephony service. The most important aspects relate to the PSTN to Internet gateway capabilities. Of particular interest is the possibility of providing the PSTN caller with one-step dialing to his called party. The one-step dialing solutions discussed below are in the context of the North American numbering plan. There are essentially four cases:\n\n","a) PCtoPC","(1) Directory Service","To facilitate PC to PC Internet Telephony a directory service is needed to find the IP address of the called party based on a name presented by the calling party Early internet telephony software utilized a modified internet chat server as a meeting place. More recently, internet telephony software is replacing the chat server with a directory service which will uniquely identify internet telephone users (perhaps by email address). To receive calls, customers would register with the directory service (for a fee, with recurring charges) and would make their location (IP address) known to the directory system whenever they connect to the Internet and want to be available for calls. The best way to accomplish automatic notification is to get agreement between the vendors of IP phone software on a protocol to notify the directory service whenever the software is started (automatic presence notification). It would also be desirable, as an option, to find a way to automatically invoke the IP phone software when the IP stack is started.","The directory service is envisioned as a distributed system, somewhat like the Internet Domain Name System, for scalability. This is not to imply, necessarily, the user@gfoo.com format for user identification.","Theoretically only the called parties need to be registered. If the calling party is not registered, then the charge for the call (if there is one) could be made to the called party (a collect call). Alternatively, we can insist that the caller also be registered in the directory and billed through that mechanism (this is desirable since we charge for the registration and avoid the complications that collect calls require). A charge for the call setup is billed, but not for the duration, over and above the usual Internet charges. Duration charges already apply to the dial up Internet user and Internet usage charges, both for dial up and dedicated usage, are probably not too far away.","Collect calls from a registered user may be required to meet market demand. A scheme for identifying such calls to the called party must be devised, along with a mechanism for the called party to accept or reject the collect call. The directory service will track the ability of the called software to support this feature by version number (or, alternatively, this could be a matter for online negotiation between the IP telephony software packages).","In the event of collect calls (assuming the caller is not registered), the caller could claim to be anyone she chooses. The directory service will force the caller to take on a temporary \u2018assigned\u2019 identity (for the duration of the call) so the called party will know this is an unverified caller. Since IP addresses are not necessarily fixed, one cannot rely on them to identify parties.","(2) Interoperability","Nearly all IP phone software packages on the market today use different voice encoding and protocols to exchange the voice information. To facilitate useful connections the directory will store the type and version (and possibly options) of Internet phone software being used. To make this work effectively software vendors will report this information automatically to the directory service. This information will be used to determine interoperability when a call is placed. If the parties cannot interoperate, an appropriate message must be sent to the caller. As an alternative, or in addition to registration of software type, a negotiation protocol could be devised to determine interoperability on the fly, but all packages would have to \u201cspeak\u201d it.","There is a question of whether translations between IP phone encoding can be performed with acceptable quality to the end user. Such a service could have a duration and or volume fee associated with it, which might limit the desirability of its use. Also, after a shake out period we expect only a few different schemes to exist and they will have interoperability, perhaps through an industry agreed lowest common denominator compression and signaling protocol. So far, all the IP phone software vendors we have contacted are in favor of an Esperanto that will permit interoperability. If this comes to pass the life span of the translation services will be short, probably making them not economically attractive.","We can help the major software vendors seek consensus on a \u201ccommon\u201d compression scheme and signaling protocol that will provide the needed interoperability. Once the major vendors support this method the others will follow. This is already happening, with the recent announcements from Intel, Microsoft, Netscape, and VocalTec that they will all support the H.323 standard in coming months. This can be automatically detected at call setup time. The directory service would keep track of which versions of which software can interoperate. To facilitate this functionality the automatic notification of presence should include the current software version. This way upgrades can be dynamically noted in the directory service. Some scheme must also be defined to allow registration information to be passed between software packages so if a user switches packages she is able to move the registration information to the new application. There is no reason to object if the user has two applications each with the same registration information. The directory service will know what the user is currently running as part of the automatic presence notification. This will cause a problem only if the user can run more than one IP phone package at the same time. If the market requires this ability the directory service could be adapted to deal with it. The problem could also be overcome through the use of negotiation methods between interacting IP phone software packages.","(3) Call Progress Signaling","If the user is reachable through the directory system, but is currently engaged in a voice connection, then a call waiting message (with caller ID, something which is not available in the PSTN call waiting service) is sent to the called party and a corresponding message is sent back to the caller.","If the user is reachable through the directory system, but is currently not running his voice software (IP address responds, but not the application\u2014see below for verification that this is the party in question) then an appropriate message is returned to the caller. (As an option an email could be sent to the called party to alert him to the call attempt. An additional option would be to allow the caller to enter a voice message and attach the \u201cvoice mail\u201d to the email. The service could also signal the caller to indicate: busy, unreachable, active but ignored call waiting, etc. Other notification methods to the called party can also be offered, such as FAX or paging. In each case, the notification can include the caller's identity, when known.) Once the directory system is distributed it will be necessary to query the other copies if contact cannot be made based on local information. This system provides the ability to have various forms of notification, and to control the parameters of those forms.","(4) Party Identification","A critical question is how will the directory service know that a called party is no longer where she was last reported (i.e., has \u201cgone away\u201d). The dialed in party might drop off the network in a variety of ways (dialed line dropped, PC hung, Terminal Server crashed) without the ability to explicitly inform the directory service of his change in status. Worse yet, the user might have left the network and another user with a voice application might be assigned the same IP address. (This is OK if the new caller is a registered user with automatic presence notification; the directory service could then detect the duplicate IP address. There may still be some timing problems between distributed parts of the directory service.) Therefore, some scheme must exist for the directory service to determine that the customer is still at the last announced location.","One approach to this is to implement a shared secret with the application, created at registration time. Whenever the directory system is contacted by the software (such as automatic presence notification or call initialization) or attempts to contact the called party at the last known location, it can send a challenge (like CHAP) to the application and verify the response. Such a scheme eliminates the need for announcing \u201cI am no longer here\u201d, or wasteful keep alive messages. A customer can disconnect or turn off his IP phone application at any time without concern for notification to the directory system. If multiple IP phone applications are supported, by the directory service, each may do the challenge differently.","(5) Other Services","Encrypted internet telephone conversations will require a consensus from the software vendors to minimize the number of encryption setup mechanisms. This will be another interoperability resolution function for the directory service. The directory service can provide support for public key applications and can provide public key certificates issued by suitable certificate authorities.","The user can also specify on the directory service, that his PC be called (dial out) if she is not currently on-line. Charges for the dial out can be billed to the called party, just as would happen for call forwarding in POTS. The call detail record (CDR) for the dial out needs to be associated with the call detail of an entity in the IP Phone system (the called party). Note that this is different than the PC to PSTN case in that no translation of IP encoded voice to PCM is required, indeed the dial out will use TCP\/IP over PPP. If the dial out fails an appropriate message is sent back.","The dial out could be domestic or international. It is unlikely that the international case will exist in practice due to the cost. However, there is nothing to preclude that case and it requires no additional functionality to perform.","b) PC to PSTN","The PSTN to Internet gateway must support translating PCM to multiple encoding schemes to interact with software from various vendors. Alternatively the common compression scheme could be used once it is implemented. Where possible, the best scheme, from a quality stand point, should be used. In many cases it will the software vendor's proprietary version. To accomplish that, telcos will need to license the technology from selected vendors. Some vendors will do the work needed to make their scheme work on telco platforms.","(1) Domestic PSTN Destination","The PC caller needs to be registered to place calls to the PSTN. The only exception to this would be if collect calls from the Internet are to be allowed. This will add complications with respect to billing. To call a PSTN destination the PC caller specifies a domestic E.164 address. The directory system maps that address to an Internet dial out unit based on the NPA-NXX. The expectation is that the dial out unit will be close to the destination and therefore will be a local call. One problem is how to handle the case where there is no \u201clocal\u201d dial out unit. Another problem is what to do if the \u201clocal\u201d out dial unit is full or otherwise not available.","Three approaches are possible. One approach is to offer the dial out service only when local calls are possible. A second approach is to send a message back to the caller to inform him that a long distance call must be placed on his behalf and request permission to incur these charges. A third approach is to place the call regardless and with no notification. Each of these cases requires a way to correlate the cost of the dial out call (PSTN CDR) with the billing record of the call originator (via the directory service).","The third approach will probably add to the customer support load and result in unhappy customers. The first approach is simple but restrictive. Most users are expected to be very cost conscious, and so might be satisfied with approach one. Approach two affords flexibility for the times the customer wants to proceed anyway, but it adds complexity to the operation. A possible compromise is to use approach one, which will reject the call for the reason that no local out dial is available. We could also add an attribute in the call request that means \u201cI don't care if this ends up as a long distance call.\u201d In this case the caller who was rejected, but wants to place the call anyway makes a second call attempt with this attribute set. For customers with money to spare, all PSTN calls could be made with that attribute set.","Placing domestic PSTN calls supports the international calling requirement for Internet originated calls from Internet locations outside the US.","(2) International PSTN Destinations","Calls to an international PSTN station can be done in one of two ways. First, an international call could be placed from a domestic dial out station. This is not an attractive service since it saves no money over the customer making an international telephone call himself. Second, the Internet can be used to carry the call to the destination country and a \u201clocal\u201d dial out can be made there. This situation is problematic for it must be agreed to by the carrier at the international destination. This case may be viable in one of two ways. Both ways require a partner at the international destination. One option would be to use a local carrier in the destination country as the partner. A second option would be to use an Internet service provider, or some other service provider connected to the Internet in the destination country.","c) PSTN to PC","This case appears to be of least interest, although it has some application and is presented here for completeness.","As noted in the PC to PSTN case the PSTN to Internet gateway will need to support translating PCM to multiple encoding schemes to interwork with software from various vendors. The directory service is required to identify the called PC. Automatic notification of presence is important to keep the called party reachable. The PSTN caller need not be registered with the directory service, for caller billing will be based on PSTN information. The caller has an E.164 address that is \u201cconstant\u201d and can be used to return calls as well as to do billing. Presumably we can deliver the calling number to the called party as an indication of who is calling. The calling number will not always be available, for technological or privacy reasons. It must be possible to signal the PC software that this is a PSTN call and provide the E.164 number or indicate that it is unavailable.","The service can be based on charging the calling phone. This can be done as if the Internet were the long distance portion of the call. This is possible with a second dial tone. If an 800 or local dial service is used it is necessary for the caller to enter billing information. Alternatively a 900 service will allow PSTN caller-based billing. In either case the caller will need to specify the destination \u201cphone number\u201d after the billing information or after dialing the 900 number.","A major open issue is how the caller will specify the destination at the second dial tone. Only touch tones are available at best. To simplify entry we could assign an E.164 address to each directory entry. To avoid confusion with real phone numbers (the PSTN to PSTN case) the numbers need to be under directory control. Perhaps 700 numbers could be used, if there are enough available. Alternatively a special area code could be used. Spelling using the touch tone PAD is a less \u201cuser friendly\u201d approach.","3. Phone Numbers in the Internet","The best approach is to have an area code assigned. Not only will this keep future options open, but it allows for simpler dialing from day one. Given a legitimate area code the PSTN caller can directly dial the E.164 address of the PC on the Internet. The telephone system will route the call to an MCI POP where it will be further routed to a PSTN-to-Internet voice gateway. The called number will be used to place the call to the PC, assuming it is on-line and reachable. This allows the PSTN caller to dial the Internet as if it were part of the PSTN. No second dial tone is required and no billing information needs to be entered. The call will be billed to the calling PSTN station, and charges will accrue only if the destination PC answers. Other carriers would be assigned unique area codes and directories should be kept compatible.","For domestically originated calls, all of the billing information needed to bill the caller is available and the intelligent network service functionality for third party or other billing methods is available via the second dial tone.","4. Other Internet Telephony Carriers","All this will get more complicated when number portability becomes required. It may be desirable to assign a country code to the Internet. Although this would make domestic dialing more complex (it appears that dialing anything other than 1 plus a ten digit number significantly reduces the use of the service) it may have some desirable benefits. In any event the assignment of an area code (or several) and the assignment of a country code are not mutually exclusive. The use of a country code would make dialing more geographically uniform.","5. International Access","It is unlikely that an international call will be made to the US to enter the Internet in the US. If it happens, however, the system will have enough information to do the caller-based billing for this case without any additional functionality.","Another possibility is that we will (possibly in partnership) set up to handle incoming calls outside the US and enter the Internet in that country to return to the US, or go anywhere else on the Internet. If the partner is a local carrier, then the partner will have the information needed for billing the PSTN caller.","a) Collect Calls","PSTN to PC collect calls require several steps. First, the call to the PSTN to Internet gateway must be collect. The collect call could then be signaled in the same way as PC to PC calls. It will be necessary to indicate that the caller is PSTN based and include the calling E.164 address if it is available.","b) PSTN to PSTN","The choice of voice compression and protocol scheme for passing voice between PSTN to Internet gateways is entirely under the carrier's control. Various service levels could be offered by varying the compression levels offered. Different charges could associated with each level. The caller would select a quality level; perhaps by dialing different 800 number services first.","(1) Domestic Destination","Neither the calling nor the called parties need be registered with the directory service to place calls across the Internet. The caller dials a PSTN-to-Internet gateway and receives a second dial tone and specifies, using touch tones, the billing information and the destination domestic E.164 address. 900 service could be used as well. The directory service (this could be separate system, but the directory service already has mapping functionality to handle the PC to PSTN dial out case) will be used to map the call to an out dialer to place a local call, if possible. Billing is to the caller and the call detail of the out dial call needs to be associated with the call detail of the inbound caller.","An immediate question is how to deal with the case where the nearest dial out unit to the number called results in a long distance or toll call, as discussed in PC to PSTN case. The situation here is different to the extent that notification must be by voice, and authorization to dQ a long distance, or toll call dial out must be made by touch tones. In the event of a long distance dial out the Internet could be skipped altogether and the call could go entirely over the PSTN. It is not clear that there is any cost savings by using the Internet in this case.","(2) One Step Dialing","The problem is that the destination PSTN number needs to be entered and, somehow, it needs to be indicated that the destination is to be reached via the Internet rather than the conventional long distance network.","This selection criteria can be conveyed according to the following alternatives:\n\n","The first method has the draw back that the caller must dial an extra five digits. Although many will do this to save money, requiring any extra dialing will reduce the total number of users of the service. The second method avoids the need to dial extra digits, but requires a commitment by the subscriber to predominately use the Internet as his long distance network. The choice is a lower price with a lower quality of service.","In the PSTN to PSTN case it is possible to consider offering several grades of service at varying prices. These grades will be based on a combination of the encoding scheme and the amount of compression (bandwidth) applied, and will offer lower cost for lower bandwidth utilization.","To signal the grade of service desired three 10XXX codes could be used. By subscription a particular grade would be the default and other service grades would be selected by a 10XXX code.","(3) Service Quality","The service quality will be measured by two major factors. First, sound quality, the ability to recognize the caller's voice, and second by the delays that are not present in the PSTN.","On the first point we can say that most of the offerings available today provide an acceptable level of caller recognition. Delay, however, is another story. PC to PC users experience delays of a half second to two seconds. As noted in the introduction much of the delay can be attributed to the sound cards and the low speed dial access. In the case of PSTN to PSTN service both these factors are removed.","The use of DSPs in the PSTN to Internet voice gateway will keep compression and protocol processing times very low. The access to the gateway will be at a full 64 kbps on the PSTN side and likely Ethernet on the Internet side. Gateways will typically be located close to the backbone so the router on the Ethernet will likely be connected to the backbone by a T3 line. This combination should provide a level of service with very low delays. Some buffering will be needed to mask the variable delays in the backbone, but that can likely be kept to under a quarter of a second in the domestic carrier backbone.","The main differentiation of quality of service will be voice recognition which will be related to bandwidth usage. If needed, the proposed IETF Resource reSerVation setup Protocol (RSVP) can be used to assure lower delay variation, but the need for the added complexity of RSVP is yet to be established. Also, questions remain regarding the scalability of RSVP for large-scale internet telephony.","(4) Costs","An open question is whether using the Internet for long distance voice in place of the switched telephone network is actually cheaper. Certainly it is priced that way today, but do current prices reflect real costs? Routers are certainly cheaper than telephone switches, and the 10 kbps (or so) that the IP voice software uses (essentially half duplex) is certainly less than the dedicated 128 kbps of a full duplex 64 kbps DS0. Despite these comparisons the question remains.","Although routers are much cheaper than telephone switches, they have much less capacity. Building large networks with small building blocks gets not only expensive, but quickly reaches points of diminishing returns. We already have seen the Internet backbone get overloaded with the current crop of high end routers, and they are yet to experience the significant traffic increase that a successful Internet Telephony offering would bring. We are saying two things here.","1. It is unlikely that the current Internet backbone can support a major traffic increase associated with a successful internet telephony service. We need to wait for the technology of routers to improve.","2. The second issue raised above was that of bandwidth usage. Indeed 10 kbps half duplex (a little more when both parties occasionally speak at the same time, but much less during periods of silence) is considerably less than 64 kbps full duplex dedicated capacity. Two points should be noted on this argument.","First, bandwidth is cheap, at least, when there is spare fiber in the ground. Once the last strand is used the next bit per second is very expensive. Second, on transoceanic routes, where bandwidth is much more expensive, we are already doing bandwidth compression of voice to 9.6 kbps. This is essentially equivalent to the 10 kbps of Internet Telephony.","Why is IP capacity priced so much cheaper than POTS? The answer is that the pricing difference is partly related to the subsidized history of the Internet. There is a process in motion today, by the Internet backbone providers, to address some of the cost issues of the Internet. The essence of the process is the recognition that the Internet requires a usage charge. Such charges already apply to some dial up users, but typically do not apply to users with dedicated connections.","If PC to PC Internet Telephony becomes popular, users will tend to keep their PCs connected for long periods. This will make them available to receive calls. It will also drive up hold times on dial in ports. This will have a significant effect on the capital and recurring costs of the Internet.","(5) Charges","A directory service must provide the functions described above and collect enough information to bill for the service. A charge can be made for directory service as well as for registration (a one time fee plus a monthly fee), call setup, but probably not for duration. Duration is already charged for the Internet dial in user and is somewhat bundled for the LAN-attached user. Usage charges for Internet service may be coming soon (as discussed above). Duration charges are possible for the incoming and outgoing PSTN segments.","Incoming PSTN calls may be charged as the long distance segment by using a special area code. Other direct billing options are 900 calls and calling card (or credit card) billing options (both require a second dial tone).","Requiring all callers (except incoming PSTN calls) to be registered with the directory service will eliminate the immediate need for most collect calling. This will probably not be a great impediment since most users of the IP Phone service will want to receive as well as originate calls, and registration is required for receiving calls. Callers could have unlisted entries which would be entries with an E.164 address, but no name. People given this E.164 address could call the party (from the PSTN or from a PC), as is the case in the present phone system.","Different compression levels can be used to provide different quality of voice reproduction and at the same time use more or less Internet transit resources. For PC to PC connections the software packages at both ends can negotiate the amount of bandwidth to be used. This negotiation might be facilitated through the directory service.","(6) Technical Issues","It will be necessary to coordinate with IP Phone vendors to implement the registration, automatic presence notification, and verification capabilities. We will also need to add the ability to communicate service requests. These will include authorization for collect calls specifying attributes such as \u201cplace a dial out call to the PSTN even if it is long distance\u201d and others to be determined.","Registration with a directory is a required feature that will be illuminated below. Using the DNS model for the distributed directory service will likely facilitate this future requirement. Assignment of a pseudo E.164 number to directory entries will work best if a real area code is used. If each carrier has an area code it will make interworking between the directory systems much easier. An obvious complication will arise when number portability becomes required.","IP Telephony, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, is here and will stay for at least the near future. A combination of a carrier level service, based on this technology, and a growth in the capacity of routers may lead to the Internet carrying a very significant percentage of future long distance traffic.","The availability of higher speed Internet access from homes, such as cable modems, will make good quality consumer IP Telephony service more easily attained. The addition of video will further advance the desirability of the service.","More mundane, but of interest, is FAX services across the Internet. This is very similar to the voice service discussed above. Timing issues related to FAX protocols make this a more difficult offering in some ways.","Conferencing using digital bridges in the Internet make voice and video services even more attractive. This can be done by taking advantage of the multi-casting technology developed in the Internet world. With multi-casting the cost of providing such services will be reduced.","C.

The switch  is simplified to show it operating on a single DS1 line, but it will be understood that switching among many lines actually occurs so that calls on thousands of individual subscriber lines can be routed through the switch on their way to ultimate destinations. The DAP  returns a routing response to the originating switch  which instructs the originating switch  to route the call to the destination switch  or .

The card number is validated using a card validation database. Assuming the card number is valid, then if the terminating number is in the US (domestic), then the call would be routed over the current MCI voice lines as it is today. If the terminating number is international, then the call is routed to a CODEC  that converts the voice to TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP and sends it via the LAN  to the internet .

The SPM  is in communication with the service provider's call processing system which determines which of the lines require which type of hybrid switch processing. For example, fax transmissions generate a tone which identifies the transmission as digital data rather than digitized voice. Upon detecting a digital data transmission, the call processing system directs the call circuitry to allow the particular input line to connect through the pooled switch matrix to a corresponding line with the appropriate processing characteristics.

To establish this connection, the user of the PC dials the VNET number (or other unique LD such as name, employee ID, etc). Once the telephony software package has identified this call as a VNET type call , it will send a translation request to the directory service. At a minimum, this translation request will contain the following information:\n\n","2.

VNET PC to PC Call Flow Description","The user for PC12  connects the computer to an Internet Protocol (IP) network , turns on the computer and starts an IP telephony software protocol system. The system software transmits a message to a directory service  to register the computer as \u201con-line\u201d and available to receive calls. This message contains IP address identifying the connection that is being used to connect this computer to the network. This address may be used by other IP telephony software packages to establish a connection to this computer. The address comprises an identification of the computer or virtual private network number that may be used to address this computer . In this VNET scenario, the address is a VNET number assigned to the individual using this PC. VNET refers to a virtual network in which a particular set of telephone numbers is supported as a private network of numbers that can exchange calls. Many corporations currently buy communication time on a trunk that is utilized as a private communication channel for placing and receiving inter-company calls. The address may also be some identification such as name, employee id, or any other unique ID.","The message may contain additional information regarding the specifics of the system software or the hardware configuration of PC11  utilized for IP telephony. As an example, it is important for a calling PC to know what type of compression algorithms are supported and active in the current communication, or other capabilities of the software or hardware that might affect the ability of other users to connect or use special feature during a connection.","6. Determining best choice for Internet client selection of an Internet Telephony Gateway server on the Internet:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0941","num":"1929"},"figref":"FIG. 10B","b":["1080","1084"]},"If the client  needs to place a telephone call to a regular PSTN phone, and PSTN network usage is determined to be less expensive or higher quality than Internet network usage, it is the preferred choice to select a gateway that allows the client to access the PSTN network from a point \u201cclosest\u201d to the point of internet access. This is often referred to as Head-End Hop-Off (HEHO), where the client hops off the internet at the \u201chead end\u201d or \u201cnear end\u201d of the internet.","If the client  needs to place a telephone call to a regular PSTN phone, and the PSTN network is determined to be more expensive than Internet network usage, it is the preferred choice to select a gateway that allows the client to access the PSTN from the Internet at a point closest to the destination telephone. This is often referred to as Tail-End Hop-Off (TEHO), where the client hops off the internet at the \u201ctail end\u201d or \u201cfar end\u201d of the internet.","a) Head-End Hop-Off Methods","(1) Client Ping Method","This method selects the best choice for a head-end hop-off internet telephony gateway by obtaining a list of candidate internet telephony gateway addresses, and pinging each to determine the best choice in terms of latency and number of router hops. The process is as follows:\n\n","The Client Computer  issues the following three commands simultaneously:\n\n","The results of the ping commands are as follows:\n\n","(2) Access Device Location Method","The method for identifying the most appropriate choice for an Internet Telephony Gateway utilizes a combination of the Client Ping Method detailed above, and the knowledge of the location from which the Client Computer  accessed the Internet. This method may work well for clients accessing the Internet via a dial-up access device.","A client computer  dials the Internet Access Device. The Access Device answers the call and plays modem tone. Then, the client computer and the access device establishes a PPP session. The user on the Client Computer is authenticated (username\/password prompt, validated by an authentication server). Once the user passes authentication, the Access Device can automatically update the User Profile in the Directory Service for the user who was authenticated, depositing the following information\n\n","Later, when the Client Computer requires access through an Internet Telephony Gateway, it queries the Directory Service  to determine the best choice of Internet Telephony Gateway. If an Access Device Site Code is found in the User's Profile on the Directory Service, the Directory Service  selects the Internet Telephony Gateway ,  and  at the same site code, and returns the IP address to the Client Computer . If an Internet Telephony Gateway ,  and  is unavailable at the same site as the Access Device Site Code, then the next best choice is selected according to a network topology map kept on the directory server.","If no Access Device Site Code is found on the directory server , then the client  has accessed the network through a device which cannot update the directory server . If this is the case, the Client Ping Method described above is used to locate the best alternative internet telephony gateway .","(3) User Profile Method","Another method for selection of an Internet Telephony Gateway ,  and  is to embed the information needed to select a gateway in the user profile as stored on a directory server. To use this method, the user must execute an internet telephony software package on the client computer. The first time the package is executed, registration information is gathered from the user, including name, email address, IP Address (for fixed location computers), site code, account code, usual internet access point, and other relevant information. Once this information is entered by the user, the software package deposits the information on a directory server, within the user's profile.","Whenever the Internet Telephony software package is started by the user, the IP address of the user is automatically updated at the directory service. This is known as automated presence notification. Later, when the user needs an Internet Telephony Gateway service, the user queries the directory service for an Internet Telephony Gateway to use. The directory service knows the IP address of the user and the user's usual site and access point into the network. The directory service can use this information, plus the network map of all Internet Telephony Gateways ,  and , to select the best Internet Telephony Gateway for the client computer to use.","(4) Gateway Ping Method","The last method selects the best choice for a head-end hop-off internet telephony gateway by obtaining a list of candidate internet telephony gateway addresses, and pinging each to determine the best choice in terms of latency and number of router hops. The process is as follows:\n\n","b) Tail-End Hop-Off Methods","Tail-End Hop-Off entails selecting a gateway as an egress point from the internet where the egress point is closest to the terminating PSTN location as possible. This is usually desired to avoid higher PSTN calling rates. The internet can be used to bring the packetized voice to the local calling area of the destination telephone number, where lower local rates can be paid to carry the call on the PSTN.","(1) Gateway Registration","One method for Tail-End Hop-Off service is to have Internet Telephony Gateways ,  and  register with a directory service. Each Internet Telephony Gateway will have a profile in the directory service which lists the calling areas it serves. These can be listed in terms of Country Code, Area Code, Exchange, City Code, Line Code, Wireless Cell, LATA, or any other method which can be used to subset a numbering plan. The gateway, upon startup, sends a TCP\/IP registration message to the Directory Service  to list the areas it serves.","When a Client Computer wishes to use a TEHO service, it queries the directory service for an Internet Telephony Gateway  serving the desired destination phone number. The directory service  looks for a qualifying Internet Telephony Gateway, and if it finds one, returns the IP address of the gateway to use. Load-balancing algorithms can be used to balance traffic across multiple Internet Telephony Gateways ,  and  serving the same destination phone number.","If no Internet Telephony Gateways ,  and  specifically serve the calling area of the given destination telephone number, the directory service  returns an error TCP\/IP message to the Client Computer . The Client  then has the option of querying the Directory Service for any Internet Telephony Gateway, not just gateways serving a particular destination telephone number.","As a refinement of this Gateway Registration scheme, Gateways can register calling rates provided for all calling areas. For example, if no gateway is available in Seattle, it may be less expensive to call Seattle from the gateway in Los Angeles, than to call Seattle from the gateway in Portland. The rates registered in the directory service can enable the directory service the lowest cost gateway to use for any particular call.","7.

TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK MANAGEMENT","A preferred embodiment utilizes a network management system for a telecommunication network for analyzing, correlating, and presenting network events. Modern telecommunications networks utilize data signaling networks, which are distinct from the call-bearing networks, to carry the signaling data that are required for call setup, processing, and clearing. These signaling networks use an industry-standard architecture and protocol, collectively referred to as Common Channel Signaling System #7, or Signaling System #7 (SS7) for short. SS7 is a significant advancement over the previous signaling method, in which call signaling data were transmitted over the same circuits as the call. SS7 provides a distinct and dedicated network of circuits for transmitting call signaling data. Utilizing SS7 decreases the call setup time (perceived by the caller as post-dial delay) and increases capacity on the call-bearing network. A detailed description of SS7 signaling is provided in Signaling System #7, , Mcgraw Hill (1995).","The standards for SS7 networks are established by ANSI for domestic (U.S.) networks, by ITU for international connections, and are referred to as ANSI SS7 and ITU C7, respectively. A typical SS7 network is illustrated in  call-bearing telecommunications network makes use of matrix switches \/for switching customer traffic. These switches \/are conventional, such as a DMS-250 manufactured by Northern Telecom or a DEX-600 manufactured by Digital Switch Corporation. These switches \/are interconnected with voice-grade and data-grade call-bearing trunks. This interconnectivity, which is not illustrated in , may take on a large variety of configurations.","Switches in telecommunications networks perform multiple functions. In addition to switching circuits for voice calls, switches must relay signaling messages to other switches as part of call control. These signaling messages are delivered through a network of computers, each of which is called a Signaling Point (SP) \/. There are three kinds of SPs in an SS network:\n\n","The SS7 links that connect the various elements are identified as follows:\n\n","To interface two different carriers' networks, such as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) network with an Interchange Carrier (IXC) network, STP clusters  from each carriers' network may be connected by D links or A links. SS7 provides standardized protocol for such an interface so that the signaling for a call that is being passed between an LEC and an IXC may also be transmitted.","When a switch receives and routes a customer call, the signaling for that call is received (or generated) by the attached SSP . While intermachine trunks that connect the switches carry the customer's call, the signaling for that call is sent to an STP . The STP  routes the signal to either the SSP  for the call-terminating switch, or to another STP  that will then route the signal to the SSP  for the call-terminating switch. Another element of an SS7 network are Protocol Monitoring Units (PMU) , shown in FIG. . PMUs  are deployed at switch sites and provide an independent monitoring tool for SS7 networks. These devices, such as those manufactured by INET Inc. of Richardson, TX., monitor the A, E, and F links of the SS7 network, as shown in FIG. . They generate fault and performance information for SS7 links.","As with any telecommunications network, an SS7 network is vulnerable to fiber cuts, other transmission outages, and device failures. Since an SS network carries all signaling required to deliver customer traffic, it is vital that any problems are detected and corrected quickly. Therefore, there is an essential need for a system that can monitor SS7 networks, analyze fault and performance information, and manage corrective actions.","Prior art SS7 network management systems, while performing these basic functions, have several shortcomings. Many require manual configuration of network topology, which is vulnerable to human error and delay topology updates. Configuration of these systems usually requires that the system be down for a period of time. Many systems available in the industry are intended for a particular vendor's PMU , and actually obtain topology data from their PMUs , thereby neglecting network elements not connected to a PMU  and other vendors' equipment.","Because prior art systems only operate with data received from proprietary PMUs , they do not provide correlation between PMU events and events generated from other types of SS7 network elements. They also provide inflexible and proprietary analysis rules for event correlation.","A system and method for providing enhanced SS7 network management functions are provided by a distributed client\/server platform that can receive and process events that are generated by various SS7 network elements. Each network event is parsed and standardized to allow for the processing of events generated by any type of element. Events can also be received by network topology databases, transmission network management systems, network maintenance schedules, and system users. Referring to , the systems architecture of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, referred to as an SS7 Network Management System (SNMS), is illustrated. SNMS consists of four logical servers \/\/\/ and a plurality of client workstations \/\/connected via a Network Management Wide Area Network (WAN) . The four logical SNMS servers \/\/\/ may all reside on a single or a plurality of physical units. In the preferred embodiment, each logical server resides on a distinct physical unit, for the purpose of enhancing performance. These physical units may be of any conventional type, such as IBM RS6000 units running with AIX operating system.","The client workstations  may be any conventional PC running with Microsoft Windows or IBM OS\/2 operating systems, a dumb terminal, or a VAX VMS workstation. In actuality, client workstations may be any PC or terminal that has an Internet Protocol (IP) address, is running with X-Windows software, and is connected to the WAN . No SNMS-specific software runs on the client workstations .","SNMS receives events from various SS7 network elements and other network management systems (NMS) . It also receives network topology, configuration, and maintenance data from various external systems, as will be described. The various network elements that generate events include Network Controllers , International and Domestic SPs \/, STPs , and PMUs . Network Controllers  are devices that switch circuits based on external commands. They utilize SS signaling in the same manner as an SSP , but are not linked to any STPs . International SPs  support switches that serve as a gateway between a domestic and international telecommunications network. The STPs  may be domestic or international.","The PMUs  scan all the SS packets that pass across the SS7 circuits, analyze for fault conditions, and generate network events that are then passed onto SNMS. The PMUs  also generate periodic statistics on the performance of the SS7 circuits that are monitored.","All SPs \/, STPs , PMU , and SS Network Controllers  transmit network events to SNMS via communications networks. This eliminates the need for SNMS to maintain a session with each of the devices. In one typical embodiment, as illustrated in , an Asynchronous Data Communications Network  is used to transport events from Network Controllers  and International SPs . An IBM mainframe Front End Processor (FEP) , such as IBM's 3708, is used to convert the asynchronous protocol to SNA so it can be received by a IBM mainframe-based Switched Host Interface Facilities Transport (SWIFT) system . SWIFT  is a communications interface and data distribution application that maintains a logical communications session with each of the network elements.","In this same embodiment, an X.25 Operational Systems Support (OSS) Network  is used to transport events from STPs , SPs , and PMUs . These events are received by a Local Support Element (LSE) system . The LSE , which may be a VAX\/VMS system, is essentially a Packet Assembler\/Disassembler (PAD) and protocol converter used to convert event data from the X.25 OSS Network  to the SNMS servers \/. It also serves the same function as SWIFT  in maintaining communication sessions with each network element, thus eliminating the need for SNMS to do so. The need for both SWIFT  and LSE  illustrates one embodiment of a typical telecommunications network in which different types of elements are in place requiring different transport mechanisms. SNMS supports all these types of elements.","All network events are input to the SNMS Alarming Server  for analysis and correlation. Some events are also input to the SNMS Reporting Server  to be stored for historical purposes. A Control system , which may be a VAX\/VMS system, is used to collect topology and configuration data from each of the network elements via the X.25 OSS Network . Some elements, such as STPs  and SPs , may send this data directly over the X.25 OSS Network . Elements such as the International SSP , which only communicates in asynchronous mode, use a Packet Assembler\/Disassembler (PAD)  to connect to the X.25 OSS Network . The Control system  then feeds this topology and configuration data to the SNMS Topology Server .","Network topology information is used by SNMS to perform alarm correlation and to provide graphical displays. Most topology information is received from Network Topology Databases , which are created and maintained by order entry systems and network engineering systems in the preferred embodiment. Topology data is input to the SNMS Topology Server  from both the Network Topology Databases  and the Control System . An ability to enter manual overrides through use of a PC  is also provided to the SNMS Topology Server .","The SNMS Alarming Server  also receives events, in particular DS-3 transmission alarms, from other network management systems (NMS) . Using topology data, SNMS will correlate these events with events received from SS7 network elements. The SNMS Alarming Server  also receives network maintenance schedule information from a Network Maintenance Schedule system . SNMS uses this information to account for planned network outages due to maintenance, thus eliminating the need to respond to maintenance-generated alarms. SNMS also uses this information to proactively warn maintenance personnel of a network outage that may impact a scheduled maintenance activity.","The SNMS Alarming Server  has an interface with a Trouble Management System . This allows SNMS users at the client workstations  to submit trouble tickets for SNMS-generated alarms. This interface, as opposed to using an SNMS-internal trouble management system, can be configured to utilize many different types of trouble management systems. In the preferred embodiment, the SNMS Graphics Server  supports all client workstations  at a single site, and are therefore a plurality of servers. The geographical distribution of SNMS Graphics Servers  eliminates the need to transmit volumes of data that support graphical presentation to each workstation site from a central location. Only data from the Alarming Server , Reporting Server , and Topology Server  are transmitted to workstation sites, thereby saving network transmission bandwidth and improving SNMS performance. In alternative embodiments, the Graphics Servers  may be centrally located.","Referring now to , a high-level process flowchart illustrates the logical system components of SNMS. At the heart of the process is Process Events . This component serves as a traffic cop for SNMS processes. Process Events , which runs primarily on the SNMS Alarming Server , is responsible for receiving events from other SNMS components, processing these events, storing events, and feeding processed event data to the Reporting and Display components. The Process Events process  is shown in greater detail in FIG. .","The Receive Network Events component , which runs primarily on the Alarming Server , receives network events from the various SS network elements (STPs , SPs , PMUs , etc.) via systems such as SWIFT  and LSE . This component parses the events and sends them to Process Events  for analysis. The Receive Network Events process  is shown in greater detail in FIG. .","The Process Topology component , which runs primarily on the Topology Server , receives network topology and configuration data from the Network Topology Databases , from the SS7 network elements via the Control System , and from Manual Overrides . This data is used to correlate network events and to perform impact assessments on such events. It is also used to provide graphical presentation of events. Process Topology  parses these topology and configuration data, stores them, and sends them to Process Events  for analysis. The Process Topology process  is shown in greater detail in FIG. .","The Define Algorithms component , which runs primarily on the Alarming Server , defines the specific parsing and analysis rules to be used by SNMS. These rules are then loaded into Process Events  for use in parsing and analysis. The algorithms are kept in a software module, and are defined by programmed code. A programmer simply programs the pre-defined algorithm into this software module, which is then used by Process Events . These algorithms are procedural in nature and are based on network topology. They consist of both simple rules that are written in a proprietary language and can be changed dynamically by an SNMS user, and of more complex rules which are programmed within SNMS software code.","The Receive NMS Data component , which runs primarily on the Alarming Server , receives events from other network management systems (NMS) . Such events include DS- transmission alarms. It also receives network maintenance events from a Network Maintenance Schedule system . It then parses these events and sends them to Process Events  for analysis. The Display Alarms component , which runs primarily on the Graphics Server  and the Alarming Server , includes the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and associated software which supports topology and alarm presentation, using data supplied by Process Events . It also supports user interactions, such as alarm clears, acknowledgments, and trouble ticket submissions. It inputs these interactions to Process Events  for storing and required data updates. The Display Alarms process  is shown in greater detail in FIG. .","The Report On Data component , which runs primarily on the Reporting Server , supports the topology and alarm reporting functions, using data supplied by Process Events . The Report On Data process  is shown in greater detail in FIG. .","Referring now to , the detailed process of the Process Events component  is illustrated. This is the main process of SNMS. It receives generalized events from other SNMS components, parses each event to extract relevant data, and identifies the type of event. If it is an SS7-related event, Process Events  applies a selected algorithm, such as create alarm or correlate to existing alarm.","The first three steps - are an initialization process that is run at the start of each SNMS session. They establish a state from which the system may work. Steps - are then run as a continuous loop.","In step , current topology data is read from a topology data store on the Topology Server . This topology data store is created in the Process Topology process  and input to Process Events , as reflected in FIG. . The topology data that is read has been parsed in Process Topology , so it is read in step  by Process Events  as a standardized event ready for processing.","In step , the algorithms which are created in the Define Algorithms component  are read in. These algorithms determine what actions SNMS will take on each alarm. SNMS has a map of which algorithms to invoke for which type of alarm.","In step , alarms records from the Fault Management (FM) reporting database, which is created in the Report on Data process , are read in. All previous alarms are discarded. Any alarm that is active against a node or circuit that does not exist in the topology (read in step ) is discarded. Also, any alarm that does not map to any existing algorithm (read in step ) is discarded. The alarms are read from the FM reporting database only within initialization. To enhance performance of the system, future alarm records are retrieved from a database internal to the Process Events  component. Step  concludes the initialization process; once current topology, algorithms, and alarms are read, SNMS may begin the continuous process of reading, analyzing, processing, and storing events.","This process begins with step , in which the next event in queue is received and identified. The queue is a First In\/First Out (FIFO) queue that feeds the Process Events component  with network events, topology events, and NMS events. To reiterate, the topology data that are read in step  and the alarm data that are read in step  are initialization data read in at startup to create a system state. In step , ongoing events are read in continuously from process components , , and . These events have already been parsed, and are received as standardized SNMS events. SNMS then identifies the type of event that is being received. If the event is found to be older than a certain threshold, for example one hour, the event is discarded.","In steps , , , and  SNMS determines what to do with the event based on the event type identification made in step .","In step , if the event is determined to be topology data, SNMS updates the GUI displays to reflect the new topology in step . Then in step , SNMS performs a reconciliation with active alarms to discard any alarm not mapping to the new topology. In step , the new topology data is recorded in a topology data store, which is kept in the SNMS Topology Server .","In step , if the event is determined to be NMS data, such as DS- alarms , it is stored in the FM reporting database on the SNMS Reporting Server  for future reference by SNMS rules.","In step , if the event is determined to be a defined SS7 network event, then in step  one or more algorithms will be invoked for the event. Such algorithms may make use of data retrieved from Network Management Systems , Network Maintenance Schedules , and Network Topology .","For example, when each circuit level algorithm generates an alarm, it performs a check against the Network Maintenance Schedule  and NMS  records. Each alarm record is tagged if the specified circuit is within a maintenance window (Network Maintenance Schedule ) or is transported on a DS-3 that has a transmission alarm (NMS ). While SS7 circuits run at a DS-0 level, the Network Topology Databases  provide a DS-3 to DS-0 conversion table. Any DS-0 circuit within the DS-3 is tagged as potentially contained within the transmission fault. Clear records from NMS  will cause active SNMS circuit level alarms to be evaluated so that relevant NMS  associations can be removed. SNMS clear events will clear the actual SNMS alarm. GUI filters allow users to mask out alarms that fit into a maintenance window or contained within a transmission fault since these alarms do not require SNMS operator actions.","In step , active alarms are reconciled with new alarm generations and clears resulting from step . In step , the GUI displays are updated. In step , the new alarm data is stored in the FM reporting database.","In step , the event may be determined to be a timer. SNMS algorithms sometimes need to delay further processing of specific conditions for a defined period of time, such as for persistence and rate algorithms. A delay timer is set for this condition and processing of new SNMS events continues. When the time elapses, SNMS treats the time as an event and performs the appropriate algorithm.","For example, an SS7 link may shut down momentarily with the possibility of functioning again within a few seconds, or it may be down for a much greater period of time due to a serious outage that requires action. SNMS, when it receives this event, will assign a timer of perhaps one minute to the event. If the event clears within one minute, SNMS takes no action on it. However, if after the one minute timer has elapsed the event is unchanged (SS link is still down), SNMS will proceed to take action.","In step , the appropriate algorithm is invoked to take such action. In step , active alarms are reconciled with those that were generated or cleared in step . In step , the GUI displays are updated. In step , the new alarm data is stored in the FM reporting database. As stated previously, SNMS operates in a continuous manner with respect to receiving and processing events. After the data stores in steps , , , and , the process returns to step .","Referring now to , the detailed process of the Receive Network Events component  is illustrated. This component collects events from the SS7 network elements via data transport mechanisms, such as the Async Data Network , SWIFT , X.25 OSS network , and the LSE . These events are received by the SNMS Alarming Server  in a First In\/First Out (FIFO) queue. In steps  and , events from the SS network elements are collected by mainframe applications external to SNMS, such as SWIFT  and LSE , and the protocol of the event data is converted from the network element-specific protocol to SNA or TCP\/IP. In one embodiment, SNMS may also have software running on the mainframe that converts the protocol to that recognizable by the SNMS Alarming Server . The event data is then transmitted via SNA or TCP\/IP to the SNMS","Alarming Server . SNMS maintains a Signaling Event List  of all SS7 event types that is to be processed. In step , SNMS checks the Signaling Event List  and if the current event is found in the list, SNMS traps the event for processing. If the event is not found in the list, SNMS discards it.","In step , the event is parsed according to defined parsing rules . The parsing rules  specify which fields are to be extracted from which types of events, and are programmed into the SNMS code. The parsing of events in step  extracts only those event data fields needed within the alarm algorithms or displays. Also input to step  are scheduled events  from the Network Maintenance Schedule . Scheduled events  are used to identify each network event collected in step  that may be a result of scheduled network maintenance. This allows SNMS operators to account for those SS network outages that are caused by planned maintenance.","In step , the parsed event data is used to create standardized event objects in SNMS resident memory for use by other SNMS processes. Such event objects are read into the main process, Process Events , in step .","Referring now to , the detailed process of the Process Topology component  is illustrated. This process component retrieves network topology and configuration data from three types of sources, creates standardized topology data records, and stores this data for use by other SNMS processes. In particular, it feeds active topology data to Process Events , running on the Alarming Server , in step .","In step , the SNMS Topology server  collects topology data from three different sources. It collects current connectivity and configuration data generated by the SS7 network elements via the Control system . It collects topology data that has been entered into order entry and engineering systems and stored in Network Topology Databases . It also accepts manual overrides  via workstation. The collection of data from the Topology Database  and the Control system  occurs on a periodic basis, and is performed independently of the SNMS Alarming server . Unlike prior art systems that use data retrieved from PMUs , SNMS receives topology data from all types of network elements, including those that are not connected to a PMU  such as that of FIG. . SNMS also uses data reflecting the topology of foreign networks, such as those of a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or an international carrier. This data is used to perform impact assessments that will allow the SNMS user to determine facts such as which end customers may be impacted by an SS7 link outage. The type of topology data collected and used by SNMS, and for example, for the SS7 linkage of an STP  with a Switch\/SSP , data is received by network order entry and engineering systems.

That is, each operator instigates a separate execution of Display Alarms .","When an operator logs on SNMS, the first four steps, -, execute as an initialization. From there, steps - operate as a continuous loop. The initialization provides each operator with a system state from which to work. In step , the current topology is read in and displayed via Graphical User Interface (GUI). Each operator has its own GUI process that is initialized and terminated based upon an operator request. Each GUI process manages its displays independently. Any status change is handled by the individual processes.","In step , a filter that defines the specific operator view is read in. Each operator can define the view that his\/her GUI process will display. Filter parameters include:\n\n","The operator's GUI displays are updated both upon initialization in step  and when filter changes are requested in steps  and . Each specific operator's instance of the Display Alarms  process opens a connection with Process Events  so that only alarm records relevant to the specific operator's filter are transmitted. In step , the specific operator's process registers itself with Process Events  to identify which alarms are to be sent. In step , the GUI display is presented to the operator.","The continuous execution of Display Alarms  begins in step . Each event that is to be retrieved and presented, as defined by the operator filter, is received and identified. In steps , , , , and  SNMS determines what to do with the event based on the event type identification made in step . In steps  and , if the event is determined to be an alarm update or a topology update, the operator's GUI display is updated to reflect this, in steps  and , respectively. Then the next event is received, in step .","In step , if the event is determined to be an operator action, two activities are required. First, in step , the operator's GUI display is updated to reflect the status change. Then, in step , a status change update is sent to the main process, Process Events , so that the status change may be reflected in SNMS records and other GUI processes (for other operators) can receive and react to the status changes.","In step , if the event is determined to be an operator display action, then it is determined if the action is a filter change request or a display request. In step , if it is determined to be a filter change request, then in step  the GUI process registers with Process Events  so that the appropriate alarms records are transmitted. In step , if it is determined to be an operator display request, then in step  the requested display is presented to the operator. Display requests may include:\n\n","In step , if the event is determined to be a termination request, then the specific operator's GUI process is terminated in step . Otherwise, the next event is received in step . Within the Display Alarm process, SNMS provides several unique display windows which support fault isolation, impact assessments, and trouble handling. All of the GUI displays which contain node and circuit symbols are \u201cactive\u201d windows within SNMS (i.e. screens are dynamically updated when alarm status of the node or circuit change). All the displays are possible due to the set of MCI topology sources used within SNMS. SNMS has extensive topology processing of SNMS which is used in operator displays.","A. SNMS Circuits Map","This window displays topology and alarm status information for a selected linkset. As network events are received, SNMS recognizes the relationships between endpoints and isolates the fault by reducing generated alarms. This display allows the operator to monitor a linkset as seen from both sides of the signaling circuit (from the perspective of the nodes).","B. SNM Connections Map","This window presents a cluster view of MCI's signaling network. All MCI and non-MCI nodes connected to the MCI STPs in the cluster are displayed along with the associated linksets. A cluster view is important since a single STP failure\/isolation is not service impacting, but a cluster failure is since all MCI SPs have connectivity to both MCI STPs in the cluster.","C. SNMS Nonadjacent Node Map","This window presents a STP pair view of a selected LEC signaling network. All LEC SPs, STPs, and SCPs (with signaling relationships to the MCI network) connected LEC STP pair are displayed. MCI's area of responsibility does not include the LEC STP to LEC SSP signaling links, so no linksets are displayed here. This display allows the SNMS operator to monitor a LEC signaling network as seen by the MCI nodes.","D. SNMS LATA Connections Map","This window presents a map of all LEC owned nodes that are located within a specified LATA. As well, the MCI STP pair that serves the LATA is also displayed along with the associated linksets (where applicable). This display allows the operator to closely monitor a specific LATA if\/when problems surface within the LATA. LATA problems, while outside MCI's domain of control, can introduce problems within the MCI network since signaling messages are shared between the networks. As well, MCI voice traffic which terminates in the specified LATA can be affected by LATA outages.","E. NPA-NXX Information List","This window presents a list of NPX-NXX's served by a specified LEC switch. This display is very valuable during impact assessment periods (i.e. if the specified LEC switch is isolated, which NPA-NXX's are unavailable).","F. End Office Information List","This window presents a list of LEC end office nodes which are homed to the specific LEC access tandem. This display is very valuable during impact assessment periods (i.e. if the specified LEC tandem switch is isolated, which end offices are unavailable).","G. Trunk Group Information List","This window presents a list of MCI voice trunks, connected to a specified MCI switch, and the LEC end office switches where they terminate. This display is very valuable during impact assessment periods (i.e. what end offices are impacted when a MCI switch is isolated). This display is also available for selected LEC end office switches.","H. Filter Definition Window","The SNMS operator can limited the scope of his displays to:\n\n","I. Trouble Ticket Window","The SNMS operator can open trouble tickets on signaling alarms. These trouble tickets are opened in MCI's trouble ticketing system. Operators can also display the status of existing trouble tickets.","Referring now to , the detailed process of the Report On Data component  is illustrated. This process component, which runs on the Reporting server , stores SNMS-processed data and provides reports.","Standardized Network Element (NE) Event Records  are received with location specific time stamps. In step , the time stamps are converted into Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) so that standardized reports can be produced.","In step , all data received are stored in individual database tables. Data may also be archived for long-term storage to tape or disk. This data includes SNMS-generated alarms , standardized topology records , and performance statistics from PMUs . It may also include non-processed data, such as DS-3 alarms from NMS  and network maintenance schedule data .","In step , reports are produced. These reports may be custom or form reports. They may also be produced on demand, or per a schedule. These reports may be presented in a number of ways, including but not limited to electronic mail , X-terminal displays , and printed reports .","XII. VIDEO TELEPHONY OVER POTS","The next logical step from voice over the POTS is video. Today, computers are capable of making video \u201ccalls\u201d to each other when connected to some type of computer network. However, most people only have access to a computer network by making a call from their modem on the POTS with another modem on a computer connected to a network, so that they can then \u201ccall\u201d another computer on the network, which is in turn connected by a modem to another network computer. It is much simpler (and efficient) to call another person directly on the POTS and have the modems communicate with each other, without network overhead. ITU recommendation H.324 describes terminals for low bitrate (28.8 kbps modem) multimedia communication, utilizing V.34 modems operating over the POTS. H.324 terminals may carry real-time voice, data, and video, or any combination, including video telephony. H.324 terminals may be integrated into personal computers or implemented in stand-alone devices such as videotelephones and televisions. Support for each media type (voice, data, video) is optional, but if supported, the ability to use a specified common mode of operation is required, so that all terminals supporting that media type can interwork. H.324 allows more than one channel of each type to be in use. Other Recommendations in the H.324 series include the H.223 multiplex (combination of voice, data and video), H.245 control, H.263 video codec (digital encoder and decoder), and G.723.1.1 audio codec.","H.324 makes use of the logical channel signaling procedures of ITU Recommendation H.245, in which the content of each logical channel is described when the channel is opened. Procedures are provided for allowing each caller to utilize only the multimedia capabilities of their machine. For example a person trying to make a video (and audio) call to someone who only has audio and not video capabilities can still communicate with the audio method (G.723.1.1)","H.324 by definition is a point-to-point protocol. To conference with more than one other person an MCU (Multipoint Control Unit) is needed to act as a video-call bridge. H.324 computers may interwork with H.320 computers on the ISDN, as well as with computers on wireless networks.","A. Components of Video Telephony System","1. DSP modem pools with ACD.","A Digital Signal Processor (DSP) modem pool is a modem bank, with each modem having the ability to be programmed for extra functions (like new V. modem protocols, DTMF detection, etc.) A call is routed from the MCI switch to an ACD. The ACD keeps a matrix of which DSP modems are available. The ACD also communicates with the ISNAP which does a group select to determine which group of Agents are responsible for this call and also which of the agents are free to process this call. In an alternative embodiment, DSP resources can be deployed without an ACD, directly connected to a switch. In this embodiment, the DSP resources are managed using an NCS-based routing step.","2. Agent","An Agent can be a human Video Operator (video capable MTOC), or an Automated program (video ARU). The ACD knows which Agent ports are available and connects an Agent to an Agent Port.","3. Video on Hold Server","If the ACD has no Agent ports available, then the caller is connected to the Video On Hold Server, which has the ability to play advertisements and other non-interactive video, until the ACD finds a free Agent port.","4. Video Mail Server","Video-mail messages are stored here. Customers can manage their mail and record greetings to be stored on this server.","5. Video Content Engine","Video On Demand content resides on the Video Content Engine. Video stored here can be previously recorded video-conferences, training videos, etc.","6. Reservation Engine","When people want to schedule a multi-party video-conference, they can specify the participants and time of the conference on this system. Configuration can be done with the help of a human Video Operator or by some other form entry method.","7. Video Bridge","Because H.324 is a point-to-point protocol, a Multi-point Conferencing Unit (MCU) needs to manage each participants call and re-direct the video streams appropriately. MCU conferencing will be available for customers with H.324 and H.320 compliant systems.","B. Scenario","A computer or set-top TV has H.324 compliant software, and a modem for use over POTS, most likely to be 28.8 kbps (V.34) or higher. One objective is to call another party. If they do not answer or are busy, the originator has the option of leaving video-mail for the destination party. Another objective is to schedule and participate in a conference with more than two participants.","C. Connection Setup",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1105","num":"2190"},"figref":"FIG. 19B","b":["1","7","19"]},"When a user dials \u201c1 800 VID MAIL\u201d at , the ACD on the DSP modem pool will connect a switch to a modem  and a port to an Agent . Then the user logs-in to the system with a special, custom terminal program that utilizes the data stream part of the H.324 bandwidth (using the ITU T.120 standard), called the V-mail Data Interface (VMDI). From a graphical user interface, icon or other menu, the caller can choose to:\n\n","In an alternate embodiment, a user can dial \u201c1 800 324 CALL\u201d to call a number. Then, if the destination number was 1 319 375 1772, the modem dial string would be \u201cATDT 1 800 324 CALL ,,, 1 319 375 1772\u201d (the comma \u2018,\u2019 tells the modem to do a short pause while dialing.) When the connection to 1 800 324 CALL is made, a connection is made from the originator, to an MCI switch , to an ARU , selected by an ACD , ","The ARU detects DTMF tones entered through a telephone keypad or other device for generating DTMF tones to get the destination number. The originator remains on hold while the ARU makes a separate call to the destination number , and . If the destination answers, the originator is connected to the destination, both party's modems can connect, and the ARU is released. If the destination is busy or does not answer, the call is transferred to 1 800 VID MAIL or an Agent through the DSP modem pool . If there are no DTMF tones detected, the call is transferred to an Agent through the DSP modem pool . The Agent will make an H.324 connection with the caller and ask for their destination number (or provide help.) The architecture for this alternative is similar to how faxes are detected and transmitted in the directlineMCI system as discussed with respect to an alternative embodiment.","D. Calling the Destination","When the destination number is known, the Video On Hold Server provides the video input for the H.324 connection . A new call is made from the Agent ,  to the destination number . One concern that required analysis while working out a detailed embodiment required determining if modems could re-synchronize after a switch operation without going off-line. If the destination number answers and is a modem, a connection MUST be made at the same speed as the originator modem speed. After modem handshaking is performed, the ACD instructs the switch to release the agent ,  and releases the modems  and  and connects the originator to the destination  and . The destination PC realizes that the connection is an H.324 call (not a fax or otherwise) and the video-call proceeds.","In an alternate embodiment, if the destination answers and is a modem, a connection is made. Then, two H.324 calls are using two DSP modems. The Agent can be released from both calls  and . The incoming data from each call is copied to the other call  and . This way, an Agent can monitor the video call for Video Store & Forward . When one connection drops carrier, the video-call is complete, and the modem carrier for the remaining call is dropped.","E. Recording Video-Mail, Store & Forward Video and Greetings","If a destination number does not answer or is busy, the Video Mail Server will play the appropriate Video-Mail greeting for the owner of the destination number . The caller then leaves a video-message, which is stored on the Video Mail Server. The recording of video for Store & Forward Video is exactly the same as leaving a video-message, described above. Parameters such as destination number, forwarding time, and any other audio S&F features currently available are entered through the VMDI or communicated with a human video operator (or automated video ARU.)","To record a personalized greeting for playback when someone cannot reach you because you are busy or do not answer, is similar to leaving Video-Mail. The option to do this is done through the VMDI or communicated with a human video operator.","F. Retrieving Video-Mail and Video On Demand","Users have the choice of periodically polling their video-mail for new messages, or have the video-mail server call them periodically when they have a new message waiting. Configuration is done through the VMDI or human video operator. Managing and checking video-mail is also performed through the VMDI or communicated with a human video operator.","Choice of video to view for Video On Demand (VOD) is through the VMDI. These videos can be previously recorded video-conferences, training videos, etc. and are stored on the Video Content Engine .","G. Video-conference Scheduling","A user can navigate through the VMDI or Internet  WWW forms, or communicate with a human video operator to schedule a multi-point conference. This information is stored on the Reservation Engine . The other conference participants are notified of the schedule with a video-mail, e-mail message or otherwise. There will be an option to remind all registered conference participants at a particular time (e.g. 1 hour before the conference), through video-mail (or e-mail, voice-mail, paging service or any other available notification method). The MCU (video bridge) can call each participant , or H.324 users can dial In to the MCU at the scheduled time .","XIII. VIDEO TELEPHONY OVER THE INTERNET",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1120","num":"2211"},"figref":"FIG. 19E"},"RTP is a protocol providing support for applications with real-time properties. While UDP\/IP is its initial target networking environment, RTP is transport-independent so that it can be used over IPX or other protocols. RTP does not address the issue of resource reservation or quality of service control; instead, it relies on resource reservation protocols such as RSVP. The transmission service with which most network users are familiar is point-to-point, or unicast service. This is the standard form of service provided by networking protocols such as HDLC and TCP.","Somewhat less commonly used (on wire-based networks, at any rate) is broadcast service. Over a large network, broadcasts are unacceptable (because they use network bandwidth everywhere, regardless of whether individual sub-nets are interested in them or not), and so they are usually restricted to LAN-wide use (broadcast services are provided by low-level network protocols such as IP). Even on LANs, broadcasts are often undesirable because they require all machines to perform some processing in order to determine whether or not they are interested in the broadcast data.","A more practical transmission service for data that is intended for a potentially wide audience is multicast. Under the multicast model on a WAN, only hosts that are actively interested in a particular multicast service will have such data routed to them; this restricts bandwidth consumption to the link between the originator and the receiver of multicast data. On LANs, many interface cards provide a facility whereby they will automatically ignore multicast data in which the kernel has not registered an interest; this results in an absence of unnecessary processing overhead on uninterested hosts.","A. Components","RSVP Routers with MBONE capability for broadcast of video from the Video Content Engine and the MCI Conference Space network. MCI will have an MBONE network that multicasts locally and transmits many unicasts out the Internet.","RSVP is a network control protocol that will allow Internet applications to obtain special qualities-of-service (QOS's) for their data flows. This will generally (but not necessarily) require reserving resources along the data path(s) either ahead of time or dynamically. RSVP is a component of the future \u201cintegrated services\u201d Internet, which provides both best-effort and real-time qualities of service. An embodiment is presented in the detailed specification that follows.","When an application in a host (end system) requests a specific QOS for its data stream, RSVP is used to deliver the request to each router along the path(s) of the data stream and to maintain router and host state to provide the requested service. Although RSVP was developed for setting up resource reservations, it is readily adaptable to transport other kinds of network control information along data flow paths.","1. Directory and Registry Engine","When people are connected to the Internet (whether through modem dial-up, direct connection or otherwise), they can register themselves in this directory. The directory is used to determine if a particular person is available for conferencing.","2. Agents","An Agent can be a human Video Operator (video capable MTOC), or an Automated program (video ARU). An Internet ACD in accordance with a preferred embodiment is designed so that Agent ports can be managed. The ACD will know which Agent ports are available and connects an Agent to an available Agent Port. If the ACD has no Agent ports available, then the caller is connected to the Video On Hold Server, which has the ability to play advertisements and other non-interactive video, until the ACD finds a free Agent port.","3. Video Mail Server","Video-mail messages are stored here. Customers can manage their mail and record greetings to be stored on this server.","4.

Virtual Reality Space Engine","The Conference Spaces are generated and managed by the Virtual Reality Engine. The virtual reality engine manages object manipulation and any other logical descriptions of the conference spaces.","B. Scenario","If a user has a current connection to the Internet. The user will utilize H.263 compliant system software utilizing RTP (as opposed to TCP) over the Internet. If the user also desires to participate in VR MCI conference-space, and create\/view video-mail, the user can join a VR session.","C. Connection Setup","The simplest way to make a video call to another person on the Internet is to simply make the call without navigating through menus and options as an initial telephone call. However, if the destination is busy or not answering, MCI provides services for depositing messages.","A customer can login to a telnet server (e.g. telnet vmail.mci.com), or use a custom-made client, or the WWW (e.g. http:\/\/vmail.mci.com). The services menu is referred to as the V-Mail Data Interface (VMDI), similar to the VMDI available when dialing through POTS as described above.","From a menu, the caller can choose to:\n\n","When a user has specified a party to call by indicating the destination's name, IP address or other identification, the Directory is checked. It is possible to determine if a destination will accept a call without actually calling; so, since it can be determined that the destination will accept a call, the originator's video client can be told to connect to the destination. If the callers are using a WWW browser (e.g. Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, internetMCI Navigator, etc.) to access the VMDI, then a call can be automatically initiated using Java, JavaScript or Helper App. If a call cannot be completed, there will be a choice to leave video-mail.","D.

Overview","Analog Video from different sources and H.320 video from an MCU is received as input and transcoded into various formats as required like ITU H.324, ITU H.261, ITU H.263 or MPEG and stored on the different Object Servers dedicated for each of the formats. The Object Servers are in turn managed by the Index Server and are together called a Digital Library. Any request from the clients for content is received by the Index Server and in turn serviced by the Object Server through a Proxy Client.","The Index Server or the Library Server respond to requests from the proxy client and store, update and retrieve objects like H., H. or MPEG multimedia information on the object servers. Then they direct the object server to deliver the retrieved information back to the proxy client. The Index Server has the complete index information of all the different objects stored on the object servers and also information on which of the object server the information is residing on. The index information available on the Index Server is accessible by the proxy client for retrieval of multimedia content from the different object servers. Security and access control is also part of the index server functionality.","The Object Servers are an integral part of the Digital Library providing physical storage and acting as the repository for the multimedia content, including the video-conferencing information stream from the conferencing facilities. The multimedia content is stored in standard formats which can be retrieved by the proxy client on demand. Each of the Object Servers are dedicated for a specific format of multimedia content like H.261, H.263, MPEG, etc. The organization and index information of the multimedia content including information about the specific object server dedicated for a multimedia format is managed by the index server. The Object Server delivers the stored multimedia content to the proxy client upon receiving specific instructions from the index server.","The Proxy Client is the front end of the digital library and is accessed by all the clients through the Internet for on-demand multimedia content. The Proxy Client also is a World Wide Web (WWW) Server and delivers a page to the clients when accessed. The clients interact with the Proxy Client and thereby with the Digital Library through the WWW pages. Clients request multimedia content by interacting with the WWW pages. The Proxy Client receives the request from the clients through the WWW pages and processes the request. The Proxy Client then communicates with the index server with object queries as requested by the client. The index server then communicates with one of the object servers dedicated to the requested multimedia format and, based on the index information available at the index server, directs the object servers to deliver the requested multimedia content to the Proxy Client. The Proxy Client receives the multimedia content from the object server and delivers it to the client making the request.","The Clients connect to the Servers either through the Internet or by dial-up connections on an ISDN line or an Analog line at 28.8 Kbps depending on the video format requested and the client capabilities. A H.320 client connects by an ISDN line and a H.324 client requests services on an analog telephone line at 28.8 Kbps. A MPEG client or a H.263 client using RTP or a H.263 client using IP request services through the Internet. The front-ends for multimedia content query and display like the WWW browsers are integrated as a part of the Client and provide an easy-to-use interface for the end-users.","A request for video from the client is received by the proxy client which routes the request to the Index Server which is turn processes the request and communicates with a specific Object Server in addition to indexing the content for delivery. The Object Server delivers the requested content to the client through the Internet. In the case of the dial-up links, the content is delivered back on the already established link.","In sum, the Video Store and Forward architecture describes a comprehensive system for the creation, transcoding, storage, archiving, management and delivery of video and audio or audio on demand. The delivery of video and audio or audio will be on the Internet or by ISDN or Analog Telephone dial-up lines. Content including video and audio or audio is delivered at various data rates from individual storage locations, each serving a different delivery speed.","XVI. VIDEO OPERATOR","A.

Class Hierarchy",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1650","num":"2848"},"figref":"FIG. 106"},"Described in object-oriented programming terms, the GUI has a main application object which creates and maintains all the windows and views within. The main window is the VOMainFrame  which is created by the VOConsoleApp . This mainframe window creates the VOScheduleWnd , VOAlertWnd , VOConferenceVw  and the VOVideoWatchVw . The VOScheduleWnd  and the VOAlertWnd are dockable windows meaning that they can be attached to one of the sides of their parent window. In this case the parent window is the VOMainFrame  window. The dockable windows can also be separated from the border by dragging them away. In such a situation they will act like normal tool windows.","The function of each class of object can be summarized as follows. VOConsoleApp  is the main application class, and VOMainFrame  is the main window which contains all the other windows. VOScheduleWnd  is a window displaying the operator's schedule, and VOAlertWnd  is a window where the error messages and alerts are displayed. VOChildFrame  is a frame window for the multiple document interface (\u201cMDI\u201d) windows. VOChildFrame  will act like the mainframe window for each of the views. VOConferenceFrame , derived from the VOChildFrame , is the frame window for the conference view, and VOConferenceVw  is the window displaying the conference information. VOConferenceDoc  is the document class corresponding to the VOConferenceVw . VOVideoWatchFrame , derived from the VOChildFrame , is the frame window for the Video Watch view, and VOVideoWatchVw  is the window displaying the video stream and controls for making calls. VOVideoWatchDoc  is the document class corresponding to the VideoWatch view.","In one embodiment using Visual C++ as the programming language, CWnd  is a Superclass to the CMDIFrameWnd  Subclass-1, CMDIChildWnd  Subclass-2, CFromView  Subclass-3, and CDialogBar  Subclass-4, such that CMDIFrameWnd  class objects, CMDIChildWnd  class objects, CFromView  class objects, and CDialogBar  class objects inherit attributes from the CWnd  class. CMDIFrameWnd  is a Superclass to VOMainFrame  Subclass-1; CMDIChildWnd  is a Superclass to VOChildFrame  Subclass-1; CFromView  is a Superclass to both VOVideoWatchVw  Subclass-1 and VOConferenceVw  Subclass-2; and CDialogBar  is a Superclass to both VOAlertWnd  Subclass-1 and VOScheduleWnd  Subclass-2.

The user is also able to enter the List Name to locate it. Users are able to modify lists through create, review, edit (add and remove recipients), delete and rename commands.","Whenever a subscriber modifies a list with a recipient addition, removal or address change, she is able to make the modification a global change. For example, a user changes the voice mailbox address for Mr. Brown in one list. she is able to make this a global change, changing that address for Mr. Brown in all of his distribution lists. While the subscriber is able to create and modify distribution lists through the ARU and VRU in addition to the PC, enhanced list maintenance capabilities are supported through the WWW Browser interface.","The subscriber is able to search and sort lists by name or by the different address fields. For example, a user is able to search for all lists containing \u2018DOLE\u2019 by using the *DOLE* command within the search function. In addition, users are able to search lists using any of the address fields. For example, a user could search based on a recipient number, \u2018to\u2019 name or zip code. A user is able to sort lists by list names, identifiers and types or by any address field.","In addition to search capabilities, the distribution list software enables the user to copy and create sub-lists from existing distribution list records. The user is able to import and export recipient data from external database structures.","The capability to share lists among users and upload lists to a host also exists.","12. Global Message Handling","Global Message Handling provides subscribers the ability to define the message types that will appear in the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d or accessed through the Message Center. The following message types are selectable:\n\n","If a subscriber is not enrolled in a specific service then that option will be grayed-out and therefore not selectable within Global Message Handling. Any updates to Global Message Handling result in a real-time update to the Message Center. An example is that a subscriber may choose to allow voicemail messages to appear in the Message Center. The Message Center automatically retrieves all voicemail message objects that exist within the voicemail database.","D. Message Center","The Message Center functions as the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d for retrieving and manipulating message objects. The \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d consists of folders containing messages addressed to the user. Access to the Message Center is supported from all WWW Browsers, but content contained in the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d only presents the following message types:\n\n","In addition to the On-Screen Help Text and Control Bar discussed in the previous sections, the Message Center screen presents a Title Bar. The Title Bar provides the subscriber easy access to the Message Center functions and quick access to Profile Management. The Message Center functions that are supported through the Title Bar are:\n\n","When composing or forwarding messages through the Message Center, the user has the ability to send a message as either an email or a faxmail. The only limitation is that voicemails may only be forwarded as voicemails or as email attachments. All other message types may be interchanged such that emails may be forwarded to a fax machine, or pager messages may be forwarded as an email text message. Messages that are sent out as faxmail messages are generated in a G3 format, and support distribution to Fax Broadcast lists.","The presentation layout of the Message Center is consistent with the presentation layout of the PC Client such that they have the same look and feel. The Message Center is designed to present a Message Header Frame and a Message Preview Frame, similar to the presentation that is supported by nMB v3.x. The user will have the ability to dynamically re-size the height of the Message Header Frame and the Message Preview Frame. The Message Header Frame will display the following envelope information:\n\n","The Message Preview Frame displays the initial lines of the body of the email message, the initial lines of the first page of the faxmail message, the pager message, or instructions on how to play the voicemail message. Playing of voicemail messages through an WWW Browser is supported as a streaming audio capability such that the subscriber is not required to download the audio file to their workstation before playing it. The streaming audio is initiated after the user has selected (single left-mouse click) on the voicemail header in the Message Header Frame. Displaying of faxmail messages is initiated immediately after the user has selected (single left-mouse click) on the faxmail header in the Message Header Frame.","The Message Center also allows the subscriber to use distribution lists that have been created in Profile Management. The distribution lists support sending messages across different message types.","In addition to the basic message retrieval and message distribution, the Message Center supports the creation and maintenance of message folders (or directories) within the universal inbox. Initially users are limited to the following folders:\n\n","1. Storage Requirements","Initially, users are allotted a limited amount of storage space for directlineMCI voicemail and directlineMCI faxmail. Pager recall messages and email messages are not limited based upon amount of storage space consumed, but rather the date\/time stamp of the message received. Ultimately, storage requirements will be enforced based upon a common measurement unit, like days. This will provide users an easier approach to knowing when messages will be deleted from the database, and when guests will be prevented from depositing a message (voicemail, faxmail) to their \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d. To support this, the following are storage requirements for messages retained in the inbox:\n\n","The subscriber is provided the option to download the messages that are scheduled to be overwritten in the database except for messages that are retained in the trash folder.","E. PC Client Capabilities","1. User Interface","The PC Client interface supports subscribers that want to operate in a store & forward environment. These users want to download messages to either manipulate or store locally. The PC Client is not designed to support Profile Management and the PC Client interface only presents messages (voicemail, faxmail, email, text-page). Access to Profile Management capabilities only is available through the ARU interface or the WWW Browser interface. The PC Client interface is integrated with the WWW Browser interface such that both components can exist on the same workstation and share a single IP connection.","The PC Client interface is optimized to support Windows 95; however, Windows 3.1 is supported as well.","The graphical user interface is designed to present a Message Header Window and a Message Preview Window, similar to the presentation that is supported by nMB v3.x and is supported by the WWW Browser. The user has the ability to dynamically re-size the height of the Message Header Window and the Message Preview Window. The Message Header Window displays the following envelope information:\n\n","The Message Preview Window displays the initial lines of the body of email messages or pager messages, or instructions on how to display the faxmail message or play the voicemail message. Playing of voicemail messages from the PC Client requires an audio card be present on the PC. Displaying of faxmail messages invokes the faxmail reader within the PC Client.","The Message Center also allows the user to use distribution lists that have been created in Profile Management. The distribution lists support sending messages across different message types.","2. Security","User authentication between the PC Client and the server is negotiated during the dial-up logon session. Security is supported such that the User Ib and Password information is imbedded in the information that is passed between the PC Client and server when establishing the interface. Subscribers are not required to manually enter their User ID and Password. In addition, updates made to the password are communicated to the PC Client.","3. Message Retrieval","Message Retrieval provides subscribers the ability to selectively retrieve voicemail, faxmail, pages and email messages that reside in the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d. Message types that are displayed or played from the PC Client include:\n\n","The PC Client initiates a single communication session to retrieve all message types from the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d. This single communication session is able to access the upstream databases containing voicemails, faxmails, emails and pages.","The PC Client also is able to perform selective message retrieval such that the user may is able to:\n\n","Header-only faxmail messages retrieved from the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d are retained in the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d until the message body is retrieved. Voicemail messages are retained in the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d until the subscriber accesses the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d via the WWW Browser (i.e., Message Center) or ARU and deletes the message. Messages retrieved from the \u201cuniversal inbox\u201d are moved to the desktop folder.","In addition, the PC Client is able to support background and scheduled polling such that users are able to perform message manipulation (create, edit, delete, forward, save, etc.) while the PC Client is retrieving messages.","4. Message Manipulation","Message Manipulation provides subscribers the ability to perform many standard messaging client actions, like:\n\n","F. Order Entry Requirements","directlineMCI or networkMCI Business customers are provided additional interface options to perform profile management and message management functions. Both directlineMCI and networkMCI Business customers are automatically provided accounts to access the features and functions available through the different interface types. The ability to provide accounts to networkMCI Business customers is also supported; however not all networkMCI Business customers are provided accounts. Order entry is flexible enough to generate accounts for networkMCI Business customers, as needed.","Order entry is designed such that directlineMCI customers or networkMCI Business customers are automatically provided access to the additional interface types and services provided in the system. For example, a customer that orders directlineMCI (or networkMCI Business) is provided an account to access the Home Page for Profile Management or Message Center. Checks are in place to prevent a customer from being configured with two accounts\u2014one from directlineMCI and one from networkMCI Business. In order to accomplish this, integration between the two order entry procedures is established.","An integrated approach to order entry requires a single interface. The interface integrates order entry capabilities such that the order entry appears to be housed in one order entry system and does not require the order entry administrator to establish independent logon sessions to multiple order entry systems. This integrated order entry interface supports a consistent order entry methodology for all of the services and is capable of pulling information from the necessary order entry systems. In addition, the interface supports the capability to see the services associated with the user's existing application.","The specific requirements of the integrated order interface system are:\n\n","These abilities give order entry administrators the flexibility to add a user based upon preexisting MCI service (email, paging, directlineMCI) account information. Alternatively, the order administrator may add a user while specifying the underlying services.","The order entry systems provide the necessary customer account and service information to the downstream billing systems. They also track the initial customer order and all subsequent updates so that MCI can avoid sending duplicate platform software (i.e., PC Client) and documentation (i.e., User Guide). In addition, order entry processes enable an administrator to obtain the following information:\n\n","Personal home pages can be ordered for a customer. The customer delivery information recorded during order entry is the default address information that is presented from the user's Personal Home Page. In addition, the order entry processes support the installation of and charging for special graphics.","The capability to turn existing feature\/functionality \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 for a specific service exists. Features that can be managed by the user are identified within the order entry systems. These features are then activated for management within the user's directory account.","There are real-time access capabilities between order entry systems and the user's directory account. This account houses all of the user's services, product feature\/functionality, and account information, whether user-managed or not. Those items that are not identified as user-managed are not accessible through the user's interface.","1. Provisioning and Fulfillment","Access requirements have been defined in terms of inbound access to the system and outbound access from the system. Inbound access includes the methods through which a user or a caller may access the system. Outbound access includes the methods through which users are handled by the system in accordance with a preferred embodiment. Internet support exists for both inbound and outbound processing.","The following components may provide inbound access:\n\n","The following components have been identified for outbound access:\n\n","G. Traffic Systems","Traffic is supported according to current MCI procedures.","H. Pricing","Initially, the features are priced according to the existing pricing structure defined for the underlying components. In addition, taxing and discounting capabilities are supported for the underlying components as they are currently being supported. Discounting is also supported for customers that subscribe to multiple services.","I. Billing","The billing system:\n\n","In one embodiment, the billing system supports the current invoicing procedures that exist for each of the underlying components. In an alternative embodiment, the billing provides a consolidated invoice that includes all of the underlying components. In addition to invoicing, directed billing is supported for all of the underlying components that are currently supporting directed billing.","XVIII.DIRECTLINE MCI","The following is a description of the architecture of the directline MCI system, as modified for use with the system. This document covers the general data and call flows in the directlineMCI platform, and documents the network and hardware architecture necessary to support those flows. Billing flows in the downstream systems are covered at a very high level.","Order Entry (OE) flows in the upstream systems are covered at a very high level. Certain portions of the directlineMCI architecture reuse existing components (e.g. the Audio Response Unit (ARU)). Those portions of the directlineMCI architecture which are new are covered in more detail.","A. Overview","In addition to billing, order entry, and alarming, the directlineMCI system is made up of three major components, as shown in FIG. :\n\n","The subsections below describe each of the major components at a high level.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2038","num":"3447"},"figref":"FIG. 43"},"1. The ARU (Audio Response Unit) ","The ARU  handles all initial inbound calls for directlineMCI. Some features (such as find me\/follow me) are implemented entirely on the ARU.","Inbound faxes are tone-detected by the ARU and extended to the VFP . Menuing provided by the ARU can be used to request access to the voicemail faxmal f eatures, in which case the call is also extended to the VFP.","2. The VFP (Voice Fax Platform) ","The VFP provides the menuing for the voicemail\/faxmail features as well as outbound fax and voice forwarding and pager notifications. The VFP is also the central data store for the customized subscriber prompts which are played and recorded by the ARU .","3. The DDS (Data Distribution Service) ","The DDS is a central data repository for OE profiles and Billing Details Records (BDRs). OE profiles are deposited with DDS, which is responsible for distributing the profiles to all of the appropriate systems. DDS  collects BDRs and ships them to the downstream billing systems.","B. Rationale","The requirement for the directlineMCI service is to integrate a variety of service components into a single service accessed by a single  number. A number of these service components had been previously developed on the ISN ARU platform. The services not present in the ARU were mailbox services and fax services. The ARU  of the system incorporates a voicemail\/faxmail platform purchased from Texas Instruments (TI). Portions of that software are ported to run on DEC Alpha machines for performance, reliability, and scalability. Another requirement for the directlineMCI implementation is integration with the mainstream (existing MCI) billing and order entry systems. The DDS provides the inbound and outbound interfaces between directlineMCI and the mainstream order entry systems.","C.

When the ARU plays the customized prompt, or records a new prompt, the prompt is accessed on the VFP . Alarms from the ARU  and VFP  are sent to the Local Support Element (LSE).","1. Call Flow Architecture ","The call flow architecture for directlineMCI is shown in FIG. . The top part of the figure shows the network  connectivity used to transport the calls. The bottom part of the figure shows the call direction for different call types. The subsections below provide the text description to accompany the figure.","2. Network Connectivity","All inbound ISN calls are received at an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD)  connected to the MCI network . The Access Control Point (ACP) receives notice of an inbound call from the Integrated Services Network","Application Processor (ISNAP) , which is the control\/data interface to the ACD . The Network Audio System (NAS) plays and records voice under the control of the ACP via a T1 interface to the ACD. In the United States, a digital multiplexing system is employed in which a first level of multiplexed transmission, known as T1, combines 24 digitized voice channels over a four-wire cable (one-pair of wires for \u201csend\u201d signals and one pair of wires for \u201creceive\u201d signals). The conventional bit format on the T1 carrier is known as DS1 (i.e., first level multiplexed digital service or digital signal format), which consists of consecutive frames, each frame having 24 PCM voice channels (or DS0 channels) of eight bits each. Each frame has an additional framing bit for control purposes, for a total of 193 bits per frame. The T1 transmission rate is 8000 frames per second or 1.544 megabits per second (Mbps). The frames are assembled for T1 transmission using a technique known as time division multiplexing (TDM), in which each DS0 channel is assigned one of 24 sequential time slots within a frame, each time slot containing an 8-bit word.","Transmission through the network of local, regional and long distance service providers involves sophisticated call processing through various switches and hierarchy of multiplexed carriers. At the pinnacle of conventional high-speed transmission is the synchronous optical network (SONET), which utilizes fiber-optic media and is capable of transmission rates in the gigabit range (in excess of one-billion bits per second). After passing through the network, the higher level multiplexed carriers are demultiplexed (\u201cdemuxed\u201d) back down to individual DS0 lines, decoded and coupled to individual subscriber telephones.","Typically, multiple signals are multipexed over a single line. For example, DS3 transmission is typically carried by a coaxial cable and combines twenty-eight DS1 signals at 44.736 Mbps. An OC3 optical fiber carrier, which is at a low level in the optical hierarchy, combines three DS3 signals at 155.52 Mbps, providing a capacity for 2016 individual voice channels in a single fiber-optic cable. SONET transmissions carried by optical fiber are capable of even higher transmission rates.","The NAS\/ACP combination is referred to as the ARU . If the ARU  determines that a call must be extended to the VFP , it dials out to the VFP . The VFP media servers are connected to the MCI network  via T1. Data transfer from the ARU  to the VFP  is accomplished via is Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) on each call.","3. Call Flow","The call scenarios shown in  are detailed below. At the start of any of the inbound calls, the ARU  has already received the call and performed an application select to determine whether the call is a directlineMCI call or not.","a) Inbound FAX:","An inbound FAX call is delivered to the ARU . The ARU performs a faxtone detect and extends the call to the VFP . Account number and mode are delivered to the VFP utilizing DTMF signaling.","b) Inbound Voice, ARU only:","An inbound voice call is made in either subscriber or guest mode, and only those features which use the ARU  are accessed. The ARU determines mode (subscriber or guest). In subscriber mode, the ARU queries the VFP  to determine the number of messages. No additional network accesses are made.","c) Inbound\/Outbound Voice, ARU only:","A call is made to the ARU , and either pager notification or find me\/follow me features are accessed. The ARU  dials out via the ACD  to the outside number.","d) Inbound Voice, VFP features:","A call is made to the ARU , and the call is extended to the VFP . Account number and mode (subscriber or guest) are sent to the VFP via DTMF. The guest modes are:\n\n","The subscriber modes are:\n\n","The VFP  continues prompting the user during the VFP session.","e) Outbound Fax\/Voice\/Pager, VFP only:","For FAX or voice delivery or pager notification, the VFP dials out on the MCI network  directly.","f) Reoriginate\/Takeback:","While an inbound subscriber call is connected to the VFP , the user may return to the top level of the ARU  directlineMCI menus by pressing the pound key for two seconds. The network  takes the call back from the VFP  and reorginates the call to the ARU .","4. Data Flow Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0039","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 45","b":"520"},"OE records (customer profiles) are entered in an upstream system and are downloaded at  to the DDS mainframe .

Rationale","The TI MultiServe 4000  was selected by MCI for the voicemail\/faxmail portion of the directlineMCI platform. The MultiServe 4000 is a fairly slow 68040 machine on a fairly slow Nubus backplane. The 68040\/Nubus machines are used by TI as both media servers (T1 interface, DSPs for voice and fax) and also for the executive server (database and object storage). Although this hardware is adequate for media server use, it was inadequate as an executive server to serve hundreds or even thousands of gigabytes of voice and fax data and thousands of media server ports. Additionally, there is no clustering (for either performance or redundancy) available for the media server hardware. Thus, the executive server portion of the TI implementation was ported by MCI to run on a DEC Alpha 8200 cluster , described below. This clustering provides both failover and loadsharing (thus scalability).","Likewise, the gigabytes that must be moved from the high speed 8200 platforms must be moved across a network to the TI media servers. Cabletron Hubs  with both Fiber Distribution Data Interface (FDDI) and switched 10 bT connectivity provide the backbone for the implementation. Each media server  is attached to a redundant pair of switched Ethernet ports. Because each port is a switched port, each media server gets a dedicated 10 Mb of bandwidth to the hub. The 8200 servers  each need a large network pipe to serve the many smaller 10 Mb Ethernet pipes. For the first embodiment, the FDDI interfaces  will be used. However, traffic projections show that the necessary traffic will exceed FDDI capacity by several times, so an embodiment in accordance with a preferred embodiment will use higher speed networking technology such as ATM. The hub  configuration is fully redundant.","The AlphaStation 200 workstation  is needed for operations support. The AlphaStation 200 provides console management via DEC's Polycenter Console Manager for each of the directlineMCI VFP  components. It also runs the DEC Polycenter Performance Analyzer software. The performance analyzer software collects and analyzes data from the 8200s for tuning purposes.","3.

It was decided to use the directlineMCI VFP  as the network-based central object store for the NAS  to read and write customer prompts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2122","num":"3542"},"figref":["FIG. 50","FIG. 51"],"b":"5105"},"The DMZ permits a customer to receive periodically generated data, such as DDS data down feeds from a mainframe database. Such data is periodically extracted from the database and placed in a user account directory on a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) host for subsequent retrieval by a customer.","Data access for customers is through dedicated ports at dial-in gateways, which are owned, operated and maintained by the Internet provider. Dial-in user authentication is through the use one time passwords via secure identification cards, as is more fully described below. The cards are distributed and administered by Internet provider personnel.","The DMZ provides a screened subnet firewall that uses a packet filtering router to screen traffic from the outside unsecured network and the internal private network. Only selected packets are authorized through the router, and other packets are blocked. The use of multiple firewalling techniques ensures that no single point of failure or error in DMZ configuration puts the ISN production network at risk.","The DMZ  is intended to conform to several security standards. First, individuals who are not authorized employees cannot be allowed access to internal production networks. Therefore IP connectivity through the gateway is not allowed. Second, access and use of DMZ services is restricted to authenticated and authorized users for specific purposes. Therefore all other utilities and services normally found on a general purpose machine are disabled. Third, use of DMZ services and facilities must be carefully monitored to detect problems encountered by authorized users and to detect potentially fraudulent activity.","The centerpiece of the DMZ is the DMZ Bastion host . Bastion host  runs an FTP server daemon that implements a modified FTP protocol, as will be described in further detail below. Bastion host  is a highly secured machine used as the interface to the outside world. Bastion host  allows only restricted access from the outside world. It typically acts as an application-level gateway to interior hosts in ISN , to which it provides access via proxy services. Generally, critical information is not placed on Bastion host , so that, even if the host is compromised, no access is made to critical data without additional integrity compromise at the ISN .","Bastion host  is connected to both interior and exterior users as shown in FIG. A. Bastion host  may be a UNIX-based computer such as an IBM RS\/6000 model  running the AIX operating system.","An interior user is a user connected to the ISN production token ring . Token ring  is connected to an interior packet filter  such as a Cisco model 4500 modular router. Packet filter  is connected to token ring LAN , which in turn is connected to bastion host . Token ring LAN  is a dedicated token ring that is isolated from all components other than bastion host  and interior packet filter , thereby preventing any access to bastion host  through token ring LAN  except as allowed by packet filter .","Exterior users connect through exterior packet filter , such as a Cisco model 4500 modular router. Packet filter  is connected to bastion host  through an isolated Ethernet LAN segment . Ethernet LAN segment  is a dedicated segment that is isolated from all components other than bastion host  and exterior packet filter . Because of the configuration, no user can access bastion host  except through interior packet filter  or exterior packet filter .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2131","num":"3551"},"figref":"FIG. 51","b":["5105","5205","5205","5210","5220","5215","5230","5220","5230","5233","5235","5235"]},"The Bastion host  resides within a firewall, but is logically outside both the ISN  and the gateway site .","Following authentication, the selected modem  is connected to incoming call router  using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). PPP is a protocol that provides a standard method of transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP is designed for simple links that transport packets between two peers. These links provide full-duplex simultaneous bi-directional operation, and are assumed to deliver packets in order. PPP provides a common solution for easy connection of a wide variety of hosts, bridges and routers). PPP is fully described in 1661--(PPP), W. Simpson, Ed. (1994) (\u201cRFC 1661\u201d), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Incoming call router  selectively routes incoming requests to the exterior packet filter  of DMZ  over a communications link such as T1 line , which is connected to exterior packet filter  via a channel service unit (not shown). Incoming call router  may be implemented using, for example, a Cisco 7000 series multiprotocol router. Incoming call router  is optionally connected to Internet . However, router  is configured to block traffic from Internet  to Exterior packet filter , and to block traffic from exterior packet filter  to Internet , thereby disallowing access to DMZ  from Internet .","Bastion host  runs a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server daemon that implements a modified FTP protocol based on release 2.2 of the wu-ftpd FTP daemon, from Washington University. Except as noted herein, the FTP protocol is compliant with 765, by J. Postel (June 1980) (\u201cRFC 765\u201d), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. RFC 765 describes a known protocol for transmission of files using a TCP\/IP-based telnet connection, in which the server responds to user-initiated commands to send or receive files, or to provide status information. The DMZ FTP implementation excludes the send command (which is used to send a file from a remote user to an FTP server, and any other FTP command that transfers files to the FTP host. A restricted subset of commands including the get (or recv), help, ls, and quit commands are supported.","The get command is used to transfer a file from host server  to remote user . The recv command is a synonym for get. The help command provides terse online documentation for the commands supported by host server . The ls command provides a list of the files in the current directory of the server, or of a directory specified by the user. The quit command terminates an FTP session. Optionally, the cd command, which specifies a named directory as the current directory, and the pwd command, to display the name of the current directory, may be implemented.","By disallowing send and other commands that transfer files to the server, a potential intruder is prevented from transferring a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d type of computer program that may be used to compromise system security. As an additional benefit, the unidirectional data flow prevents a user from inadvertently deleting or overwriting one of his files resident on the Bastion server.","When the FTP daemon initiates a user session, it uses the UNIX chroot() service to specify the root of the user's directory tree as the apparent root of the filesystem that the user sees. This restricts the user from visibility to UNIX system directories such as\/etc and \/bin, and from visibility to other users' directories, while permitting the desired visibility and access to the files within the user's own directory tree. To further assure a secured environment, the FTP daemon executes at the user-id (\u201cuid\u201d) of the user level, rather than as root, and allows access only to authorized users communicating from a set of predetermined IP addresses known to be authorized. In particular, the standard non-authenticated accounts of anonymous and guest are disabled.","In order to further secure Bastion server , a number of daemons that are ordinarily started by the UNIX Internet server process inetd are disabled. The disables daemons are those that are either not needed for Bastion server operation, or that are known to have security exposures. These daemons include rcp, rlogin, rlogind, rsh, rshd, tftp, and tftpd. These daemons are disabled by removing or commenting out their entries in the AIX\/etc\/inetd.conf file. The \/etc\/inetd.conf file provides a list of servers that are invoked by inetd when it receives an Internet request over a socket. By removing or commenting out the corresponding entry, the daemon is prevented from executing in response to a received request.","As a further assurance of security a number of daemons and utilities are disallowed from execution by changing their associated file permissions to mark them as non-executable (e.g., having a file mode of 000). This is performed by a DMZ Utility Disabler (DUD) routine that executes at boot time. The DUD routine marks as non-executable the above-identified files (rcp, rlogin, rlogind, rsh, rshd, tftp, and tftpd), as well as a number of other daemons and utilities not ordinarily invoked by inetd. This set of daemons and utilities includes sendmail, gated, routed, fingerd, rexecd, uucpd, bootpd, and talkd. In addition, DUD disables the telnet and ftp clients to prevent an intruder from executing those clients to access an interior host in the event of a break-in. The telnet and ftp clients may be temporarily marked as executable during system maintenance activities.","Bastion host  has IP forwarding disabled. This ensures that IP traffic cannot cross the DMZ isolated subnet  by using Bastion host  as a router.","The limited level of ftp service provided by Bastion server  provides a secure ftp session but makes it difficult to perform typical system maintenance. In order to perform system maintenance, maintenance personnel must connect to Bastion host  from an interior host within ISN  using a telnet client. The FTP client program in Bastion is then changed from non-executable (e.g., 000) to executable (e.g., 400), using the AIX chmod command. Maintenance personnel may then execute the ftp client program to connect to a desired host on ISN . During this procedure, control of transfers is therefore from within Bastion host  via the FTP client program executing within that host, rather than from a client outside of the host. At the end of a maintenance session the FTP session is terminated, and the chmod command is executed again to revert the ftp client program to a non-executable state (e.g., 000), after which the ISN-initiated telnet session may be terminated.","To provide logging, Bastion server  implements a TCP daemon wrapper, such as the TCPwrappers suite from Wietse Venema. The TCP wrapper directs inetd to run a small wrapper program rather than the named daemon. The wrapper program logs the client host name or address and performs some additional checks, then executes the desired server program on behalf of inetd. After termination of the server program, the wrapper is removed from memory. The wrapper programs have no interaction with the client user or with the client process, and do not interact with the server application. This provides two major advantages. First, the wrappers are application-independent, so that the same program can protect many kinds of network services. Second, the lack of interaction means that the wrappers are invisible from outside.","The wrapper programs are active only when the initial contact between client and server is established. Therefore, there is no added overhead in the client-server session after the wrapper has performed its logging functions. The wrapper programs send their logging information to the syslog daemon, syslogd. The disposition of the wrapper logs is determined by the syslog configuration file, usually \/etc\/syslog.conf.","Dial-in access is provided through dial-in environment . The use of authentication server  provides for authentication of users to prevent access from users that are not authorized to access the DMZ. The authentication method implemented uses a one-time password scheme. All internal systems and network elements are protected with one-time password generator token cards, such as the SecurID secure identification token cards produced by Security Dynamics, using an internally developed authentication client\/server mechanism called Keystone. Keystone clients are installed on each element that receive authentication requests from users. Those requests are then securely submitted to the Keystone Servers deployed throughout the network.","Each user is assigned a credit card sized secure identification card with a liquid crystal display on the front. The display displays a pseudo-randomly generated six-digit number that changes every 60 seconds. For an employee to gain access to a Keystone protected system, the user must enter their individually assigned PIN number followed by the number currently displayed on the secure identification card. Such authentication prevents unauthorized access that employ the use of programs that attempt to \u201csniff\u201d or intercept passwords, or Trojan horse programs designed to capture passwords from users.","Authentication information collected by the Keystone clients is encrypted with an RSA and DES encryption key, and is dispatched to one of many Keystone Servers. The Keystone Servers evaluates the information to verify the user's PIN and the access code that should be displayed on that user's card at that moment. After the system verifies that both factors for that user where entered correctly, the authorized user is granted access to the system, or resource requested.","In order to assure security from the point of entry of the external network, no external gateway machine has a general access account and all provide controlled access. Each gateway machine ensures that all gateway services generate logging information, and each external gateway machine maintains an audit trail of connections to the gateway. All of the external gateway machines have all non-essential services disconnected.","The authentication server  serves as a front end to all remote access dial up, and is programmed to disallow pass-through. All network authentication mechanisms provide for logging of unsuccessful access attempts. Preferably, the logs generated are reviewed daily by designated security personnel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2150","num":"3570"},"figref":"FIG. 53","b":["5305","5310","5315","5315","5318"]},"After starting auCheckForFaxAsync routine , control proceeds to step . In step , the fax tone detection system adds an entry to the linked list allocated in step . The added entry represents a unique identifier associated with the message being processed. In step , the fax tone detection system starts the asynchronous routine auPlayFileAsync . The auPlayFileAsync routine  is an asynchronous program that executes concurrently with the main line program, rather than synchronously returning control to the calling program. The auPlayFileAsync routine  accesses previously stored digitally recorded sound files and plays them to the originating caller. The sound files played may be used, for example, to instruct the originating caller on sequences of key presses that may be used to perform particular functions, e.g., to record a message, to retrieve a list of previously recorded messages, etc.","In step , the fax tone detection system starts the asynchronous routine auInputDataAsync . The auInputDataAsync routine  is an asynchronous program that executes concurrently with the main line program, rather than synchronously returning control to the calling program. The auInputDataAsync routine  monitors the originating call to detect key presses by the user, in order to invoke the routines to execute the tasks associated with a particular key press sequence.","As has been noted, the auCheckForFaxAsync routine  executes concurrently with the main program, and generates a auCheckForFax response  if and when a facsimile tone is detected. In step , the fax tone detection system checks to see whether an auCheckForFax response  response has been received. If a response has been received, this indicates that the originating call is a facsimile transmission, and the fax tone detection system extends the incoming call to Voice\/Fax processor (VFP) . If no auCheckForFax response  is received within a predetermined time (e.g., 7 seconds), the fax tone detection system concludes that the originator of the call is not a facsimile device, and terminates the auCheckForFaxAsync routine . In an implementation, it may be preferable to implement this check through an asynchronous interruption-handling process. In such an implementation, an execution-time routine may be set up to gain control when an auCheckForFax response  event occurs. This may be implemented using, for example, the C++ catch construct to define an exception handler to handle an auCheckForFax response  event.","Following the decision in step , the fax tone detection system in step  waits for the next incoming call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2155","num":"3575"},"figref":["FIGS. 54A through 54E","FIG. 54A"],"b":["5401","5405","5407","5409","5409","5410","5412"]},"In step , the VFP completion processor obtains the mode of the VFP call.

A subscriber, or user, is asked for profile information, which is entered into his customer record in the directlineMCI database on the ISN mainframe. The product's feature set includes:","Personal Greeting: The user has the option of recording a personal greeting to be played to his guest callers. If a user records a personal greeting, it replaces the \u2018Welcome to directlineMCI\u2019 default greeting. Guest Menu: The Guest Menu is defined by which features the user has subscribed to. A guest caller to a \u2018fully loaded\u2019 account will be presented options to Speak to or Page the user, Send a Fax, or Leave a Voicemail Message.","3-Number Sequence for Find-Me functionality: The system attempts to reach the user at three numbers, trying the First (Primary) number, then the Second(ary), then the Third (Tertiary) number. If no answer is received at any of these numbers, the call is treated as prescribed in Alternate Routing. 2-Level Schedule for Find-Me functionality: The system attempts to reach the user at two numbers, using current date\/day\/time information to query his schedules. Attempts are made to a number from the user's Schedule 1, then Schedule 2; if no answer is received, Alternate Routing defines the treatment.","Alternate Routing allows the user to prescribe the treatment of a guest caller who chose to reach him, but no answer was received at any of the attempted numbers. Options for Alternate Routing include Voicemail, Pager, a Guest's choice of Voicemail or Pager, or a Closing Message, asking the caller to try his call again at a later time.","Override Routing allows the user to disable the presentation of the Guest Menu, and prescribe a single treatment for all guest callers. Options include completion to a telephone number, the user's defined Find-Me sequence, Voicemail, or Pager.","Default Routing is the treatment of a guest caller who, when presented the Guest Menu, does not respond after three prompts. Default Routing options include a transfer to the Operator, completion to a telephone number, the Find-Me sequence, or Voicemail.","Call Screening allows the user to define whether or not he wishes callers to be announced before being connected.

Because a domestic telephone number, an international telephone number, or a Speed Dial number can be entered here, the system allows the user to press \u2018#\u2019, which indicates the end of dialed digits. The \u2018#\u2019 is accepted whether it's entered following a single digit entry or a string of digits, i.e. a telephone number.","At any place in the call flow where the user is able to enter a domestic or international number, the \u2018#\u2019 key must be accepted to indicate the end of dialed digits.

This means that , in the event that multiple keys are pressed, scripting is bypassed and the appropriate menu is reached.","One access method is supported for directlineMCI in this embodiment: 800\/8xx number access, with no PIN. The PIN field in the database is defaulted to 0000.","Billed Number Screening (Fraud) Validation","All directlineMCI calls received are subject to a Billed Number Screening validation, to verify that the number has not been tagged as a Fraud risk. The lookup is into Category 5, Type 0; the flag checked is the Credit Card (Hot) flag. In the event that the number has been \u2018shut down\u2019, i.e. the Hot flag is set to \u2018Y\u2019, the application treats the call as an off-line account, but does not allow a subscriber to access programming options.","WorldPhone","Callers are able to access the directlineMCI platform via WorldPhone. In a preferred embodiment, these calls arrive at the directline platform with a pseudo-ANI in the Originating Number field of the SCAI message. This pseudo-ANI is associated with the specific Feature Group A (FGA) circuit on which the WorldPhone call extension was launched. In another embodiment, the true originating country information is forwarded to the directline platform; the Originating Number field is populated with the 3-digit Country Code.","In a preferred embodiment, the WorldPhone-originated directline call is billed as follows:","Calls originating via WorldPhone, and arriving at the directline platform with a pseudo-ANI as the origination, are billed as domestic, using Bill Type 15.","The Originating Number field in the BDR is the FGA pseudo-ANI.","In another embodiment, the call is billed as follows:","The ARU and Console implement code to identify whether the Originating Number field contains a pseudo-ANI or true origination information. If the true Country Code origination information is provided, the application refers to its configuration files, where a WorldPhone pseudo-ANI is an optional entry. The existence of this item in the configuration file indicates to the application how the call should be billed.","If the application finds a WorldPhone pseudo-ANI in its config file, the call is billed as domestic, using Bill Type 15. The Calling Number in the BDR is set to that WorldPhone pseudo-ANI, and the application instructs the bridging switch to change its Originating Number to that same pseudo-ANI.","If the application does not find the WorldPhone pseudo-ANI in its config file, the call is billed as international, using Bill Type 115, and the Originating Number information is retained in the switch record. The BDR is populated with a 10-digit string: \u2018191\u2019+3-digit Country Code+\u20180000\u2019.","Guest call routing is prescribed by the directlineMCI subscriber in several ways, as described in the following paragraphs:","Blocking checks for guest termination, based on origination, are included below.","Call Routing","Two options are provided to the user in defining Call Routing: the Find-Me sequence, and the Schedule sequence. With the exception of Schedule definition, the user has the ability to define Call Routing via DTMF.","3-Number Find-Me Sequence","If the user has chosen the Find-Me sequence for his Call Routing, the application launches a call to the user's Primary (First) programmed number. If a live answer is received, the guest caller is connected with the answering party. Call screening, described below, may be active, in which case the answering party must actively accept the call before it is connected. If the line at the First number is busy, the call is routed to the user's programmed Alternate Routing, described below. If no answer is detected after a configurable time, the application launches a call to the user's Secondary (Second) programmed number.","Answer treatment at the Second number is the same as for a call attempt to the First number with no answer resulting in a call attempt to the user's Tertiary (Third) number. Answer treatment at the Third number is the same, with no answer resulting in Alternate Routing.","If, at any point in this calling sequence, a termination slot is not programmed, the application skips that number in the sequence, and proceed to the next number, or Alternate Routing.","For any programmed international termination, the application looks up the terminating country code in the Country Code tables. If the Direct Dial Country flag is set to \u2018Y\u2019 for that country, the ARU transfers the call to the manual console (TTC=1e) for processing.","2-Level Schedule Sequence","If the user has chosen the Schedule sequence for his Call Routing, the application takes the Schedule 1 Trans and Schedule 2 Trans fields to use as keys into the 800 Translation database to retrieve schedule information. From the user's two schedule translations, and using the current day and time, the First and Second Schedule numbers are determined.","A call is launched to the First Schedule number, and answer treatment is as described in the Find-Me sequence, with no answer resulting in a call attempt to the Second Schedule number. Answer treatment at the Second Schedule number is the same, with no answer resulting in Alternate Routing.","Again, if at any point in the Schedule calling sequence, a terminating number cannot be found, the application skips that slot in the sequence, and proceeds to the next number, or Alternate Routing.","The user's schedule is set up during Order Entry, and is not user-updatable via DTMF. At Order Entry, the user is asked to define his schedule by Date, Day of Week, Time of Day (in 30 minute increments), and by Time Zone.","Override Routing","The option is available, via DTMF, for the user to disable the presentation of the Guest Menu by prescribing specific routing for all guest callers. Via Override Routing, the user is able to: route callers to a single telephone number, have callers leave a voicemail message, have callers page him, or route callers through his programmed Call Routing (Find-Me or Schedule).","If the user has programmed Override Routing to route to a telephone number, no answer at that number results in Alternate Routing treatment.","Alternate Routing","Alternate Routing allows the user to define, via DTMF, the treatment of a caller for whom an attempt to reach the subscriber has been made, but no answer was received. Alternate Routing options include Voicemail, Pager, Closing Message, or the Guest Option of Voicemail or Pager. The default for Alternate Routing, if not programmed, is the playing of the Closing Message.","Default Routing","The user is able to prescribe at Order Entry the treatment for a caller who, when presented the Guest Menu, does not respond after two attempts. The Default Routing options are: a transfer to the Operator (TTC=67), where the Guest menu is presented again, a telephone number, with no answer resulting in Alternate Routing, Voicemail, or Call Routing (Find-Me or Schedule). The default for Default Routing, if it's not programmed, is the Operator transfer.","Call Screening","The user may choose to have Call Screening invoked, to announce all guest callers. Call Screening options include pre-programming of Name Only, ANI Only, Name and ANI, and No Call Screening. The user has the ability to program Call Screening via DTMF.","When Name Only or Name and ANI screening is programmed, the caller's name is recorded. If the caller does not respond to the prompt, and nothing is recorded, the system will default to ANI Only screening. When an answer is received at a terminating telephone number, the caller's Name and\/or ANI is played and the answering party is asked to accept or reject the call. If the call is accepted, the caller is connected. If Caller Screening includes ANI screening, and the originating number is a Country Code, the scripts \u2018 . . . an international location\u2019 will be played in place of the ANI.","If the call is rejected, or no response is received from the answering party, the caller is asked to leave a voicemail message, or the Closing Message is played, if the user has not subscribed to Voicemail.","Timeout Parameters","Timeout values are defined, in seconds, in the directlineMCI database for the following termination:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2414","num":"3870"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00089","num":"00089"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Use this"]},{"entry":[{},"For this termination:","timeout value:"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"First Find-Me","Primary"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},"Second Find-Me","Secondary"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},"Third Find-Me","Tertiary"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},"Schedule 1","Primary"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},"Schedule 2","Secondary"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},"Override Routing, if","Override"]},{"entry":[{},"telephone number","Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},"Default Routing, if","Default"]},{"entry":[{},"telephone number","Timeout"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":[{},{}]},"Call connection delays, when a guest call to a programmed termination is completed, are minimized as much as possible.","Answer detection","For all call attempts to a telephone number, treatment on detection of an answering machine is defined by the Roll on Machine Detect flag (State flag, bit ).

If so, Country Set blocking is applied. The Pseudo-Country Code (PCC) associated with the programmed number is validated against the Country Set found in the directlineMCI Property Record. If that PCC is blocked, programming to that number is not allowed. International numbers.","The International Terms flag (PIN bit ) is examined to ensure that the user is authorized to program a international number.","The Country Set from the directlineMCI Property Record is retrieved, and the application verifies that the programmed Country Code is not blocked for that Country Set.","Blocking checks for programming guest termination are included below.","The Call Flow diagram depicts the various situations for which a transfer to the Voice\/Fax Platform (VFP) is necessary.

Call extension delay is reduced additionally by removing inter-digit timeouts, as described previously. After launching a call and playing the script, the application awaits answer detection, at which time the user's directlineMCI access number (800\/8xx number) is out-pulsed to the VFP, followed by a \u2018*\u2019, then a single mode digit, which indicates to the VFP the type of transfer to process, followed by a \u2018#\u2019. The mode indicator is one of the values, described in the table that follows.

Introduction","A large percentage of calls on the PSTN are Fax calls. These calls send digital information encoded and modulated for analog transmission to the phone company's central office (CO). At the CO the analogue signal is digitized for continuous transmission across the PSTN at 64 Kbps. At the destination CO the digital signal is converted to analogue for transmission to the recipient Fax machine. Continuous transmission of international Fax traffic results in high utilization of scarce transmission capacity and incurs the high cost of international direct dial phone service.","B. Details","Currently, there is an increased interest in sending fax and voice over the Internet. In the past, facsimiles tended to be on the periphery of the network and did not utilize the intelligence inherent in the Internet. A preferred embodiment transparently routes faxes over the internet rather than tying up the telephone network. A network subsidized with appropriate logic can sense a fax call by sensing tones on the line. Then, the call can be directed to another piece of hardware or software that would then perform a fax over the Internet. The network performs routing by utilizing the destination fax machines phone number as an address. Then, by accessing the DAP, the appropriate gateway can be selected to route the call to the appropriate destination based on the phone number. This is accomplished by sending a routing request to the DAP. The DAP selects the destination gateway by one of several methods. One method may be by point of origin. That is, by table lookup a particular point of origin is assigned a particular destination gateway. Another method could be by a load balancing technique. The network logic can transparently detect normal telephone network activities and transmit them over the internet without affecting their integrity. One embodiment employs a double dialing scenario similar to the current telephone credit card. The first number is utilized to designate how the call was to be routed, while the second telephone number is used to route the call to the destination address like any other telephone call once the appropriate gateway was identified.","The detailed logic associated with the alternative routing of faxes on the Internet is accomplished by monitoring calls on trunk groups. Typically, a company or other organization will purchase capacity on a trunk line that can be utilized exclusively to service the requirements of the organization. The trunk group of a preferred embodiment is modified with appropriate sensing hardware which can be a hybrid network, such as, or including a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to divert faxes destined for predetermined carriers over a data network such as an internet or an X.25 network instead of the public switched network. The monitoring of the calls coming into a specific trunk group is performed transparently.","The trunk group comes into a bridging switch which diverts calls to an intelligent network. The intelligent network detects if the call is being directed to a particular country or city that is targeted for special routing treatment over the internet or another data network instead of the PSTN. If the call is not targeted for one of the country or city codes of interest the call is routed normally across the PSTN to its destination.","Dropping down one more level of detail, when the call comes into an MCI switch, the switch launches a DAP query requesting a route for the call. The DAP analyzes the call based on the number dialed and other profile information, and. routes the call to a fax done detection system. The fax tone detection system listens for fax CNG tone and if it detects a CHG tone, then a second phone call is placed to a fax internet gateway. When the fax internet gateway answers, the first and second call are bridged together at a bridging switch.","The required modification is to screen incoming calls by destination, For predetermined target destinations, the intelligent network holds the call for additional processing. This is accomplished according to a preferred embodiment illustrated in FIG. B. In that figure, an originating user's fax machine F1, is connected via switch  to the phone line. Switch  connects the call via switch  and places a routing request to the DAP  for routing data query purposes. The DAP is connected to a routing database such as a Long Term Regulatory Routing Database. The trunk is also connected to appropriate logic, only the Fax Tone Detector (FTD) is shown, at . That logic includes logic to route fax calls destined for predetermined countries to a fax gateway  via switches and  to an alternate data network  to a fax gateway  in the predetermined country. For countries other than the predetermined country, the switch  will send the call by way of the PSTN.","Operation of the above embodiment of  is seen with respect to the flow chart of FIG. C. At step  of the flow chart, the originating switch  of  receives the call. The call can be from a telephone, a PC, a fax machine F1, or other suitable device. Using the destination information associated with the call, the DAP is queried via Switch  at step . The DAP looks up the routing information and a decision is made at step  whether the destination is one of the predetermined countries, cities, or other locations of interest. If not, the call is handled through normal routing as in step .","If the call is for a predetermined destination of interest it is routed to the FTP as in step . The FTP then determines whether this call is a fax call at step . This may be done by attempting to detect a CNG tone by well known means. In one method of accomplishing this a timer can be used. If a CNG tone is not detected within a specified time period the call is assumed not to be a fax call. It is then released and bridged through normal routing over the PSTN as at step . If a CNG tone is detected, the call is released and bridged to fax gateway  as at step , the call is collected and the fax is transmitted over the alternate data network  over which it is sent to fax gateway  and then on to fax machine F at the destination point.","This may have further routing via a domain name that may have several countries. The Domain Name Server will distribute calls amongst several destinations via a lookup table. A gateway will be located in a destination country and a TCP\/IP session is set up with the gateway for control purposes. The data may be passed TCP or UDP based on the particular network characteristics. In any case, the dialed digits are passed to the origin gateway which forwards the digits to the destination gateway where the phone number is dialed.","The destination gateway then dials the destination number and engages a fax machine at the other end. The system utilizes two pairs of fax modems to convert a telephony signal to packets and back. Fax modems like any other modems negotiate for baud rate, but they do it each time a page is transmitted. Each side specifies its capabilities and they negotiate what speed they can support. First, start the transfer of fax information, then an ACK is transmitted after each page and finally the baud rate is renegotiated at 300 baud (LCD). Finally, the messages are received at the distant modem and the packet is repackaged as a fax package. At the end of every page, there is a renegotiating of baud rate based on error rate, and, if there are too many errors, the faxes will renegotiate to a lower speed before resending and\/or retransmitting the page.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the system detects that the destination telephone circuit has been connected before transmitting fax information. The overhead associated with this processing requires the following detriments to normal fax processing.\n\n","A. An Embodiment","The problem with current switched networks is that when you have a LEC connected via legislated feature group D trunks, providing inexpensive access is difficult because access charges are dictated by the LEC.","Therefore, if the Internet access is provided via a service which utilizes feature group D trunks, the cost passed on to the consumer is exorbitant. If the feature group D trunks are bypassed, and a dedicated network is provided, ie., the LEC is connected directly to a modem pool which provides access to the Internet, a second tier of problems arises. These problems include: scalability, survivability and inefficiency of design. Further, a modem would be necessary for each DSO purchased from the LEC. All of these problems are solved by the architecture discussed below.","Scalability is addressed by the CBLs described in  because the modem pool can be adjusted to meet the network traffic requirements. The CBLs can be adjusted to meet the requirements of the particular community of interest. In a dedicated network, a one-to-one relationship exists between CBLs and entries in a modem pool. Then, if a modem fails, the ability to service users is directly affected by the ability to utilize modems. By eliminating the direct correlation between the modem pools and the CBLs, the DAP can map calls to dynamic resources obtained through the network wherever they reside. This design is more efficient than any current architecture. A detailed discussion of this architecture ensues below.","The third problem which was overcome by a preferred embodiment was a direct result of solving the previous two problems. A method for routing a call in the network was required when only an origination indication is provided by a LEC. An embodiment incorporating the functionality of a hotline provides a solution to this problem. When an origination is detected on an incoming trunk (circuit) for which the hotline functionality is enabled, a database lookup is performed as an internal process of a switch's routing database. This database lookup results in a preliminary dialing plan (i.e. a 7 or 10 digit number) that will be used to determine the destination of the call. The hotline function resides in the switch, but it was not integrated into routing capability which exploited the DAP and allowed a switch to formulate a DAL procedure request without any calling information (ADF transaction) to the DAP. The request is transmitted over an X.25 protocol link, a local area network, an Optical Connection Three (OC3) ATM network, a frame relay, SMDS or other communication link to the DAP for processing. The DAP performs additional database lookups to determine the appropriate destination (in this case, it would be the SWitch ID (SWID) and Terminating Trunk Group (TTG) that corresponds with the trunk connection to the Modem Pool). The hotline is a foundation in the design that overcame the problems described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2493","num":"3951"},"figref":"FIG. 71","b":["10201","10205","10215","10225","10201","10205","10201","10210","10220","10201","10215","10225","10225","10245","10230","10201","10235","10235"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2494","num":"3952"},"figref":"FIG. 72","b":["10240","10241","10242","10243","10235","10230","10320"]},"For example, if a problem arises with Windows, a customer would call 1-800-FIX-WIN. The call enters the network at Originating Switch  which would initiate a transaction to a DAP - querying for appropriate routing information for the call. The queried DAP recognizes the number, creates a transaction and routes it to the appropriate gateway  that is connected to the appropriate CAP  (in this case the CAP associated with the Microsoft company). The CAP  receives the transaction and determines that the customer service center in New York is swamped, but the customer service center in California is not very busy (time of day could account for the reason in this case). The CAP  would send a response back to the queried DAP - (via the gateway ) indicating that this particular 1-800-FIX-WIN95 call should be routed to the California customer service center. The selected DAP - translates the transaction information into a specific Switch ID (SWID) and a specific Terminating Trunk Group (TTG) that corresponds to the route out of the MCI network necessary to arrive at the California customer service center. The selected DAP - transmits this response information to the originating switch  which routes the original call to 1-800-FIX-WIN95 to the correct Terminating switch , as indicated in the DAP response via the SWID.","The terminating switch  then determines the correct Terminating Trunk Group (TTG) utilizing information transmitted via SS network created from a parameter in the original DAP response, and routes the call to the California customer service center.

ARU  interrogates the destination number to determine whether the destination telephone is an international call or a domestic call. Domestic calls are returned to the termination switch  for conventional routing. International calls are encoded as data by providing the analog voice signal to coder\/decoder (or \u201ccodec\u201d) . Codec , having encoded the signal as digital data then routes the call through modem pool  and Basic Internet Protocol Platform .","In an alternate embodiment, when the call is delivered to the ISN by the network switch, an SS7 ISUP message is routed to the resident ISN switch. That switch is called a DMS-ACD. ACD stands for Automatic Call Distributor. The ACD takes an incoming SS7 ISUP message and converts it to SCAI (Switch\/ComputerApplication Interface). On the opposite side of the ACD is a device called an ISN-AP (Intelligent Services Network\u2014Adjunct Processor). SCAI is the language spoken between the ACD and the ISN-AP. So, there are two interfaces: on the inbound side from the network to the ACD a SS7 ISUP, and on the outbound side from the ACD to the ISN-AP a SCAI. These are simply two different signaling protocols.","When the call arrives at the ACD from the network, the ACD doesn't automatically know where to route the call. The ACD receives its instructions from the ISN-AP. To do that, the ACD takes the ISUP signaling parameters received from the network and converts them to SCAI protocol format and sends a SCAI message to the ISN-AP.","Specifically, the SCAI message is called DV_Call_Received (DV means Data\/Voice. When the ISN-AP receives this message it looks at the Called Party Number (CPN) field within the SCAI message and, based on that number, determines where in the ISN the ACD should route the call. When the ISN-AP has made the decision, the ISN-AP builds a DV_Call_Received_RR (a response to the previous message\u2014RR means Return Result). Within the RR message are instructions to the ACD regarding the ACD port to which the call should be terminated.","For this service, the ACD is instructed to terminate the call to the ACD ports connected to the ARU .

At that time, the ARU  will collect further information about the caller. This feature is a modified version of existing calling card services that telephone companies offer today. The ARU  first collects the card number, then collects the number the caller wishes to terminate to. After capturing this information, the ARU  sends the data across the ISN Local Area Network (LAN) to a validation data base. In addition to verifying the calling card number, the data base also ensures that the terminating number is within the allowed dialing plan for the card holder.","Once the card information is verified, the ARU  will then determine if the terminating number is domestic or international. If the terminating number is domestic, the ARU  will release the call from the ISN back into the voice network where the call will be routed to its intended destination. If the terminating number is international, the call will be routed to a device called a CODEC (COde DECode) resident at a BIPP site. The purpose of the CODEC is to convert the voice signal to data for routing over the Internet using UDP\/IP.","In an alternate embodiment, if the caller has called from a fax machine, at the ARU  voice prompt, the caller will press 2 indicative of a request for fax service. At that time, the ARU  will route the call to a fax platform that is a guaranteed fax service  for those who don't have the time or patience to wait for a terminating fax number to become available, or for those who need assistance delivering an international fax.

When a user makes a call, the call may be routed through one or more switches before reaching its destination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2530","num":"3993"},"figref":"FIG. 82","b":["30102","30104","30112","30106","30108","30110","30106","30110"]},"Each of the switches, -, is connected to two (2) or more Data Access Points (DAP) -, for instance a primary DAP - and a backup DAP -. A DAP - is a facility that receives requests for information from the switches -, processes the requests, and returns the requested information back to the requesting switch -. The switches - use information from the DAPs - to process calls through the network.","When a call passes through one of the switches, -, that switch creates a call record. The call record contains information on the call, including but not limited to: routing, billing, call features, and trouble shooting information. After the call is terminated, each switch - that processed the call completes the associated call record. The switches - combine multiple call records into a billing block.","When a switch - fills the billing block, the switch - sends the billing block to a billing center . Thus, the billing center  receives one billing block from each switch - that handled the call, which in this case would be three billing blocks. The billing center  searches each billing block and retrieves the call record associated with the call, thereby retrieving one call record per switch - that handled the call. The billing center  then uses one or more of the retrieved call records to generate a billing entry. The billing center  is also connected to each DAP - to retrieve information regarding a switch - or call record.","To better understand the invention, it is useful to describe some additional terminology relating to a telecommunication network. A telephone call comes into a switch on a transmission line referred to as the originating port, or trunk. The originating port is one of many transmission lines coming into the switch from the same location of origin. This group of ports is the originating trunk group. After processing an incoming call, the switch transmits the call to a destination location, which may be another switch, a local exchange carrier, or a private branch exchange. The call is transmitted over a transmission line referred to as the terminating port, or trunk. Similar to the originating port, the terminating port is one of a group of ports going from the switch to the same destination. This group of ports is the terminating trunk group.","Contemporary telecommunication networks provide customers with the capability of using the general public network as well as the capability of defining a custom virtual network (VNet). With a VNet, a customer defines a private dialing plan, including plan telephone numbers. A VNet customer is not limited to the default telephone numbers allocated to a public telecommunication system dedicated to a specific geographic region, but can define custom telephone numbers.","Upon processing a telephone call, a switch must generate a call record large enough to contain all of the needed information on a call. The call record, however, must not be so large that the typical call results in the majority of the record fields in the call record to be unused. In such a case, storing such call records results in large amounts of wasted storage, and transmitting such a call record causes unnecessary transmissions.","One solution for creating and processing call records is to implement a fixed length call record format, such as a 32-word call record. A word is two (2) bytes, or sixteen (16) bits. A fixed length record format, however, cannot expand when new call features are implemented. More importantly, fixed call record formats cannot handle expanded data fields as the telecommunications network becomes more complex with new features and telephone numbers.","Contemporary fixed length record formats include time point fields recording local time in three (3) second increments where local switch time represents the time of day at a switch. The timepoint fields are used by the network switches, billing center, and other network subsystems. Each subsystem, however, may require the time period for a different use and in a different format, such as in an epoch time format. Epoch time is the number of one (1) second increments since a particular date and time in history. For example, the billing center requires epoch time for its billing records whereas switch reports and error logs require local switch time.","A problem also arises when using only local switch time in that there is no accommodation for time changes due to daylight savings time. In addition, each subsystem may require a finer granularity of precision than the current three (3) second increments. By providing only local switch time at three (3) second increments, the switches have passed the burden of translating the time into a usable format to the network subsystems. The fixed record format cannot accommodate the various time period requirements because it only contains the time periods in local switch time at a low level of precision. Because of its fixed nature, the fixed record format cannot expand to include different time formats, nor to include a finer granularity of precision, such as a one (1) second increment.","Therefore, there is a need for switches of a telecommunications network to store call record information in a flexible and expandable format. There is a further need to provide time point fields with one (1) second granularity in a flexible format that easily and efficiently responds to daylight savings time and time zone changes.","There is also a need to match all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call. For example, for proper billing and cost control, it is necessary for the billing center to match the originating switch's call record to the terminating switch's call record. Also, for troubleshooting and security purposes, it may be necessary to trace a specific telephone call through the network with ease in order to isolate problem areas.","Therefore, there is a need for switches of a telecommunications network to uniquely identify each telephone call that traverses the network, thereby uniquely identifying all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call.","A. An Embodiment","1. Call Record Format","An embodiment solves the problem of providing a flexible and expandable call record format by implementing both a small and a large call record format. In particular, the embodiment implements a default 32-word call record format, plus an expanded 64-word call record format. An embodiment uses a 32-word call record format for the typical telephone call, which comprises the majority of all telephone calls, and uses a 64-word call record format when additional information is needed regarding the call. This implementation provides the flexibility needed to efficiently manage varying data requirements of a given call record. New call features can be developed and easily incorporated into the variable call record format of the present invention.","This embodiment also records timepoints in the epoch time format. The embodiment records the origination time of a call in epoch time format, and the remaining timepoints are offsets, or the number of seconds, from that origination time. This embodiment solves the problems associated with converting to and from daylight savings time because daylight savings time is a local time offset and does not affect the epoch time. Furthermore, the timepoints in epoch time format require less space in the call record than they do in local switch time format.","The epoch time format may represent coordinated universal time (UTC), as determined at Greenwich, England, which has a time zone of zero (0) local switch time, or any other time. Epoch time is only a format and does not dictate that UTC must be used. The billing time and the local switch time may be in UTC or local time, and the local switch time may not necessarily be the same time that is used for billing. Therefore, the switch must keep billing time and local switch time separate in order to prevent the problems that occur during daylight savings time changes.","2. Network Call Identifier","This embodiment solves the problem of uniquely identifying each telephone call and all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call by providing a unique identifier to each call record. It generates a network call identifier (NCID) that is assigned to each call record at the point of call origination, that is, the originating switch generates an NCID for each telephone call. The NCID accompanies the associated telephone call through the telecommunications network to the termination point at the terminating switch. Therefore, at any point of a telephone call in the network, the associated NCID identifies the point and time of origin of the telephone call. Each switch through which the telephone call passes records the NCID in the call record associated with the call. The NCID is small enough to fit in a 32-word call record, thereby reducing the data throughput and storage. The NCID provides the billing center and other network subsystems with the ability to match originating and terminating call records for a specific telephone call.","This embodiment also provides the switch capability of discarding a received NCID and generating a new NCID. A switch discards a received NCID if the NCID format is invalid or unreliable, thereby ensuring a valid unique identifier to be associated with each call going through the network. For instance, an NCID may be unreliable if generated by third party switches in the telecommunications network.","This embodiment relates to switches of a telecommunication network that generate call records using a flexible and expandable record format. The call record formats include a small (preferably 32-word) and a large (preferably 64-word) expanded format. It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to implement a small and large record format of different sizes.","The embodiment also relates to switches of a telecommunication network that generate a unique NCID for each telephone call traversing the network.

In this regard, the switch makes nine (9) checks for each call  that it receives. The switch uses an expanded record for a call  that passes any check as well as for a call  that passes any combination of checks.","The first check  determines if the call is involved in a direct termination overflow (DTO) at the current switch. For example, a DTO occurs when a customer makes a telephone call  to an  number and the original destination of the  number is busy. If the original destination is busy, the switch overflows the telephone call  to a new destination. In this case, the switch must record the originally attempted destination, the final destination of the telephone call , and the number of times of overflow. Therefore, if the call  is involved in a DTO, the switch must complete an expanded record (ECDR, EPNR, EOSR, EPOSR) .","The second check  made on a call  by a switch determines if the calling location of the call  is greater than ten (10) digits. The calling location is the telephone number of the location from where the call  originated. Such an example is an international call which comprises at least eleven (11) digits. If the calling location is greater than ten (10) digits, the switch records the telephone number of the calling location in an expanded record (ECDR, EPNR, EOSR, EPOSR) .","A switch makes a third check  on a call  to determine if the destination address is greater than seventeen (17) digits. The destination address is the number of the called location and may be a telephone number or trunk group. If the destination is greater than seventeen (17) digits, the switch records the destination in an expanded record (ECDR, EPNR, EOSR, EPOSR) .","A switch makes a fourth check  on a call  to determine if the pre-translated digits field is used with an operated assisted service call. The pre-translated digits are the numbers of the call  as dialed by a caller if the call must be translated to another number within the network. Therefore, when a caller uses an operator service, the switch records the dialed numbers in expanded record (EOSR, EPOSR) .","In a fifth check  on a call , a switch determines if the pre-translated digits of a call  as dialed by a caller without operator assistance has more than ten (10) digits. If there are more than ten (10) pre-translated digits, the switch records the dialed numbers in expanded record (ECDR, EPNR) .","In a sixth check  on a call , a switch determines if more than twenty-two (22) digits, including supplemental data, are recorded in the Authorization Code field of the call record. The Authorization Code field indicates a party who gets billed for the call, such as the calling location or a credit card call. If the data entry requires more than twenty-two (22) digits, the switch records the billing information in an expanded record (ECDR, EPNR, EOSR, EPOSR) .","In a seventh check  on a call , a switch determines if the call  is a wideband call. A wideband call is one that requires multiple transmission lines, or channels. For example, a typical video call requires six (6) transmission channels: one (1) for voice and five (5) for the video transmission. The more transmission channels used during a wideband call results in a better quality of reception. Contemporary telecommunication systems currently provide up to twenty-four (24) channels. Therefore, to indicate which, and how many, of the twenty-four channels is used during a wideband call, the switch records the channel information in an expanded record (ECDR, EPNR) .","In an eighth check  on a call , a switch determines if the time and charges feature was used by an operator. The time and charges feature is typically used in a hotel scenario when a hotel guest makes a telephone call using the operator's assistance and charges the call  to her room. After the call  has completed, the operator informs the hotel guest of the charge, or cost, of the call . If the time and charges feature was used with a call , the switch records the hotel guest's name and room number in an expanded record (EOSR, EPOSR) .","The ninth, and final, check  made on a call  by a switch determines if the call  is an enhanced voice service\/network audio response system (EVS\/NARS) call. An EVS\/NARS is an audio menu system in which a customer makes selections in response to an automated menu via her telephone key pad. Such a system includes a NARS switch on which the audio menu system resides. Therefore, during an EVS\/NARS call , the NARS switch records the customer's menu selections in an expanded record (EOSR, EPOSR) .","If none of the checks - return a positive result, then the switch uses the default record format (OSR, POSR) . Once the checks have been made on a call, a switch generates and completes the appropriate call record. Call record data is recorded in binary and Telephone Binary Coded Decimal (TBCD) format. TBCD format is illustrated below:\n\n","All TBCD digit fields must be filled with TBCD-Null, or zero, prior to data being recorded. Where applicable, dialed digit formats conform to these conventions:\n\n","Each call record, except SER, contains call specific timepoint fields. The timepoint fields are recorded in epoch time format. Epoch time is the number of one second increments from a particular date\/time in history. The embodiment of the present invention uses a date\/time of midnight (00:00 am UTC) on Jan. 1, 1976, but this serves as an example and is not a limitation. It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to implement an epoch time based on another date\/time. In the records, Timepoint 1 represents the epoch time that is the origination time of the call . The other timepoint stored in the records are the number of seconds after Timepoint 1, that is, they are offsets from Timepoint 1 that a particular timepoint occurred. All of the timepoint fields must be filled in with \u201c0's\u201d prior to any data being recorded. Therefore, if a timepoint occurs, its count is one (1) or greater. Additionally, timepoint counters, not including Timepoint 1, do not rollover their counts, but stay at the maximum count if the time exceeds the limits.","The switch clock reflects local switch time and is used for all times except billing. Billing information is recorded in epoch time, which in this embodiment is UTC. The Time offset is a number reflecting the switch time relative to the UTC, that is, the offset due to time zones and, if appropriate, daylight savings time changes. There are three factors to consider when evaluating time change relative to UTC. First, there are time zones on both sides of UTC, and therefore there may be both negative and positive offsets. Second, the time zone offsets count down from zero (in Greenwich, England) in an Eastward direction until the International Dateline is reached. At the Dateline, the date changes to the next day, such that the offset becomes positive and starts counting down until the zero offset is reached again at Greenwich. Third, there are many areas of the world that have time zones that are not in exact one-hour increments. For example, Australia has one time zone that has a thirty (30) minute difference from the two time zones on either side of it, and Northern India has a time zone that is fifteen (15) minutes after the one next to it. Therefore, the Time Offset of the call records must account for variations in both negative and positive offsets in fifteen (15) minute increments. The embodiment of the present invention satisfies this requirement by providing a Time Offset representing either positive or negative one minute increments. There are two formulas used to convert local switch time to epoch time and back.\n\n","The switch records the Time Offset in the SER using a value where one (1) equals one (1) minute, and computes the Time Offset in seconds and adds this value to each local Timepoint 1 before the call record is recorded. For example, Central Standard Time is six (6) hours before UTC. In this case, the Sign Bit indicates \u201c1\u201d for negative offset and the Time Offset value recorded in the SER would be 360 (6 hours*60 minutes\/hour=360 minutes). See  for more details on the SER record format. When recording Timepoint 1 in the call record, the switch multiplies the Time Offset by 60, because there is 60 seconds in each 1 minute increment, and determines whether the offset is positive or negative by checking the Sign Bit. This example results in a value of \u221221,600 (\u22121*360 minutes*60 seconds\/minute=\u221221,600 seconds). Using equation (ii) from above, if the local switch time were midnight, the corresponding epoch time might be, for example, 1,200,000,000. Subtracting the Time Offset of \u221221,600 results in a corrected epoch time of 1,200,021,600 seconds, which is the epoch time for 6 hours after midnight on the next day in epoch time. This embodiment works equally as well in switches that are positioned on the East side of Greenwich where the Time Offset has a positive value.","Two commands are used when changing time. First,  illustrates the control flow of the Change Time command , which changes the Local Switch Time and the Time Offset. In , after a switch operator enters the Change Time command, the switch enters step  and prompts the switch operator for the Local Switch Time and Time Offset from UTC. In step  the switch operator enters a new Local Switch Time and Time Offset. Continuing to step , the new time and Time Offset are displayed back to the switch operator. Continuing to step , the switch operator must verify the entered time and Time Offset before the actual time and offset are changed on the switch. If in step  the switch operator verifies the changes, the switch proceeds to step  and generates a SER with an Event Qualifier equal to two which identifies that the change was made to the Local Switch Time and Time Offset of the switch. The billing center uses the SER for its bill processing. The switch proceeds to step  and exits the command. Referring back to step , if the switch operator does not verify the changes, the switch proceeds to step  and exits the command without updating the Local Switch Time and Time Offset. For more information on SER, see FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2581","num":"4065"},"figref":["FIG. 91","FIG. 91"],"b":["31000","31002","31004","31004","31006","31006","31010","31004","31010"]},"In step , the switch operator must verify the forward or backward option and the new Local Switch Time and Time Offset before the actual time change takes place. If in step , the switch operator verifies the new time and Time Offset, the switch proceeds to step  and generates a SER with an Event Qualifier equal to nine which changes the Local Switch Time and Time Offset of the switch. The switch proceeds to step  and exits the command. Referring back to step , if the switch operator does not verify the changes, the switch proceeds to step  and exits the command without updating the Local Switch Time and Time Offset.","After the successful completion of a Change Daylight Savings Time Command, the billing records are affected by the new Time Offset. This embodiment allows the epoch time, used as the billing time, to increment normally through the daylight savings time change procedure, and not to be affected by the change of Local Switch Time and Time Offset.","2. Network Call Identifier","An embodiment provides a unique NCID that is assigned to each telephone call that traverses through the telecommunications network. Thus, the NCID is a discrete identifier among all network calls. The NCID is transported and recorded at each switch that is involved with the telephone call.","The originating switch of a telephone call generates the NCID. The chosen embodiment of the NCID of the present invention is an eighty-two (82) bit identifier that is comprised of the following subfields:\n\n","It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to create an NCID of a different format. Each switch records the NCID in either the 32 or 64-word call record format. Regarding the 32-word call record format, intermediate and terminating switches will record the NCID in the AuthCode field of the 32-word call record if the AuthCode filed is not used to record other information. In this case, the Originating Switch ID is the NCS Switch ID, not the alphanumeric Switch ID as recorded in the SER call record. If the AuthCode is used for other information, the intermediate and terminating switches record the NCID in the 64-word call record format. In contrast, originating switches do not use the AuthCode field when storing an NCID in a 32-word call record. Originating switches record the subfields of the NCID in the corresponding separate fields of the 32-word call record. That is, the Originating Switch ID is stored as an alphanumeric Switch ID in the Switch ID field of the SER call record; the Originating Trunk Group is stored in the Originating Trunk Group field of the 32-word call record; the Originating Port Number is stored in the Originating Port field of the 32-word call record; the Timepoint 1 is stored in the Timepoint 1 field of the 32-word call record; the Sequence Number is stored in the NCID Sequence Number field of the 32-word call record. The 32-word call record also includes an NCID Location (NCIDLOC) field to identify when the NCID is recorded in the AuthCode field of the call record. If the NCID Location field contains a \u20181,\u2019 then the AuthCode field contains the NCID. If the NCID Location field contains a \u20180,\u2019 then the NCID is stored in its separate sub-fields in the call record. Only intermediate and terminating switches set the NCID Location field to a \u20181\u2019 because originating switches store the NCID in the separate fields of the 32-word call record.","Regarding the 64-word call record format, the expanded call record includes a separate field, call the NCID field, to store the 82 bits of the NCID. This call record is handled the same regardless of whether an originating, intermediate, or terminating switch stores the NCID. In the 64-word call record format, the Originating Switch ID is the NCS Switch ID, not the alphanumeric Switch ID as recorded in the SER call record.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-2589","num":"4078"},"figref":"FIG. 92","b":["30106","30110","31104","31104","30202","31106","31106","31108","31108","31112"]},"In step , the switch analyzes the originating trunk group parameters to determine the originating trunk group type. If the originating trunk group type is an InterMachine Trunk (IMT) or a release link trunk (RLT), then the switch proceeds to step . An IMT is a trunk connecting two normal telecommunication switches, whereas a RLT is a trunk connecting an intelligent services network (ISN) platform to a normal telecommunication switch.
