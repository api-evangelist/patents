title: Quick payment using mobile device binding
abstract: Methods and systems are provided for secure device binding that provides user convenience through avoiding repetitive logging in when changing apps or moving from website to website. A mobile device undergoes binding to an account so that customers do not always have to enter their password when going through a financial transaction process, on a known (e.g., registered) mobile device. A device may be bound during an initial login, and once logged in, the user can select an option to be “remembered” so that the user need not re-login on the same device for future visits with an app or to a website that shares the service provider library.

Technical Field","The present disclosure generally relates to electronic commerce conducted over a network using a mobile or other consumer electronic device and, more particularly, to providing a secure device binding that provides user convenience through avoiding repetitive logging in when changing apps or moving from website to website.","2. Related Art","Electronic commerce generally refers to the buying and selling of products or services over electronic networks such as the Internet and other computer networks using electronic devices such as mobile phones with mobile web browsers, smart phones, and electronic note pads. The huge volume of electronic commerce has given rise to a need for the ability to make secure transactions, such as payments for purchases, over the network. There are several service providers that facilitate electronic commerce by providing services to make payments and perform other transactions with security. For example, one service provider describes itself as acting like a digital wallet where the customer can securely store the customer's payment options\u2014such as the customer's bank account and credit card\u2014so that when the customer wants to make a payment, the customer doesn't have to pull out his or her credit card or type his or her billing information every time. This service provider provides a service that can be invoked from a participating merchant's website, for example, by simply clicking on the service provider's checkout button at the merchant website, which redirects the customer to a login page of the service provider where the customer can securely log in to his or her service provider account and select his or her preferred payment method. Then, for example, payment is made to the merchant by the service provider, and the customer is redirected back to the merchant website where the customer may confirm his or her purchase.","According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, methods and systems are provided for secure device binding that provides user convenience through avoiding repetitive logging in when changing apps or moving from website to website. In one embodiment, a mobile device is bound, or undergoes binding, to an account with a service provider to enable a streamlined authentication flow so that customers do not always have to enter their password when going through a payment flow, or other financial transaction process, on a known mobile device. A device may be bound during an initial login, and once logged in, the user can select an option to be \u201cremembered\u201d for future visits to any app or website that shares the service provider library so that the user need not re-login as long as the user is \u201cremembered\u201d. A log in may nevertheless be required, however, in certain situations such as a high dollar amount purchase or a situation with unusual circumstances.","In one or more embodiments, a system includes a processor for communicating over a network with a user device, in which the processor executes a process that binds the user device to a user account so that a secure connection is maintained with the processor when a user switches between a first app on the user device and a second app on the user device or when the user switches between a first website viewed on the user device and a second website viewed on the user device.","In another embodiment, a computer-implemented method includes: communicating over a network with a user device; binding the user device to a user account; and using the binding to maintain a secure connection with the user device when a user switches between a first app on the user device and a second app on the user device or when the user switches between a first website viewed on the user device and a second website viewed on the user device.","In a further embodiment, a computer program product comprises a non-transitory computer readable medium having computer readable and executable code for instructing a processor to perform a method that includes: communicating over a network with a user device; binding the user device to a user account; and using the binding to maintain a secure connection with the user device when a user switches between a first app on the user device and a second app on the user device or when the user switches between a first website viewed on the user device and a second website viewed on the user device.","According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, methods and systems are provided for secure device binding that provides user convenience through avoiding repetitive logging in when changing apps (application programs) or moving from website to website. In one embodiment, a mobile device is bound, or undergoes binding, to an account\u2014for example, with a service provider, merchant, bank, or other commercial entity\u2014to enable a streamlined authentication flow so that customers do not always have to enter their password when going through a payment flow, or other financial transaction process, on a known mobile device. This device binding can serve as the basis for functionality such as skipping redundant login in various payment flows, risk management processes and models, and other device-based logic. In one embodiment, a device is bound during an initial login, for example, through device interrogation to get a device identification (ID) which may include one or more device identifiers. Once logged in, the user can select an option to be remembered for future visits to any app or website that shares a service provider library. As a result, when the user accesses another app or website through the mobile device, there is no need to go through a login process. A login may be required in certain situations, such as a high dollar amount purchase. A key feature of one embodiment is that it allows the user to bypass login across all apps on the user device that use the service provider library. In addition, the feature can be activated selectively, where a user chooses which apps on the device to stay logged in for. The feature can also be extended to apps from merchants that are not part of the service provider library but do call the library or the service provider to process a purchase request from the user.","Device binding may be based on a unique device identifier which is present on the device (e.g., international mobile equipment (IMEI) number, name of device, various date modified checks, and other variables, or a combination of identifiers). Use of such a device-unique identifier may enable the service provider to remember a user across apps on a device if the user wants to skip subsequent logins on a device. Multiple mobile devices may be bound to a single account. In one embodiment, each mobile device may have only one bound user (e.g., the most recent). The bound user may be able to manage the login preferences of the device. Multiple users will, however, be able to log in on the device, switching who is the most recent and active user and possibly switching who is the bound user. At the service provider back-end (e.g., a database that is automatically maintained by processors of the service provider and connected to network servers) all users of a device may remain associated with that device. In another embodiment, each device can be attached to multiple accounts that share the common device. In these cases, login could be determined based on preferences or other knowledge of which app was being used. For a transition between data models, the service provider can migrate any current conflicts where two users have the same device on their accounts into the new model, such as by running a script to make the bound user the active user or the one who has last used the device.","In one or more embodiments, interoperability with other process flows is possible. In one example, using a mobile web based checkout flow the device binding may occur when the user comes from an app using the service provider library. The mobile web based checkout flow may be used when a web flow is launched or embedded inside an app. The mobile web based checkout flow may represent the payment provider's express checkout flow, but may also be generalized to a web-based flow where pages are rendered via HTML (hypertext markup language). For mobile web based checkout flow, a token may be passed in to the mobile web based checkout flow referencing the device information. For a native library for checkout via mobile apps, the device binding may occur when using the service provider libraries. Generally, the library can do this on behalf of the app developer, whereas with the web flow, information needs to be passed to the web browser to link the two. The app or mobile website can be a shopping or commerce app, P2P (peer-to-peer) money transfer app, or any other type of service that needs to use the login provided by the financial service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","130","120","120","106","106"]},"Mobile device  may be, for example, a laptop, smart phone, iPad\u00ae from Apple, or other mobile computing or communication devices, televisions with internet connection, set-top boxes or other network-connected devices. Mobile device , which may function as a client (and may also be referred to as \u201cclient device\u201d ) may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and software configured for wired or wireless communication over network . For example, mobile device  may be implemented as a personal computer of user  (e.g., a client or customer) in communication with network . Also for example, mobile device  may be implemented as a wireless telephone (e.g., cell phone), personal digital assistant (PDA), or notebook computer.","As seen in , a browser app  may run on mobile device  and may be used to provide a user interface to permit user  to browse information available over network . For example, browser app  may be implemented as a web browser to view information available over network . In one implementation, browser app  may comprise a software program such as a graphical user interface (GUI) executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with merchant  and service provider  via network . For example, user  may access merchant websites via merchant  to find and purchase items. User , through client mobile device , may also communicate with service provider server  to create an account and make a payment to the merchant  via service provider . Mobile device  may include other apps  as may be desired to make additional features available to user , including making quick payments with service provider server . For example, apps  may include interfaces and communication protocols that allow the user  to receive and transmit information through online sites via network . Apps  may also include security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over network  and various other types of generally known programs and applications.","Merchant  may be a service provider (for example, a merchant site, an auction site, a marketplace, or a social networking site including P2P money transfer or any other P2P-like information transfer) offering various items such as products or services through their website. Merchant  (which could be any representative or employee of the merchant) may process online transactions from consumers making purchases through the merchant site from mobile devices. Merchant  also may operate a merchant server  capable of handling various on-line transactions automatically, for example, by communicating over network  with client mobile device  and service provider server . Merchant server  may run a purchase app  for offering products or services for purchase. Merchant server  may also run a browser app  and other applications . Browser app  and other applications  may enable the merchant to access a service provider  web site and communicate with service provider server ; for example, to convey and receive information to allow a quick payment through the service provider . In accordance with one or more embodiments, consumers (e.g., user ) may access apps for making transactions (e.g., payments) with a merchant  through a service provider ) without having to log in, which may enable quicker service (e.g., completing payment processing) with service provider server .","Service provider  may be an online payments provider, for example, providing processing for online financial and information transactions with a merchant  on behalf of a user . Service provider server  may include one or more identity apps , which may be adapted to interact with the client mobile device  as well as merchant server  over network  to facilitate the purchase of items, products, and services by user . Service provider server  may be configured to maintain multiple user and merchant accounts in an account database ; each merchant account may include or be separate from account information  associated with individual users, including user  and one or more merchants . For example, account information  may include identity information of user  and merchants , such as one or more full names, business names, street addresses, email addresses and phone numbers, website addresses, or other types of financial information, which may be used to facilitate online transactions between user  and merchants . Account information  or identity app  may also include device identifiers (e.g., unique device identifier present on the device, as described above, such as IMEI number) for user devices such as mobile device . Thus, identity app  may be configured to interact with a merchant server , a user , mobile device , or other payee to process, obtain, and store information for allowing quick payments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","120","200","100"]},"At step , a user  may communicate over a network , using a mobile device , with a merchant , using the merchant's purchase app , for example, to browse the merchant's website and arrive at viewing a shopping cart page such as that shown in . Tithe user clicks the pay button  in , the user may be redirected to a page such as , and method  may continue at step .","At step , user  may login to an account  belonging to or associated with user  by entering, for example, a username (e.g., email address) and a password in an account login dialog box  of a non-option login page, as shown at . Alternatively, as shown at , user  may be presented at step  with a login page where user  may login to an account  belonging to or associated with user  by entering, for example, a username (e.g., phone number or email address as shown) and a personal identification number (PIN) in an account login dialog box  of a login page that provides an option, for example, using a checkbox , for the process flow to remember the user  (using, e.g., machine ID as described above). The login page shown in  may be referred to as an option login page in contradistinction to the non-option login page shown in .","At step  of , user  may be presented\u2014as shown, for example, at FIG. C\u2014with a review page that allows the user to review and possibly change transaction or other information before committing to the transaction. If the user  clicks on the continue button , user  may be taken to a payment or other confirmation page such as that shown in , for example. The confirmation page may provide the user  with a final opportunity to review or modify the transaction or information exchange, or user  may complete the transaction, for example, by clicking the place order button  shown in . Upon completing the transaction, user  may be shown a final confirmation such as the payment complete page shown, for example, at . Method  may then continue at decision block  shown in .","At step , if user  has at some point (e.g., at step  in  or step  in ) opted in, for example, by checking the check box on an option login page, such as checkbox  shown in , then the user's mobile device  has undergone binding to the user  and user's account information , and if the binding is still in effect the user can skip any further login process and may be returned to the merchant's app or another app running on device , so method  may continue at step  as shown in . Otherwise, method  may continue at step  as shown in .","At step , if the user has a PIN (e.g., the PIN may have been created previously at step ) then any further login process may be abbreviated through use of the PIN. The user's PIN may provide enhanced security by being associated to the user's mobile device  along with the user's mobile device  having undergone binding (as described further below) yet at the same time provide extra convenience by avoiding a complete re-login when switching apps or website. If the user  has a PIN, user  may, for example, enter the PIN and method  may continue at step  as shown in , similar to the case (e.g., step ) in which the user  has elected to be remembered but this case (step ) may require PIN entry rather than being simply automatic.","If the user  does not have a PIN, method  may continue at step  as shown in . At step , user  may wish to have a username created (e.g., a phone number, email address, or other suitable identifier may be used) and to have a PIN created, typically a 4 to 6-digit number, and associated with the user's username. Creating the username and PIN may include associating the username and PIN to the user (e.g., user ) and the user's account (e.g. account information ).","If at step , the user (e.g., user ) does not need a username or PIN or, for whatever reason, decides that he or she does not want to create either or both, step  may be skipped, and method  may continue at step  as shown in . Otherwise, the PIN (and a username if needed) may be created at step  and associated with the user (e.g., user ) and the user's account (e.g. account information ).","At step , if the user  has opted in, e.g., by checking \u201ckeep me logged in\u201d check box  in , then any page displayed by the merchant's app (e.g., browser app  or other apps  on mobile device ) to the user  may include personalized information (e.g., user name personalized information  shown in ) to provide confidence to the user  that the app recognizes the user  and that user  is indeed still logged in.  shows, for example, a review page that provides a payment button  and personalized information  by which the user  may know that a payment is credited to the account associated with personalized information  when payment button  is clicked on or selected.  also shows that a \u201cnot you?\u201d switch user button  may be provided. For example, if a phone is shared between family members, the switch user button may provide a convenient, fast way to reset the device binding or be redirected to a login page such as a quick PIN login page for abbreviated login using the other family member's PIN without having to go through a full login process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["102","120","200","100","211","102","106","104","130","134","302","200","212"]},"At step , although the user  has not opted in (e.g., there is no device binding in effect) the user  does have a PIN so user  may login to an account  belonging to or associated with user  by entering, for example, a PIN, as seen at . Method  may then continue at step  of , as shown in . If the user  has, for example, forgotten the PIN or for any reason does not wish to use it, the user  may still use the \u201cregular\u201d user name and password login so method  provides the user  the alternative to continue at step  of , as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 2","FIG. 2B"],"b":["102","120","200","100","221","102","106","104","130","134","302","200","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 2","FIG. 2C"],"b":["102","120","200","100","231","102","106","104","130","134","302","200","203","202","102","200","202","102"]},"Returning to step , for example, of , if it is the first time (based on device interrogation, e.g., identity app  of service provider  polls mobile device ) that a device  is connecting to the service provider , the service provider  may register the device  during its first authentication. Device  will not be associated with any account  or user  at this time. (This case is the same as if the previous owner (bound user) had removed the device from their account.) When authentication is happening, the service provider  may pass additional parameters for device binding. These parameters may be passed directly or as referenced in a token. The choice may differ on whether the device  is connecting to a web flow (e.g., EC, express checkout) or a pure API flow (e.g., MPL, mobile payment library). Examples of parameters for device binding from the service provider  mobile library include device information, such as device ID, device ID type (UDID) or IMEI, platform (e.g., Apple\u00ae, Android\u00ae), device name (e.g., Joe's iPhone\u00ae), device category (e.g., phone, computer), device model (e.g., iPod Touch\u00ae), operating system (OS) information, such as OS version and OS name, app information, such as app name (bundle display name), app ID (such as bundle ID used by Apple, Inc.), bundle name (different from above), and PayPal\u00ae x.com app ID. During authentication, the service provider  may not need to use a hash for subsequent authentication attempts because that can make logging in with a different account more problematic and may not work with two-factor authentication tokens.","When the user  has successfully logged in, the service provider  can associate the user's account  with the user device  which was previously registered. At that moment, the user  is bound to this device . A risk management analysis may be performed by the service provider  to determine whether the device can be registered to the account. For example, there might be a blacklisted account or device that should not be bound. If the device cannot be registered with that particular account, the service provider  can display an error message and not let the transaction be completed. The account database  can be updated to reflect the new registration of the device  to the account . The app  or  can also be added to that device  on that account . This may enable the service provider  to see which apps are being used on a particular user's device . Note that this does not imply that binding is happening at the app level. A device  may be registered regardless of what happens with the payment once authentication is completed. An email or other suitable notification can then be sent to the user ","After registration, the payment flow may continue normally (as outlined above, for example, with reference to ). The transaction or information exchange can be associated with a particular app (e.g., an app ) on a particular device (e.g., device ) so that the service provider  can run reports and make this information visible for administration conducted by the service provider .","Once the device  is registered, the service provider  can send an email or text to the user  (e.g., buyer) to let the user know what happened, what it means, and how the user can update it. The binding may happen before the payment is completed so the \u201cyour device is registered\u201d email may come before the payment complete email. The registration email can also be sent even if the payment is not completed as long as the registration is completed during log in. The email can inform the user that the device is registered (e.g., the email may say what the device is and may show a picture). The user  can also be given information on how to remove (e.g., unregister) the device  or opt-in.","Returning to , B, and C, the following example illustrates a process for a subsequent authentication from the same user. Note that there could be cases where the service provider  allows multiple people to have the same device . If the next login on the device  is from same user as the first time, no further action is required for binding the device  to the account . The app name and app ID should be passed and stored in so they can be associated with the transaction and listed as an app that is being used by the device  (this information may be visible in the profile and in admin in database , for example, but may not be needed). Generally, the device  and app ,  information may still be passed in as to associate the device and apps with a particular transaction.","There may be cases where a different user  may log in than was expected (someone who was not the currently active and registered user  on the device ). In such a case, when a new account  (e.g., different user ) successfully logs in, the service provider  may remove the device  as being actively associated with the previous account . Any preferences or settings on the device  may also be removed (when such preferences exist). The removal may free up the device  for the second user  to log in with the device  (assuming, for example, risk management of service provider  approves of the new relationship). In these cases, the process flow of method  may behave as it does for the first-time authentication (including any emails being sent to the new user ). The removal may also enable the new user  to attach the new user's own preferences to the device  (when such preferences exist). Only the current user  may see their active device  in their profile; and the current user  should only see the apps the current user  has used since the device  was most recently activated on the user's own account.","The following provides a description according to one or more embodiments (e.g., with reference to one of steps , , , , or  of method  illustrated in , A, B, and C) for a merchant  to use, e.g., to provide a quick pay feature on the merchant's site. Before beginning the checkout flow, merchant  may need to call an initialization function in a library (which may be included with other apps ). Inputs may include the app ID and environment (e.g., sandbox or live) and return a reference token. Once the merchant  calls the library initialization function, the service provider  library can call a corresponding API to connect to the back-end service provider servers (e.g., server ). Inputs may be an app ID and device-app-operating system information and return a reference token. The reference token mentioned above will then be used during the authentication to link the device  to the account (e.g., an account  that belongs to user ) that logs in.","When the user  logs in, the device  may be bound to the account  if it was not already. The user  may use merchant apps to shop for items and navigate to a checkout flow. The merchant  may launch a Web-View session within an app  to render checkout flow on the merchant's mobile site. The user  may navigate to a screen or webpage with a service provider button (e.g., item details, shopping cart, payment methods).","The following is an example: User  is using Device  with App , App , and App . At this point, User 's profile and administration (e.g., in database  of service provider ) may show Device  with Apps , , and  as being active. User  then logs in with Device  on App . At this point, User  would no longer see Device  in their profile. However, an administration agent would see Device  listed on User 's account (marked as disabled) and would see App , , and  marked as inactive. User  would see Device  in their profile with App  underneath it. An administration agent looking up User 's account would see the same. User  then logs back in to Device  on App . User  would now see Device  in their profile, but they would only see App  listed below it. An administration agent looking up User 's account, would see Device  as enabled. Underneath Device , the administration agent would see App  as active. The administration agent would also see App  and  as inactive. User  would not see Device  in their account profile. An administration agent may be able to see listings of current status.","A device  may be unbound or removed in several use cases, such as from a user profile, from administration, or when a second user logs in with the same device . When a device  is removed, it should no longer appear in the User 's profile. It should still be associated with the User 's account from a back-end model such that the information can be used by administration, risk management, or for reporting. The new status of device  (e.g., removed) should be reflected in the administration account for User . It should be available for another to account (User ) to add. The service provider  may email the user  when a device is unbound (as this is not always done explicitly by the user but may be done by administration agent or risk rules, for example). This can also signal to the user  that the user's device is being used by someone else. This email can convey that the device  was removed from the account  so the user  can report any fraudulent activity (and, for example, get the device  listed as restricted). The next login on the device  may require a password authentication and can look like the first time through (e.g., step ) to a user . If the device  is removed as a result of another user logging in during the checkout flow, the service provider  can still capture and use any opt-in preferences set during that login (just as if it were the first time through).","The service provider  may maintain a transaction history, such as which app ,  and device  a payment was made from. This could be particularly important to help identify transactions made without user authentication. These details may be different for the buyer and seller. The buyer may want to see both the device  and app ,  used. The seller may only see the app name.","Users may have the ability to manage settings, such as disable or enable an existing device  for staying logged in and view apps that have been used. Since the device binding can be at a device level or app level, users (e.g., user ) do not need to be able to take action on these applications , , but they may want to know which apps have been used on their device . In embodiments where the device binding is at an app level, the users may take actions on the applications directly.","The service provider  may also have the ability to manage settings, such as updating tables so that administration agents can see the status of a device  on an account  as active (or other relevant term), maintain the ability for an administration agent to look up a device  or click on a device ID in the table of a user's devices, which can load up a list of accounts  that have been bound to the device . This list may include devices  that have been removed. The service provider  may identify which app ,  was used and which device  was used for each mobile payment library (MPL) transaction.","During a device interrogation call (based on the current information passed in), the service provider  may decide what type of user-entered information will be required for authentication. In one embodiment, possible choices for user entry are a password or PIN via the merchant's app or nothing (e.g., quick pay). For devices  that are not registered, quick pay may not be used. The buyer may have to log in via a password or PIN the first time as described above. In the device interrogation call, the service provider  may not pass back any additional information about the user  that can be pre-filled since the service provider  has not seen the device  before or the device  has been removed from an account . The service provider  can also choose the channel in which the authentication should be done. For example, service provider  may choose if the authentication can be done from the native app (e.g. apps ), or if it is required to be done via a browser (e.g., browser ).","For devices  that are registered, the authentication type may be either quick pay or a PIN or password. The device interrogation calls may also need to pass back additional information that can be used for the login flow, which can include opt-in preference (so method  may know if box , for example, should be pre-checked), primary email address (to pre-fill email box), name (to display for quick pay), and phone number (to use for PIN login if a PIN exists on the account).","The choice for authentication can be influenced by whether the user  is eligible for quick pay and opted in and whether the user  who created a PIN will be eligible for PIN authentication in a merchant's app.","During any of the flows where the service provider  collects a password or PIN, the user  may be presented with the option (such as a check box like checkbox  shown in ) to be remembered on the device . The option is not just limited to the first time device registration. A user  can opt-in during the PIN flow or when using the password flows. The option may be a device level preference (e.g., not an app level preference).","Certain emails can be sent when the user  opts-in during a purchase flow. If the device  was not yet registered, a registration email can include the user preference. If the device  was registered, and the preference was previously off, the user  may receive an email showing the current preference of user . If the device  was registered, and the preference was on, no email may need to be sent. This case can occur if a user  opted-in previously, but risk models indicated to the user  to enter a password on a future time of login. This case can also occur if the user  \u201clogged out\u201d then logged back in during a subsequent purchase.","Certain emails can be sent when the user  opts-out during a purchase flow. If a device  was not registered to this consumer (e.g., user ), a registration or binding email can mention the user's preference. If a device  was already registered to this consumer (e.g., user ), there may be no need to send another email.","Certain emails can be sent when the user  opts-out from the web or administration. If a preference is toggled via web or administration, an email can be sent to the user  as a confirmation.","In the situation where a password or PIN is required (e.g., step  or  of method ), a login page (e.g.,  or ) may allow the user to enter the password or PIN. If the buyer (e.g., user ) opted-in to quick pay, the user  may be returned to the merchant  without needing to enter credentials for the service provider . The merchant  can display any necessary success page (e.g., similar to ). If the buyer (e.g., user ) opted-out of quick pay, then a determination may be made whether the buyer has a PIN on their account . If the buyer already has a PIN on their account, the buyer (e.g., user ) may be returned to the merchant . The merchant  can display any necessary success page. If the user  does not have a PIN, then the user  may creates a PIN, e.g., as at step . A PIN creation page may allow the user  to create a phone-PIN combination. The combination may only be available for users in countries that support mobile PINs. This is an optional step, and the user  can go back to the app (e.g., app  or browser ) if the user  does not want to create a PIN. After successfully creating a PIN, the user  may be informed and given a way to return to the merchant .","In the situation where no password or PIN is required (e.g., using quick pay), a merchant's page may displays the user's name (e.g., personalized information  as shown in ) and an indication that the user  does not need to log in. Even with quick pay, a user  may be required to enter a password if the service provider  requests, such as with large payment requests or other risk triggers. The user  can then make the payment on the merchant page.","A user  may chose to \u201clog out\u201d before starting a payment flow. Once a user  logs out, the user  should be notified that the user  logged out. This may be done by taking the user  to the email-password page to log in with a different account . After a log out, the service provider  may not load the PIN-specific page if in the same flow. Instead, the next login should be a password login. In one embodiment, this can be handled on the client side. In another, it could be done on the server side as decided on by any business or risk logic. The settings of the device  can be updated such that any preferences to skip login are now turned off. The device  does not need to be removed from the account  as a result of this action. Instead, it can be removed when a subsequent user  logs into another account  with that device . This way the device  stays attached until it is used by someone else.","Once the user  navigates to checkout flow, the merchant app may make a call to initialize the service provider library, passing its application ID. Note that the merchant app can call the service provider library prior to checkout flow (either when merchant app is launched, or when merchant app launches a Web-View for checkout flow).","The following provides examples for situations where the checkout flow may be through the web (e.g., mobile express checkout using browser ) as opposed to in the app (e.g., a native app  running on device ).","The service provider  may perform device interrogation in the background (invisible to user ) to extract device ID and other information and may respond with an initialization code. If the user  clicks on or otherwise selects the service provider button on the merchant's mobile website, the merchant back-office server (e.g., server ) may make an API call with the parameters for the transaction including the return and cancel URLs (uniform resource locaters) to the service provider server .","The merchant mobile web site may show the user  a Payment Confirmation screen (e.g., similar to ) with final purchase, shipping, tax amounts, or a Payment Complete screen (e.g., similar to ). If the user  clicks \u201cComplete order\u201d on the Payment Confirmation screen, the merchant app may notify the merchant back-end server  to complete payment. Merchant back-end server  may make an API call to make a payment.","If a merchant  does not have a mobile web checkout flow already, the merchant  may still follow the flow above. However, the merchant  may open the Web-View directly to the redirect URL following the API call (including the initialization code). The merchant  may listen for the Return or Cancel URL to close out the Web-View session if the merchant  does not have a page to display. However, the merchant can still call the Get and Do calls as needed.","In implementation of the various embodiments, embodiments of the invention may comprise a personal computing device, such as a personal computer, laptop, PDA, cellular phone or other personal computing or communication devices. The payment provider system may comprise a network computing device, such as a server or a plurality of servers, computers, or processors, combined to define a computer system or network to provide the payment services provided by a payment provider system.","In this regard, a computer system may include a bus or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as a processing component (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), a system memory component (e.g., RAM), a static storage component (e.g., ROM), a disk drive component (e.g., magnetic or optical), a network interface component (e.g., modem or Ethernet card), a display component (e.g., CRT or LCD), an input component (e.g., keyboard or keypad), and\/or cursor control component (e.g., mouse or trackball).
