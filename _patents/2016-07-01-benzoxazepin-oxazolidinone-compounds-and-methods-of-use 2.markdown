The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Upregulation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)\/Akt signaling pathway is a common feature in most cancers (Yuan and Cantley (2008) Oncogene 27:5497-510). Genetic deviations in the pathway have been detected in many human cancers (Osaka et al (2004) Apoptosis 9:667-76) and act primarily to stimulate cell proliferation, migration and survival. Activation of the pathway occurs following activating point mutations or amplifications of the PIK3CA gene encoding the p110\u03b1 (alpha) PI3K isoforms (Hennessy et al (2005) Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 4:988-1004). Genetic deletion or loss of function mutations within the tumor suppressor PTEN, a phosphatase with opposing function to PI3K, also increases PI3K pathway signaling (Zhang and Yu (2010) Clin. Cancer Res. 16:4325-30. These aberrations lead to increased downstream signaling through kinases such as Akt and mTOR and increased activity of the PI3K pathway has been proposed as a hallmark of resistance to cancer treatment (Opel et al (2007) Cancer Res. 67:735-45; Razis et al (2011) Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 128:447-56).","Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) is a major signaling node for key survival and growth signals for lymphomas and is opposed by the activity of the phosphatase PTEN. The phosphoinositide 3-dependent kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is the most dysregulated pathway in hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR+BC). The PI3K pathway is also dysregulated in aggressive forms of lymphoma (Abubaker (2007) Leukemia 21:2368-2370). Eight percent of DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) cancers have PI3CA (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase catalytic subunit alpha) missense mutations and 37% are PTEN negative by immunohistochemistry test.","Phosphatidylinositol is one of a number of phospholipids found in cell membranes, and which participate in intracellular signal transduction. Cell signaling via 3\u2032-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, e.g., malignant transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity (Rameh et al (1999) J. Biol Chem. 274:8347-8350). The enzyme responsible for generating these phosphorylated signaling products, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (also referred to as PI 3-kinase or PI3K), was originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al (1992) Trends Cell Biol 2:358-60). Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are lipid kinases that phosphorylate lipids at the 3-hydroxyl residue of an inositol ring (Whitman et al (1988) Nature, 332:664). The 3-phosphorylated phospholipids (PIP3s) generated by PI3-kinases act as second messengers recruiting kinases with lipid binding domains (including plekstrin homology (PH) regions), such as Akt and PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (Vivanco et al (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:489; Phillips et al (1998) Cancer 83:41).","The PI3 kinase family comprises at least 15 different enzymes sub-classified by structural homology and are divided into 3 classes based on sequence homology and the product formed by enzyme catalysis. The class I PI3 kinases are composed of 2 subunits: a 110 kd catalytic subunit and an 85 kd regulatory subunit. The regulatory subunits contain SH2 domains and bind to tyrosine residues phosphorylated by growth factor receptors with a tyrosine kinase activity or oncogene products, thereby inducing the PI3K activity of the p110 catalytic subunit which phosphorylates its lipid substrate. Class I PI3 kinases are involved in important signal transduction events downstream of cytokines, integrins, growth factors and immunoreceptors, which suggests that control of this pathway may lead to important therapeutic effects such as modulating cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. Class I PI3Ks can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively. Class II PI3Ks phosphorylate PI and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Class III PI3Ks can only phosphorylate PI. A key PI3-kinase isoform in cancer is the Class I PI3-kinase, p110\u03b1 as indicated by recurrent oncogenic mutations in p110\u03b1 (Samuels et al (2004) Science 304:554; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,824,492; 5,846,824; 6,274,327). Other isoforms may be important in cancer and are also implicated in cardiovascular and immune-inflammatory disease (Workman P (2004) Biochem Soc Trans 32:393-396; Patel et al (2004) Proc. Am. Assoc. of Cancer Res. (Abstract LB-247) 95th Annual Meeting, March 27-31, Orlando, Fla., USA; Ahmadi K and Waterfield M D (2004) \u201cPhosphoinositide 3-Kinase: Function and Mechanisms\u201d Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry (Lennarz W J, Lane M D eds) Elsevier\/Academic Press), Oncogenic mutations of p110\u03b1 (alpha) have been found at a significant frequency in colon, breast, brain, liver, ovarian, gastric, lung, and head and neck solid tumors. About 35-40% of hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer tumors harbor a PIK3CA mutation. PTEN abnormalities are found in glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate, endometrial, ovarian, breast, lung, head and neck, hepatocellular, and thyroid cancers.","PI3 kinase (PI3K) is a heterodimer consisting of p85 and p110 subunits (Otsu et al (1991) Cell 65:91-104; Hiles et al (1992) Cell 70:419-29). Four distinct Class I PI3Ks have been identified, designated PI3K \u03b1 (alpha), \u03b2 (beta), \u03b4 (delta), and \u03b3 (gamma), each consisting of a distinct 110 kDa catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. Three of the catalytic subunits, i.e., p110 alpha, p110 beta and p110 delta, each interact with the same regulatory subunit, p85; whereas p110 gamma interacts with a distinct regulatory subunit, p101. The patterns of expression of each of these PI3Ks in human cells and tissues are distinct. In each of the PI3K alpha, beta, and delta subtypes, the p85 subunit acts to localize PI3 kinase to the plasma membrane by the interaction of its SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (present in an appropriate sequence context) in target proteins (Rameh et al (1995) Cell, 83:821-30; Volinia et al (1992) Oncogene, 7:789-93).","The PI3 kinase\/Akt\/PTEN pathway is an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit cellular proliferation, to repress signals from stromal cells that provide for survival and chemoresistance of cancer cells, to reverse the repression of apoptosis and surmount intrinsic resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic agents. PI3K is activated through receptor tyrosine kinase signaling as well as activating mutations in the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, or through rare activating mutations in AKT.","Taselisib (GDC-0032, Roche RG7604, CAS Reg. No. 1282512-48-4, Genentech Inc.), named as 2-(4-(2-(1-isopropyl-3-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-5,6-dihydrobenzo[f]imidazo[1,2-d][1,4]oxazepin-9-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2-methylpropanamide, has potent PI3K activity (Ndubaku, C. O. et al (2013) J. Med. Chem. 56:4597-4610; WO 2011\/036280; U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104; 8,343,955) and is being studied in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Taselisib (GDC-0032) is a beta-isoform sparing inhibitor of the PI3K catalytic subunit, 31\u00d7 more selective for the alpha subunit, compared to beta. Taselisib displays greater selectivity for mutant PI3K\u03b1 isoforms than wild-type PI3K\u03b1 (Olivero A G et al, AACR 2013. Abstract DDT02-01). Taselisib is currently being developed as a treatment for patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the phase Ia study with single agent taselisib, partial responses (PRs) were observed in 6\/34 enrolled patients. All 6 responses were observed in patients with PIK3CA mutant tumors (Juric D. et al. AACR 2013), indicating the need to determine PIK3CA mutation status from patients treated with taselisib.","Recent clinical data with PI3K inhibitors has implicated PI3K delta activity as a source of gastrointestinal toxicities (Akinleye et al Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors as cancer therapeutics\u201d Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2013, 6:88-104; C. Saura et al \u201cPhase Ib Study of the PI3K Inhibitor Taselisib (GDC-0032) in Combination with Letrozole in Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer\u201d San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium\u2014Dec. 12, 2014, PD5-2; Lopez et al \u201cTaselisib, a selective inhibitor of PIK3CA, is highly effective on PIK3CA-mutated and HER2\/neu amplified uterine serous carcinoma in vitro and in vivo\u201d (2014) Gynecologic Oncology).","Idelalisib (GS-1101, CAL-101, ZYDELIG\u00ae, Gilead Sciences Inc., CAS Reg. No. 870281-82-6, 5-fluoro-3-phenyl-2-[(15)-1-(7H-purin-6-ylamino)propyl]-4(3H)-quinazolinone) is a selective PI3K\u03b4 (delta) inhibitor and approved for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia, CLL (Somoza, J. R. et al (2015) J. Biol. Chem. 290:8439-8446; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,800,620; 6,949,535; 8,138,195; 8,492,389; 8,637,533; 8,865,730 8,980,901; RE44599; RE44638). Diarrhea and colitis are among the most common adverse events reported after idelalisib treatment (Brown et al \u201cIdelalisib, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110d, for relapsed\/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia\u201d (2014) Blood 123(22):3390-3397; Zydelig\u00ae Prescribing Information 2014; Zydelig\u00ae REMS Fact Sheet). The significant GI toxicities observed after treatment with idelalisib are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of PI3K\u03b4 (delta) is a source of gastrointestinal toxicities. Additional serious side effects were seen in clinical trials of idelalisib (Zydelig\u00ae) in combination with other therapies. Adverse events, including deaths have been tied to infections such as pneumonia. In March 2016, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) issued a provisional warning and a recommendation that patients receive antibiotic co-treatment and are routinely monitored for infection when taking Zydelig (idelalisib). In March 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an alert that \u201csix clinical trials exploring idelalisib (Zydelig\u00ae) in combination with other therapies have been halted due to reports of an increased rate of adverse events, including death\u201d.","There is a need for additional modulators of PI3K\u03b1 that are useful for treating cancers, particularly an inhibitor of PI3K\u03b1 that is selective for mutant PI3K\u03b1 expressing tumors relative to non-mutant PI3K\u03b1 expressing cells. There is especially a need for such an agent that selectively inhibits the PI3K\u03b1 isoform relative to the PI3K\u03b2, PI3K\u03b4, and PI3K\u03b3 isoforms, which may be expected to result in an enhanced therapeutic window.","The invention relates generally to benzoxazepin oxazolidinone compounds with selective activity in modulating mutant forms of the PI3K\u03b1 (alpha) isoform, and having the Formula I structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"40.39mm","wi":"63.42mm","file":"US09650393-20170516-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"and stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those with the condition or disorder.","The phrase \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d refers to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A \u201ctumor\u201d comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (\u201cNSCLC\u201d), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","\u201cHematological malignancies\u201d (British spelling \u201cHaematological\u201d malignancies) are the types of cancer that affect blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. As the three are intimately connected through the immune system, a disease affecting one of the three will often affect the others as well: although lymphoma is a disease of the lymph nodes, it often spreads to the bone marrow, affecting the blood. Hematological malignancies are malignant neoplasms (\u201ccancer\u201d), and they are generally treated by specialists in hematology and\/or oncology. In some centers \u201cHematology\/oncology\u201d is a single subspecialty of internal medicine while in others they are considered separate divisions (there are also surgical and radiation oncologists). Not all hematological disorders are malignant (\u201ccancerous\u201d); these other blood conditions may also be managed by a hematologist. Hematological malignancies may derive from either of the two major blood cell lineages: myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. The myeloid cell line normally produces granulocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, macrophages and mast cells; the lymphoid cell line produces B, T, NK and plasma cells. Lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, and myeloma are from the lymphoid line, while acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative diseases are myeloid in origin. Leukemias include Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Lymphomas include Hodgkin's lymphomas (all four subtypes) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL, all subtypes).","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action.

Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of the invention, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a Formula I compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. Enantiomers may be separated from a racemic mixture by a chiral separation method, such as supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Assignment of configuration at chiral centers in separated enantiomers may be tentative, and depicted in Table 1 structures for illustrative purposes, while stereochemistry is definitively established, such as from x-ray crystallographic data.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d denotes salts which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include both acid and base addition salts. The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and\/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and\/or the mammal being treated therewith.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt\u201d denotes those pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, and organic acids selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, aryl-aliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic, and sulfonic classes of organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, gluconic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, aspartic acid, ascorbic acid, glutamic acid, anthranilic acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, embonic acid, phenylacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid \u201cmesylate\u201d, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and salicyclic acid.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt\u201d denotes those pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed with an organic or inorganic base.

It is measured using competition binding assays and is equal to the concentration where the particular inhibitor would occupy 50% of the receptors if no competing ligand (e.g. a radioligand) was present. Ki values can be converted logarithmically to pKi values (\u2212log Ki), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency.","The term \u201cIC\u201d is the half maximal inhibitory concentration and denotes the concentration of a particular compound required for obtaining 50% inhibition of a biological process in vitro. ICvalues can be converted logarithmically to pICvalues (\u2212log IC), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. The ICvalue is not an absolute value but depends on experimental conditions e.g. concentrations employed, and can be converted to an absolute inhibition constant (Ki) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Biochem. Pharmacol. (1973) 22:3099). Other percent inhibition parameters, such as IC, IC, etc., may be calculated.","The terms \u201ccompound of this invention,\u201d and \u201ccompounds of the present invention\u201d and \u201ccompounds of Formula I\u201d include compounds of Formulas I and stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.","Any formula or structure given herein, including Formula I compounds, is also intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof.","Any formula or structure given herein, including Formula I compounds, is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds.

Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited to 2H (deuterium, D), 3H (tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F, 31P, 32P, 35S, 36Cl, and 125I. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 13C, and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labeled compounds may be useful in metabolic studies, reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. Deuterium labeled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the invention may have improved DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) properties, relating to distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. An 18F labeled compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent in the compound of the formula (I). The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \u201cH\u201d or \u201chydrogen\u201d, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly, in the compounds of this invention any atom specifically designated as a deuterium (D) is meant to represent deuterium.","Benzoxazepin Oxazolidinone Compounds","The present invention provides benzoxazepin oxazolidinone compounds of Formula I, and pharmaceutical formulations thereof, which are potentially useful in the treatment of cancer, having the structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0064"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"40.39mm","wi":"63.42mm","file":"US09650393-20170516-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"and stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:","Ris selected from \u2014CH, \u2014CHCH, cyclopropyl, and cyclobutyl;","Ris selected from \u2014CH, \u2014CHF, \u2014CHF, and \u2014CF.","Exemplary embodiments of Formula I compounds include wherein Ris \u2014CH.","Exemplary embodiments of Formula I compounds include wherein Ris cyclopropyl.","Exemplary embodiments of Formula I compounds include wherein Ris \u2014CHF.","Exemplary embodiments of Formula I compounds include the compounds in Table 1.","The Formula I compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms.

For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","Biological Evaluation","The relative efficacies of Formula I compounds as inhibitors of an enzyme activity (or other biological activity) can be established by determining the concentrations at which each compound inhibits the activity to a predefined extent and then comparing the results. Typically, the preferred determination is the concentration that inhibits 50% of the activity in a biochemical assay, i.e., the 50% inhibitory concentration or \u201cIC\u201d. Determination of ICvalues can be accomplished using conventional techniques known in the art. In general, an ICcan be determined by measuring the activity of a given enzyme in the presence of a range of concentrations of the inhibitor under study. The experimentally obtained values of enzyme activity then are plotted against the inhibitor concentrations used. The concentration of the inhibitor that shows 50% enzyme activity (as compared to the activity in the absence of any inhibitor) is taken as the ICvalue. Analogously, other inhibitory concentrations can be defined through appropriate determinations of activity. For example, in some settings it can be desirable to establish a 90% inhibitory concentration, i.e., IC, etc.","Exemplary Formula I compounds in Table 1 were made, characterized, and tested for binding to various isoforms and mutant forms of PI3K according to the methods of this invention, and have the following structures, corresponding names (ChemBioDraw, Version 12.0.2, CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge Mass.), and biological activity.

The Ki values shown in Tables 2A and 2B represent the geometric mean of a minimum of three independent experiments unless otherwise noted.","Table 2A shows the biochemical inhibition of four PI3K isoforms by the Formula I compounds of Table 1. In addition, two clinically tested PI3K compounds, taselisib and pictilisib are included as comparators. The representative compounds of the invention exhibit strong activity against PI3K\u03b1, and exhibit significantly enhanced selectivity relative to the other isoforms PI3K\u03b2, PI3K\u03b4, and PI3K\u03b3 when compared to taselisib (GDC-0032) and pictilisib (GDC-0941). In particular, the selectivity ratios in the second from the right column of Table 2A show that each Formula I compounds 101-107 has a PI3K alpha to delta selectivity ratio far higher than taselisib or pictilisib. In fact, both taselisib and pictilisib have stronger activity against PI3K delta than against PI3K alpha, i.e. their selectivity ratios are less than 1. The selectivity ratios of Formula I compound 101-107 range from 301-fold to 634-fold.","Table 2B shows the biochemical inhibition of two PI3K isoforms, alpha and delta and the PI3K alpha to delta selectivity ratios for certain comparator compounds of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104, and a compound bearing a dimethyloxazolidin-2-one group from U.S. Pat. No. 8,263,633 (Compound 356, column 149). The comparator compounds shown here in Table 2B are examples from the broad genuses described in each of U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104 and 8,263,633. Neither U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104 nor 8,263,633 disclose a compound within the scope of the Formula I compounds of the invention. While the representative comparator examples of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104 as described in Table 2B demonstrate PI3K\u03b1 (alpha) vs. PI3K\u03b4 (delta) selectivity ratios>1, the maximum observed selectivity ratio is 46.9-fold. Formula I compounds 101-107 therefore achieve significantly higher selectivity ratios than examples of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104. There is no guidance in either U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104 or 8,263,633 to make the selection of structural elements of the Formula I compounds to achieve the property of high PI3K alpha selectivity versus PI3K delta. This unexpected property of greater than 300-fold PI3K alpha selectivity is conserved across the entire spectrum of the compounds exemplified in Table 1.","Current PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials, such as taselisib (WO 2011\/036280; U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104; 8,343,955), and other representative examples of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104 exhibit significant activity against the PI3K\u03b4 (delta) isoform. This lack of selectivity vs. PI3K\u03b4 (delta) is consistent with observed GI toxicity in the clinic for taselisib. There exists a need for inhibitors of PI3K\u03b1 (alpha) that contain the favorable characteristics representative of examples of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104 that are simultaneously lacking activity against PI3K\u03b4 (delta). The current invention provides compounds that meet this activity and selectivity profile.","The unexpected property of PI3K alpha selectivity is advantageous to remove gastrointestinal toxicity observed in clinical PI3K inhibitor candidates. Recent clinical data with PI3K inhibitors has implicated PI3K delta activity as a source of gastrointestinal toxicities (Akinleye et al, \u201cPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors as cancer therapeutics\u201d Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2013, 6:88-104). See Table 2 of PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials, taselisib and pictilisib.","With significantly higher selectivity for PI3K\u03b1 (alpha) inhibition relative to PI3K\u03b4 (delta) inhibition, Formula I compounds 101-107 would therefore be expected to achieve a greater margin between clinical activity driven by PI3K\u03b1 (alpha) inhibition relative to toxicities driven by PI3K\u03b4 (delta) inhibition, as compared to the clinically tested taselisib and pictilisib or any of the examples of U.S. Pat.

Optimized structural design of PI3K inhibitors with selectivity for the PI3K\u03b1 isoform over other isoforms may include precise positioning and arrangement of atoms and functional groups to interact with isoform-specific residues in the binding site. Particularly, substitution at the 9-position and at the 2-position of the 5,6-dihydrobenzo[f]imidazo[1,2-d][1,4]oxazepine ring system are found to have critical impacts on specific activity of compounds against PI3K\u03b1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-D","FIG. 1A"]},"As shown in , reference compound 529 (U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104) contains a primary amide functional group in a similar position to that of taselisib. This functionality is within appropriate distance and of appropriate geometry of both Ser854 and Gln859 to make hydrogen-bonding interactions. The 46.9-fold selectivity ratio for PI3K\u03b1 relative to PI3K\u03b4 (see Table 2B) may be rationalized in light of these interactions, and the knowledge that PI3K\u03b4 does not contain a Gln residue at position 859 and therefore these interactions should be specific to PI3K\u03b1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIGS. 1C and 1D","FIGS. 1C and 1D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},"All compounds of the invention contain an oxazolidinone ring and are able to make the improved interaction with Tyr836 of PI3K\u03b1 (alpha). Some examples of the invention also contain a fluorinated substituent on the oxazolidinone ring and are able to make the improved interaction with Ser774 of PI3K\u03b1. Both of these binding interactions may contribute to the enhanced selectivity for PI3K\u03b1 observed for examples of the invention relative to examples of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104. As shown in Tables 2A and 2B, compounds which contain the oxazolidinone ring have higher isoform selectivity than comparable compounds which contain the triazole ring. The residues Ser774 and Tyr836 are not unique to the PI3K\u03b1 isoform, PI3K\u03b4 contains these same residues at the same positions, and the enhanced isoform selectivity of the oxazolidinone inhibitors is not predicted by these crystal structures. Subtle differences in the positioning and orientation of the same residue identity between different isoforms may result from subtle changes in secondary and tertiary protein structure. These differences are difficult to predict and interpret even in the face of x-ray crystal structures of both protein isoforms. The surprising and unexpected properties of improved molecular interactions and enhanced isoform selectivity of oxazolidinone inhibitors is conserved across the entire spectrum of the compounds exemplified in Table 1.","The oxazolidinone is structurally differentiated from the triazole in that the oxazolidinone has a carbonyl, is more polar, and does not have aromatic character. The triazole does not have a carbonyl group, is less polar, and has aromatic character.","The oxazolidinone ring provides a further benefit relative to the triazole ring in terms of increased sp3 character and reduced aromatic ring count. It is generally accepted in the literature that an increased number of aromatic rings is correlated with an increased risk of promiscuous binding. By contrast, an increase in the fraction of sp3 carbons (# sp3 carbons\/# total carbons) is correlated with improved physicochemical properties and decreased promiscuous binding, decreasing the risk of off-target toxicology. These concepts are described in the references Lovering et. al, \u201cEscape From Flatland\u201d, (2009) J. Med. Chem., 52:6752-6756 and Ritchie and Macdonald, \u201cPhysicochemical Descriptors of Aromatic Character and Their Use in Drug Discovery\u201d, (2014) J. Med. Chem., 57:7206-7215. The replacement of the triazole aromatic ring as exemplified by representatives of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104 with a saturated heterocyclic ring, the oxazolidinone contained within every example of the invention, represents a favorable decrease in the risk of off-target toxicology. The entirety of exemplified compounds in U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104 are overwhelmingly populated by compounds with aromatic rings at this position, 4 examples of a carboxamide functional group replacing the aromatic ring, and no examples of saturated cyclic or heterocyclic systems. Due to the significantly different binding interactions and steric requirements of aromatic and saturated heterocycles, they are typically not interchangeable. With no examples of saturated heterocyclic systems at the 2-position of the 5,6-dihydrobenzo[f]imidazo[1,2-d][1,4]oxazepine ring, U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104 provides no guidance as to a method for replacing the aromatic ring with a saturated heterocycle while retaining activity against PI3K\u03b1.","Accordingly, compounds of the invention contain optimized substituents and functionality at both the 5,6-dihydrobenzo[f]imidazo[1,2-d][1,4]oxazepine 9-position and 2-position. These optimized compounds provide a significant and heretofore unknown benefit with respect to improved molecular interactions and increased selective activity against PI3K\u03b1, with reduced activity against PI3K\u03b4. The compounds of the invention may be useful as therapeutic agents with an enhanced therapeutic window relative to related agents such as taselisib (GDC-0032).","Selective Inhibition of Mutant PI3K\u03b1 (Alpha)","The ability of a compound of the invention to act preferentially against cells containing mutant PI3K\u03b1 was determined by measuring inhibition of the PI3K pathway in SW48 isogenic cell lines: PI3K\u03b1 wild-type (parental), helical domain mutant E545K, and kinase domain mutant H1047R, as described in the methods of Example 902.","Statistical Analysis: EC50 values represent the geometric mean of a minimum of 4 independent experiments unless otherwise noted. All statistics were performed using KaleidaGraph Software (version 4.1.3). A Student t-Test was performed using unpaired data with equal variance to compare activity against mutant cells and wild-type cells. P<0.05 is considered to be significant.","Table 3A shows the inhibition of P-PRAS40 in SW48 isogenic cells by the Formula I compounds of Table 1. These compounds all display increased activity against the mutant PI3K\u03b1 cells relative to the wild-type PI3K\u03b1 cells. Compounds of the invention show similar activity as taselisib in SW48 mutant PI3K\u03b1 cells, with equal or greater selectivity than taselisib relative to activity in the wild-type PI3K\u03b1 cells (see Table 3B).","Table 3B shows the inhibition of P-PRAS40 in SW48 isogenic cells by certain comparator compounds of U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104, a compound bearing a dimethyloxazolidin-2-one group from U.S. Pat. No. 8,263,633 (Compound 356, column 149), and pictilisib. The comparator compounds shown here in Table 3B are examples from the broad genuses described in each of U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104 and 8,263,633. Neither U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,242,104 nor 8,263,633 disclose a compound within the scope of the Formula I compounds of the invention. The comparator compounds contain examples that do not have significantly increased activity for the mutant PI3K\u03b1 cells relative to the wild-type PI3K\u03b1 cells (see comparator compounds 436 and 549, p>0.05). These compounds are very structurally similar to comparator compounds that do exhibit significantly increased activity for the mutant PI3K\u03b1 cells relative to the wild-type PI3K\u03b1 cell (see comparator compound 529). There is no common structural element within the comparator compounds that provides guidance towards selective inhibition of mutant PI3K\u03b1 (alpha) cells. More broadly, there is no guidance in either U.S. Pat.

Formula 1 compounds 101 and 103 at >5-fold free exposure multiples over TGI60 (tumor growth inhibition 60% in a PI3K-mutant xenograft study) do not promote a pro-inflammatory signature as determined by clinical pathology or anatomic pathology evaluation (Table 11a, 11b). Similarly, compounds 101 and 103 produce only minor amounts of lymphoid depletion at high exposure multiples. In contrast, experiments with comparator compound taselisib indicate significant pro-inflammatory effects and lymphoid depletion at <0.3-fold free exposure over TGI60 (Table 11c). Comparator compounds alpelisib (BYL-719) and compound 436 (U.S. Pat. No. 8,242,104) also cause inflammation and lymphoid depletion at lower exposure multiples compared to Formula 1 compounds 101 and 103 (Table 11d, 11e).

Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.","A dose to treat human patients may range from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg of Formula I compound. A typical dose may be about 10 mg to about 300 mg of the compound. A dose may be administered once a day (QID), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.","Methods of Treatment with Formula I Compounds","Formula I compounds of the present invention are useful for treating a human or animal patient suffering from a disease or disorder arising from abnormal cell growth, function or behavior associated with PI3K such as cancer, may thus be treated by a method comprising the administration thereto of a compound of the present invention as defined above. A human or animal patient suffering from cancer may also be treated by a method comprising the administration thereto of a compound of the present invention as defined above. The condition of the patient may thereby be improved or ameliorated.","Methods of the invention also include treating cancer selected from breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, genitourinary tract, esophagus, larynx, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, stomach, skin, keratoacanthoma, lung, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bone, colon, adenoma, pancreas, adenocarcinoma, thyroid, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, seminoma, melanoma, sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, liver carcinoma and biliary passages, kidney carcinoma, pancreatic, myeloid disorders, lymphoma, hairy cells, buccal cavity, naso-pharyngeal, pharynx, lip, tongue, mouth, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's, leukemia, bronchus, thyroid, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, hepatocellular, gastric, glioma\/glioblastoma, endometrial, melanoma, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, uterine corpus, uterine cervix, multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), myeloid leukemia, oral cavity and pharynx, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, and villous colon adenoma.","Based on expression analysis, immunohistochemical analysis and on cell line profiling, malignancies of the colon, breast, cervix, stomach, lung, and multiple myeloma are most likely to respond to PI3K modulators or inhibitors.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","In order to use a compound of this invention for the therapeutic treatment of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of Formula I having the desired degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to ameliorate, or treat the hyperproliferative disorder.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations of compounds of Formula I may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of a compound of Formula I suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of Formula I. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom. Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral use. Formulations of compounds of Formula I intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.","For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs. The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween\u00ae 60, Span\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of Formula I compounds contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of Formula I may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w\/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w\/w, for example about 1.5% w\/w.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of Formula I may be employed alone or in combination with additional therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as inflammation or a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula I is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with an additional, second therapeutic compound that has anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating an inflammation, immune-response disorder, or hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The additional therapeutic may be a Bcl-2 inhibitor, a JAK inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunomodulatory agent, chemotherapeutic agent, an apoptosis-enhancer, a neurotropic factor, an agent for treating cardiovascular disease, an agent for treating liver disease, an anti-viral agent, an agent for treating blood disorders, an agent for treating diabetes, and an agent for treating immunodeficiency disorders. The second therapeutic agent may be an NSAID anti-inflammatory agent. The second therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, in combination with a therapeutic agent such as an NSAID.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other therapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or separate infusions. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","In a particular embodiment of therapy, a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other therapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formula I and the other pharmaceutically active therapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","Additional therapeutic agents employed in combination with a compound of Formula I include 5-FU, docetaxel, eribulin, gemcitabine, cobimetinib, ipatasertib, paclitaxel, tamoxifen, fulvestrant, GDC-0810, dexamethasone, palbociclib, bevacizumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab and letrozole.","Metabolites of Compounds of Formula I","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of Formula I described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided. In one embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert on or associated with the container. The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of Formula I or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a compound of Formula I. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In addition, the label or package insert may indicate that the patient to be treated is one having a disorder such as a hyperproliferative disorder, neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, pain, migraine or a neurotraumatic disease or event. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the composition comprising a compound of Formula I can be used to treat a disorder resulting from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of Formula I and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit comprises a first composition comprising a compound of Formula I and a second pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a patient in need thereof","In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a compound of Formula I, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a \u201cblister pack\u201d. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.","According to one embodiment, a kit may comprise (a) a first container with a compound of Formula I contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a composition of Formula I and a second therapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.","Preparation of Formula I Compounds","Compounds of Formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well-known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein, and those for other heterocycles described in: Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, Editors Katritzky and Rees, Elsevier, 1997, e.g. Volume 3; Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, (9):1910-16, (1985); Helvetica Chimica Acta, 41:1052-60, (1958); Arzneimittel-Forschung, 40(12):1328-31, (1990), each of which are expressly incorporated by reference. Starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, , v. 1-23, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-2006 ed.), or 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database).","Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing Formula I compounds and necessary reagents and intermediates are known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1999); and L. Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.","The Examples provide exemplary methods for preparing Formula I compounds. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the Formula I compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted and discussed in the Figures and Examples, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and\/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the exemplary compounds prepared by the described methods can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.","In preparing compounds of Formulas I, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.","In the methods of preparing Formula I compounds, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like. Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved, such as, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J. Org. Chem. (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. Chromatogr., (1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Compounds of the invention were prepared as illustrated in general Schemes 1 and 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0184"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00027","num":"00027"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00027","he":"187.62mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09650393-20170516-C00027.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"As shown in Scheme 1, 4-bromo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde 2 may be obtained by formylating commercially available 3-bromophenol.

Drug doses were prepared weekly and stored at 4 C.","Treatment:","Mice were given (Vehicle) or stated mg\/kg dosage of PI3K compounds (expressed as free-base equivalent), PO by gavage daily for 21-28 days in a volume of 100 \u03bcL, microliters (5 mL\/kg).","Endpoint:","Tumor volume was measured in 2 dimensions (length and width), using Ultra Cal 0 calipers (Model 54 10 111; Fred V. Fowler Company), as follows: tumor volume (mm)=(length\u00d7width)\u00d70.5 and analyzed using Excel version 11.2 (Microsoft Corporation). A linear mixed effect (LME) modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement of tumor volumes from the same animals over time (Pinheiro J, et al. nlme: linear and nonlinear mixed effects models, 2009; R package version 325. This approach addresses both repeated measurements and modest dropouts due to any non-treatment-related death of animals before study end. Cubic regression splines were used to fit a nonlinear profile to the time courses of log 2 tumor volume at each dose level. These nonlinear profiles were then related to dose within the mixed model. Tumor growth inhibition as a percentage of vehicle control (% TGI) was calculated as the percentage of the area under the fitted curve (AUC) for the respective dose group per day in relation to the vehicle, using the following formula: % TGI=100\u00d7(1\u2212AUC\/AUC). Using this formula, a TGI value of 100% indicates tumor stasis, a TGI value of more than (>) 1% but less than (<) 100% indicates tumor growth delay, and a TGI value of more than (>) 100% indicates tumor regression. Partial response (PR) for an animal was defined as a tumor regression of more than (>) 50% but less than (<) 100% of the starting tumor volume. Complete response (CR) was defined as 100% tumor regression (i.e., no measurable tumor) on any day during the study.","Toxicity:","Animals were weighed daily for the first five days of the study and twice weekly thereafter. Animal body weights were measured using an Adventurer Pro\u00ae AV812 scale (Ohaus Corporation). Percent weight change was calculated as follows: body weight change (%)=[(weight\u2212weight)\/weight]\u00d7100. The mice were observed frequently for overt signs of any adverse, treatment-related side effects, and clinical signs of toxicity were recorded when observed. Acceptable toxicity is defined as a group mean body weight (BW) loss of less than 20% during the study and not more than one treatment-related (TR) death among ten treated animals. Any dosing regimen that results in greater toxicity is considered above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A death is classified as TR if attributable to treatment side effects as evidenced by clinical signs and\/or necropsy, or may also be classified as TR if due to unknown causes during the dosing period or within 10 days of the last dose, A death is classified as NTR if there is no evidence that death was related to treatment side effects.","Cell lines were grown under standard tissue culture conditions in RPMI media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U\/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg\/mL streptomycin. HCC-1954 and HDQ-P1 are breast cancer cell lines (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, Va. HCC-1954 and HDQ-P1 cells were placed in each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate at 800,00 cells\/well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of each compound for 24 hours. Following incubation, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Biosource\u2122 Cell Extraction Buffer (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with protease inhibitors (F. Hoffman-LaRoche; Mannheim, Germany), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, Mo.). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Rockford, Ill.).","Protein Assays","Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Rockford, Ill.). For immunoblots, equal protein amounts were separated by electrophoresis through NuPage Bis-Tris 4-12% gradient gels (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.); proteins were transferred onto Nitrocellulose membranes using the IBlot system and protocol from InVitrogen. Antibodies to p110alpha, and phospho-Akt (Ser473), were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, Mass.). Antibodies to \u25a1-actin and GAPDH were from Sigma.","Cell Culture:","Human whole blood was dispensed into 96-deep well plates at 100 \u03bcl per well. Compounds were diluted in DMSO to generate the desired stock concentrations and then further diluted in PBS to the desired working concentration and added in a volume of 5.5 \u03bcL per well. Samples were then incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. under 5% CObefore the addition of 5 \u03bcg (10 \u03bcl per well) of Goat anti IgM. F(ab\u2032)2 (Southern Biotech, AL), and incubated for 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C. under 5% CO. All treatments were tested in duplicate.","Cell Isolation and Staining Procedures:","After incubation, the level of CD69 expression on CD19 CD27 cells was determined by staining the whole blood samples with a cocktail of CD27; 10 \u03bcl\/well (clone L128; BD Biosciences, N.J.) CD19; 7.5 \u03bcl\/well (clone SJ25C1; BD Biosciences, N.J.) and CD69; 10 \u03bcl (clone FN50; BD Biosciences, N.J.). In addition, human whole blood from each donor was stained with isotype-matched fluorescent control antibodies. After the addition of the appropriate antibody cocktail the whole blood samples were stained for 30 minutes in the dark and then lysed using BD Pharm Lysis (BD Bioscience, N.J.). The resulting samples were then washed with FACS Buffer (Phosphate Buffered Saline (Ca\/Mg++ free), 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (Heat-Inactivated) and fixed in FACS Buffer supplemented with 0.1% Formaldehyde (Polysciences Inc, PA) and 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma, Mo.). Data were acquired using a BD LSR-II (BD Biosciences) with BD FACSDiva software.","CD69 Expression of CD19 CD27 B Cells.","Cells were assessed by flow cytometry for levels of CD19, CD27 and CD69 using BD FACSDiva Software and the CD69 MH-Mean of the CD19 CD27 lymphocyte population was determined. The concentration of compound resulting in 50% inhibition of CD69 MFI-Mean (IC) was determined using Genedata software (Genedata Screener, Mass.).","Cells are plated in 384 well tissue culture treated assay plates and incubated overnight. The following day, cells are treated with compounds and incubated for 24 hours. After 24 hours, cells are lysed and pPRAS40 levels are measured using the Meso-Scale assay platform. These cell lines are quite useful for characterizing the selectivity of PI3K\u03b1 inhibitors for mutant PI3K\u03b1. The HCC1954 cell line expresses mutant PI3K\u03b1 (E545K) vs WT in HDQP1.","Assay Principle:","The MSD platform provides a method of measuring the phosphorylated levels of pPRAS40 in a single sample. Cell lysates are added to assay plates pre-coated with antibodies against total PRAS40. Following cell lysis, PRAS40 in samples is allowed to bind to the capture antibodies. The detection antibody (anti-phospho PRAS40), labeled with an electrochemiluminescent compound MSD SULFO-TAG, is added to the bound lysate. The MSD Read Buffer is added such that when a voltage is applied to the plate electrodes, the labels bound to the electrode surface emit light. The MSD Sector Instrument measures the intensity of the light, and quantitatively measures the amount of phosphor EGFR in the sample (Meso Scale Assay Principle).","Materials:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0276","num":"0283"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Assay plate","Black u-Clear bottom 384 well sterile, TC treated"]},{"entry":[{},"plates (Greiner cat #781091)"]},{"entry":["Cell Types","WT Parental Line: HDQ-P1 (CL131963)"]},{"entry":[{},"E545K Mutant: HCC1954 (CL130216)"]},{"entry":["Media","RPMI 1640"]},{"entry":[{},"10% FBS (Gibco 16140-071)"]},{"entry":[{},"2 mM L-Glutamine (GNE in-house)"]},{"entry":[{},"1% HEPES (GNE in-house)"]},{"entry":["Other cell culture","0.25% Trypsin EDTA 1X (Invitrogen Gibco, cat #"]},{"entry":["reagents","25200)"]},{"entry":["Assay reagent kit","Whole Cell Lysate Kit custom pPRAS40 384w"]},{"entry":[{},"Assay Kit (Meso Scale Discovery, cat # L21CA-1"]},{"entry":[{},"for 100 plates)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Procedure:\n\n","Day 1: Cell Plating\n\n","Day 2: Compound Plate Preparation and Compound Treatment\n\n","Day 3: Cell Lysis and Addition to MSD Plates","Block the MSD assay plate with 50 ul 3% Blocker A\/1\u00d7MSD Wash Buffer 1-2 hr at room temp.
