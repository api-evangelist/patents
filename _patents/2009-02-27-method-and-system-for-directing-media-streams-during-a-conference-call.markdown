{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to conference calling, and more specifically to a method and system for directing media streams during a conference call.","Conference calls are well known in today's expanding marketplace as a mechanism for business employees and clients to communicate with each other, regardless of their location. In some cases, due to the globalization of businesses and their customers, such conference calls take place among participants located in several different countries.","Although conventional conference call systems enable these participants to communicate with each other in a single call, efficient communication can become an issue when dealing with participants who are not fluent in or do not speak the language in which the call is conducted. To address this problem, translation services have been developed that enable a participant to receive media data of the conference call in their primary language. To utilize such services, the participant typically either subscribes to the service or downloads the necessary software. As the conference call proceeds, the media stream is sent to the endpoint associated with the participant, where it is translated and transmitted to the participant's communication device. Similarly, when the participant responds to the incoming media stream in his desired language, it is translated into the primary language of the call and transmitted to the endpoints associated with the other participants.","Because each participant in a conference call is generally associated with a single endpoint, a translation service is typically required at each endpoint to independently translate the media streams between the primary language and the desired languages of those participants who do not understand the primary language, and direct the media streams between the various endpoints. Such a system is inefficient, time consuming and impractical, especially when the conference call includes dozens or more participants, each located in different areas of the world.","Accordingly, there is a need for a system that efficiently enables translation and direction of media streams during a conference call.","The present disclosure provides a method and system for directing communication streams. A multi-layer platform is provided in the architecture of an enterprise system, and is in communication with, among other things, a plurality of servers each configured for executing a corresponding application. The platform is configured for receiving and directing communications between application servers and a plurality of mobile devices.","More specifically, a system for directing media streams during a conference call, including an enterprise, at least one network provided within the enterprise and in communication with a plurality of communication devices, a platform provided within the enterprise and in communication with the network, the platform comprising a protocol layer, a services layer and an application layer, and a conference call server in communication with the platform, wherein the platform is configured for receiving media streams from each of the communication devices and instructing the conference call server on how to direct the media streams to and from each of the communication devices.","A method for directing media streams through a system during a conference call is also provided. The system includes an enterprise, at least one network provided within the enterprise and in communication with at least one communication device, a platform provided within the enterprise and in communication with the network, the platform comprising a protocol layer, a services layer and an application layer, a private branch exchange server and a conference call server, both in communication with the platform. The method includes connecting the communication device to the conference call server, selecting a device language from a menu on the communication device for conducting the conference call, the menu including a plurality of languages, the device language being different from a conference call language, directing a media stream from the conference call server to a translation server, translating the media stream at the translation server from the conference call language into the device language, sending the translated media stream to the private branch exchange server, and directing the translated media stream from the private branch exchange server to the communication device.","A method of providing translations in a system during a conference call, the system including a conference call server, a communication device, a translation server, and a session management platform for establishing and directing media streams, the conference call having a call language. The method including, receiving, at the session management platform, a language selection from the communication device, wherein the selected language differs from the call language; routing media from the device to the conference server through the translation server; routing media from the conference server to the device through the translation server; and, at the translation server, translating media from the device into the call language before transmitting it to the conference server, and translating media from the conference server into the selected language before transmitting it to the device.","A system for managing a conference call including a communication device, the conference call having a call language. The system includes a conference call server for managing media for the conference call; a session management platform configured to receive a language selection from the communication device, wherein the selected language differs from the call language; and a translation server. The session management platform is configured to send instructions in response to the received language selection to cause media to be routed from the device to the conference server through the translation server and to cause media to be routed from the conference server to the device through the translation server. The translation server is configured to translate media from the device into the call language before transmitting it to the conference server, and to translate media from the conference server into the selected language before transmitting it to the device.","In addition, a conference call server for a communication system is also provided. The communication system includes an enterprise, at least one network provided within the enterprise and in communication with at least one communication device, a platform provided within the enterprise and in communication with the network, the platform comprising a protocol layer, a services layer and an application layer, a private branch exchange server and a conference call server, both in communication with the platform. The conference call server includes a translation server configured for translating each of a plurality of media streams received by the conference call server into a selected language, wherein the conference call server is configured for receiving the media streams from a plurality of communication devices and directing the translated media streams to each communication device.","Referring now to , a system for directing media streams is provided and generally designated . The system  includes an enterprise or business system  that contains a wireless network  in communication with at least one mobile device , such as a WLAN or dual mode communication device configured for communicating with the wireless network, as known in the art. The cellular network  is located outside of the enterprise  and is also in communication with at least one of the mobile devices , such as a WAN or dual mode communication device, as known in the art.","A Public Switched Telephony Network or PSTN  and an Internet network  are in communication with the enterprise , and more specifically are in communication with corresponding servers provided in the enterprise, as known in the art. The PSTN  is also in communication with at least one telephone  and the Internet network  is in communication with at least one computer . However, it will be appreciated that the system  is not limited to the networks or devices described herein.","A platform (herein referred to as a Service Management Platform or SMP)  is provided within the enterprise  and is configured for enabling execution of a plurality of applications through the use of one of a plurality of protocols. The SMP  is configured to communicate with both the cellular network  and the wireless network  and, for security purposes, is preferably located behind a corporate firewall (not shown). More specifically, the SMP , among other things, takes in signaling from the mobile device , and instructs corresponding servers in the enterprise  how to direct the signaling to and from the mobile device, which will be described in further detail below. It is to be understood that the SMP  can either be a stand-alone server (as shown in  and as described in the present application), or it can be implemented into an existing control agent\/server as a logical software component that enables the control agent to remotely control other servers (not shown).","Referring still to , the SMP  is a multi-layer platform that includes a protocol layer , a services layer  and an application layer . The protocol layer  includes a plurality of interface protocols configured for enabling operation of corresponding applications in the application layer . The services layer  includes a plurality of services that can be leveraged by the interface protocols to create richer applications. Finally, the application layer  includes a plurality of applications that are exposed out to the communication device and that leverage corresponding ones of the services and interface protocols for enabling the applications.","Specifically, the protocol layer  preferably includes protocols which allow media to be controlled separate from data. For example, the protocol layer  can include, among other things, a Session Initiation Protocol or SIP , a Web Services protocol , an Application Programming Interface or API , a Computer Telephony Integration protocol or CTI , and a Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions or SIMPLE protocol . It is contemplated that the interface protocols - are plug-ins that can interface directly with corresponding servers in the enterprise , which will be further described below.","For the purposes of this disclosure, SIP  will be utilized, although it is appreciated that the system  can operate using the above disclosed or additional protocols. As known by those of ordinary skill in the art, SIP is the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard for multimedia session management, and more specifically is an application-layer control protocol for establishing, maintaining, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions between two or more endpoints. Media streams during a session are sent over a media protocol such as RTP (Real Time Protocol), and are controlled by SIP. As further known by those of ordinary skill in the art, the SIP protocol  includes two interfaces for signaling: SIP-Trunk (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-T\u201d) and SIP-Line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-L\u201d). Specifically, the SIP-T interface is utilized when the endpoint is a non-specific entity or not registered (i.e., when communicating between two network entities). In contrast, the SIP-L interface is utilized when the endpoint is registered (i.e., when dialing to a specific extension). Throughout this application, it is to be understood that either SIP-L or SIP-T can be utilized to control the media streams. Specific operation of the system  utilizing SIP  will be described in further detail below.","The SMP  also includes a plurality of enablers, among other things, a VoIP enabler , a Fixed Mobile Convergence or FMC enabler , a conference services enabler , a presence enabler  and an Instant Messaging or IM enabler . Each of the enablers - are used by corresponding services in the services layer  that combine one or more of the enablers. Each of the applications in the application layer  is then combined with one or more of the services to perform the desired application. For example, a phone call service may use the VoIP or PBX enabler, and an emergency response application may use the phone call service, an Instant Messenger service, a video call service, and email service and\/or a conference service.","Turning now to , the general operation of the system  using SIP  as the control protocol will be discussed, although it is recognized that the present system is not limited to the processes discussed herein. provides a signaling diagram for a call originating from one of the mobile devices  to a target phone  connected to a Private Branch Exchange Server or PBX  provided within the enterprise . First, the device  sends a mobile originated call request with its cellular number and the destination number of the target phone  through the enterprise server  to the SMP  (block ). The SMP  confirms the call request by sending the DNIS number to the device (block ). Next, the device  makes a cellular call using the DNIS number, which is received by the PBX  (block ). As the DNIS has been configured in the PBX  to be routed to the SMP , in response to the incoming call, the PBX  sends an invite with the DNIS number to the SMP  (block ). The SMP  matches the incoming call with the expected call from the mobile, and if correct, acknowledges the invite by sending a 200 o.k. signal to the PBX, indicating that the mobile call leg is established (block ).","The SMP  then sets up the outgoing call leg to the destination. It does this by sending an invite to the PBX  with the destination number of the target phone (block ). SIP-L is preferably used as the control protocol, so that the call can be correctly attributed to the individual within the organization within any call records that are being maintained by the PBX . When the invite is received, the PBX  dials the destination number to the target phone  (block ), and the target phone answers the call (block ). When the target phone is answered, the PBX sends a 200 o.k. signal to the SMP  indicating that the target phone is ready to receive data (block ). The SMP  then sends an invite to the PBX  and shuffles the SDP (Session Description Protocol, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art) to connect the call legs (block ). When the call legs are connected, the PBX  sends a second 200 o.k. signal to the SMP  (block ), and the users of the device  and target phone  can communicate with each other.","Note that between the cellular call leg being established and the outgoing call leg being answered, the mobile user hears ringing tones. These ringing tones may be provided by the PBX  using the presentation of early media from the outgoing call leg, or they may be generated locally on the device if early media is not available. In the latter case, it will be necessary to localize the ringing tone to match the tone normally heard with a call through the PBX .","The above description is known as a \u201cmobile initiated\u201d call, because the SMP  provides the mobile device  with the DNIS number into which the mobile device  has called. Alternatively, the mobile originated call could be \u201cPBX initiated\u201d, as shown in . Specifically, in a PBX-initiated call, upon receipt of the mobile originated call request (block ), the SMP  confirms receipt of the call to the mobile device  with an ANI number (block ), which the mobile device uses to identify the incoming call from the PBX . The PBX  then sends an invite to the PBX  with the cellular number of the device and the ANI number that is attached to the outgoing call (block ). Upon receipt of the invite, the PBX  makes a cellular call to the device  (block ), which is answered by the device (block ). The device  checks the ANI number in the incoming call to confirm if the number is actually from the PBX . If the ANI number is stripped for any particular reason, then the device  may be configured to answer the call as a regular cellular call, or it may reject the call as unknown. When the device  answers the PBX-initiated call, the PBX  sends a 200 o.k. signal to the SMP , indicating that the call leg to the device is established (block ).","In response, the SMP  sends an invite with the destination number of the target phone  to the PBX  (block ). When the invite is received at the PBX , the PBX dials the destination number to the target phone  (block ), the target phone picks up the call (block ), and a 200 o.k. signal is sent from the PBX to the SMP  (block ), indicating that the target phone is also ready to receive data. In response to the 200 o.k., the SMP  sends an invite to the PBX , shuffling the SDP to connect the call legs (block ). Finally, when the call legs are connected, the PBX  sends a second 200 o.k. signal to the SMP , and the users of the device  and target phone  are able to communicate with each other.","In both instances, the SMP  is performing third party call control of the two call legs, the PBX  remaining in control of the call. The decision of whether to proceed with a mobile-initiated call or a PBX-initiated call can be set by policy. Specifically, the option to select either mobile-initiated or PBX-initiated calls is a feature provided in the SMP , and an administrator for the enterprise  can determine which setting to use. For example, in some cases it may be more cost effective for the corporation to utilize PBX-initiated calls rather than mobile-initiated calls, and vice versa. However, it is appreciated that the system  is not limited to the above processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A"],"b":["40","60","60","62","150","62","32","152"]},"In response to the invite, the SMP  sends a call request with the DNIS number and source details to the device  (block ), which is confirmed to the SMP (block ). In addition to confirming the call, the mobile device  sends a cellular call to the DNIS number at the PBX  (block ). Again, as the DNIS number is routed in the dialing plans to the SMP , upon receipt of the cellular call, the PBX  sends an invite to the SMP  with the DNIS number (block ). In response to the invite, a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal is sent from the SMP  to the PBX , acknowledging that the call leg to the mobile device  is established (block ). Finally, the initial invite (block ) is acknowledged with the \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal with the cellular SDP, at which point the call legs are joined and the target phone  and device  can communicate with each other on the call.","The diagram shown in  illustrates a \u201cmobile-initiated\u201d call, because, as discussed above with respect to , the SMP  presents the mobile device  with the DNIS number at the PBX  into which to call. However, it is also possible to employ a \u201cPBX-initiated\u201d mobile terminated call, as shown in , where the PBX  sends an incoming call to the device  with the ANI number of the target phone .","Specifically, similar to the mobile initiated call described above and shown in , the target phone  sends an incoming call to the destination number of the device, which is received at the PBX  (block ). Upon receipt of the call, the PBX  sends an invite to the SMP  (block ) with the source number of the target phone . In response to the invite, the SMP  sends a call request with the source number to the device  (block ), with the ANI number the device should expect in the incoming call, the call request being confirmed by the device (block ). At this point in the PBX-initiated call, the SMP  sends an invite to the PBX with the cellular number and ANI number to use (block ), prompting the PBX  to make a cellular call to the device  with the ANI number (block ), prompting the device to ring. The device answers the call (block ), and a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal is sent from the PBX  to the SMP , acknowledging that the cellular call leg to the device  is established (block ). In response, a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal is also sent from the SMP  to the PBX , acknowledging that the call leg to the target phone  is also established (block ). The SMP  shuffles the SDP to connect the call legs, the call legs are joined, and the target phone  and device  can communicate with each other on the call.","As discussed above with respect to , the SMP  remains in control of the signaling between the target phone  and the mobile device  in both the mobile-initiated and PBX-initiated calls. Again, the decision to proceed with a mobile-initiated call or a PBX-initiated call is based on policy and made by the administration of the organization. In some cases, it may be more efficient or cost effective for the administrator to decide that PBX-initiated calls should be used, and in other cases, it may be more efficient or cost effective for mobile-initiated calls to be utilized. As these policy decisions may vary by organization and are not imperative to the scope of the present application, they will not be discussed in further detail.","Attention will now be turned to the operation of a conference services application , which enables multiple communication devices (including desk telephones and personal computers) to participate in a conference call through use of a centralized conference server . As seen in , the conference server  is provided in the enterprise  and is in communication with the conference services application  preferably through the SIP protocol  (either utilizing SIP-L or SIP-T as described above), although it is recognized that additional protocols that control media separate from data may be appropriate, such as the Web Services protocol  or the CTI protocol . As will be described in further detail below, the conference call server  is configured for directing media and data streams to and from one or more communication devices (i.e., mobile devices , telephones , and computers ).","Turning now to , the basic initiation of a conference call utilizing the SIP protocol  is provided. In , the mobile device  joins the conference call at the appropriate time by calling a specified dial-in number and entering an access code, as known in the art. However, it is understood that other methods for joining a conference call are appropriate, and the present application is not limited to those options discussed herein. For example, the user of the mobile device  could access their calendar, select the scheduled conference call, and the device could automatically dial the appropriate number, without the need for an access code. Similarly, the user could receive an alert that the conference call is approaching, select an option to dial the appropriate number, and be joined to the conference call. Optionally, the user could access their email, find the conference call invite, and select the appropriate dial-in number for joining the conference call. For purposes of this disclosure and as known in the art, the terms cellular SDP and conference server SDP (used below) refer to communication ports provided on the PBX  and the conference server , respectively, through which signals are sent during the conference call.","Specifically and as shown in , at the designated time of the conference call, the mobile device  sends a call request with the destination number to the SMP  (block ), which the SMP confirms to the mobile device with the DNIS number (block ). Upon receipt of the confirmation, the mobile device  sends a cellular call to the DNIS number, which is received at the PBX  (block ). The PBX  then establishes a first dialog and sends an invite containing the cellular SDP (block ) to the SMP , which in response, establishes a second dialog by sending an invite to the PBX also containing the cellular SDP (block ). At this point, the PBX  calls the conference server  (block ), and the conference server answers the call (block ). When the PBX  is notified that the conference server  has answered the call, the PBX utilizes the second dialog and sends a \u201c200 o.k\u201d containing the conference server SDP to the SMP  (block ). In response, the SMP  utilizes the first dialog and sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d to the PBX  containing conference server SDP (block ). By this method the PBX has now the SDP of the conference server to which it sends media received from the cellular device and the conference server has the SDP on the PBX to which it can send media which is in turn sent onto the cellular device. The call legs are now connected. Once connected to the conference server , the user enters the access code into the mobile device (if applicable), enabling participation in the conference call.","Similar to the mobile originated call described with respect to , the mobile originated call in  is mobile-initiated, because the SMP  provides the mobile device  with a DNIS number at the PBX  into which to call. Alternatively, the mobile originated call to the conference server  can also be PBX-initiated, which is shown in . Specifically, the mobile device  sends a call request to the destination number of the conference server , which is received at the SMP  (block ). Upon receipt of the call request, the SMP  confirms the call request to the device  containing the expected ANI number of the call back (block ). At this point, the SMP  establishes a first dialog and sends an invite to the PBX  (block ), instructing the PBX  to send a cellular call to the device (block ). Utilizing the first dialog, the PBX  then sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal containing the cellular SDP to the SMP  (block ), and the SMP establishes a second dialog and sends an invite to the PBX containing the cellular SDP (block ). In response to the invite, the PBX  calls the conference server  (block ), and the conference server answers the call (block ). When the PBX  is notified that the conference server  has answered the call, the PBX, utilizing the second dialog, sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal containing conference server SDP to the SMP  (block ). At this point, the SMP  utilizes the first dialog and re-invites the PBX  containing conference server SDP (block ). In response, the PBX , utilizing the first dialog, sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal to the SMP  (block ), connecting the call legs and enabling the device to participate in the conference call. By this method the PBX has now the SDP of the conference server to which it sends media received from the cellular device and the conference server has the SDP on the PBX to which it can send media which is in turn sent onto the cellular device.","Turning now to , it is also possible for the conference server  to \u201cfetch\u201d or bring the mobile device  into the conference call at the appropriate time. It is contemplated that this can happen in a variety of ways, and the present disclosure is not limited to those methods described herein. For example, the mobile device could have previously accepted an invitation to the conference call, of which the conference call server  makes note, calling the device at the appropriate time, as known in the art. Alternatively, the user of the mobile device  could, upon acceptance of the invitation, elect to be dialed into the conference call at the appropriate time, as also is known in the art. Such a \u201cfetch\u201d option may be beneficial to users who are unable to dial into the conference call at the desired time (i.e., they are driving), but still want to be included in the conference.","Specifically, and as seen in , the conference server  sends an incoming call signal to the device, which is received at the PBX  (block ), which then establishes a first dialog and sends an invite containing conference server SDP to the SMP  (block ). Upon receipt of the invite, the SMP  sends a mobile terminated call request with the DNIS number to the mobile device  (block ), which call is confirmed by the mobile device (block ). The device  then makes a cellular call to the DNIS number, which is received at the PBX  (block ). When the call is received, the PBX  establishes a second dialog and sends an invite containing cellular SDP to the SMP  (block ). In response to the invite, the SMP , utilizing the second dialog, sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal containing conference server SDP to the PBX  (block ). At this point, the SMP , utilizing the first dialog, also sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal containing cellular SDP to the PBX  (block ), enabling the conference server  and device  to communicate with each other on the call. By this method the PBX has now the SDP of the conference server to which it sends media received from the cellular device and the conference server has the SDP on the PBX to which it can send media which is in turn sent onto the cellular device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["16","32","62","16","66","16","62","250","32","252","32","16","254","256","32","62","258","62","16","260","16","62","32","32","62","16"]},"As mentioned above with respect to , the decision to proceed with a mobile-initiated call versus a PBX-initiated call is a policy decision that is made by the administrator or someone within the organization. Further, although  discuss a mobile device  joining a conference call, it is appreciated that other communication devices may also be joined into the conference call, such as telephones  on the PSTN , computers , and the like. These communication devices would be joined to the conference call server  in the same manner as that described above with respect to the mobile device , and accordingly will not be described in further detail herein.","Referring now to , to enable translation of the media streams, a translation server  is provided and configured for receiving the media streams, translating the media streams into a desired language and transmitting the media streams to the communication device , as will be described in further detail below. It is contemplated that the translation server  can be provided as a separate component within the enterprise  (not shown), or as a component within the conference server  (). The translation server  will enable those participants who do not speak the same language as other participants to still partake in the conference call. For example, and as will be described in further detail below, if the conference call is occurring primarily in English, but one of the participants speaks German, they will have the option to send and receive media streams in German. However, the remaining participants will continue to receive and send media streams in English.","Specifically, and as seen in , a signaling diagram for a method of directing media streams during a conference call is provided. It will be appreciated that the method described herein is not limited to the steps disclosed or the order in which they are disclosed.  shows a mobile-originated, mobile-initiated conference call, as shown and described above with respect to , although it is to be appreciated that the method for directing media applies similarly to mobile-originated, PBX-initiated (as shown in ) calls; mobile-terminated, mobile-initiated (as shown in ) calls; and mobile-terminated, PBX-initiated (as shown in ) calls. Accordingly, blocks - (described in detail above with respect to ) will not be described again herein.","Upon commencement of the conference call at block , media streams are directed between the device  and the conference server  (block ). Specifically, media originating at the device  is directed from the device, through the PBX  and to the conference server  via conference server SDP (i.e., through a conference server communication port  provided in the conference server ). In response, media originating from the conference server  is directed from the conference server, through the PBX  and to the device  via cellular SDP (i.e., through a PBX communication port  provided in the PBX). If there are no translation issues, the conference call continues, with media being directed between the device  and the conference server  as described above (and as shown in ).","However, if a need for translation arises, a request is sent from the device  to the SMP  for translation to German, for example (block ). In response, the SMP  establishes a third dialog and sends an invite containing cellular SDP to the PBX  (block ), which then sends a call to the translation server  for cellular-to-conference translation (block ). When the translation server  answers the call (block ), the PBX  is notified and utilizes the third dialog to send a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal containing translation server SDP-up (i.e., via an upflow translation server communication port , as seen in ) to the SMP  (block ). In response, the SMP  utilizes the first dialog and sends a re-invite containing translation server SDP-up to the PBX  (block ).","Once the invite is received, the PBX utilizes the first dialog and sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal to the SMP  (block ). Upon receipt of the \u201c200\u201d signal, the SMP  establishes a fourth dialog and sends an invite containing cellular SDP to the PBX  (block ). When the PBX  receives the invite, it calls the translation server  for conference-to-cellular translation (block ), and the translation server answers the call (block ). When the PBX  is notified that the translation server  has answered the call, it utilizes the third dialog and sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal containing translation server SDP-down (i.e., via a downflow translation server communication port , shown in ) to the SMP  (block ). In response, the SMP, utilizing the second dialog, sends a re-invite containing translation server SDP-down to the PBX  (block ). Upon receipt of the re-invite, the PBX  utilizes the second dialog and sends a \u201c200 o.k.\u201d signal to the SMP  (block ). At this point, media is sent between the device  and the translation server  (block ), and also between the translation server and the conference server  in the desired language (block ). By this method the PBX has been given the communication port on the translation server to which it sends media received from the device and the translation server has been given the communication port on the conference server to which it sends the subsequently translated media. In the reverse direction, the conference server has been given the communication port on the translation server to which it sends media destined for the device, and the translation server has the communication port on the PBX to which it sends the subsequently translated media to be sent onto the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"b ","b":["400","66","16","62","68","74","68","66","70","66","68","76","62","72","16"]},"It is contemplated that a conference call participant can opt to have the media translated into their desired language at any point during the conference call. Specifically, in one instance, the conference call invitee will receive an invite to participate in a conference call at their communication device , and upon acceptance of the invite, select the language in which they wish to participate in the conference call. Alternatively, upon connection of the device to the conference call, the participant can select a language from a menu on the communication device  in which the conference call will be conducted. For example, a drop-down menu will appear with a list of languages supported by the translation server . It is contemplated that the translation server  can support a plurality of languages, such as English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese and Spanish. It will be appreciated that the translation server  is not limited to the languages discussed herein. If the participant does not wish to select a translation language at that time, it is contemplated that they can access the language menu at any time during the conference call.","It is also contemplated that several devices can participate in the conference call, and that each of these devices can request to have the media streams translated into a particular language). As known in the art, each device  has a unique network identifier (i.e., a phone number, IP address, SIP URI), and accordingly the streams are kept separate and can be independently translated to the proper language.","It is appreciated that the media streams can be directed to the devices  over either packet-switched or circuit-switched voice, as known in the art. For example, if the media stream is directed to the device over packet-switched voice, it will be transmitted to the appropriate address and port number (i.e., either audio or data) in the device, as described in the above method. If the media stream is sent to the device over circuit-switched voice, it will be transmitted over GSM channel (if audio) or over the GPRS data channel (if text), for example.","For conference call participants who are unable to receive voice streams of the conference call (i.e., they are in another meeting or in a location where they can not speak freely), the enterprise  further includes a voice to data server (not shown) configured for converting the voice stream to a data stream, where the data stream is transmitted to one of the communication devices . Specifically, upon connecting the device to the conference call, as described above with reference to  (block ), a menu will appear on the participant's device indicating that the conference call can be transmitted as either a voice or data stream. The participant can then select the text message option from the menu. It is contemplated that the participant can opt to receive the media stream in text or voice form at any point during the conference call. For example, if the participant is originally receiving voice streams of the call and needs to go to a meeting, he can access the menu and opt to receive text of the conference call from that point forward.","When a voice-to-data server is utilized, media streams are directed in the same manner as when the translation server  is utilized, except that rather than coming through the PBX , data would travel through a specified server, such as an IM server, for example. It is contemplated that the media can be translated from voice to text or vice versa. Specifically, when the device requests data be sent as a text message, media is sent from the conference server  to the voice-to-data server, where it would be translated into text. The translated text would then be sent to the device via the IM server. Alternatively, if the device  is sending responses as text messages which need to be translated to voice streams, the media is sent from the device, through the IM server to the voice-to-data server, where it is translated into a voice stream. The voice stream is then sent to the conference server , where it can be transmitted to the other devices on the call as a voice stream. It is to be understood that the present system is not limited to the above-described method.","The present system  with conference call capability provides an efficient and practical method for receiving and directing media streams during a conference call. By providing a platform capable of remotely controlling a centralized conference server within the enterprise, the media streams are directed to a single server where they are translated and sent to the participating devices in a desired language, alleviating the need for each participant to communicate with its own conference and translation service. The present system also allows participants to participate in the conference call via either audio or text streams, and enables the participant to select these options anytime during the call. Further, the present system does not require the device to be updated with any additional software to communicate with the conference server and platform, enabling efficient and cost effective communication.","While a particular embodiment of the present method and system for directing media streams during a conference call has been described herein, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the disclosure in its broadest aspects and as set forth in the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"b "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
