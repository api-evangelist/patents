{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to data processing and, more particularly, to making a payment on a bill previously sent by a third party via a financial service provider using a network based device.","2. Related Art","Short codes\u2014also known as \u201cshort numbers\u201d\u2014are special telephone numbers, shorter than full telephone numbers, which can also be used to address Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging System (MMS) messages from mobile phones or fixed phones. Short codes are intended to be shorter to read and easier to remember than normal telephone numbers. While similar to telephone numbers, short codes are generally unique to each operator, with some operators having agreements to avoid overlaps. In some countries\u2014such as the United States\u2014some classes of numbers are inter-operator numbers (called \u201ccommon short codes\u201d in the United States).","Short codes are widely used for value-added services such as television voting, ordering ringtones, charity donations, and mobile services. Messages sent to a short code can be billed at a higher rate than a standard SMS message and may, for example, subscribe a customer to a recurring monthly service that is added to the customer's mobile phone bill until a text message terminating the service is sent. In another example, short codes may be used to facilitate purchases from merchants using a mobile phone. Short codes are often associated with automated services. An automated program can handle a customer response and typically requires the customer to start the message with a command word or prefix. The service then responds to the command appropriately. For example, in ads or in other printed material where a provider informs about both a prefix and a short code number, the information may typically follow a long format\u2014e.g., Text football to 72404 for latest football news\u2014or a short format\u2014e.g., football@72404.","According to one embodiment, a system includes: a server computing device configured to communicate with a network-based device via a network; and a bill code, in which the bill code corresponds to a bill owed to a biller; and the server computing device is configured to receive a reply corresponding to the bill code from the network based device; the server computing device is configured to identify the corresponding bill owed to the biller in response to receiving the reply corresponding to the bill code from the network based device; and the server computing device is configured to transfer to the biller a payment corresponding to the bill in response to receiving the reply corresponding to the bill code from the network based device.","According to another embodiment, a method for facilitating bill payment includes: receiving a reply corresponding to a bill code by a financial service provider (FSP), for which the bill code is included in a bill viewable by a customer; and transferring to a biller a payment corresponding to the bill in response to receiving the reply corresponding to the bill code from a network based device.","According to another embodiment, a method for secure transfer of debt payment includes: receiving a request for a billing service from a biller; providing a reference code to the biller in response to the request, in which the reference code uniquely corresponds to a bill code; receiving a reply corresponding to the bill code from a customer via a network-based device in response to the bill code being included in a bill to the customer; and transferring a payment corresponding to the reference code to the biller while keeping selected financial information of the customer secure with respect to the biller.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Some examples of embodiments and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating various examples of embodiments and not for purposes of limiting the same.","Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to payment of bills\u2014e.g., a customer's electric, gas, and water utility bills\u2014through a financial service provider (FSP) using a text messaging capability of the customer's mobile phone. Such a bill payment service, in accordance with an embodiment, provided by the financial service provider could be useful to the customer, i.e., a user of the payment service, because for some users, it is easier to pay the bill with their phone when they open the mail than to wait and pay later. For a biller\u2014e.g., a utility such as the electric company or some other creditor\u2014the biller may receive payment faster, in accordance with an embodiment, than through normal bill pay, when the customer is thus encouraged by the convenience of the service to make payments sooner.","Another feature that may provide usefulness to the customer is an option, in accordance with an embodiment, that allows the customer to \u201cpay-in-the-future\u201d, e.g., by approving a payment that will occur at a date in the future of the approval date. So, for example, a customer could receive a bill and approve the payment immediately (e.g., before forgetting about it) but not have the payment debited against the customer's account\u2014e.g., bank, credit card, or financial service provider account\u2014until a specified date in the future. Another feature that may provide usefulness to the biller is an option, in accordance with an embodiment, that allows the customer to \u201cpay-now-and-save\u201d, e.g., by providing the customer a discount from the biller in return for a prompt payment or a specified discount for payment by a specified date.","Still another feature that may be useful to both a biller and customer is to use the bill payment service provided by the financial service provider as \u201cbill-is-almost-past-due\u201d or a \u201cbill-is-due-pay-now-to-avoid-late-fee\u201d service, in which the financial service provider would call the customer to provide a reminder prompt that allows the customer to pay immediately using the cell phone and avoid having overdue payments. An advantage of this feature to the biller may be that the biller can use the financial service provider for special cases and not have to use the financial service provider as the primary way, but a supplemental way for obtaining bill payment. The financial service provider may also allow users to default to this payment option, e.g., authorize the option to occur automatically. The user, for example, may be saved having to remember to log in to the biller website to pay a bill the user obviously already forgot to pay.","Yet another possible configuration is for the \u201cbiller\u201d to be a ward or dependent of the \u201ccustomer\u201d by which the \u201ccustomer\u201d provides an allowance or funding for the \u201cbiller\u201d. For example, the \u201cbiller\u201d may be a college student child of the \u201ccustomer\u201d having a \u201cstudent account\u201d with the financial service provider that allows the parent to provide (or not, or specify an amount) funds to the child in response to requests from the child.","Generally, embodiments provide a text messaging payment service that allows a customer (also referred to as a user) having an account with a financial service provider to text a billing code to a phone number (or short code) established by the third party biller for services provided\u2014e.g., utility service\u2014in order to trigger a transaction in which payment is made to the biller by the financial service provider on behalf of the user and the biller receives payment\u2014for example, the biller credits the user's account with the biller, also referred to as a \u201cbilling account\u201d. A customer's utility bill may include the billing code and short code whether the bill, for example, is included in a paper statement received in the mail, is an on-line bill viewed by the customer at a biller's website, or is a bill viewed at a wireless application protocol (WAP) website that is specially designed for small cell-phone screens. The process of completing the transaction may include various details; for example, the financial service provider may call or text back to the user to confirm the payment, requiring confirmation, e.g., in the form of entry of a personal identification number (PIN), before making the payment to the biller.","More particularly, embodiments relate to systems and methods to receive a request associated with a third party at a financial service provider from a network-based device via a network. The network-based device\u2014e.g., a mobile phone\u2014is associated with a user. A payment transfer module of the financial service provider, responsive to receiving the request, transfers a payment from the user to the third party via the financial service provider.","Referring to , a text messaging payment system  is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment. System  may include a biller , a financial service provider , a communications network , and a mobile phone  or other network based device by which system user  (also referred to as \u201ccustomer\u201d) may communicate with the system . As seen in , system  operates by providing various flows of information or data , , , , and , which may be provided, for example, by the use of various devices such as computers, web servers, routers, and cell phone networks\u2014used by the biller  and financial service provider \u2014and mobile phone \u2014used by the customer .","For example, communications network  may include the Internet, email, a public or private telephone network, a private wireless network using technologies such as Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11x, or other networks, and may provide a capability for cloud computing, as indicated in . Although not shown in , biller  may communicate with financial service provider  via communications network , and any of biller , financial service provider , and user  via mobile phone  may avail themselves of the cloud computing capabilities of communications network . In addition, financial service provider  may employ a server computing device  in the sending, receiving, and transforming of information, e.g., in the flows of information , , , , and .","Communication among biller , financial service provider , and customer  may involve, for example, web servers, web clients, browsers, and application programming interfaces (API) and may also make use of short messaging service (SMS) messaging and multimedia messaging service (MMS) messaging. The network-based device, e.g., mobile phone , may host an interface associated with the financial service provider . The network-based device\u2014for example, mobile phone , a personal digital assistant (PDA), or iPhone\u00ae\u2014used by customer  may be browser-enabled and may engage in an interactive message or open communication session, such as SMS, email, wireless application protocol (WAP), web, interactive voice response (IVR), or other mobile interfaces. The interactive messaging or open communication session may involve multiple technology modalities, e.g. the user (e.g., customer ) may engage the system  via SMS and receive a responsive communication from an IVR Server or as an SMS with an embedded hyperlinked URL directing the user's (e.g., customer ) device (e.g., mobile phone ) to a WAP or web page. A hyperlinked URL may be delivered directly to the network-based device , for example, from an application server of the financial service provider  and may be used to access a web site or a micro-browser, such as a WAP site.","Biller  may be a creditor of customer  in the sense that customer  owes an amount of money (also referred to as the \u201cbill amount\u201d) to the biller . The customer  may have a customer account (also referred to as the \u201cbilling account\u201d) with the biller , which may be identified with the biller , for example, by a customer account number.","For example, the biller  may be a utility company\u2014e.g., electric, water, gas, or phone company\u2014with which the customer has a billing account with an amount receivable by the biller . Biller  could also be any other type of creditor\u2014such as a store, credit card company, or any other entity\u2014with which the customer has a relationship of owing a debt to a creditor that can be expressed and paid as a monetary amount. In addition, the biller  may have some relationship to the customer  by which the customer  desires to provide funding for the biller\u2014such as in the parent-child, student account example given above.","The customer  may also have an account (also referred to as the \u201cservice account\u201d) with the financial service provider . The customer's service account may provide a number of payment services and functions to users, such as customer . The customer's service account may allow customer  to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value against a debt (e.g., for goods, services, or other payments) presented via an invoice or bill , as shown in . The financial service provider  may also extend credit to customer , or may also have access to other funding sources to complete transactions, e.g. a credit card, a bank account, or a credit line. The financial service provider  may operate as a money transmitter or a bank, for example. The financial service provider  may keep certain specific, or selected, financial information of the customer  secure with respect to the third party biller . For example, the payment from customer  may be received by the biller  via the financial service provider  exclusive of the payment method or financial information of the customer , including credit card information, bank information, or other service account information belonging to customer .","Referring now to , as well as to , a method , according to one embodiment, may include a step  in which financial service provider  receives billing information  from biller . Billing information  may, for example, accompany a request from biller  to financial service provider  to provide a bill payment service\u2014such as \u201crequest-immediate-payment\u201d, \u201cpay-in-the-future\u201d, \u201cbill-is-due-pay-now-to-avoid-late-fee\u201d, or \u201cstudent account payment\u201d\u2014or, for example, the billing information  may be received pursuant to a previously made arrangement between biller  and financial service provider . The billing information  may include, for example, payer (e.g., customer ) name and address, payer contact information\u2014such as phone numbers and email addresses, line items\u2014such as particulars of a bill (e.g., bill  shown in ), additional calculations\u2014such as taxes, and a total amount of the bill. At step , the financial service provider  may generate a reference code .","The reference code  may serve, for example, as a database key that can be used to cross reference the billing information  received at step . The financial service provider  may send the reference code  to the biller , along with some or all of the received billing information  for the biller's () verification or validation of the reference code . The reference code  may serve, for example, as acknowledgement that financial service provider  has received the billing information  and will commence the bill payment process. The reference code  may also provide a common cross-reference to the billing information  between the biller  and financial service provider . The financial service provider  may also match contact information it possesses for the customer  with contact information provided in billing information  in a further process of verification for the biller  or may add such contact information along with the reference code  sent to the biller .","At step , the financial service provider  may generate a bill code  (see  and ) corresponding to the reference code . The financial service provider  may generate the billing code  based on selected criteria, for example, the source (e.g., the biller ) presenting the invoice or bill  (see ), the type of bill (e.g., service, product, student account, or other type of payment) or the placement of the billing code  (e.g., whether presented to customer  by a traditional paper bill, by the mobile phone , or by an on-line bill). The financial service provider  may also generate the billing code  in such a way that it uniquely corresponds to the reference code . In other words, two different payment matters, with two different sets of billing information , do not have the same bill code  so that the bill code  by itself is sufficient to identify the particular reference code  and payment matter for which the bill code  has been generated.","Also at step , once the bill code  has been generated, the financial service provider  may send an FSP-initiated billing message , via communications network , to the network based device, e.g., mobile phone . The FSP-initiated billing message  may include, for example, any or all of billing information , the bill code , a short code to which the customer may send a reply via mobile phone , and any other data or information which may be useful to customer . For example, in the \u201cbill-is-almost-past-due\u201d or a \u201cbill-is-due-pay-now-to-avoid-late-fee\u201d service options, the financial service provider  may call the customer  (or send an email or SMS message to mobile phone ) and prompt \u201cThis is [name of biller ]; your bill is due, and you can pay using [name of financial service provider ] right now with your bill code [bill code ].\u201d","In another example, the billing information  may include a template for a general layout with, for example, a biller logo and additional information. The financial service provider  may use such additional billing information  to receive, store, and display a digital picture of the bill (e.g., bill  shown in ). For example, the financial service provider  may store the template information and use additional information to create a bill using any of the familiar .pdf, .gif, .bmp, or other computer file formats. For example, the biller , having previously provided a template and general layout, may provide some text information (e.g., name and address, contact information, line items, and total amount) and the financial service provider  may re-create the bill dynamically using the text information to fill in fields in the template. Thus, financial service provider  may provide a bill presentment service as part of any of the service options described so that, for example, a customer  may receive a bill, e.g., via FSP-initiated billing message , that like a physical bill received in the mail, the customer can have access to whenever desired and may be used, for example, as a proof, e.g., a proof of residence or a proof that home property tax was paid for refinancing purposes.","Because the FSP-initiated message  has been sent, e.g., initiated, by financial service provider , financial service provider  can be sure that a reply  to the FSP-initiated message  corresponds to the bill code  and, thus, may consider an abbreviated reply to be authentic as being from the customer  to whom the FSP-initiated message  has been addressed. An abbreviated reply may be one that, for example, does not include either the bill code  or a security verification such as entry of a PIN by customer , but rather a more simple reply that may include, for example, an indication of accord with (e.g., \u201cY\u201d) or rejection of (e.g., \u201cN\u201d) paying the bill.","Thus, financial service provider  may not require any additional security information\u2014such as entry of a PIN or the bill code  itself\u2014in order to proceed with the process of method . For example, in an option where the biller  asks financial service provider  to request immediate payment, financial service provider  may send billing information  in FSP-initiated message , and all the customer  needs to do to authorize the payment to the biller  is to reply, for example, with a \u201cY\u201d for \u201cyes\u201d (or whatever may be indicated in optional instructions included with FSP-initiated message ). FSP-initiated message  may also, for example, provide customer  with an option to send in an amount different from the bill, e.g., the amount included in the billing information . In another example, e.g., that of the \u201cstudent account\u201d, a child may send an SMS (i.e. text message, or short message service) like \u201cget 10\u201d to financial service provider ; the financial service provider  may recognize\u2014e.g., from the billing information , which may include a service account number\u2014that the account is a \u201cparent-child\u201d or \u201cstudent account\u201d and may send an FSP-initiated message  to the phone of the parent of the account (e.g., mobile phone  of customer ) including a message such as \u201cJohn wants $10. Reply \u2018Y\u2019 or with another amount\u201d.","At step , financial service provider , e.g., via server computing device , may receive a reply  from customer  via a network based device, e.g., mobile phone . The reply  may be an abbreviated reply because the contact that provides the FSP-initiated message  and to which a reply  is sought is initiated by the financial service provider  so that the abbreviated reply  is sure to correspond to the bill code  for which the FSP-initiated message  has been sent. Thus, reply , shown in , may contain, for example, just the bill code \u2014or an even more simple reply such as \u201cY\u201d or \u201cOK\u201d\u2014sent by SMS to a short code (e.g., a short code that provides a connection to the financial service provider ) included in FSP-initiated message .","At step , financial service provider  may in response to receiving reply  process a payment  from (or on behalf of) customer  to biller . For example, financial service provider  may collect the amount of the payment  from the customer , e.g., via a credit card or bank draft payment from customer  to the service account of customer  with financial service provider . Financial service provider  may then provide a payment  to biller  using means for payment that is independent of customer . Thus, the biller  may receive the payment  corresponding to the billing information  and reference code , exclusive of the customer's () financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers of customer .","Such processing and provision of payments may be accomplished automatically by machine, for example, with the aid of server computing device  and cloud computing provided by communications network . Similarly, at step , financial service provider  may receive confirmation from the biller  that payment  has been received and may provide a receipt to the customer .","Referring to , a billing interface  is schematically illustrated according to one embodiment. The interface  may include a bill  that may be viewable by customer  via one or more media, e.g. virtual or physical. The biller , for example, may provide the bill  in a paper statement (i.e., the interface  in this case) mailed to the customer . The bill  may, for example, be stored by the financial service provider  (e.g., using server computing device  or cloud computing capability of communications network ) in a .pdf file (or other visual format) for the biller  that the customer  can access via a website or any other physical or virtual medium used to provide billing interface . Also, for example, a user interface  (e.g., a web page, SMS, IVR, or downloaded application) may receive the bill  from the biller  or from the financial service provider  in response to a query initiated by the customer .","In one example, as shown in , the bill code  associated with a bill  may be presented as part of a billing account statement. The bill  may describe an obligation (e.g., debt for goods, services, or other payment). The bill  may be associated with the bill code , which may be specific to a particular obligation or debt expressed by billing data  which may comprise billing information . The bill  may include multiple obligations with multiple respective bill codes . The bill  may also contain other information , such as instructions for providing reply , or a billing option available, such as \u201cpay-in-the-future\u201d and other options available.","Referring to  and , a bill payment system  and a method , according to one or more embodiments, may include a step  in which financial service provider  receives a billing request  for a billing service from biller . For example, billing request  may include a request for a bill code  and other information, such as billing information  or contact information of the customer , that financial service provider  can use, for example, to verify that customer  has a service account with financial service provider  or to use for cross referencing to the bill code  that financial service provider  may provide to biller  in response to billing request .","At step , financial service provider  may verify from information included in billing request  that an arrangement for a billing service\u2014such as \u201crequest-immediate-payment\u201d, \u201cpay-in-the-future\u201d, \u201cbill-is-due-pay-now-to-avoid-late-fee\u201d, or \u201cstudent account payment\u201d\u2014has been set up between financial service provider  and biller  relevant to customer . For example, financial service provider  may verify that customer  has a service account with financial service provider  and may match or add contact information of customer  to any contact information provided by the biller  in the billing request .","The billing request  may include a bill code  to be \u201cdeposited\u201d with financial service provider . For example, an arrangement between financial service provider  and biller  relevant to customer  may include a means for biller  to provide a unique (e.g., uniquely corresponding to the billing request  and its information) bill code  with the billing request . Alternatively, as in step , the financial service provider  may generate a unique (e.g., uniquely corresponding to the billing request  and its information) bill code  in response to the billing request . The financial service provider  may also, as in step , generate a reference code  that may be used, for example, as a database key to cross reference the billing request  and the unique bill code . The financial service provider  may generate the reference code  and the billing code  in such a way that they uniquely corresponds to each other. In other words, two different billing requests  representing two different payment matters, with two different sets of billing information , do not have the same bill code  so that the bill code  by itself is sufficient to identify the particular reference code  and payment matter for which the bill code  has been generated.","At step , once the bill code  has been generated, the financial service provider  may keep a record of the bill code  and any other information associated with the bill code , e.g., uniquely associated information such as the reference code , the billing request , and the associated contact information and billing information . The financial service provider , at step , may provide to the biller  a response  to billing request . The response  may include the bill code  that was either deposited with or generated in response to billing request . In the example that the bill code has been \u201cdeposited\u201d with financial service provider , the response  may serve as an acknowledgement or verification that the bill code  has been recorded by the financial service provider  and is now useable by the biller . The response  may also include other information, for example, any other information associated with the bill code , e.g., uniquely associated information such as the reference code , the billing request , and the associated contact information and billing information . As with method , the reference code , e.g., when included in response , may provide a common cross-reference to the billing request  and billing information  between the biller  and financial service provider .","At step , once the response ,\u2014e.g., including bill code  or acknowledgement that the bill code  has been recorded by the financial service provider and is now useable\u2014has been received by the biller , the biller  (or any other party on behalf of the biller ) may send a biller-initiated billing message , including the bill code , in any form and by any means to the customer . For example, in the case of a utility like water, gas, or electricity, the utility company may send the customer  a traditional paper bill , including the bill code , in the mail. Other means for the biller  to send the bill code  in a biller-initiated billing message  may include any form of providing an interface  including bill code  to the customer . For example, biller  may send a .pdf file attached to an email as the interface  including a bill  in the .pdf document, the bill  including bill code . Interface  may also include, for example, a web page, or an SMS message sent to the customer's () mobile phone. The biller  may also provide a mobile application (or \u201capp\u201d) for the customer's () mobile phone that allows, for example, the customer  to periodically check with the biller  for status of the customer's () billing account with the biller . The interface , e.g., the paper bill, may also include instructions for the customer , for example, to use the bill code  by contacting the financial service provider , e.g., using a short code included in the interface . The customer  may then create a text message (e.g., reply ) with the unique bill code  and send the reply  to the short code (or phone number). Reply  could also be sent, for example, with an email or the user  may call into the IVR.","At step , financial service provider  (e.g., via server computing device ; through SMS servers; through an email server; or via IVR) may receive a reply  from customer  via a network based device, e.g., mobile phone . For method , it may be required that the reply  not be an abbreviated reply; for example, the reply  should include a security verification such as entry of the bill code  or a PIN by customer  (or both), because the contact with the customer , e.g., bill  via interface , to which a reply  is sought is not initiated by the financial service provider  but, for example, by the biller , so that it is not certain whether the reply  corresponds to the bill code  for which the biller-initiated billing message  has been sent. Thus, unabbreviated reply , shown in , may contain, for example, the bill code  sent by SMS to a short code (e.g., a short code that provides a connection to the financial service provider ) or a response to a security prompt in order to establish a certainty that reply  does indeed correspond to bill code , or both.","For example, the financial service provider  may respond to receipt of the reply , including bill code , with a prompt for the customer  user, e.g., \u201cHello, Charles [e.g., name of customer ], this is PayPal Mobile [e.g., name of financial service provider ] calling to confirm your bill payment to The Electric Company [e.g., name of biller ] in the amount of $57.99 [e.g., billing information ]. Enter your mobile PIN to confirm.\u201d In this example, the prompt may be personalized (e.g., \u201cHello, Charles\u201d) using information from the billing request , for example, by keying off of information contained in the reference code . Similarly, the name of the financial service provider  (e.g., \u201cthis is PayPal Mobile\u201d); the name of the biller  (e.g., \u201cThe Electric Company\u201d); and the billing information  (e.g., amount of the bill , \u201c$57.99\u201d) may also be included in the prompt. The prompt may be provided, for example, by the server computing device . The customer  may also be allowed, for example, to specify some amount the customer  is willing to pay other than simply the amount of the bill  included in the billing information .","At step , financial service provider  may in response to receiving reply  process a payment  from customer  to biller . For example, the financial service provider  match the bill code  to the biller , and then notify the biller  the amount the customer  paid (which could be different from the amount of the bill ).","The financial service provider  may collect the amount of the payment  from the customer , e.g., via a credit card or bank draft payment from customer  to the service account with financial service provider  of customer . Financial service provider  may then provide a payment  to biller  using means for payment that is independent of customer . Thus, the biller  may receive the payment  corresponding to the billing information  and reference code , exclusive of the customer's () financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers of customer .","Such processing and provision of payments  may be accomplished automatically by machine, for example, with the aid of server computing device  and cloud computing provided by communications network . Similarly, at step , financial service provider  may receive confirmation from the biller  that payment has been received (e.g., that customer's () billing account with the biller  has been credited) and may provide a receipt to the customer .","In implementation of the various embodiments, embodiments of the invention may comprise a personal computing device, such as a personal computer, laptop, PDA, cellular phone or other personal computing or communication devices.
