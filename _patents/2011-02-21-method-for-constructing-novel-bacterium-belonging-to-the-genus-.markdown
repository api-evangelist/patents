For this, a number of commercial products containing the bacteria belonging to the genus are available in the forms of various fermented foods and drinks, probiotic preparations, and the like. Particularly, fermented milk foods and drinks have excellent palatability; therefore, they are suitable for continuous ingestion of the bacteria belonging to the genus ","The bacteria belonging to the genus are obligate anaerobes and susceptible to oxygen, low pH, and high acidity. Thus, there are many difficulties in handling the bacteria belonging to the genus in fermented milk foods and drinks in terms of proliferation during production, viability during storage, and the like. In order to obtain the physiological effect of the bacteria belonging to the genus , it is considered necessary to deliver the bacteria alive to the intestine as many as possible. Particularly, increasing the viability of the bacteria in foods and drinks, namely the rate of arrival of ingested bacteria at the intestine, is regarded as an important factor.","In order to solve the above problems, an attempt has been made to improve the viability in fermented milk foods and drinks by improving the production method and adding various viability-improving agents such as N-acetyl glucosamine, pantothenic acid, peptides, and lactulose. However, such a viability-improving agent for the bacteria belonging to the genus cannot be easily added because not only it increases the production cost but also it causes problems such as reduced palatability. Further, a method that completely blocking the bacteria belonging to the genus from contacting oxygen by filling a fermented product containing the bacteria into a container composed of an oxygen-impermeable packaging material immediately after the product is produced is also studied. However, no perfect oxygen-impermeable container has yet been available. Further, there is not a lot of flexibility in shaping such a container, and waste disposal is complicated since the container is made by using composite materials. Furthermore, the container itself is expensive, etc. As mentioned above, there are many limitations in using the container.","Accordingly, a fundamental solution for improving the viability of the bacteria belonging to the genus in fermented foods and drinks is to produce bacteria belonging to the genus having high viability even under aerobic conditions and under conditions of low pH and high acidity. Examples of such a bacterial strain include YIT 10001 (FERM BP-8205) (Patent Document 1), breve SBR 3212 (FERM P-11915) (Patent Document 2), and YIT 4002 (FERM BP-1038) (Patent Document 3).","However, there has been a problem such that these strains with improved viability are expected to exhibit their effects of improved viability only under conditions in which they are produced. That is, in the production of a mutant strain of the bacteria belonging to the genus , a method of subculturing and storing bacteria belonging to the genus in an environment which is harsh for the bacteria to grow and obtaining a surviving strain is normally practiced. While a certain level of viability-improving effect can be expected in an environment under which the mutant strain has been produced, no viability-improving effect can be expected in other environments. Accordingly, the bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by a conventional method cannot be applied to foods and drinks which are distributed under a condition different from that under which the mutant strain is produced. Accordingly, utility of the conventional method has been extremely limited.","Also, although the cause is unknown, it is known that even a bacterial strain with improved viability obtained by subculturing and storing under conditions with deteriorated environmental factors (for example, a pH in the acidic region) does not exhibit its viability-improvement effect when used under mild conditions at a pH in the neutral region. This has been also one of the reasons for failing to obtain a highly-versatile bacterial strain which is applicable to various foods and drinks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[Patent Document 1] International Publication No. WO03\/040350","[Patent Document 2] JP-2922013","[Patent Document 3] JP-B-61-19220"]}},"Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing bacteria belonging to the genus having excellent viability even under various conditions with different environmental factors, novel bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the method, and a method for detecting the bacteria.","The present inventors conducted an intensive research in order to solve the aforementioned problems. As a result, they have found that, by subculturing and storing bacteria belonging to the genus alternately in at least two kinds of systems of which conditions are different in environmental factors at least twice, bacteria belonging to the genus having excellent viability under all the conditions for the alternate subculturing and storing can be obtained.","Furthermore, as a result of a research on a method for specifically detecting the novel bacteria belonging to the genus thus obtained, they have found a primer capable of specifically amplifying a DNA fragment of the bacteria, and found that the bacteria can be specifically detected and quantified by using the primer. The present inventors have further found that the viable bacterial count of the above bacteria can be quantified with a combination of the primer and a membrane-permeable dye.","That is, the present invention provides a method for producing bacteria belonging to the genus including subculturing and storing bacteria belonging to the genus alternately in at least two kinds of systems under conditions with different environmental factors at least twice.","Also, the present invention provides the bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the aforementioned method.","Also, the present invention provides a food or drink, particularly a fermented milk food or drink containing the bacteria belonging to the genus ","Also, the present invention provides a DNA fragment having a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to the above sequence.","Also, the present invention provides a primer for YIT 12272 (FERM BP-11320) having a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to the sequence.","Also, the present invention provides a method for detecting YIT 12272 including using the primer.","Also, the present invention provides a method for quantifying a bacterial count of YIT 12272 including using the primer.","Also, the present invention provides a method for quantifying a viable bacterial count of YIT 12272 (FERM BP-11320) including performing a PCR reaction on a sample treated with a membrane-permeable dye by using the primer.","According to the method for producing bacteria belonging to the genus of the present invention, bacteria belonging to the genus having excellent viability even in finished products or under conditions different in environmental factors such as distribution conditions can be obtained. Since such a bacterial strain is applicable to various foods and drinks and has high viability in foods and drinks, it can effectively exhibit the physiological effect of the bacteria belonging to the genus . Also, a bacterial strain utilizable in various foods and drinks can be produced by improving bacteria belonging to the genus having a specific physiological effect such as an anti-bacteria action through the production method of the present invention. For these reasons, the present invention has extremely high industrial applicability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"i":"Bifidobacterium breve "},"In the present invention, an environmental factor refers to any factor which affects the proliferation and viability of the bacteria belonging to the genus . Examples thereof include pH, osmotic pressure, acidity, culture\/storage temperature, culture\/storage time, the amount of dissolved oxygen, light, pressure, water activity, a co-existing microorganism, a nutritional factor (for example, sugars, protein, peptide, fats such as a milk fat, vitamins, minerals, a nonfat milk solid, and a growth factor of the bacteria belonging to the genus such as a yeast extract), an antibiotic, a culture method (such as static culture, stirred culture, shaking culture, and aeration culture), a sterilization method, a blending method, a packing method, and a material of a storage container of a culture broth or a food or drink. Particularly, pH, osmotic pressure, acidity, culture temperature, and a nutritional factor, which are important environmental factors affecting the proliferation and viability of the bacteria belonging to the genus , are preferably used. Herein, light includes both visible light and non-visible light, and acidity indicates the amount of a 1\/10 N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (mL) necessary to neutralize 9 g of a sample.","Also, \u201cat least two kinds of systems under conditions with different environmental factors\u201d refer to at least two kinds of systems in which the quality and\/or the quantity of certain environmental factors are varied, for example, at least two kinds of systems resulting from varying pH, osmotic pressure, acidity, culture temperature, a nutritional factor, and the like of a culture broth or a food or drink. More specific examples include systems resulting from varying a culture broth or a food or drink by means of changing the pH, for example, from 5 to 3, changing the osmotic pressure, for example, from 600 mOsm (milliosmol) to 950 mOsm, changing the acidity, for example, from 6 to 20, changing the culture temperature of culture broth, for example, from 37\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C., changing the sugars in culture broth or food or drink, for example, from digestible sugar to nondigestible sugar, and, for example, increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen by stirring.","No particular limitation is imposed on either the target environmental factor or the changes in the quality and\/or the quantity thereof. However, it is preferable to take into consideration one or more conditions and environmental factors of culture broths or foods and drinks to which the bacteria belonging to the genus to be produced by the production method of the present invention are applied, select the condition and the environmental factor affecting the proliferation and viability of the bacteria belonging to the genus , and conduct alternately subculturing and storing of the bacteria under thus selected condition and environmental factor. Although culture conditions of the bacteria belonging to the genus vary depending on the bacterial species, in general, culture is carried out approximately under the following conditions; a nonfat milk solid content of 5 to 30%, a milk fat content of 0 to 10%, an osmotic pressure of 150 to 1000 mOsm, a pH of 4.0 to 7.0, a concentration of dissolved oxygen of 0 to 2 ppm, and a culture temperature of 30 to 39\u00b0 C. The conditions can be varied within the above range, or conditions can be set outside the above range. Further, storage conditions vary depending on the kind and the form of a culture broth or a food or drink, for example, the storage temperature for foods and drinks may be a normal temperature, a refrigerated temperature, or a freezing temperature. Thus, the environmental factor and the condition of a culture broth or a food or drink to which the bacteria are applied may be appropriately selected and used.","Also, when a syrup (sweetener) is added to a culture broth to provide a food or drink, various kinds of sugars will be used. In that case, the osmotic pressure may be increased or decreased depending on the kind of sugar used; therefore, such a change in the osmotic pressure may be used as the condition to be varied.","Further, when a food or drink is stored in a blending tank for a certain period of time before filed in a container, the drink or food needs to be homogenized by stirring before filled a container. At this time, oxygen in the head space of the blending tank may be taken in and the concentration of dissolved oxygen is increased to the saturation concentration in some cases. Thus, such a change in the concentration of dissolved oxygen may be used as the condition to be varied.","Although no particular limitation is imposed on the kind of the bacteria belonging to the genus which can be used in the production method of the present invention, examples thereof include , and . Among them, , and are preferable as they have been used in a number of milk products for some time and data of the safety and the like have accumulated, and further, those bacteria exhibit also a high viability-improvement effect. Among them, is particularly preferable.","Using the aforementioned bacteria belonging to the genus as a parent strain, by alternately subculturing and storing the bacteria belonging to the genus at least twice in at least two kinds of systems under conditions with different environmental factors, the bacteria belonging to the genus having excellent viability under all the conditions used for the alternate subculturing and storing can be obtained. Specifically, (1) the parent strain bacteria belonging to the genus is cultured under environmental factor A to thereby obtain a culture broth or a food or drink. The culture broth or the food or drink thus obtained is stored so that a strain exhibiting improved viability under the conditions with the environmental factor A is concentrated or selected. (2) After that, the strain exhibiting improved viability is cultured under environmental factor B to thereby obtain a culture broth or a food or drink. The culture broth or the food or drink thus obtained is stored so that a strain exhibiting improved viability under the conditions with the environmental factor B is concentrated or selected. (3) The above steps are repeated at least twice, whereby the bacteria belonging to the genus exhibiting excellent viability under the environmental factors A and B can be obtained.","A method of alternately subculturing and storing, when the conditions are varied based on the environmental factors A and B, includes performing the alternate subculturing and storing in any combination and order such as A\u2192B\u2192A\u2192B\u2192A and A\u2192A\u2192B\u2192B\u2192A\u2192A\u2192B\u2192B\u2192A\u2192A\u2192B\u2192B; however, the alternate subculturing and storing is preferably performed at least twice. It is preferably performed 2 to 100 times, more preferably 4 to 100 times, particularly preferably 4 to 50 times.","At least two kinds of the condition variations of the environmental factor may be set. A method of alternately subculturing and storing in which three condition variations, A, B, and C, are set may be carried out in any way, for example, A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192A\u2192B\u2192C and A\u2192A\u2192A\u2192B\u2192B\u2192C\u2192A\u2192B\u2192B\u2192B\u2192C\u2192C\u2192A.","The environmental factor are preferably changed in at least one kind, further, at least two kinds, and particularly at least three kinds selected from pH, osmotic pressure, acidity, culture temperature, and a nutritional factor in terms of A and B. Herein, these factors are preferably changed in the following range; pH changed by 0.1 to 3 between 4.0 and 7.0, the osmotic pressure changed by 10 to 700 mOsm between 150 and 1000 mOsm, the acidity changed by 1 to 20 between 5 and 30, and the culture temperature changed by 1 to 6\u00b0 C. between 30 and 39\u00b0 C. As the nutritional factor, it is preferable to change the kind of sugar from palatinose to reduced maltose syrup. Also, a milk fat content is preferably changed by 0.1 to 6% between 0 and 10%. Also, a nonfat milk solid content is preferably changed by 0.1 to 20% between 5 and 30%.","Further, it is also possible to treat the parent strain of bacteria belonging to the genus with a mutation-inducing agent and the like such as ultraviolet rays, nitrosoguanidine (NTG), and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and subject the mutation-inducing agent-treated parent strain to the aforementioned alternate subculturing and storing to select a bacterial strain having desired quality.","Herein, the viability indicates approximately how many live bacteria are present in a culture broth or a food or drink after storage, and the viable bacterial count can be obtained by an ordinary method. For example, a culture broth, or a drink or food used for storage is appropriately diluted and applied to a TOS propionate agar medium, followed by anaerobic culture at 37\u00b0 C. for 72 hours. Then, the viable bacterial count can be obtained by determining colonies formed on the medium. The viability can be indicated based on the proportion of the viable bacterial count in a culture broth, or a drink or food used for storage after storage to that before storage.","Any medium in which the bacteria belonging to the genus can grow, such as a GAM medium, a MILS medium (Iwata & Morishita, Letter in Applied Microbiology, vol. 9, 165-168, 1989), a TOS propionate medium, soybean milk, vegetable juice, fruit juice, and wort can be used as a culture broth in the production method of the present invention. However, a medium containing milk as a main component is preferable, and examples of the milk include cow milk (whole milk) and a processed product thereof such as defatted milk and a milk-derived peptide. A nonfat milk solid content and a fat content can be set at any amount depending on the milk material to be used and the blending amount thereof, and a growth factor of the bacteria belonging to the genus such as a yeast extract may be added. Any of these nonfat milk solid content, fat content, and growth factor of the bacteria belonging to the genus can be an environmental factor.","Also, the environmental factor of fermented milk foods and drinks obtained by adding an optional ingredient such as a syrup to a culture broth containing a milk medium is close to that of a finished product; therefore, bacteria exhibiting high viability in a finished product can be more efficiently concentrated. Thus, the fermented milk foods and drinks are preferably used for the aforementioned breeding and improvement of the bacterial strain. An optional ingredient, for example, a syrup (sweetener) such as sugars, an emulsifying agent, a thickener (a stabilizer), vitamins, and minerals can be added to the fermented milk foods and drinks, any of which can be an environmental factor. Examples of the syrup include sugars such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, glucose fructose syrup, palatinose, trehalose, lactose, xylose, malt sugar, honey, and molasses, sugar alcohol such as sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, palatinit, a reduced sugar syrup, and a reduced malt sugar syrup, a highly-sweet sweetener such as aspartame, thaumatin, sucralose, acesulfame-K, and stevia. Also, an emulsifying agent such as a sucrose fatty acid ester, a glycerin fatty acids ester, a polyglycerin fatty acid ester, a sorbitan fatty acid ester, and lecithin, a thickener (a stabilizer) such as agar, gelatin, carrageenan, guar gum, xanthan gum, pectin, locust bean gum, gellan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, soybean polysaccharide, and propylene glycol alginate may be added to the fermented milk foods and drinks. Besides these, vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin Bs, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin Es, minerals such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, and manganese, an acidifier such as citric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, and gluconic acid, a milk fat content such as cream, butter, and sour cream, flavors of, for example, yoghurt, berry, orange, Chinese quince, perilla, citrus, apple, mint, grape, apricot, pear, custard cream, peach, melon, banana, the tropics, herb, tea, and coffee, a herb extract, and a brown sugar extract, and the like can be added.","For the culture broth and the fermented milk food or drink, microorganisms other than the bacteria belonging to the genus can also be used in combination. Examples of the microorganism include bacteria belonging to the genus such as subsp. subsp. , and , bacteria belonging to the genus such as , bacteria belonging to the genus such as subsp. and subsp. , bacteria belonging to the genus such as and , bacteria belonging to the genus such as , yeast belonging to the genus , and such as , and ","The fermented foods and drinks can be produced according to an ordinary method. For example, when producing fermented milk foods and drinks, the parent strain of bacteria belonging to the genus is inoculated into a sterilized milk medium alone or in combination with other microorganisms and cultured, and the resulting product is subjected to homogenization treatment to give fermented milk. Subsequently, a separately-prepared syrup solution is added and mixed, and the resulting product is homogenized using a homogenizer and the like, and a flavor is further added to prepare the final product.","By the aforementioned method, using YIT 4125 (FERM BP-7813) as the parent strain, one strain of the bacteria belonging to the genus exhibiting particularly excellent viability under the conditions of different environmental factors was produced. The bacterial strain thus obtained was deposited as YIT 12272 (deposited under the terms of the Budapest Treaty under accession number FERM BP-11320) at International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki) on Feb. 16, 2010.

Further, the bacteria may be added to various food products, for example, a processed meat product such as ham and sausage, a processed seafood product such as cooked minced fish (kamaboko) or fish sausage (chikuwa), bread, confectionary, butter, and dry milk, or the bacteria may also be added to drinks such as water, fruit juice, milk, a soft drink, and a tea drink. It is to be noted that the foods and drinks also include feed for the animal.","The bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the method of the present invention can be applied to various kinds of foods and drinks of different environments, and owing to its high viability in foods and drinks, the bacteria belonging to the genus can effectively exhibit their general physiological function such as an intestine-regulating action. Also, improving the bacteria belonging to the genus naturally having a specific physiological effect such as a bacteria-eradication action by the production method of the present invention enables utilization of the bacterial strain in various foods and drinks. This increases the palatability of the foods and drinks containing the bacterial strain, and at the same time broadens consumers' choice. Further, improving the viability of the bacterial strain can enhance the physiological effect of the bacterial strain.","Further, the food and drink are preferably used as fermented foods and drinks such as fermented milk foods and drinks, fermented soymilk, fermented fruit juice, and fermented vegetable juice containing live bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the method of the present invention. Among them, fermented milk foods and drinks are preferably employed. These fermented milk foods and drinks may be produced by an ordinary method, and can be produced by the aforementioned method. The fermented milk foods and drinks thus obtained may also be provided as a product in the form of any of a plain type without syrup (a sweetener), a soft type, a fruit-flavored type, solid, liquid, and the like.","Further, the present invention relates to foods and drinks containing the bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the method of the present invention, particularly fermented milk foods and drinks containing a sweetener. The kind, the production method, and the form of the fermented milk foods and drinks may be similar to those described above. It is preferable to produce fermented milk foods and drinks using a combination of the bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the method of the present invention and at least one kind of bacterium selected from bacteria belonging to the genus , bacteria belonging to the genus , and bacteria belonging to the genus because high palatability is attained, and this enables continuous ingestion.","Further, for foods and drinks prepared by using the bacteria belonging to the genus , a container composed of an oxygen-impermeable packaging material such as glass and aluminum-coated paper has been mainly used for the purpose of increasing the viability of the bacteria during storage. However, because the bacteria belonging to the genus obtained by the method of the present invention do not require a strict anaerobic condition owing to its high viability, highly oxygen-permeable resin (such as polystyrene, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate) can also be used as a material for the container. A container made of such a resin has merits of low cost and high flexibility in forming, as compared with a container composed of an oxygen-impermeable packaging material.","A DNA fragment and a primer of the present invention have a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to the sequence. The DNA fragment primer of the present invention can be obtained by performing PCR on DNA derived from numerous bacteria belonging to the genus and related bacteria and searching through RAPD method. That is, PCR is performed on DNA derived from bacteria belonging to the genus using numerous random primers to amplify a DNA fragment sandwiched between the random primers. Based on the RAPD band pattern thus obtained, cloning is performed and the nucleotide sequence of the YIT 12272-specific PCR amplification product is determined (SEQ ID NO: 3). The DNA fragment primer of the present invention is designed based on the nucleotide sequence thus determined (SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2). The DNA fragment primer of the present invention includes a DNA fragment primer having a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2.","For the primer of the present invention, a combination of two nucleotide sequences represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2; or a combination of two nucleotide sequences complementary to the sequences is more preferably used. Furthermore, it is preferable to use a primer having a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a sequence complementary to the sequence as a forward primer and a primer having a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a sequence complementary to the sequence as a reverse primer.","The primer of the present invention is specific for the YIT 12272, and useful for detection, quantification of the bacterial count, and quantification of the viable bacterial count for the YIT 12272. Examples of a sample for the detection and quantification method of the present invention include foods and drinks, pharmaceutical products, and feces containing YIT 12272.","Examples of the method of detecting and quantifying YIT 12272 include the steps of (1) extracting DNA from a sample, (2) performing a PCR reaction using the primer of the present invention, and (3) detecting the DNA fragment amplified by the step (2).","In more detail, first, DNA is extracted from feces, foods, drinks, and the like, as a sample for PCR. As a method of extracting DNA from a diluted solution of feces and the like, Marmur's method which is the standard method, an enzyme method which is the modified Marmur's method, and a benzyl chloride method are preferable. Further, a sample obtained by suspending some of the bacterial cells in a buffer or sterilized water, followed by heating at 95\u00b0 C. for approximately 15 minutes can be provided as a template for PCR.","A target DNA fragment (PCR product) can be obtained by carrying out the amplification reaction using a combination of DNA thus extracted and the primer of the present invention. Generally, when using a primer in PCR method and the like, it is preferable to use a pair of two kinds of primers. For example, by using a primer set of primers having nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, only a region sandwiched between the primers in DNA of the YIT 12272 can be amplified among other numerous kinds of bacteria which are present, whereby the bacteria can be identified. Also, when performing PCR, quantification of the target bacteria is also possible by subjecting template DNA to serial dilution in advance to find the detection limit and then the similar analysis is conducted.","The DNA thus obtained may be subjected to electrophoresis, and the YIT 12272 can be identified based on the presence or absence of a band.","Also, only live bacteria of the YIT 12272 can be detected and quantified by performing PCR reaction on a sample after treated with a membrane-permeable dye. Examples of a membrane-permeable dye to be used include ethidium monoazide (EMA) and propidium monoazide (PMA), and propidium monoazide (PMA) is particularly preferable. The membrane-permeable dye treatment of a sample is carried out by, for example, adding a membrane-permeable dye solution having a final concentration of 5 to 250 \u03bcM, followed by irradiation of light. PCR reaction may be performed in a same manner as mentioned above.","Hereinbelow, the content of the present invention will be described further in detail with Examples; however, the present invention is not limited in any way by these Examples.","Using YIT 10001 strain (FERM BP-8205) and YIT 4125 strain (FERM BP-7813) as the parent strain, the alternate subculturing and concentrating of the bacteria is conducted.","(1) After sterilizing 20.7% whole milk powder medium at 135\u00b0 C. for 3.5 seconds, 0.5% of seed starter 1 of YIT 10001 strain or YIT 4125 strain and 1% of a seed starter of were inoculated and then cocultured at 33\u00b0 C. until the pH reached 5.3, whereby bacterial suspension A1 (400 mL) was prepared.\n\n(2) Into the bacterial suspension A1, syrup solution A was blended to 10% of the final concentration of palatinose, whereby milk product A1 (630 mL) was prepared. The milk product A1 (200 mL) was dispensed into 300-mL flasks, followed by storage at 5\u00b0 C. for one week while stirring (90 rpm) under aerobic conditions with a cotton plug (hereinafter, abbreviated as aerobic stirring storage). Subsequently, test tubes were filled up with the resulting milk product A1 and closed with a butyl stopper, followed by static storage at 10\u00b0 C. for one week under anaerobic conditions (hereinafter, abbreviated as anaerobic static storage).\n\n(3) The milk product A1 (1 mL) stored under the above conditions was inoculated in 10 mL of a cephalothin-added milk medium (12% defatted milk, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.03% L-cysteine hydrochloride, 0.2% sedimentary calcium carbonate, and 5 \u03bcg\/mL cephalothin, hereinafter, abbreviated as a cephalothin-added milk medium), followed by anaerobic culture at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours, whereby mother starter 2 of was obtained. The mother starter 2 (0.03 mL) was inoculated in 30 mL of a milk medium (12% defatted milk, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.03% L-cysteine hydrochloride, 0.2% sedimentary calcium carbonate, hereinafter abbreviated as a milk medium), followed by anaerobic culture at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours, whereby seed starter 2 of was prepared. Similar operations as above were repeated using the seed starter 2. That is, milk product A2 prepared by using the seed starter 2 was subjected to aerobic stirring storage, followed by anaerobic static storage, whereby mother starter 3 of , and further, seed starter 3 of were prepared.\n\n(4) Subsequently, a 23.5% defatted milk medium was sterilized at 120\u00b0 C. for 3.5 seconds, and 2% of the seed starter 3 of and 0.01% of a seed starter of lactis were inoculated and then mixed and cocultured at 37\u00b0 C. until the pH reached 4.4, whereby bacterial suspension B1 (100 mL) was prepared.\n\n(5) Further, to a 19.7% defatted milk medium which was sterilized at 120\u00b0 C. for 3.5 seconds, 0.08% of milk peptide was added, and then 0.5% of a seed starter of was inoculated and cultured at 37\u00b0 C. until the pH reached 4.3, whereby bacterial suspension C1 (700 mL) was prepared. The bacterial suspension C1 was added to bacterial suspension B1 (blending ratio 1:2), and further, syrup solution B was blended to 5% of the final concentration of reduced maltose syrup, whereby milk product B1 (870 mL) was prepared.\n\n(6) Similarly to the milk product A1, the milk product B1 (1 mL) was subjected to aerobic stirring storage, followed by anaerobic static storage, and then inoculated in 10 mL of the cephalothin-added milk medium, followed by anaerobic culture at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours to provide mother starter 4 of . The mother starter 4 (0.03 mL) was inoculated in 30 mL of the milk medium, followed by anaerobic culture at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours, whereby seed starter 4 of was prepared. Similar operations as above were repeated using the seed starter 4. That is, milk product B2 prepared with the seed starter 4 was subjected to aerobic stirring storage, followed by anaerobic static storage, whereby mother starter 5, and further, seed starter 5 of were prepared.\n","As shown above, preparation, aerobic stirring storage, and anaerobic static storage of the milk product A were repeated twice. Subsequently, using surviving , preparation, aerobic stirring storage, and anaerobic static storage of the milk product B were repeated twice and the was concentrated. A series of the above steps was set as one cycle, which was repeated for a total of four cycles. Finally, milk product A8 and milk product B8 were subjected to anaerobic static storage at 10\u00b0 C. for two weeks and then a portion (1 mL) of each products was applied to a TOS propionate agar medium (Yakult Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd.) containing 5 \u03bcg\/mL cephalothin and anaerobic culture was conducted at 37\u00b0 C. by using Anaero Pack (Mitsubishi gas chemical company, Inc.) to isolate single colony. The single colony isolation was repeated for purification, whereby single colonies of a total 42 strains derived from YIT 10001 strain and YIT 4125 strain, specifically a total of 21 strains from milk product A8 and a total of 21 strains from milk product B8, were isolated.","Using the parent strain and the isolated strains, milk products A and B were each prepared and stored while stirring at 5\u00b0 C. for one week under aerobic conditions, followed by static storage at 10\u00b0 C. for two weeks under anaerobic conditions in accordance with the method of Example 1. Then, YIT 12272 strain (derived from YIT 4125 strain, isolated from the milk product A8), which exhibited excellent viability in both of the milk products A and B, was selected.","The results of viability of YIT 12272 strain and control strain (YIT 10001 strain and YIT 4125 strain) in the milk products A and B are shown in Table 3.

In contrast, in milk products A and B prepared by using each control bacteria, 3\u00d710CFU\/mL or more live cells survived in one of the milk products; however, the control bacteria did not exhibit excellent viability in both of the products.","Also, the physical properties of the milk product A and B are shown in Table 4. Syrup A was blended into bacterial suspension A to prepare milk product A, of which the pH and the acidity were found to be 5.6 and 3.4, respectively. Although the osmotic pressure of the bacterial suspension A was 550 mOsm, it was increased to 950 mOsm in the milk product A. Meanwhile, bacterial suspension C and syrup B were blended into bacterial suspension B to prepare milk product B, of which the pH and the acidity were found to be 4.4 and 7.5, respectively. Although the osmotic pressure of bacterial suspension B was 900 mOsm, it was decreased to 600 mOsm in the milk product B.","As shown above, it was revealed that the viability of YIT 12272 strain was enhanced, compared with the control strain, in both of the milk products A and B, which differed in culture temperature, pH, acidity, a change in the osmotic pressure due to blending of syrup, a

Using a liquid medium with GAM+1% glucose, to each of untreated YIT 12272 which had been cultured for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. under anaerobic conditions (live bacteria), dead cells thereof obtained by heating the bacteria at 80\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes, or dead cells thereof obtained by continuously culturing the bacteria for 10 days at 37\u00b0 C., the dye was added to the final concentrations of EMA and PMA of 240 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM, respectively. After keeping warm for five minutes at room temperature, the bacteria were irradiated by light for two minutes using two 500 W halogen lamps at a distance of 20 cm under the lamp. Thereafter, DNA was extracted from each of bacterial cells, and YIT 12272 was quantified by quantitative PCR using the YIT 12272-specific primer. (As a quantitative PCR method, the method described in International Journal of Food Microbiology (2008) Vol. 126, p. 210 to 215 was used.) As a result, while both EMA and PMA inhibited PCR amplification in dead bacterial cells, EMA also inhibited PCR amplification in live bacteria. Based on that PMA inhibited PCR amplification in dead bacteria without inhibiting PCR amplification in live YIT 12272, it was found that PMA was suitable for detection and quantification of live YIT 12272 by quantitative PCR. [FIG. 2]","In order to optimize the PMA treatment, quantitative PCR was carried out using the YIT 12272-specific primer, and live bacteria and heat-killed bacterial cells of YIT 12272 treated with various PMA concentrations (5 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, and 150 \u03bcM) and light irradiation time (one, two, and five minutes). As a result, it was found that light irradiation time did not affect the PMA treatment, and that the treatment with low concentration (5 \u03bcM) and high concentration (150 \u03bcM) of PMA exhibited a weaker inhibitory effect on PCR amplification in the heat-killed bacterial cell, compared to the treatment with 50 \u03bcM PMA (). Accordingly, it was found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM PMA and two minutes of light irradiation was suitable for the PMA treatment to be applied on YIT 12272.","(2) Detection and Quantification of Live YIT 12272 in Feces","Feces in which the absence of YIT 12272 was confirmed by a selective medium and quantitative PCR using the YIT 12272-specific primer was prepared. To the feces, heat-killed bacterial cells of YIT 12272 were added, followed by the PMA treatment (50 \u03bcM PMA and two minutes of light irradiation). As a result, it was found that PCR amplification in the heat-killed bacterial cells of YIT 12272 in feces was inhibited, and the quantitative value of the dead bacteria of YIT 12272 was decreased to approximately one-twenty thousandth (). In contrast, live YIT 12272 which had been cultured for 24 hours was added to the feces and the PMA treatment was carried out, and YIT 12272 was quantified by quantitative PCR using the primer specific for YIT 12272. As a result, the PMA treatment did not inhibit PCR amplification in viable YIT 12272, resulting that, when YIT 12272 is present in an amount of 10or more per gram of feces, viable YIT 12272 can be accurately quantified (). Herein, the viable bacterial count of YIT 12272 can be calculated by the following formula 3.","(Symbol)","PCR quantitative value of YIT 12272 without PMA treatment: X cells\/g","PCR quantitative value of YIT 12272 subjected to PMA treatment: Y cells\/g","The viable bacterial count of YIT 12272 in a sample: L cells\/g","The dead bacterial count of YIT 12272 in a sample: D cells\/g\n\n\u2003\u2003Formula 1:\n\n20000\u2003\u2003Formula 2:\n\n(Formula 3 is derived by Formulae 1 and 2):=(20000)\/19999\u2003\u2003Formula 3\n","The following method was used for extraction of DNA from feces.
