The sophistication of this communication has improved and the primary modes differentiated over time and technological progress. Each primary mode of online communication varies based on a combination of three basic values: privacy and persistence and control. Email as a communications medium is private (communications are initially exchanged only between named recipients), persistent (saved in inboxes or mail servers) but lacks control (once you send the message, you can't take it back, or edit it, or limit re-use of it). Instant messaging is private, typically not persistent (some newer clients are now allowing users to save history, so this mode is changing) and lacks control. Message boards are public (typically all members, and often all Internet users, can access your message) persistent, but lack control (they are typically moderated by a central owner of the board). Chat rooms are public (again, some are membership based) typically not persistent, and lack control.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"privacy","persistence","author control"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Chat Rooms\/IRC","no","no","no"]},{"entry":[{},"Instant Messaging","yes","no","no"]},{"entry":[{},"Forums","no","yes","no"]},{"entry":[{},"Email","yes","yes","no"]},{"entry":[{},"Blogs","no","yes","yes"]},{"entry":[{},"social networks","yes\/no","yes","yes"]},{"entry":[{},"Second Life","yes","yes","yes+"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Blogs and Social Networks are the predominant communications mediums that permit author control. By reducing the cost, technical sophistication, and experience required to create and administer a web site, blogs and other persistent online communication have given an unprecedented amount of editorial control to millions of online authors. This has created a unique new environment for creative expression, commentary, discourse, and criticism without the historical limits of editorial control, cost, technical expertise, or distribution\/exposure.","There is significant value in the information contained within this public media. Because the opinions, topics of discussion, brands and celebrities mentioned and relationships evinced are typically totally unsolicited, the information presented, if well studied, represents an amazing new source of social insight, consumer feedback, opinion measurement, popularity analysis and messaging data. It also represents a fully exposed, granular network of peer and hierarchical relationships rich with authority and influence. The marketing, advertising, and PR value of this information is unprecedented.","This new medium represents a significant challenge for interested, parties to comprehensively understand and interact with. As of Q1 2007 estimates for the number of active, unique online CGM sites (forums, blogs, social networks, etc.) range from 50 to 71 million, with growth rates in the hundreds of thousands of new sites per day. Compared to the typical mediums that PR, Advertising and Marketing businesses and divisions interact with (<1000 TV channels, <1000 radio stations, <1000 major news publications, <10-20 major pundits on any given subject, etc.) this represents a nearly 10,000-fold increase in the number of potential targets for interaction.","Businesses and other motivated communicators have come to depend on software that perform Business Intelligence, Customer Relationship Management, and Enterprise Resource Planning tasks to facilitate accelerated, organized, prioritized, tracked and analyzed interaction with customers and other target groups (voters, consumers, pundits, opinion leaders, analysts, reporters, etc.). These systems have been extended to facilitate IM, E-mail, and telephone interactions. These media have been successfully integrated because of standards (jabber, pop3, smtp, pots, imp) that require that all participant applications conform to a set data format that allows interaction with this data in a predictable way.","Blogs and other CGM generate business value for their owners, both on private sites that use custom or open source software to manage their communications, and for massive public hosts. Because these sites can generate advertising revenue, there is a drive by author\/owners to protect the content on these sites, so readers\/subscribers\/peers have to visit the site, and become exposed to revenue generating advertising, in order to participate in\/observe the communication. Because of this financial disincentive, there is no unifying standard for blogs which contains complete data. RSS and Atom feeds allow structured communication of some portion of the communication on sites, but are often very incomplete representations of the data available on a given site. Sites also protect their content from being \u201cstolen\u201d by automated systems with an array of CAPTCHAs, (\u201cCompletely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\u201d) email verification, mobile phone text message verification, password authentication, cookie tracking. Uniform Resource Locator (URL) obfuscation, timeouts and Internet Protocol (IP) address tracking.","The result is a massively diverse community that it would be very valuable to understand and interact with, which resists aggregation and unified interaction by way of significant technical diversity, resistance to complete information data standards, and tests that attempt to require one-to-one human interaction with content.","Embodiments described herein provide enhanced computer- and network-based methods, techniques, and systems for maintaining social intelligence of the social media space. Exemplary embodiments provide a Social Intelligence System (\u201cSIS\u201d), which enables users to search, monitor, export, compare, discover, engage, and or manage social media. In one embodiment the SIS includes a content collection and ingestion system, stored in the memory and configured, when executed on a computer processor, to communicate with one or more computing systems to direct a search of a content source using a received collection request and to ingest the results of the directed search into a data store; and a content management system, stored in the memory and configured, when executed on a computer processor, to display the ingested results on a display. One such example of such techniques is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,720,835, filed May 7, 2007, and entitled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CONSUMER-GENERATED MEDIA REPUTATION MANAGEMENT,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The following sections describe various architectural components, data flows, and other aspects of an example embodiment of a SIS, including various processes used to implement an example SIS. It further describes various alternative or additional techniques that may be employed by various embodiments of an SIS. Other system organizations and process flows could also be used to implement the capabilities of an SIS.","Embodiments include platform and services designed to enable Global 2000 customers, agencies and integration partners to more profitably engage their markets. Embodiments transform masses of unstructured social media data into actionable business insights that drive purchase behavior, improved customer service and brand loyalty.","In one embodiment, social data is collected from blogs, microblogs, social networks, social news sites, message boards & forums, social video sites. This includes the social must-have sites: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn, Details include, but are not limited to, the following examples:\n\n","The capability exists for an embodiment to add additional RSS data sources that may be keyword matched.","Data may be collected in languages available for that media type. For example, Twitter is available in English, Japanese, French, Italian, German and Spanish, which is what an embodiment, in turn, is able to collect.","Threaded content is available and includes the original post and all the comments written against that post.","Hyperlinks (aka permalinks) to a video or picture are preferably presented with the post for easy one-click view to the source site.","An embodiment regularly searches the Internet 24\u00d77\u00d7365 for keywords to match the saved searches created for each of your workspaces, and also does fall-site collection from popular areas of the social that are hotbeds of social conversation. An embodiment also builds customized templates for sites (aka \u201chot sites\u201d) that are of relevance to you, which may come at additional costs to implement.","An embodiment has the ability to collect from password-protected sites on a case-by-case basis provided (1) the client gives permission to access them with their user name and password (e.g., LinkedIn), and (2) a special template is constructed for that site and user to implement collection.","Data collection is an ongoing process that takes place 24\u00d77\u00d7365. Most content is identified and collected within minutes or hours of appearing publicly on the internet. Once the data is in a system according to an embodiment, it is cleaned and enriched, as discussed in greater detail below, and is available to users anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 hours.","All content that an embodiment collects from different media sources goes through a common ingestion and QA process that includes: data normalization, de-duplication, SPAM filtering and auto-scoring.","Filtering options for any search include:\n\n","Data can be segmented by three principle subjects\u2014author, site and content\u2014and further by sentiment, volume, lists, trend, media type, geo and period. Data can be segmented further with keyword includes and excludes using filters.","In an embodiment, a word cloud identifies the most common word and terms occurring within filtered search results. The cloud is interactive, and as a user clicks on a word or phrase, the search is (temporarily) revised to include that word or term and narrow the search results. This can be a very useful method to quickly determine growing topic trends within a brand or issue before they become viral and help keep the user's finger on the pulse of what people are talking about in specific time periods.","Influencers can be identified using a number of methods in the tool including the most active authors, authors on top websites.","Analytics provide the ability to identify trends, drill into the drivers behind shifts in the trends and tag appropriate insights to be handled as required by a user's social media team, product innovation team, brand managers and marketing specialists.","Auto-sentiment (aka automated sentiment) is the programmatic review and analysis of status updates, tweets and blog posts through Natural Language Processing and assignment of positive, negative, neutral or mixed sentiment.","An embodiment utilises proprietary algorithms, rich Natural Language Processing and machine learning to provide industry leading sentiment scoring for every piece of content collected. All data may be automatically scored for sentiment (some competitors only score a sample) for positive, negative, neutral (gray circle) and mixed (yellow face).","Searches may include the ability to search based on multi-word phrases (in quotations) and to use compound search operators and wildcards (proximity like \u201cNEAR\u201d may be included) to find the data you are looking for.","Geographical source of data may be identified at the country-level using IP identification (of the hosted domain\/URL) and manual site validation for the highest volume sites.","Data may be collected from both localized and global websites. An embodiment collects some specific geographical data at the latitude and longitude level.","In an embodiment, custom tagging provides the ability to define a strategy that works best for a user. These tags can then be added to any post, providing a basis for workflow as tagged posts are filtered and surfaced for users according to the specific tag they are looking for. Any post can also be forwarded as an email from within the application to users that are outside the system, providing exposure to the specific data and enabling action.","Users may engage with Twitter directly through the tool and promote any post to Facebook as well.","Users may promote by clicking the drop down while on a post and then logging in to their selected site, or if logged in, an embodiment copies the body of the post for them with the appropriate @mention or RT notation to help a user save time.","For example, directly from a displayed post, a user may:\n\n","Additionally, a user can select to email any post they are reviewing. The post body auto fills in their email tool and allows them to enter the \u201cTo\u201d address.","In an embodiment, the Monitoring Tab is where a user may view saved searches and drill into the data sets, track changes over time and uncover potential insights and areas for deeper research. There is at least one but preferably at least 27 distinct views that allow a user to drill down from high-level metrics to granular post-level view details. A user can slice and dice data based on multiple pivots:","By Focus areas\n\n","By View areas\n\n","Dashboards can provide the ability to select the Search and Monitor views that are most relevant to the user and combine those views and searches on a single screen view.","When selecting and clicking on a data point, the drill down may show the content (posts) that drove the specific data point value for the respective time frame. So a user may see all of the posts related, to that point, for the selected time period.","An embodiment includes an event detection feature called Intelligent Alerts, that may track volume and tone changes that are out of the \u201cnormal\u201d range as defined. It is highly useful for scenarios like monitoring a potential crisis outbreak, forecasting trends and campaign outcomes, etc.","According to one or more embodiments, the combination of software or computer-executable instructions with a computer-readable medium results in the creation of a machine or apparatus. Similarly, the execution of software or computer-executable instructions by a processing device results in the creation of a machine or apparatus, which may be distinguishable from the processing device, itself, according to an embodiment.","Correspondingly, it is to be understood that a computer-readable medium is transformed by storing software or computer-executable instructions thereon. Likewise, a processing device is transformed in the course of executing software or computer-executable instructions. Additionally, it is to be understood that a first set of data input to a processing device during, or otherwise in association with, the execution of software or computer-executable instructions by the processing device is transformed into a second set of data as a consequence of such execution. This second data set may subsequently be stored, displayed, or otherwise communicated. Such transformation, alluded to in each of the above examples, may be a consequence of, or otherwise involve, the physical alteration of portions of a computer-readable medium. Such transformation, alluded to in each of the above examples, may also be a consequence of, or otherwise involve, the physical alteration of, for example, the states of registers and\/or counters associated with a processing device during execution of software or computer-executable instructions by the processing device.","As used herein, a process that is performed \u201cautomatically\u201d may mean that the process is performed as a result of machine-executed instructions and does not, other than the establishment of user preferences, require manual effort.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0149"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"Embodiments of the invention are operational with numerous other general-purpose or special-purpose computing-system environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set-top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed-computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","Embodiments of the invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Embodiments of the invention may also be practiced in distributed-computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed-computing environment, program modules may be located in both local- and remote-computer storage media including memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing an embodiment of the invention includes a computing device, such as computing device . In its most basic configuration, computing device  typically includes at least one processing unit  and memory .","Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device, memory  may be volatile (such as random-access memory (RAM)), non-volatile (such as read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, etc.) or some combination of the two. This most basic configuration is illustrated in  by dashed line .","Additionally, device  may have additional features\/functionality. For example, device  may also include additional storage (removable and\/or non-removable) including, but not limited to, magnetic or optical disks or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in  by removable storage  and non-removable storage . Computer storage media includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Memory , removable storage  and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by device . Any such computer storage media may be part of device .","Device  may also contain communications connection(s)  that allow the device to communicate with other devices. Communications connection(s)  is an example of communication media. Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, radio-frequency (RF), infrared and other wireless media. The term computer-readable media as used herein includes both storage media and communication media.","Device  may also have input device(s)  such as keyboard, mouse, pen, voice-input device, touch-input device, etc. Output device(s)  such as a display, speakers, printer, etc. may also be included. All such devices are well-known in the art and need not be discussed at length here.","Referring now to , an embodiment of the present invention can be described in the context of an exemplary computer network system  as illustrated. System  includes an electronic client device , such as a personal computer or workstation, that is linked via a communication medium, such as a network  (e.g., the Internet), to an electronic device or system, such as a server . The server  may further be coupled, or otherwise have access, to a database  and a computer system . Although the embodiment illustrated in  includes one server  coupled to one client device  via the network , it should be recognized that embodiments of the invention may be implemented using one or more such client devices coupled to one or more such servers.","In an embodiment, each of the client device  and server  may include all or fewer than all of the features associated with the device  illustrated in and discussed with reference to . Client device  includes or is otherwise coupled to a computer screen or display . As is well known in the art, client device  can be used for various purposes including both network- and local-computing processes.","The client device  is linked via the network  to server  so that computer programs, such as, for example, a browser, running on the client device  can cooperate in two-way communication with server . Server  may be coupled to database  to retrieve information therefrom and to store information thereto. Database  may include a plurality of different tables (not shown) that can be used by server  to enable performance of various aspects of embodiments of the invention. Additionally, the server  may be coupled to the computer system  in a manner allowing the server to delegate certain processing functions to the computer system.","In one embodiment, the methods and systems are implemented by a coordinated software and hardware computer system. This system is comprised of a set of dedicated networked servers controlled by TruCast. The servers are installed with a combination of commercially available software, custom configurations, and custom software. A web server is one of those modules, which exposes a web based client de UI to customer web browsers. The UI interacts with the dedicated servers to deliver information to users. The cumulative logical function of these systems results in a system and method referred to as TruCast.","In alternate embodiments, the servers could be placed client side, could be shared or publicly owned, could be located together or separately. The servers could be the aggregation of non-dedicated compute resources from a Peer to Peer (P2P), grid, or other distributed network computing environments. The servers could run different commercial applications, different configurations with the same or similar cumulative logical function. The client to this system could be run directly from the server, could be a client side executable, could reside on a mobile phone or mobile media device, could be a plug-in to other Line of Business applications or management systems. This system could operate in a client-less mode where only Application Programming Interface (API) or eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or Web-Services or other formatted network connections are made directly to the server system. These outside consumers could be installed on the same servers as the custom application components. The custom server-side engine applications could be written in different languages, using different constructs, foundations, architectural methodologies, storage and processing behaviors while retaining the same or similar cumulative logical function. The UI could be built in different languages, using different constructs, foundations, architectural methodologies, storage and processing behaviors while retaining the same or similar cumulative logical function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Collection","In one embodiment, the Collection system gathers the majority of information about all CGM content online. This is a weighted, prioritized goal because TruCast functions in a weighted, prioritized way. This prioritization system is an optionally advantageous element of the collection system, called the Collection Manager. The Collection Manager receives input from internal and external sources about what sites have information of value, weights that information against a set of pre-described and manipulatable co-factors to allow tuning, and prioritizes the execution of collection against those sites.","In order to collect data from a blog site, an automated web scripting and parsing system called, a robot is built. An individual \u201crobot\u201d is a sophisticated, coordinated script which informs a software engine of how to navigate, parse, and return web information. Every web site is comprised of code in one of several popular languages, which software applications called web browsers \u201crender\u201d or convert to a visually appealing \u201cweb site\u201d. A robot, similar to a browser, interprets site code to render an output. The desired output is not the \u201cweb site\u201d that a browser would create, but are XML document, with columns of information about the content stored on a given site. Because robots are accessing the code, and not the rendered page, they have access to markup structures in the code which identify where specific content of interest is stored the code. Robots use navigation based on Document Object Model (DOM) trees, regular expression pattern matching, conditional parsing, pre-coded transformations, mathematical and logical rules, tags, comments, formatting, and probability statistics to extract the specific content TruCast, in one embodiment, uses from raw web site code. Functions which perform this parsing are abstracted and codified in the robot engine, which is instructed on specific actions by a specific robot script. In pseudo-code, a robot designed to gather all of the blog content on a wordpress site would be scripted thusly: Load X URL, read code \u201c<bodytext>\u201d is found, return all text until \u201c<\/bodytext>\u201d is found. If it is found create row , store this text in column A row . Find link with the word \u201cnext\u201d in it, follow this link. Read code until \u201c<bodytext>\u201d is found, return all text until \u201c<\/bodytext>\u201d is found. If it is found create row , store this text in column A row .","This is a clearly incomplete example, as a plurality of robots have the ability to gather and transform a very complete set of knowable information from every website we visit, including the full body text, author's name, date of the post, permalink to the post, title of the post, it's position on the page, how many comments it has, the full information about those comments, including author, date, order, body, any hyperlinks, graphics, scripts, emoticons, or other multimedia files included in a post, comment or site. Robots can be designed to gather data from only an individual site, or made more general to accommodate variation amongst similar sites. Robots parse the gamut non-structured web site code into XML encoded text that meets a predefined data specification of the design. The system, in one embodiment, collects all posts, all comments, and all desired content from every page that a robot visits.","Robots are not limited to these methods for content parsing, hierarchical temporal memory analysis, probability-based, positive heuristics, and structural inference technologies can be used to make robots are capable of collecting information from a wider variety of sites.","Some sites have full-data RSS or Atom feeds (different than the typically truncated feeds), for which a specific set of robots exist. We also have data vendors who deliver full-data feeds in several formats, these feeds are converted to the XML data spec by another class of robots. Robots are not limited to web content collection, but represent a scriptable system for parsing and transforming incoming and outgoing data based on pre-defined rules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0169"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["305","310","315","320","325","330","340","335","345","335","350","355"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0170"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["372","370","362","364","366","368","372","374","370","388","390","372","370","388","390","370","372","376","382","388","390"]},"Ingestion",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0172"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["800","805","810","815","820","825","830"]},"Analysis","In one embodiment.

A keyphrase match is absolute; if a post contains an appropriate keyphrase, there is no question as to if a match exists. The Conceptual Categorization system is built to apply a series of exempla based prediction algorithms to determine the conceptual relevance of a given post independent of exact keyphrase match. This makes the system, in one embodiment, more robust and provides more human-relevant information. In an exemplary embodiment a blog post body includes the following text: \u201cI really enjoy looking out my windows to see the vista out in front of my house. Buena! It is so great! I wish my computer was so nice, it is a little broken edgy eft sadly.\u201d (EX.1)","A topic for the Microsoft Corporation, looking for the words \u201cwindows vista computer\u201d in order to find online discussion about their new operating system would find this post by keyphrase match, despite the fact that the user discusses using \u201cedgy eft\u201d which is a code name for Ubuntu 6.08, a competitor's operating system. A topic for Milgard Windows and Doors Corporation that is looking for discussion about windows in need of repair would find this same post looking for the keyphrase \u201cbroken house windows\u201d despite the fact that clearly the writer is enjoying looking out of his unbroken windows. The Disney Corporation, looking for discussion about their film company \u201cBuena Vista\u201d would find this post, which has nothing to do with them at all. A biologist researcher looking for references to immature red newts would search for \u201cEft\u201d only to be sadly disappointed in another result about Ubuntu's software. In all of these cases keyphrase matches have proven insufficient to successfully match relevant content to interested parties. Boolean modifiers help (vista NOT Buena) but consistently fall far short of expectations, and require non-intuitive and time consuming research and expertise.","Automated Conceptual Categorization",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0180"},"figref":"FIGS. 7-9","b":["350","610","615","620","625","645","645"]},"Automated Sentiment Analysis","When users score content for relevance in the scoring manager, they also may assert the sentiment of the content for each topic that it is relevant, from the perspective of their account. Users will mark, from their perspective (as informed by a set of scoring rules described by user administrators) the sentiment reflected about each topic. This information will be stored for later use in a relational database.","These human markup actions serve two purposes. First is to capture this data for direct use within a response system, and a series of data visualizations that leverage topic and sentiment information to elucidate non-obvious information about the content TruCast collects, in one embodiment. This is the \u201cmanual\u201d path for data to flow thru the system, in one embodiment. The second use for these posts is that they serve as example data for an exemplar driven automated sentiment analysis system that mirrors the conceptual categorization system.","Similar to the process of categorization, the system, in one embodiment, leverages an exemplar set of documents to perform an automated algorithmic comparison in order to determine the sentiment, per topic, contained within an individual post. This requires a larger number of examples than categorization analysis, (\u02dc100 per sentiment value per topic) due to the four different stored sentiment values, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cbad\u201d, \u201cneutral\u201d and \u201cgood\/bad\u201d. Due to the significant complexity of sentiment language within human language, additional processing is performed upon each document to improve the accuracy of the analysis. A lexicon of sentimental terms is stored within the system, and their presence has a weighted impact on the analysis. Negation terms and phrase structures also alter the values associated with sentimental terms. A stop words list eliminates connective terms, object nouns, and other non-sentimental terms within the text, reducing the noise the comparison has to filter thru. Sentence detection uses linguistic analysis to subdivide posts into smaller sections for individual analysis. A series of algorithms are compared for accuracy and performance on a per topic basis, to allow the performance of the analysis system to be tuned to each topic.","Automated Analysis Management","Both of these processes work upon the post-ingestion content, directing automatically analyzed documents into the remainder of the system workflow. This process reacts to the number of exemplar documents that are available. If incoming content is keyphrase-relevant to a specific topic, a determination is made if sufficient exemplar documents have been gathered by the system from users. If enough exemplary documents are not available, that post is delivered to the scoring queue which feeds content to the scoring manager interface. If some documents are present as exemplars, the system will attempt automated categorization and sentiment analysis, but still deliver posts to the scoring manager. This creates a pair of analysis results, one from the computer and one from the user. These are compared, and when a sufficient alignment (agreement frequency) is reached, the system starts delivering auto-analyzed content directly to the reporting and response systems, saving human effort.","This is a sliding ratio from 100% being delivered to the UI and 0% being auto-analyzed to only 1-10% being delivered to the UI and 100% being auto-analyzed. Once the ratio of content being reviewed by human scorers reaches 10%, and accurate performance of the automated analysis is maintained, mature operation of the automated systems has been achieved. This is the most efficient operation of the system, in one embodiment.","The system utilizes an aging and auditing system to ensure that the oldest human scored posts are ejected from the exemplar set and replaced by new human scored posts over time. The system also performs internal cluster analysis and ejects significant outliers from the system. Both of these processes are tunable by administrative control panels. The result of this aging and auditing should be that as the vernacular, word usage, and issues discussed internal to a given topic change over time, exemplar documents continue to reflect that change and accurately map relevance.","Reporting","The system, in one embodiment, of databases which receive topic relevant, analyzed content is connected to a series of web-based visualizations to allow users of the UI to understand valuable information about the discussions captured by the system, in one embodiment. Visualizations are shown in .","Response",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["752","758","754","756","760","764","760","766","772","770","774"]},"The response manager is a system to convert into a manageable, scalable business process the task of responding to CGM content by way of comments. All CGM systems that allow interactivity (>90%) have a web based system for allowing readers of content to respond by way of a comment, note, or other stored message. This often requires that users register themselves on the site, by providing a username, password, and other personal details. Sometimes this requires providing an e-mail address, to which an activation link is sent, or an instant messenger account which is sent a password. This isn't too difficult for casual users to maintain, especially if they only interact with a few sites. Professional users however often have to interact with thousands of different sites. The system, in one embodiment, aims to reduce this workload for responders by automating the registration and response process.","Response Workflow","In one embodiment, the TruCast UI system facilitates a workflow for many users to interact in a coordinated, managed way with CGM content. Once a post as been successfully analyzed by either a user in the scoring manager, or the automated analysis systems it becomes available within the response manager. This is a UI system for a user to write a comment in response to relevant posts. The UI two halves, one which shows information about the post being responded to (author, date, body text, and other comments from within the thread, as well as stats about the author and site responsible for the content), and the second that contains the new response the user is writing. The system provides an interface called the response vault for managers to pre-write message components, fragments of text, names, stats, and pieces of argument that they'd like responders to focus on. These snippets can be copied into the response body during authoring. Once a user is done writing a response, the can click a \u201csend\u201d button which delivers the newly written response to the relational database.","Response Automation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0197"},"figref":"FIGS. 11-13"},"This system utilizes a similar engine and scripting methodology as the collection system. Registration and Response robots are scripted automations, which interpret the code of CGM content pages, web pages, pop3 or web based e-mail systems, and other data structures, and perform re-determined, probabilistic, or rule driven interactions with those structures. By interpreting page code and scripted instructions, they can imitate the actions of human users of these structures, by executing on screen navigation functions, inserting data, gathering data, and reporting success or failure. An example registration robot would be given as a data input the registration information for an individual user of the system, in one embodiment, and given the URL to a site that the user wishes to register on . The robot would visit the site, navigate by markers pre-identified in the page code to the appropriate form locations to insert this information, confirm its insertion, and report success, as well as any output information from the site. An example response robot would accept as input the registration information for a given user of the system, in one embodiment, the blog response they've written, and the URL to the site that the user wishes to respond to. The robot would load the site into memory, navigate the page by way of hyperlinks or pre-determined, probabilistic or rule driven information, examine the page source code to discover the appropriate form fields to insert this input data into, do so, and report success. Other embodiments of this solution could include purpose built scripts that perform the same assignment and scripted interaction with CGM sites to perform registration and response tasks. Smaller scale systems would have users perform the manual field entry and navigation tasks, but captures these interactions for conversation involvement identification and maintenance by the analysis systems.","Once the system, in one embodiment, receives a response record from the response manager, it determines which flog site contains the original message, and the link to the response page for that site and message. If the system, in one embodiment, has never written a response to that site before, the record is delivered to the response interactor UI, which is run by company employees. This UI allows an employee to visit the appropriate site, navigate to the appropriate fields, and assign the information from the record to fields on the site that will cause the site to record a response. This action is recorded, and converted into a script for later re-use. If TruCast has already written a response to a given site, this script will be used eliminating the need for repeated human interaction.","This system utilizes a similar engine and scripting methodology as the collection system. Other embodiments of this solution could include purpose built scripts that perform the same assignment and scripted interaction with CGM sites to perform registration and response tasks. Smaller scale systems would have users perform the manual field entry and navigation tasks, but captures these interactions for conversation involvement identification and maintenance by the analysis systems.","There are several sophisticated systems for preventing automated interaction with registration and response forms on CGM sites. Because TruCast is engine and script driven, and each transaction happens by way of a modular execution system, we can tie the process to outside support modules to defeat these automation prevention systems. The response automation system has a complete pop3 e-mail interaction system which can generate e-mail addresses for use in registration, check those addresses for incoming mail, and navigate the mail content as easily as more typical web content. The response automation system uses advanced OCR processing along with human tuning to defeat CAPTCHA protections. The system has access to jabber protocol interactions to create automated IM accounts and interact by SMS with mobile phone systems. TruCast also stores a significant body of information, in contact card format, about responders so more complex registration questions can be correctly answered.","Conversation","The response system within TruCast delivers posts to blog sites, which are the target for the collection system. As the system, in one embodiment, collects content it matches incoming content to evaluate if that content belongs to a thread that the system has interacted with. When the system discovers posts that were written after a response that TruCast wrote, it is returned to the queue of posts assigned to the user who wrote the response, with a maximum priority. This way a conversation can be facilitated. We also allow review of conversations by way of an Audit Panel, which gives a timeline of interaction for a conversation between a blogger and a TruCast user.","Transparency","Given the volatility of the CGM space, the value it represents, and the danger of negative publicity for any companies or other interested parties who choose to interact by way of responding by comment, it is very important to maintain the appearance of correct attribution. The users are responsible for the content they generate. Because of the sophisticated analysis tools available for CGM site owners to evaluate the source of incoming comments, it's important that the system, in one embodiment correctly portrays correct attribution. While using the TruCast system to automate response delivery to blog sites, correct attribution of content origination is retained.","Indicators of origination include: (1) E-mail address used in registration\/response process; (2) Owner of e-mail address domain's as reported by the WHOIS information; (3) Receipt of e-mail sent to this address by the correct customer to the system, in one embodiment; (4) IP Address used in the response\/registration process; (5) Reverse DNS lookup on the IP Address used in the response\/registration process, and the resultant WHOIS information; and\/or (6) Internal consistency of blog user registration information.","Any given customer or user will direct a domain name that's appropriate for blot post response, connect this domain (and its MX record) to web accessible server. This server should make available the e-mail addresses hosted on it via a pop3 connection. This resolves issues  and  by placing ownership of the domain from which the e-mails for registration are generated into the hands of the users.","A forwarding system between e-mail addresses created by a robot and the e-mail address listed in the User Manager exists. Forwarding messages from this TruCast controlled site to the customer's e-mail ensures that customers receive any messages from bloggers that reply by e-mail. This resolves issue .","The Response Automation tool receives port  from the IP address used for the e-mail server installation, and the server hosts the Response Automation Engine for use in executing the scripting that is created to perform automated response. This resolves issues  and  by aligning the IP source of the comments with the e-mail source of the comments.","The tool collects significantly more information about responders than is typically necessary. This includes obscure information like birth date, favorite car, mother's maiden name, favorite popsicle flavor, user picture, etc, to ensure that registrations are complete, feature rich, and transparent. The manual response app and robots accept this data in the response and registration steps. This resolves issue .","By way of this unified approach to transparency, attribution accuracy should always be retained.","If customers or other users desire misattribution of message source, IP and e-mail anonymization features can be enabled. This obfuscates the source of output messages by way of a rotating IP proxy environment which leverages P2P and onion topologies for maximum opacity.","Administration","It is valuable to keep blog-focused workers on message, saying appropriate things, making persuasive arguments, and being considerate participants in the community. In order to facilitate this, the system, in one embodiment, has a set of authorization features. Administrators have access to a per-user toggle which forces the posts that users write to be delivered to a review queue instead of the response automation system when they press the \u201csend\u201d button. This queue is accessible by administrators to allow review, editing, or rejection before messages are submitted.","Administrators can also create and manipulate sorting rules which prioritize content within user scoring and response queues based on topic, site, engine, author, and date information. This forces users to work on appropriate content, and allows administrators to segment scoring and responding tasks to SME's who have the most context for a given topic, site, engine or author.","Accounts","Users in the system, in one embodiment, are members of accounts, and afforded permissions within the system based on the role assigned to them by administrative users on a per account basis. Roles are pre-bound permission sets. Administrators can create, edit, and delete everything within the system, except accounts. Group administrators, who have access to multiple accounts, can create accounts, and can edit and delete accounts that they've created or been given access to. System administrators can add, edit, and delete all accounts, so this permission role is reserved for internal support use only. Users within the system, in one embodiment, are intended to perform the majority of the scoring and responding work, and as such have only access to the scoring manager, response manager, and their own user manager to review their own performance. Group users can do these tasks for multiple assigned accounts. Viewers within the system, in one embodiment, have read only access to all UI controls. Group Viewers can review multiple accounts. Accounts as a whole can be enabled or disabled, which blocks users from accessing the system if their account is disabled, and stops any account specific collection, analysis or processing tasks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0218"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1300","1300","1305","1310","1315","1320","1325","1330","1335","1340","1305","1310","1315","1320","1325","1330","1335","1340","1345"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0175","num":"0219"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"],"b":["1105","1305","1305"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0220"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1310","1310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0221"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 19"],"b":["1315","1315","1315"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0222"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 21"],"b":["1320","1320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0179","num":"0223"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["1325","2005","2010","2015"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0224"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2110","1325","2110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0181","num":"0225"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["1330","1325","1330","2210"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0182","num":"0226"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":"2300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0227"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":"1335"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0184","num":"0228"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":"2500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0229"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0186","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0231"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0232"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0233"},"figref":"FIGS. 31-32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0190","num":"0234"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0191","num":"0235"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0192","num":"0236"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0237"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0194","num":"0238"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 39"],"b":["3900","3900","3905","3910","915","3905","3915","3910","3920"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0195","num":"0239"},"figref":["FIG. 40","FIG. 40"],"b":["3900","3905","3915","3910","4000","4010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0196","num":"0240"},"figref":["FIG. 41","FIG. 41"],"b":["3900","3905","3915","3910","4100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0197","num":"0241"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 42"],"b":["3900","3905","3915","3910","4200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0198","num":"0242"},"figref":["FIG. 43","FIG. 43"],"b":["3900","3905","3915","3910","4300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0243"},"figref":["FIG. 44","FIG. 44"],"b":["3900","3905","3915","3910","4400","4400","4410"]},"Referring to , selection of the \u201cemail\u201d option from the actions menu  causes an email application associated with the computing device by which the interface  is generated to invoke an email message window .
