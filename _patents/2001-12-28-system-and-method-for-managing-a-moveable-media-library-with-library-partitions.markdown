{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is related to commonly assigned U.S. Patent entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTERMEDIATING COMMUNICATION WITH A MOVEABLE MEDIA LIBRARY UTILIZING A PLURALITY OF PARTITIONS,\u201d filed Dec. 28, 2201 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,431, which is incorporated herein by reference","The present invention is in general related to mass data storage and more specifically to managing a moveable media library with library partitions.","Digital magnetic tape is commonly used for long-term data storage in computer systems. The low cost-per-bit stored, long-term retention capability, and portability of magnetic tape cartridges have made magnetic tape the medium of choice for storing the large quantities of data generated by businesses such as insurance companies, banking organizations, airlines, and the like.","Tape cartridges are frequently utilized by automated tape library peripherals. Tape libraries generally handle numerous tape cartridges to store very large amounts of data. The tape libraries hold the tape cartridges in predefined positions or media slots. When content is required from a particular tape cartridge, a host system communicatively coupled to the tape library communicates with a robotics subsystem controller of the tape library. The host system may be communicatively coupled to the tape library by a number of mechanisms. For example, the host system may be communicatively coupled to the tape library via a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) bus or a Fibre Channel fabric. The host system may communicate a command to the robotics subsystem controller to retrieve the particular tape cartridge from the respective position or media slot. In response, the robotics subsystem controller may execute various mechanical operations by robotic mechanics to retrieve the desired tape cartridge and place the desired tape cartridge into a tape drive. The host system may typically communicate with the tape drive utilizing a communication path independent of the communication path to the robotics subsystem controller. The host system may then read from or write to the tape cartridge via the tape drive.","Additionally, other communication may occur between the host system and the robotics subsystem controller. For example, the host system may query the robotics subsystem controller to determine the number of tape cartridges, tape drives, and robotics mechanisms contained in the tape library associated with the robotics subsystem. By querying the robotics subsystem controller in this manner, the host system may manage the tape library.","Although tape libraries are useful for providing a significant amount of long-term data storage capacity, tape libraries possess several disadvantages. For example, the data storage capacity may be allocated for use by several entities. Accordingly, all of the data storage capacity may be accessible by each host system or entity communicatively coupled to the tape library. To address this problem, partitioning has been utilized. Partitioning involves assigning specific tape library resources (e.g., various slots, tape drives, robotic mechanics) to discrete virtual devices. Access to the virtual devices is then restricted as desired for particular applications.","Different approaches may be utilized to partition a tape library. First, host system restrictions have been utilized to restrict access to portions of a tape library for partitioning applications. Such host restrictions are implemented by a mediating software process on a host system to enforce partition restrictions. However, this approach is problematic. Specifically, the approach is undesirable if the tape library is utilized in a storage service provider environment. In storage service provider environments, the tape library and the host systems belong to different entities (e.g., the storage service provider and the customers). Placement of software mediating processes on host systems is unattractive, because it increases the burden on the customers to make use of the storage service. Also, corporate environments impose relatively long qualification cycles for new host system software. Moreover, many customers are unwilling to allow other parties to place software on their host systems. Additionally, the software mediating process approach is typically incompatible with existing data back-up utilities, i.e., the software mediating process approach requires the use of specialized data back-up applications.","A second approach, used by Spectra Logic, provides multiple bridge devices to partition tape libraries into multiple virtual devices. Each bridge device includes a Quad Interface Processor (QIP) to implement partitioning. The QIPs are processor-based card devices that serve as the sole interface between a host system and a library. By configuring each of the QIPs via a software interface, the QIPs are capable of emulating several virtual libraries that appear to be multiple physical libraries to a host system or host systems. Each QIP typically includes two Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) buses and up to two tape drives may be coupled to each SCSI bus.","Although this architecture does provide a mechanism to implement partitioning in a manner that is somewhat transparent to host systems this architecture is problematic. Specifically, it is costly and hardware-intensive in that it requires multiple processor-based cards. Second, the use of multiple hardware bridges introduces multiple points of failure, thereby increasing the probability of that data may become inaccessible. Moreover, this hardware approach rigidly controls the addition of further resources to a given partition. There is a specific structural relationship between the bridging hardware and the addition of further resources to a partition. Accordingly, the hardware approach is not amenable to the creation of multiple smaller partitions or applicable to partitioning smaller tape libraries.","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a system for managing a moveable media library. The system may comprise at least one robotic mechanics and a controller. The controller may comprise a processor for executing instructions and non-volatile memory for storing at least: code for controlling the at least one robotic mechanics; and code for responding to commands received from host systems to retrieve a moveable medium of a plurality of moveable media, the code for responding is operable to receive the commands addressed with multiple device identifiers according to a device access protocol, and the code for responding is operable to associate each device identifier of the multiple device identifiers with at least one respective library partition.","The present invention is related to a system and method for partitioning the system resources of a moveable media library such as a tape library. In embodiments of the present invention, a system resource table is utilized which maps certain system resources (moveable media, tape drives, robotic mechanics, and\/or the like) to partitions. A robotics controller is utilized to implement the partitioning as will be discussed in greater detail with respect to . The robotics controller may enforce the partitioning scheme by limiting access to a defined subset of library resources on a per host system basis. For example, the robotics controller may control the tape drives to cause the tape drives to only communicate with a selected host system or host systems.","Additionally, the robotics controller provides multiple instances of itself to a host system or host systems, i.e., the robotics controller appears to be multiple virtual devices to the host system or host systems. To provide multiple instances of itself, the robotics controller may utilize multiple physical interfaces and\/or multiple logical interfaces. For example, a Fibre Channel switch may be utilized to route commands addressed with a plurality of Fibre Channel World Wide Names (WWNs) to the robotics controller as will be discussed with respect to . Even though the robotics controller is only a single device, the robotics controller may appear to be multiple devices by responding to commands addressed with the plurality of WWNs. The robotics controller may provide multiple logical versions of itself utilizing, for example, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) logical units (LUNs) as will be discussed with respect to . Accordingly, the robotics controller may execute code for responding to commands received from a host system or host systems addressed with the multiple communication medium addresses or identifiers. In the event that multiple requests are made of a same physical hardware element (e.g., a robotic mechanics), the multiple requests may be queued using a first in, first executed basis. Also, each communication medium address or identifier may be associated with at least one partition or virtual device.","Moreover, the robotics controller may execute code responsive to received commands to generate a response that utilizes a particular communication medium address or identifier depending on the host system that generated the received command. The robotics controller may determine the particular host system that generated the received command by the originating address or port. The code responsive to received commands may access a table to obtain the communication medium address or identifier that corresponds to a respective host system.","By partitioning resources in this manner, allocation of the storage capacity of a moveable media library may be achieved without appreciable difficulty. The storage capacity of a moveable media library may be shared among independent organizations. Access to another organization's data is preferably prevented by the partitioning scheme. Moreover, no modifications are required to be made to a host system or host systems according to preferred embodiments. A library administrator need only configure the moveable media library by assigning specific resources to respective partitions. Additionally, partitioning via the robotics controller does not require multiple costly bridge devices or rigidly restrict the scalability of partitions. Moreover, it shall be appreciated that such an allocation of library resources among various partitions is quite advantageous for storage area network, directly attached storage, directly attached shared storage, and network attached shared storage environments.","To demonstrate a particular environment in which embodiments of the present invention may be utilized, reference is now made to .  depicts exemplary system  that comprises exemplary tape library . System  comprises host systems - through - which facilitate access to data storage on storage area network (SAN) . Storage area network  comprises SAN fabric , storage devices - and -, and tape library . Storage devices - and - may be any type of suitable storage device including disk arrays, JBODs (Just a bunch of disks), optical media players, and\/or the like. In exemplary system , host systems - through - may dynamically store and retrieve information from storage devices - and -. Host systems - through - may execute back-up utility applications to back-up data stored on storage devices - and - on tape library . Alternatively, storage devices - and - may execute back-up operations without intervention by host systems - through -.","SAN fabric  provides a communication fabric to facilitate communication among storage devices - and -, tape library , and host systems - through -. SAN fabric  is typically implemented utilizing a Fibre Channel architecture. Fibre Channel is typically utilized due to the simplicity of its communication path, i.e., Fibre Channel utilizes a serial communication scheme. Additionally, Fibre Channel provides data communication at relatively high rates (e.g., 1064 Mbps) over either copper and\/or optical fiber cables. Copper cables are generally utilized when various storage devices  are separated from host systems - through - by intra-cabinet connections. Optical cables may support separation distances up to 500 meters from a device to a hub (a Fibre Channel interconnection unit within SAN fabric ) and up to 10 kilometers between hubs. Fibre Channel further utilizes various communication topologies such as point-to-point, arbitrated loop, and star topologies. Fibre Channel also encapsulates or supports various communication protocols such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and Internet Protocol (IP) protocols. Devices that do not support Fibre Channel can be coupled to a Fibre Channel fabric via a bridge device. Specifically, numerous commercially-available bridge devices (such as Hewlett-Packard Company SURESTORE SCSI BRIDGE FC 4\/1) allow a SCSI device to be deployed on a SAN that employs a Fibre Channel fabric. Although Fibre Channel is typically utilized for SAN fabric , other communication mechanisms may be utilized. For example, it is frequently appropriate to perform remote mirroring operations to redundantly store mission-critical data at remote locations. For such operations, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network elements or leased-lines (T-1, OC-12, and\/or the like) may be employed.","Clients - through -M may communicate with host systems - through - via communication network . Communication network  may comprise any number of communication media, such as ATM, wireless, and\/or leased-line links. By communicating with host systems - through -, clients - through -M may obtain data stored on the storage area network . For example, clients - through -M may possess operating systems which are configured to access network drives through host systems - through -. The network drives implemented by host systems - through - may manage various files on storage devices - and - and tape library .","Host systems - through - may discover the presence of tape library  in storage area network  by querying robotics controller . Peripheral or device discovery is typically performed by sending a query message to each possible device address within a device address range. For example, in the SCSI protocol, a query command may be issued to a peripheral by addressing the command to a SCSI identifier (e.g., a bus address and\/or a logical unit). The peripheral associated with the SCSI identifier will respond by communicating pertinent identification information such as LUN path information, vendor identification, product identification, serial number and product revision pursuant to the SCSI protocol. It shall be appreciated that host systems - through - may discover tape drives - through - independently of robotics controller . However, robotics controller  may advantageously direct tape drives - through - to associate with a virtual library or partition in response to discovery protocols. For example, robotics controller  may control tape drives - through - to cause tapes drives - through - to only communicate with selected ones of host systems - through -.","After host systems - through - determine that robotics controller  is a device that controls tape operations for tape library  by examining the vendor identification and product identification information, host systems - through - may communicate additional query commands. Host systems - through - may query robotics controller  to determine the number of tape cartridges - through -N, tape drives - through -, robotic mechanics - and -, and\/or the like in tape library . By receiving the device information through device discovery and subsequent queries, host systems - through - may control tape library  via communication with robotics controller .","Host systems - through - may issue appropriate commands to robotics controller  to obtain a particular tape cartridge  from a media element (e.g., a tape slot or tape drive). In response, robotics controller  may retrieve the particular tape cartridge  by utilizing one of robotic mechanics - and -. The particular robotic mechanics  may be physically translated to the tape element of the particular tape cartridge . The robotic mechanics  may grasp the particular tape cartridge . The robotic mechanics  may then place the particular tape cartridge  in one of tape drives - through -.","Interface device  allows tape drives - through - and robotics controller  to be communicatively coupled to SAN fabric . Device interface  may be, for example, a Fibre Channel device to allow SCSI devices to be connected to SAN fabric . Device interface  may be implemented to route multiple Fibre Channel WWNs to robotics controller  to allow robotics controller  to present multiple instances of itself. If implemented as a Fibre Channel device, device interface  may allow each of tape drives - through - and robotics controller  to be connected in parallel to SAN fabric , i.e., the devices may not be required to share the same SCSI bus. Host systems - through - may execute a data transfer to or from the particular tape cartridge  by utilizing a communication path associated with SAN fabric . Although tape library  is depicted as having tape drives - through - directly coupled to device interface , the present invention is not so limited. For example, the data transfers may occur by communicating data through robotics controller  before routing data to tape drives - through -.","The type of configuration depicted in  is referred to as a storage area network for several reasons. First, the data transfers or communication related to data storage is preferably isolated from communication between host systems - through - and clients - through -M. Secondly, there is preferably no single point of failure within storage area network . SAN fabric  preferably provides redundant connections via hubs, switches, routers, and\/or the like. Additionally, multiple host systems (e.g., - through -) are preferably utilized.","The configuration utilized by storage area networks is quite advantageous. First, the storage is placed behind host systems - through -. Data transfers, for example, between tape library  and host systems - through - do not occur over the same communication network as data transfers between host systems - and clients - through -M. By placing the data transfers associated with stored data behind host systems - through -, overall system performance can be significantly enhanced. Moreover, the configuration of storage area network  is robust in that the probability of failure is greatly minimized, because there is no single point of failure. Additionally, numerous additional data storage devices  or tape libraries  may be added to system  without appreciable difficulty by coupling respective devices to SAN fabric . Accordingly, storage area network  is advantageously scalable. It shall be appreciated that storage area network  may be located at any location, i.e., it is not required to be located on the premises of an organization that utilizes its storage capacity. Additionally, storage area network  may be advantageously managed by a separate entity from the organizations that utilize its storage capacity.","It shall be appreciated that the advantages of storage area network  cause the cost per bit of storage capacity to be significantly reduced as compared to other storage schemes. However, the vast amount of storage capacity made available by storage area network  can exceed the storage requirements of many organizations. Accordingly, multiple organizations may share the storage capacity of storage area network  by utilizing data warehousing. By using data warehousing, each organization is capable of reaping the benefit of the reduced cost of data storage.","However, data warehousing presents several unique challenges. First, it is important to ensure that an organization does not access data that belongs to another organization. For example, certain tapes  of tape library  may be belong to a specific organization to store back-ups of its mission-critical data. In a data warehousing scheme, other organizations should not be able to issue a command to robotics controller  to retrieve these tapes, so as to prevent access or damage to the mission-critical data.","According to embodiments of the present invention, robotics controller  is adapted to facilitate data warehousing in a manner that provides data integrity. In a first mode, robotics controller  acts in the same manner as an ordinary robotics controller . In the first mode, robotics controller  will respond to any of host systems - through - according to appropriate commands. However, in a second mode, robotics controller  may be configured by a system administrator to act as two or more different virtual devices. In this second mode, host systems - through - detect multiple device instances associated with tape library . Each device instance is assigned a subset or portion of the system resources of tape library , i.e., tape library resources are partitioned among the various device instances. Moreover, each host system of host systems - through - may only access the device instances according to various permissions. Specifically, the device instances may be addressed on a per-host basis to protect the integrity of the stored data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["105","105","201","201","105","203","104","1","104","2","105","106","106","105","109","1","109","4"]},"Robotics controller  may also comprise firmware . Firmware  may be implemented utilizing non-volatile memory elements including, but not limited to, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, and the like. Firmware  may retain executable instructions that define the operations of robotics controller  according to embodiments of the present invention. As previously noted, various communication protocols provide a mechanism to enable detection or discovery of devices coupled to a communication medium or network. The communication protocols may cause a device to return a predetermined message in response to a query message or packet. Pursuant to suitable device access protocols (e.g., SCSI, Fibre Channel, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), or the like), executable instructions may include code to identify robotics controller  to allow host systems - through - to issue appropriate drive commands. In the event that multiple drive commands are received that relate to a same physical hardware element (e.g., a robotic mechanics), the multiple commands may be queued using a first in, first executed basis. To accommodate queueing of data or commands, a relatively large buffer (not shown) may be utilized.","Additionally, executable instructions may include code that is responsive to issue such identification information pursuant to multiple device addresses or identifiers. Executable instructions may include code for accessing instance mapping table . Instance mapping table may associate communication medium addresses or identifiers with virtual devices. Moreover, executable instructions may include code for responding to query commands received from host systems - through - according to the communication medium addresses or identifiers. For example and without limitation, the code may issue the identification information for three different Fibre Channel addresses to define three virtual devices. By responding to device identification queries addressed to multiple device addresses or identifiers, robotics controller  provides multiple instances of itself to host systems - through -. The multiple instances of robotics controller  are utilized to implement the virtual devices in a manner that is transparent to host systems - through -.","Moreover, the multiple connections or interfaces may be associated with respective virtual devices. For example and without limitation, device interface  may include a Fibre Channel switch. Alternatively, device interface  may be coupled to a Fibre Channel switch of SAN fabric . By utilizing a Fibre Channel switch, communication data routed to multiple Fibre Channel addresses may be routed to robotics controller . Robotics controller  may be configured to associate the multiple addresses with respective virtual devices or partitions. By associating Fibre Channel addresses with virtual devices, robotics controller  may cause each virtual device to appear as a distinct physical device attached to SAN fabric . Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may cause the partitioning to be transparent to host systems - through -. It shall be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to utilizing Fibre Channel switches. Multiple interfaces may be associated with virtual devices in accordance with other communication mechanisms. For example, embodiments of the present invention may associate SCSI logical units (LUNs) with each partition if desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["105","109","1","109","4","105","109","1","109","4","105","109","1","109","4","105"]},"Returning to , firmware  may include resource mapping table to enforce the partitioning scheme. Resource mapping table may be utilized to assign resources (e.g., robotic mechanics - and -, tape drives - through -, and\/or tape cartridges - through -N) of tape library  to particular virtual devices. For example, robotic mechanics - may be assigned to virtual_device1 by the mechanics1 record of resource mapping table . Likewise, tape drive - may be assigned to virtual_device1 by tapeunit1 record of resource mapping table . Although resource mapping table has been described as being stored in firmware , the present invention is not so limited. Resource mapping table may be stored in non-volatile memory at any location that is accessible to robotics controller . Resource mapping table may be configured utilizing a number of techniques. For example, resource mapping table may be configured via input from a manual interface or a software interface located at a remote system by a library administrator.","It shall be appreciated that certain library resources may be assigned to one or more partitions or virtual devices. For example, robotic mechanics - and - may be shared by virtual devices. Multiple requests to a shared library resource may be queued using a first in, first executed basis.","The code for partitioning may access resource mapping table , when one of host systems - through - attempts to determine the system resources associated with a virtual device. For example, host system - may attempt to determine the resources are associated with virtual_device1 of tape library  by issuing an appropriate command that is addressed with a particular SCSI identifier, Fibre Channel address, SNMP identifier, or the like of virtual_device1. Robotics controller , by executing the code for partitioning, may examine whether host system - is permitted to access virtual_device1. The determination whether access is permitted to occur may be implemented by ordinary device and\/or file permissions that are well known in the art. The determination may also be made by using LUN masking as is known in the art. If host system - is permitted access, robotics controller  may examine resource mapping table . Robotics controller  may construct a response message identifying robotic mechanics -, tape drives - and -, and tape cartridges - through -, for example, as belonging to virtual_device1.","After obtaining information regarding the resources of virtual_device1, host system - may access data stored on tape cartridges - through -. Host system - may issue a command to robotics controller  to retrieve tape cartridge - and to place the tape cartridge in tape drive -. After tape cartridge - is placed in tape drive -, host system - may issue appropriate commands to tape drive - to initiate data transfers associated with files stored on tape cartridge -.","In a similar manner, code for partitioning may access resource mapping table when one of host systems - through - attempts to determine the resources associated with a different virtual device. However, the tape cartridges associated with, for example, virtual_device2 may be tape cartridges -{N minus 20} to tape cartridge -N. Typically, tape media such as tape cartridges - through -N are bar-coded or identified by a chip with in the cartridge which is read by a \u201cwand\u201d unit to identify the tape media. A suitable wand unit may be disposed on the media picker element of robotic mechanics - and -. The code for partitioning may perform a renumbering in a response message to a resource identification query. In this case, the code for partitioning may return a message identifying virtual cartridge identifiers 1 through 20. Robotics controller  would then map virtual cartridge identifiers 1 through 20 to tape cartridges -{N minus 20} to tape cartridge -N when responding to commands to retrieve various cartridges from their respective slots of virtual_device2. By performing such renumbering, the virtual devices may be transparent, i.e., the virtual devices may appear to be completely separate devices. Of course, any other resource of a virtual device may be renumbered in a similar manner.","It shall be appreciated that the code for partitioning prevents host systems - through - from accessing system resources that are not assigned to virtual devices that host systems - through - are allowed to access. Specifically, if one of host systems - through - attempts to determine the system resources associated with a virtual device that it does not possess authorization to access, robotics controller  will not respond or may response negatively (i.e., a \u201cno such device\u201d message). Additionally, robotics controller  may enforce the partitioning by instructing tape drives - through - to only communicate with a selected one or ones of host systems - through -. Accordingly, a host system will not be capable of issuing commands to access library resources that belonging to a virtual device of another host system.","It shall be appreciated that all resources of tape library  (e.g., tape cartridges - through -N, tape drives - through -, robotic mechanics - and -, and the like) need not be assigned at any particular point in time. Specifically, it may be advantageous to provide a greater number of resources than necessary at a particular time. When an organization outgrows the data storage capacity of its originally configured virtual device, the virtual device may be reconfigured to include some of the unassigned resources. For example, resource mapping table may be modified by assigning additional tape cartridges of tape cartridges - through -N to virtual_device1 to increase the storage capacity of virtual_device1. By configuring tape library , the data storage capability of each virtual device may be scaled without appreciable difficulty.","By utilizing tape library  in storage area network  and operating robotics controller  to partition the library resources, allocation of storage capacity may be achieved in an efficient manner. Specifically, the cost of acquiring a tape library may be shared by allocating system resources on a per host basis. Accordingly, the reduced cost per bit of data storage capacity associated with a large tape library may benefit entities that only require a moderate amount of storage capacity. Additionally, the environment of system  is advantageous if host systems - through - are owned by different entities. In particular, robotics controller  may implement the desired partitioning of resources in a manner that is transparent to each of host systems - through -. Host systems - through - are not required to possess any specialized software to access their respective virtual devices or partitions. Moreover, host systems - through - are not permitted to access the resources that do not belong to them.","Although  have been described with respect to operation in a storage area network, it shall be appreciated that the present invention is not so limited. Moveable media libraries according to embodiments of the present invention may be utilized in directly attached storage, directly attached shared storage, and network attached shared storage environments as examples. Moveable media libraries may also be utilized for corporate intranets where various partitions are assigned to respective corporate departments. In fact, embodiments of the present invention may be utilized in any mass storage environment that may utilize partitioning to allocate library resources to a host system or host systems.","Additionally, it shall be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to associating exactly one partition with one physical interface or virtual device. The partitioning may also provide the ability to allow more logical partitions than physical devices, i.e., one interface may support multiple partitions. In this instance, the back-up application scheduling by host systems may advantageously implement a policy that decreases conflicts in virtual device access.","Although preferred embodiments of the present invention partition tape libraries, the present invention is not so limited. Partitioning according to the present invention may be utilized by any library peripheral that comprises moveable media. For example, partitioning according to the present invention may be employed by CD-ROM or DVD library peripherals.","Embodiments of the present invention possess several advantages. Embodiments allow either large or small libraries to be partitioned to allocate storage capacity to a number of entities. Embodiments of the present invention are easily scalable, because any number of discrete library resources may be allocated to any particular partition as desired. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention provide partitioning in a manner that is transparent to host systems. Host systems do not require additional software or other modifications to store data on library partitions according to embodiments of the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention further provide greater reliability and reduced costs, because separate hardware processing cards are not required to interface with various partitioned devices."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
