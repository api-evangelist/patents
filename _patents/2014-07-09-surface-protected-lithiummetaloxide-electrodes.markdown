No. 12\/694,422, filed on Jan. 27, 2010, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/148,266, filed on Jan. 29, 2009, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38 between the United States Government and The University of Chicago and\/or pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 between the United States Government and UChicago Argonne, LLC representing Argonne National Laboratory.","This invention relates to non-aqueous lithium cells and batteries. Such cells and batteries are used widely to power numerous devices, for example, portable electronic appliances and medical-, transportation-, aerospace- and defense systems.","This invention relates to positive electrodes (cathodes) for lithium cells and batteries. More specifically, the invention relates to lithium-metal-oxide electrodes, notably those having layered-type or spinel-type structures, or combinations thereof, which are composed of surface protected lithium-metal-oxide particles. The invention extends to electrodes in which the oxygen ions of the closed-packed spinel and layered structures are partially replaced by other anionic species, such as fluoride ions. A particular embodiment of this invention is that the surface of the lithium-metal-oxide electrode particles are protected by one or more lithium-metal-polyanionic materials, for example, a lithium-metal-phosphate, a lithium-metal-silicate or the like, such as a lithium-nickel phosphate or a lithium-nickel-silicate, that can act as a lithium-ion conductor at or above the operating potential of the lithium-metal-oxide positive electrode, thereby protecting the surface of the electrode from undesirable effects, such as electrolyte oxidation, oxygen loss or dissolution. Such surface protection significantly enhances the surface stability, rate capability and cycling stability of high capacity lithium-metal-oxide electrodes for lithium-ion cells and batteries, particularly when charged to high potentials.","As used herein, the term \u201clithium-metal-oxide\u201d and grammatical variations thereof, refers to lithium metal oxide compounds, which can optionally include lithium metal oxides in which some oxygen ions have been replaced by other anionic species, such as fluoride ions. The term \u201clithium-metal-polyanionic material\u201d and grammatical variations thereof, refers to materials having a general formula that comprises at least one lithium cation, at least one other metal cation (e.g., a Ni or Co cation), and at least one polyanion (e.g., phosphate, silicate, tungstate, molybdate, etc.).","Conventional lithium-ion battery cathodes, such as layered LiCoO, spinel LiMnO, olivine LiFePOand compositional variations thereof, do not deliver sufficient electrochemical capacity and power to satisfy the driving range requirements for plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) and all-electric vehicles. Moreover, there is a growing demand to increase the energy and power of lithium-ion batteries for other wide-ranging applications, such as portable electronic devices, medical devices, aerospace and defense applications and for stand-alone energy storage. Conventional electrode materials such as LiCoO, LiMnOand LiFePOtypically deliver capacities of 100-160 mAh\/g between 4.2 and 3.0 V at moderate to high rates. Layered LiMOcompounds, in which M is selected typically from electroactive metal cations, such as Mn, Co, Ni, and additional stabilizing cations such as Li and Al, provide the best opportunity to increase the electrode capacity and hence the energy of lithium-ion cells and batteries, because they offer a maximum capacity of up to approximately 280 mAh\/g at potentials greater than 3.0 V vs. metallic lithium. However, the highly oxidizing character and instability of lithium-metal-oxide electrodes, in particular, at low lithium loadings, as well as solubility effects, has limited the extent to which this high capacity can be realized, particularly at high rates.","Several efforts have already been made in the past to overcome the stability and solubility problems associated with lithium-metal-oxide electrodes. For example, considerable success has been achieved by stabilizing electrodes by pre-treating the electrode powders with oxide additives such as AlOor ZrOobtained from metal alkoxide precursors such as solutions containing aluminum ethylhexanoate diisopropoxide (Al(OOCH)(OCH)or zirconium ethylhexanoate isopropoxide (Zr[(OOCH)(OCHH)]) as described, for example, by J. Cho et al. in Chemistry of Materials, Volume 12, page 3788 (2000) and J. Cho et al. in Electrochemical and Solid State Letters, Volume 4 No. 10, page A159 (2001), respectively, or a zirconium oxide, polymeric precursor or zirconium oxynitrate (ZrO(NO).xHO) as described by Z. Chen et al. in Electrochemical and Solid State Letters, Volume 5, No. 10, page A213 (2002), prior to the fabrication of the final electrode thereby making the surface of the LiCoOparticles more resistant to electrolyte attack, cobalt dissolution or oxygen loss effects. Colloidal particles have also been used to protect lithium-metal-oxide electrode surfaces, as described by Oesten et al. in US Patent Application 2001\/0046628, and by Kim et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Volume 151, page A1755 (2004). More recently, Manthiram et al. in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society, Volume 155, page A635 (2008) and Sun et al. in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society, Volume 154, page A168 (2007), and have shown that AlPOand AlFcoatings, respectively, improve the electrochemical cycling stability of lithium-metal oxide electrodes. Despite the success of improving the performance of lithium-ion cells by coating individual electrode particles with colloidal AlOor ZrOparticles or with AlPO, the coatings themselves either generally impede lithium diffusion in and out of the layered electrode structure during electrochemical discharge and charge, lowering the rate capability of the cells. On the other hand, although AlFcoatings reported by Sun et al., as referenced above, were shown by impedance spectroscopy to increase the rate capability of Li[NiCoMn]Oelectrodes, when charged to 4.6 V, the capacity delivered by the electrodes was only about 160 mAh\/g when discharged at a C\/1 rate.","The loss of oxygen from lithium metal oxide electrodes, such as layered LiCoOand LiNiCoOelectrodes can contribute to exothermic reactions with the electrolyte and with the lithiated carbon negative electrode, and subsequently to thermal runaway if the temperature of the cell reaches a critical value. Further improvements in the composition and structure of the surfaces of lithium-metal oxide electrodes are therefore still required to protect the intrinsic capacity of the electrode from decay and to improve the overall performance and safety of lithium-ion cells without compromising the rate capability of the electrode.","Lithium metal oxides with a spinel-type structure are particularly attractive lithium-ion battery electrodes for high-power applications. Of particular significance is the lithium-manganese-oxide spinel, LiMnO, and its cation-substituted derivatives, LiMnMO, in which M is one or more metal ions typically a monovalent or a multivalent cation such as Li, Mg and Al, as reported by Gummow et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,877 and in Solid State Ionics, Volume 69, page 59 (1994). It is well known that LiMnOand metal-substituted LiMnMOspinel electrodes are chemically unstable in a lithium-ion cell environment, particularly at high potentials and\/or when the cell operating temperature is raised above room temperature, when manganese ions from the spinel electrodes tend to dissolve in the electrolyte. This process is believed to contribute to the capacity loss of the cells at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the removal of all the lithium from LiMnMOspinel electrodes, notably LiMnO(x=0), yields a MnMO(MnO, x=0) component, which itself is a strong oxidizing agent. The surface of such delithiated spinel electrodes can have a high oxygen activity, thereby possibly inducing unwanted oxidation reactions with the electrolyte. Although considerable progress has been made to suppress the solubility and high-temperature performance of spinel electrodes and to improve their stability by cation doping, as described for example by Gummow et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,877, or by forming oxyfluoride compounds as described by Amatucci et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Volume 149, page K31 (2002) and by Choi et al. in Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, Volume 9, page A245-A248 (2006), or by surface coatings as described by Kim et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Volume 151, page A1755 (2004), these treatments have not yet entirely overcome the cycling instability of cells containing manganese-based spinel electrodes.","Considerable progress has been made over recent years to stabilize cubic-close-packed layered lithium-metal-oxide electrode systems by using lithium- and manganese-rich composite electrode structures, xLiMnO.(1\u2212x)LiMOin which M is, for example, Mn, Ni, and\/or Co, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,677,082 and 6,680,143, and by Kim et al. in Chemistry of Materials, Volume 16, page 1996 (2004), and by Thackeray et al. in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, Volume 17, page 3112 (2007). These electrodes can deliver essentially all their theoretical capacity (240-250 mAh\/g) at relatively low rate, for example C\/24, as reported by Johnson et al. in Electrochemistry Communications, Volume 6, page 1085 (2004). Composite electrode structures containing cubic-close-packed layered- and spinel components, such as xLiMnO.(1\u2212x)LiMnMOin which M is a metal cation selected preferably from Li, Ni, Co, Al and Mg have also been disclosed, as described for example, by Johnson et al. in Electrochemistry Communications, Volume 7, page 528 (2005), and by Thackeray et al. in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, Volume 15, page 2257 (2005). These composite electrodes form because of the structural compatibility of the cubic-close-packed oxygen arrays of the individual lithium-metal-oxide components. The integrated structures are highly complex and are often characterized by complicated cation arrangements with short range order.","When the manganese- and nickel ions are nearest neighbors in layered and spinel electrode structures and in the composite electrode structures described above, they tend to adopt tetravalent and divalent oxidation states, respectively. The lithium and transition metal ions are distributed in highly complex arrangements; the Li and Mn ions are arranged in small localized regions to give the structure LiMnO-like character. Composite layered materials can be represented either in two-component notation, xLiMnO.(1\u2212x)LiMO, in which the close-packed LiMnOand LiMOcomponents are structurally integrated or, alternatively, when normalized in standard layered (rock salt) notation, as LiMnMO. The LiMnOcomponent that supplies surplus lithium to the layered structure plays a critical role in stabilizing the electrode structure at low lithium loadings; on lithium extraction, lithium ions in the transition metal layers diffuse into the lithium depleted layers to provide sufficient binding energy to maintain the integrity of the close-packed oxygen array.","Electrochemical extraction of lithium from xLiMnO.(1\u2212x)LiMOduring the initial charge occurs in two steps. When taken to completion above 4.6 V vs. Li, the ideal reactions can be represented:\n\nLiMO\u2192MO+Li\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nLiMnO\u2192MnO+2Li+\u00bdO+2\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Despite the removal of lithium and oxygen from the LiMnOcomponent, the layered character of the residual MnOcomponent remains remarkably intact. The highly oxidizing nature of both the MOand MnOcomponents, however, can result in oxygen loss at the particle surface, particularly when M=Co and\/or Ni, thereby damaging the electrode surface; electrolyte oxidation can also occur at these high potentials. These factors limit the rate at which lithium can be reinserted into the charged, high-capacity xMnO.(1\u2212x)MOelectrode. These electrodes also tend to lose capacity on cycling.","Attempts to stabilize cubic-close-packed layered as well as spinel lithium-metal-oxide structures by integrating them with a hexagonal-close-packed olivine structure have thus far been unsuccessful. For example, R. M. Ward et al., in the U.S. Department of Energy Journal of Undergraduate Research, Volume VI, page 91 (2006), demonstrated in their studies of reactions of LiNiPO(olivine) and LiNiMnO(layered) and Li[NiMn]O(spinel) precursors that the X-ray diffraction data of the products showed a complex mixture of phases, rather than structurally-integrated LiNiPO\u2014LiNiMnO(\u2018olivine-layered\u2019) and LiNiPO\u2014Li[NiMn]O(olivine-spinel) composite materials. Thackeray et al. reported at the 25International Battery Seminar and Exhibit, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mar. 17-20, 2008 and at the International Workshop on Fundamentals of Lithium-based Batteries, Schloss Ringberg, Tegernsee, Germany, Nov. 23-28, (2008) that high resolution transmission electron diffraction of olivine LiNiPOand spinel LiNiVOprecursors after reaction at elevated temperatures existed as discrete olivine and spinel phases, respectively, rather than as an integrated structure.","Despite the apparent inability of olivine compounds (LiMPO, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) with a PO polyanionic framework to form integrated, epitaxially-grown structures with layered and spinel lithium metal oxides, it has now been discovered that depositing a lithium-metal-phosphate material, for example, a Li\u2014Ni\u2014POmaterial onto the surface of a layered lithium metal oxide using a sol-gel method followed by a heat-treatment step, significantly enhances the surface stability, rate capability and cycling stability of lithium-metal-oxide electrodes, particularly when charged to high potentials, thereby allowing high capacities to be delivered at improved rates. The principles of this invention, therefore, can be extended to other types of lithium-metal-oxide structures that suffer from chemical and electrochemical instabilities at high potentials, for example, the family of lithium-manganese-oxides with a spinel-type structure, and substituted variations thereof. These advances are particularly relevant to lithium-ion batteries that power applications such as cell phones, laptop computers, power tools, hybrid-, plug-in hybrid- and all-electric vehicles for which the demand for higher energy and power batteries is growing. These new advances were first disclosed, in concept and in practical data, by Thackeray et al. at the 25International Battery Seminar and Exhibit, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Mar. 17-20, 2008 and at the International Workshop on Fundamentals of Lithium-based Batteries, Schloss Ringberg, Tegernsee, Germany, Nov. 23-28 (2008), respectively.","This invention relates to positive electrodes (cathodes) for lithium cells and batteries. More specifically, the invention relates to surface protected lithium-metal-oxide electrodes, notably those having layered-type or spinel-type structures, or combinations thereof. The invention extends to electrodes in which the oxygen ions of the closed-packed spinel and layered structures are partially replaced by and contain other anionic species, such as fluoride ions. In one embodiment, the lithium-metal-oxide electrode is comprised of a one or more layered compounds, represented by the general formula, xLiM\u2032O.(1\u2212x)LiMOin which M\u2032 comprises one or more metal ions with an average tetravalent oxidation state, and M comprises one or more metal ions with an average trivalent oxidation state, as described and defined more fully by Thackeray et al. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,677,082 and 6,680,143. In a preferred embodiment, the M\u2032 comprises Mn, and M comprises one or more metal ions, selected preferably from Mn, Ni and Co. A second embodiment of this invention is that the surface of the lithium-metal-oxide electrode particles is protected by, and comprised of, one or more lithium-metal-polyanionic materials, such as a lithium-metal-phosphate, a lithium-metal-silicate or the like, in which the polyanion is comprised of a negatively charged species that contains more than one atom type, for example WO, MoO, SO, PO, SiO. In a preferred embodiment, the negatively charged species are metal-free polyanions, such as PO and SiO. In another preferred embodiment, the lithium-metal-polyanionic materials can act as lithium-ion conductors at or above the operating potential of the lithium-metal-oxide positive electrode to provide access of the lithium ions from the electrolyte to the electrode during discharge, and vice-versa during charge, while simultaneously protecting the surface of the electrode from undesirable effects, such as electrolyte oxidation, oxygen loss or dissolution. Such surface protection significantly enhances the surface stability, rate capability and cycling stability of the lithium-metal-oxide electrodes, particularly when charged to high potentials.","In another embodiment of this invention, the positive electrodes are protected by a modified surface, surface layer or coating comprising a lithium-metal-polyanionic material that is stable at and\/or above the operating electrochemical potential of the lithium-metal-oxide electrode. It is desirable that the modified surface, surface layer or coating should act predominantly or exclusively as a stable lithium-ion conductor that operates preferably at or above 4 V, more preferably at or above 4.5 V and most preferably at or above 5.0 V versus metallic lithium, thereby allowing the electrode to operate repeatedly at high rates without subjecting the modified surface, surface layer or coating to potentially damaging redox reactions that might affect the electrochemical properties of the electrode. The lithium-metal-polyanionic material may be comprised of lithium, one or more metals, and one or more polyanions. In addition, the lithium-metal-polyanionic material may be amorphous or, alternatively, it may be poorly crystalline or strongly crystalline with either stoichiometric structures or cation and\/or anion defect structures. Therefore in this embodiment, the positive electrode comprises lithium-metal-oxide particles, the surface of the particles comprising a lithium-metal-polyanionic material, the general formula of which comprises at least one lithium cation, at least one other metal cation, and at least one polyanion.","The lithium-metal-polyanionic material is comprised preferably of one or more lithium-metal-phosphate or lithium-metal-silicate materials, for example, those selected from the family of lithium-nickel-phosphate, lithium-cobalt-phosphate, lithium-magnesium-phosphate, lithium-nickel-silicate, lithium-cobalt-silicate, and lithium-magnesium-silicate materials. In a further preferred embodiment, the lithium-metal-polyanionic material is comprised of a lithium-nickel-phosphate, lithium-cobalt-phosphate, lithium-magnesium-phosphate, lithium-nickel-silicate, lithium-cobalt-silicate, and lithium-magnesium-silicate compositions and structures, including stoichiometric- or defect olivine-related LiMPOstructures (for example, M=Ni, Co, Mg, Zn), LiPO-related structures as well as metal-substituted LiPO-related structures, such as defect LiMPO(for example, M=Ni, Co, Mg, Zn; 0<x<2) structures, defect LiMPO(for example, M=Al, Ga, and La; 0<x<3) and LiMSiO-related structures such as stoichiometric LiNiSiOand LiCoSiOand defect LiMSiOstructures. In the stoichiometric and defect compounds of this invention, such as LiMPO, LiMPO, LiMPO, LiMSiOand LiMSiOcompositions and structures, the M cations may be partially or completely substituted by other metal cations, for example, divalent cations, such as Mg or Zn ions, and trivalent cations, such as Al ions, and tetravalent cations, such as Zr ions, that can also form lithium-ion conducting, solid electrolyte compounds. Of particular significance is the advantage that lithium-metal-polyanionic materials containing divalent metal cations, such as LiNiPOand LiCoPO, can remain stable and electrochemically inactive to lithium extraction to a high electrochemical potential of approximately 5 V vs. lithium metal. The applicants believe that a particular advantage of having stable divalent nickel ions in the modified surface, surface layer or coating may aid to stabilize manganese-based lithium-metal-oxide electrodes because any Ni\u2014Mn nearest neighbor interactions would contribute further to stabilizing the lithium-metal-oxide electrode surface by suppressing surface Mn species and manganese solubility.","The lithium-metal-polyanionic material of this invention may also include LiPOas a component of the protective layer. In this respect, LiPOmay either be the major component (>50%) or the minor component (<50%) of the surface structure or, alternatively, it may be used entirely as the protective surface layer or coating of the lithium-metal-oxide electrode.","In a further embodiment, the invention is extended to include LiSiO-related compositions and structures and substituted compositions and structures, for example, metal-substituted, defect LiMSiOstructures in which M is one or more divalent cations such as Ni, Co, Mg and Zn and 0<x<2. In metal-substituted LiSiOstructures, the substituted M cations may alternatively be comprised of trivalent cations, such as Al ions, or tetravalent cations, such as Zr ions, that can form lithium-ion conducting compounds.","The invention includes experimental procedures and treatments for depositing the protective layers onto, or coating the lithium-metal-oxide-electrodes. Examples include, in particular, standard sol-gel, rf-magnetron sputtering and\/or atomic layer deposition techniques. Because the precise nature of the modified surface, surface layer or coating is not known, the terms \u2018surface treatment\u2019 and \u2018surface coating\u2019 as disclosed in this specification are used synonymously and interchangeably.","The following examples describe the principles of the invention as contemplated by the inventors, but they are not to be construed as limiting examples.","A mildly fluorinated 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiNiCoMnO(LiMnNiCoO) electrode was prepared from a powdered precursor as described previously by Kang et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Volume 153, page A1186 (2006). A lithium nickel phosphate protective material was applied to the electrode powder using a sol-gel method, by immersing and treating the powder in an acidic solution (pH<4) of lithium acetate, nickel nitrate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate with glycolic acid as a chelating agent using a Li:Ni:P ratio of about 1:1:1. Nitric acid was used to control the pH of the solution to prevent precipitation. The electrode powder was stirred continuously in the solution and heated slowly to dryness. The resulting Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated powder product was finally heated at about 550\u00b0 C. for about 6 hours in air.","Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated samples were collected on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (CuK\u03b1) between 10 and 80\u00b0 2\u03b8. Coin-type cells (2032, Hohsen) were constructed from the coated powder in an argon-filled glovebox (<5 ppm Oand HO). The cathode consisted of 80 wt % of the coated oxide powder, 10 wt % carbon, and 10 wt % polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) binder on aluminum foil. The anode was either metallic lithium or graphite (MAG-10, Hitachi with 8 wt % PVDF) on copper foil. The electrolyte was 1.2M LiPFin a 3:7 mixture of ethylene carbonate and ethylmethyl carbonate. For the cycling experiments, cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged between 2.0 and 4.6 V (2.0 and 4.5 V for the Li-ion cells) at different currents (0.1-2.0 mA\/cm) and trickle charged at 4.6 V for 3 hours. For the rate tests, lithium cells were charged to 4.6 V at 0.1 mA\/cmwith a trickle charge at 4.6 V for 3 hours; cells were discharged to 2.0 V at 0.1 to 1.0 mA\/cmwith three cycles at each rate. Electrochemical experiments were conducted at room temperature and duplicated to check reproducibility.","The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the parent, mildly fluorinated 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiNiCoMnOmaterial and the Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated sample are shown in  (patterns (a) and (b), respectively). The pattern of the uncoated sample (, pattern (a)) is typical of layered xLiMnO.(1\u2212x)LiMOmaterials; it shows the characteristic weak ordering peaks from the LiMnO-type component at 21-25\u00b0 2\u03b8. The XRD pattern of the Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated sample (, pattern (b)) is essentially identical to the parent compound; it shows a minor amount of LiPOand\/or structurally related LiNiPO, and a few additional weak, unidentified peaks. The detailed nature of the surface structure is currently unknown.","It is already known that fluorination improves the room temperature cycling stability of layered lithium-metal-oxide electrodes and that the fluorine component resides predominantly at the particle surface, as described for example by Kang et al. in the Journal of Power Sources, Volume 146, page 654 (2005), Park et al. in the Journal of Power Sources Volume 178, page 826 (2008), and Kim et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Volume 152, page A1707 (2005). Surface fluorination of 0.1LiMnO.0.9LiMnNiCoO(Li[MnNiCo]O) electrodes using mildly acidic fluorinated solutions improves their rate capability as described by Kang et al. in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Volume 155, page A269 (2008); in this instance, at 1.0 mA\/cm, which approximates a C\/1 rate, the parent electrode yielded approximately 160 mAh\/g, whereas the fluorinated electrode yielded 175 mAh\/g.","The voltage profiles of the initial charge\/discharge cycle of lithium half cells with the uncoated and Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiNiCoMnOelectrodes of this invention, obtained at 0.1 mA\/cm(<C\/10 rate) are shown in . The initial charge profiles and capacity (approximately 295 mAh\/g) of the cells are similar, indicating lithium extraction first from the LiNiCoMnOcomponent between 3.0 and approximately 4.4 V, followed by lithium extraction and oxygen loss (net loss LiO) between 4.4 and 4.6 V. On discharge, the Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated electrode delivered approximately 260 mAh\/g vs. the approximately 240 mAh\/g from the uncoated electrode, the coated electrode exhibiting a higher, first-cycle coulombic efficiency of 87% compared to the uncoated electrode (81%). The Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated electrodes delivered their capacity at potentials above that of the parent uncoated electrode (), implying that the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction was faster in the Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated electrodes of the invention.","The relative rate capability of uncoated and Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated electrodes is shown in , graph (a). The data indicate that the Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated electrode is significantly more tolerant to higher discharge than the uncoated parent 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiNiCoMnOelectrode and shows less polarization. The beneficial effect of the surface Li\u2014Ni\u2014POmaterial is more pronounced at high discharge rates, the coated electrode showing a higher capacity retention at 1.0 mA\/cm(80%) relative to the capacity at 0.1 mA\/cmthan the uncoated electrode (70%). The corresponding capacity vs. cycle number plots of these lithium cells, for charge\/discharge currents of 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0 mA\/cm, emphasize the excellent and surprisingly superior cycling stability of the coated electrodes (, graph (b)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":["4","2","3","0.44","0.25","0.31","2 "],"sup":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"sub":["4","2","3","2 "],"sup":["2 ","2 "]},"Coatings were applied to mildly fluorinated electrode materials 0.5LiMnO.0.5LiNiCoMnO(LiMnNiCoO) following the same treatment to the powders as described in Example 1. In these experiments, solutions containing various amounts of lithium, nickel and phosphate ions were used in accordance with the formula LiNiPOfor x=0, 0.25 and 0.75 such that a 2 mole percent coating was applied. In addition, an electrode sample with a coating of 2 mole percent LiPOwas also prepared, for comparison. In the final step, the resulting Li\u2014Ni\u2014PO-coated electrode products were dried by heating at about 550\u00b0 C. for about 6 hours in air. The electrochemical properties of these electrode products were evaluated to determine, in particular, the effect that the various surface treatments or surface coatings had on coulombic efficiency and capacity, when cells were cycled at various current rates.","Electrochemical cells were assembled as described in Example 1.
