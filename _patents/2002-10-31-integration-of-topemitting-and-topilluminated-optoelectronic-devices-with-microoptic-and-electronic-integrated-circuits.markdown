The complexity and speed of electronic integrated circuit devices such as microprocessors continue to increase at a very high rate. However, the input and output (I\/O) capability of these devices has not been able to scale at the same rate, because of the existing limitations in electronic packaging and integrating of these devices. Also, the current technologies of integrating large arrays of opto-electronic devices with electronic integrated circuit devices require bottom emitting\/detecting of a light beam, and these methodologies are generally not scalable for a wafer-scale fabrication and\/or integration of both emitters and detectors.","Therefore there is a need for a method of integrating an opto-electronic device with an electronic integrated circuit device for a scalable wafer-scale fabrication, and at the same time providing a large-scale I\/O capability to an electronic integrated circuit device.","These and other aspects, advantages, and features of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the following description of the invention and referenced drawings, or by practice of the invention.

This step can be achieved by thinning the substrate from the back side of the substrate such that the top contact pads are exposed to the bottom side. The thinning step can also include forming via in the substrate from the thinned bottom side to expose the top contact pads to the bottom side. Thinning can be by mechanically lapping the bottom side of the gallium arsenide substrate to a predetermined thickness. In one embodiment the predetermined thickness is about 50 microns. A via can be formed by chemically etching the bottom side of the thinned substrate to the etch stop layer, to expose the top contact pads to the bottom side.

In one embodiment forming through-the-via includes plating through-the-via metal to connect the top contact pads to the bottom contact pads. Connecting the top contact pads to the bottom contact pads facilitates in bringing the top contact pads in a same plane as matching pads of an electronic integrated circuit device, and also helps in matching patterns the top contact pads with the matching pads of the electronic integrated circuit device and further helps in making it easier to integrate with the electronic integrated circuit device. Also connecting the top contact pads with bottom contact pads gives the flexibility of locating the bottom contact pads anywhere as needed, without interfering with the location of the emitter\/detector devices.","Step  in the process involves integrating a wafer of micro-optic devices  onto the top surface of the optically transparent superstrate  such that the micro-optic devices are aligned with corresponding top emitter\/detector devices  to provide an optical processing capability to them.
