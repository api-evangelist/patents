{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority from and the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(a) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/428,853, filed on Dec. 30, 2010, which is incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Also, the present application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61\/428,846, 61\/428,851 and 61\/428,852, all of which have been filed on December 30. Applicant hereby incorporates by reference the above-mentioned provisional applications, which are not admitted to be prior art with respect to the present invention by their mention here or in the background section that follows.","1. Field","The following description relates to provisioning of virtual card applets on a secure element of a mobile terminal.","2. Discussion of the Background","With the recent advancements of mobile technology, more features have been added to mobile terminals. Addition of applications related to Global Positioning System (GPS) to mobile office products have made mobile terminals commonplace for many consumers. In order to further utilize mobile technology to better cater to consumer's daily requirements, attempts have been made to provide for a mobile financial management system to replace conventional physical wallets. Specifically, this mobile wallet functionality was sought to be realized through provisioning of card issuer's account information directly into a secure element (SE) of the mobile terminal. The SE may be a smart card chip capable of storing multiple applications, including of account specific information that may not be easily accessed by external parties. A mobile wallet application may have the similar composition as the conventional wallet, which may contain payment cards, member cards, transportation cards, and loyalty cards.","Mobile wallet functionality may be further enhanced by provisioning the user financial credential onto mobile terminals equipped with a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled chipset. Once the user financial credentials have been provisioned onto the SE of the NFC enabled mobile terminal, the provisioned NFC enabled terminal may transfer information or make payments to another NFC compatible device, such as a Point of Sale (POS) terminal, by coming near within a close distance of one another without physically contacting each other. This type of technology is conventionally referred to as \u201ccontactless\u201d technology and a payment made with this technology is referred to as \u201ccontactless\u201d payment. Despite the numerous benefits that may be available utilizing the described technology, there has been lack of practical solutions to provision sensitive user information to the NFC enabled mobile terminals.","One possible solution for provisioning mobile wallet cards is to perform the provisioning at a secure facility controlled by the mobile wallet card issuer. However, this solution may require users to bring their mobile terminal to the physical mobile wallet card issuer for provisioning. This process has to be repeated for every mobile wallet card the user seeks to provision at different card issuer facility, making the concept of mobile wallet impractical.","In addition, with much focus on mobile commerce, many competing service providers may seek providing their services to the consumers. However, such services may be offered to the consumer without regard to the mobile terminal capabilities or mobile service providers utilized by the consumers. Due to technical or business compatibility, there may be numerous applications that may be inapplicable to the consumer's attributes. Accordingly, consumers are often bombarded with various applications that may be inapplicable to the consumer, making the process more difficult than necessary.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method for providing an application to a user. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method for providing data preparation based on a data type.","Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method using a non-transitory processor for providing an application product including receiving an application profile, a load file profile, a secure element (SE) profile, and a mobile terminal profile; establishing a link between the received profiles, in which the link is established for assembling the application product; and applying a limitation to the application product, in which the applied limitation determines whether the application product is accessible to a user.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method using a non-transitory processor for data preparation in a Trusted Service Manager (TSM) including receiving data from a service provider, in which the received data is in a Data Grouping Identifier (DGI) format or a raw data format; and processing the data using at least one of a logical data preparation and a physical data preparation.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a method using a non-transitory processor for filtering an application product including receiving an application profile, a load file profile, a key profile, a secure element (SE) profile, and a mobile terminal profile; receiving a key; establishing a link between the key profile and the key; establishing a link between the received profiles, in which the link is established for assembling the application product; applying a limitation to the application product, in which the limitation is a technical limitation, a business rule limitation, or a certification limitation; receiving mobile terminal information, in which the mobile terminal information includes at least one of operating system information, SE type information, hardware information, and application information stored in a mobile terminal; and filtering the applicable application product based on the applied limitation and the mobile terminal information for displaying to a user.","It is to be understood that both foregoing general descriptions and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.","The invention is described more fully hereinafter with references to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. It will be understood that for the purposes of this disclosure, \u201cat least one of each\u201d will be interpreted to mean any combination the enumerated elements following the respective language, including combination of multiples of the enumerated elements. For example, \u201cat least one of X, Y, and Z\u201d will be construed to mean X only, Y only, Z only, or any combination of two or more items X, Y, and Z (e.g. XYZ, XZ, or YZ). Throughout the drawings and the detailed description, unless otherwise described, the same drawing reference numerals are understood to refer to the same elements, features, and structures. The relative size and depiction of these elements may be exaggerated for clarity, illustration, and convenience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , a system employing TSM technology with OTA proxy provisioning may include a TSM system , mobile terminal , network , third party messaging platform , Point of Sale (POS) terminal , financial institution ; mobile network operator (MNO) ; handset manufacturer ; and card manufacturer . For the purposes of this disclosure, financial institution , MNO , handset manufacturer , and card manufacturer  will be collectively referred to as Service Providers (SP). However, the list of SPs are not limited to the SPs provided in .","Before TSM system  may be fully utilized by the user, SPs - may go through a pre-registration process as outlined in . In an example, the network  may refer to a cellular network, which may include one or more base stations to enable mobile terminal  to communicate with other mobile terminals or third party entities. In addition, network  may also include any other type of suitable communication network, such as the Internet, traditional wired telephone lines, and other suitable network technologies.","The handset manufacturers  may include manufacturers of embedded secure elements (SEs), and card manufacturers  may include manufacturers of micro secure digital (SD) secure element (SE) (collectively referred to as non-Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) SEs). As different SE manufacturers may provide different OTA keys than those that are used for conventional UICC SEs, handset manufacturers  and card manufacturers  may provide their OTA keys to their respective SEs to the TSM  in the pre-registration process. In addition, the handset manufacturers  and card manufacturers  may provide their OTA keys upon request by the mobile terminal  rather than going through the pre-registration process. In an example, the OTA keys may be generated by the SE manufacturers, or obtained through a third party. For the purposes of simplicity, the OTA key may be referred simply as a \u201ckey\u201d. However, the general term of \u201ckey\u201d is not limited to OTA keys only, but may also refer to a transport key, SE keys, and other keys that may be used to conduct secure transactions involving SEs.","In an example, once the mobile terminal  has been provisioned with contactless card applets, which may be used with a Near Field Communication (NFC) technology installed in the mobile terminal , owner of the mobile terminal  may make a purchase at the NFC enabled POS terminal  by waving the mobile terminal  at the corresponding POS terminal . Subsequently, once a purchase is made with the mobile terminal , the acquirer network and payment processor work together to ensure the payment gets updated at the financial institution . This end user application, however, does not involve the described TSM  ecosystem and is illustrated to provide a description of a complete ecosystem according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.","Further, TSM  may include multiple components for more efficient processing.  is a block diagram of a TSM system, its components, and its relationship with service providers according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.","A TSM system  may include a Card & Application Management System (CAMS) ; Key Management System (KMS) ; Post Issuance Processor (PIP) ; Customer Care, Billing, Participant System (CBPS) ; Wallet Management System (WMS) ; OM&A ; External System Interface (ESI) ; and a database (not pictured) to store and manage various information provided to TSM . The database storage may reside within a specified component, as an independent component within TSM , or separate from TSM  as an external component.","Component CAMS  may be responsible for managing the life cycles of SEs, secure domains, and applets. Life cycle refers to the various status of the respective SEs or applets installed in the mobile terminal . In an example, the life cycle of a SE may include operating system (OS) Native, initialized, and secured. Life cycle of an applet may include lock and unlock. Some of the functionalities offered by the CAMS  may be management of SE type, SE profile, SE identification (ID), application profile, and card profile. One or more SEs may be identified individually and controlled by CAMS  with its own SE ID (Card Reference Number (CRN), Card Image Number (CIN), Card Production Life Cycle (CPLC), Card Serial Number (CSN)).","Component KMS  may be responsible key management to allow secure transactions. Key management activities may be related to secure log in, access control, audit, key profile management, key management, key profile exchange and recovery, and delegated management.","Component PIP  may be primarily responsible for provisioning information into the mobile terminal , which may include preparation of data to be provisioned and the actual execution of sending and receiving provisioning messages provided in Application Protocol Data Units (APDU) and data preparation prior to servicing.","Component CBPS  may be responsible for customer management. This component may maintain and monitor customer account status as well as data related to SP service subscriptions. The CBPS  may modify the status of the SPs related to the customer as specified events occur (e.g. stolen mobile terminal) or requested by the SP.","Component WMS  may be responsible for management of a mobile wallet application and its associated mobile card widgets stored therein. This component may provide a mobile ID to associate the mobile wallet application stored in the user's mobile terminal  as well as all of the individual widgets stored in the mobile wallet application. In addition, this component may store any of the user preferences made by the wallet owner (e.g. language, font, default card, etc.). This system may hold the master configuration, which may provide synchronization benefit for the mobile wallet application. This particular component may reside within the TSM  or as a separate system.","Component OM&A  may be responsible for providing an interface for external managers to access TSM  directly. In instances where a SP or an external party desires to enter in data or modify certain items directly, the designated personnel may access TSM  via OM&A  to make the necessary modifications.","Component ESI  may provide for an interface for one or more SPs to send and receive data. As SPs may have specific or individualized protocol they utilize, ESI  may translate commands and requests arriving or leaving TSM  as appropriate.","The described TSM  may be implemented as a third party entity positioned to consolidate information from financial institutions , MNOs , Handset Manufacturers , and Card Manufacturers . As TSM  holds information collected from various parties, the mobile terminal  may interact with TSM  rather than various discrete entities. In sum, TSM  may act as an integration point for one or more SPs or external parties the mobile terminal  may deal with, providing for a seamless and more efficient operation of mobile services.","All of the above described components may reside within the TSM system or separately according to business or system design specifications. In an example, TSM  may be an individual server residing on a network or a collaboration of various servers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"11"},"Prior to any provisioning of mobile card application, one or more SPs may be pre-registered in TSM  as shown in step . A more detailed illustration and explanation of this process will be provided in .","Once SP profiles have been registered, the user may select a registered SP's payment card for provisioning by the mobile terminal  in step .","After a request is made to provision the selected mobile payment card, the financial institution  requests its issuance to TSM  in step . Request for service subscription may include identifying information such as Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN) along with encrypted account related information that is to to be provisioned.","TSM  in response to the request begins preparation of the provisioning data in step . Upon receipt of provisioning information, an internal data link is created to log the service request made by the financial institution . Further, a portion of the account data transmitted by the financial institution  may be maintained to identify a card account with the requesting user within TSM . For security purposes, the entire account number may not be maintained. However, the entire account number may be maintained within TSM  for business reasons. A more detailed illustration and explanation of how links are provided between two or more profiles are provided in .","Once the request has been logged in TSM , TSM  transmits a wake up request command to a mobile push server (e.g. Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM) platform) along with identifying information (i.e. MSISDN) in step , which in turn relays the command to wake up the OTA proxy residing in the requesting user's mobile terminal  in step .","In a preferred embodiment of this invention, OTA proxy may be asleep prior to being awaken. Once OTA proxy is woken or initialized, the OTA proxy may connect to TSM . The OTA proxy may connect to TSM  automatically or upon receiving a user input after OTA proxy is awake. Upon connection, OTA Proxy gathers the SE and mobile terminal specific information and sends the collected information to TSM  for verification. However, OTA Proxy may gather the specified information prior to connection or provide the information to TSM  in a separate process. In receipt of provided information, TSM  conducts an internal check to see if at least one of the MSISDN, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)\/Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID), Card Image Number (CIN)\/Integrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID) of mobile terminal  and SE match the user information stored in TSM . As this internal check is conducted when OTA proxy connects to TSM , additional security is provided to verify SE associated with the user account along with the associated the mobile terminal .","Once OTA proxy connects to TSM  with the collected information and TSM  conducts the internal check has been conducted, TSM  may analyze the provided data for any additional processing SE may require and the best mode of provisioning the information into the respective mobile terminal  in step .","More specifically, in step , TSM  may identify SE status and SE type for identifying proper processes to be performed for provisioning. As processing of stored SE may be based on its status, analysis of SE status and corresponding processes may be conducted prior to accessing the information stored in the SE. More specifically, based on the SE status, some preparation steps may be executed to secure the SE for processing commands received through the OTA proxy. In an example, SE equipped in the mobile terminal  may have any of the 3 statuses: operating system (OS) native, initialized, and secured.","If the status of the SE is determined to be \u201csecured\u201d no further preparation steps may be executed. The \u201csecured\u201d state for the SE may refer to an intended operating card life cycle state in post issuance. On the other hand, if the status of the SE is determined to be \u201cinitialized\u201d then TSM  may provide a final issuer master key to secure the SE. The \u201cinitialized\u201d state for the SE may refer to an administrative card production state. Lastly, if the status of the SE is determined to be \u201cOS native\u201d, then pre-personalization process may be conducted, which may include providing an initial issuer master key and a final issuer master key to the SE. The \u201cOS native\u201d state for the SE may refer to a status that SE is not initialized by manufacturer's initialization method.","After status of the SE has been determined, an analysis of SE type may be performed to determine the type of protocol that may be run within OTA proxy in order to provision into the identified SE. If the SE is a UICC type or an embedded type, SE may be accessed to modify the information stored in the SE. Alternatively, if the SE is a Micro SD type, additional process specific protocol may be executed to access or to modify the information stored in the SE. Since a person ordinarily skilled in the art understands what type of protocols may be used to access the Micro SD type, discussion thereof is omitted herein.","After the best mode of provisioning has been determined, TSM  prepares and transmits the provisioning data in APDU format to the OTA proxy in step . OTA proxy in receipt of APDU commands by TSM  relays the provisioning data to the SE in step .","OTA proxy is allowed access to the non-UICC SEs through the various keys that have been loaded onto TSM  along with SE specific Application Programming Interface (API), which may be exchanged offline. Through the incorporation of these attributes, OTA proxy protocol is provided access to the SE to be provisioned.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["10","10","11"]},"In step , SP's information is registered into TSM . This process may be achieved by various methods. For example, the SP may transmit an encrypted email with basic registration information along with a Pretty-Good-Privacy (PGP) public key. Registration may also be achieved in person, by phone, through an automated system or other suitable methods to exchange information. TSM administrator may then enter SP's basic information into TSM  and provide a unique SP ID, transport key ID, and the SP type (a financial institution , a MNO , a handset manufacturer , or a card manufacturer ). TSM administrator may be a person, an automated system, or a separate entity. Afterwards, TSM  may create a SP account and generate a secure token for the correlating SP ID. Once that is accomplished, TSM  encrypts the SP account information in an encrypted email to send to the requesting SP.","In step , a transport key is exchanged between TSM  and the SP. Transport key serves to provide secure transmission of sensitive data between various parties. Such security may be provided through encryption, cryptographic transformation of data through Message Authentication Code (MAC), or other suitable security measures. The SP transmits a request to receive a transport key set to TSM . In response, TSM  checks for duplicate keys assigned to the requesting SP, and if no such key has been assigned, then TSM  generates transport key sets inside a Hardware Security Module (HSM). In an example, transport key sets may include three numbered keys including an encryption key (ENC), data encryption key (DEK), and message authentication code (MAC). TSM  exports the generated keys in an encrypted form using the PGP key provided by the SP in step . Once the transport key set has been exchanged between the parties, at least one of the following SP related profiles may be provided to TSM  for registration: a load file profile , an application profile , a key profile , a SE profile , and a mobile terminal profile . These processes may be performed simultaneously or independently. Further, the number of profiles is not limited to the profiles described above. In an example, a larger number of registered profiles may provide for a more specific product that may be suitable to a user, and a smaller number of registered profiles may provide for a more generalized product that may be offered to various users.","Load file profile  may describe the application code file that contains one or more applications, or describe the load files that make up an application code. Application profile  describes a smart card application as metadata, which may be utilized later for creating an instance of the application. Key profile  describes basic profile information and key information as metadata, which may be utilized for creating an instance of the key. ISD master keys are also registered in the system, including Initial Supplier Key (ISK), Initial Issuer Master Key (KMC), and Final Issuer Master Key (CMK). Key profile may contain metadata for one or more keys, including ISK, KMC, and CMK. SE profile  describes attributes of a smart card. More specifically, the SE profile may include, without limitation, information related to manufacturer, version, name, model, contact\/contactless attributes (e.g., baud rate). And lastly, mobile terminal profile  describes attributes of a mobile terminal , including NFC capability, supported SE types, and OTA channel support.","Once one or more profiles have been provided to TSM , TSM  establishes one or more links between the provided profiles to provide for one or more application products for users to request. The profiles may be sent to TSM  directly through the network , by physical embodiments of provided data, or other suitable methods that may be available to transfer information. Two or more of these profiles may be linked in step . A process of how these profiles may be linked together is explained in more detail in .","Subsequently, once links are established between profiles, limitations may be configured between profiles in step . One or more application products may be limited according business rules that have been aggregated by TSM  based upon agreements between the SPs. For example, a certain MNO  (e.g. Sprint\u00ae) may refuse to work with a specific financial institution  (e.g. Citibank\u00ae) for business reasons. In addition, there may be some technical limitation barring providing certain products to user mobile terminal , such as an incompatible mobile operating system. Based upon these limitations, a filtered list of application products may be available for request by the consumer. A detailed explanation of how the limitations may be configured between profiles is explained further in detail in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"As mentioned in , in steps -, various profiles are registered into TSM  by the SPs. However, when a key profile  is registered, additional steps may be taken. In step , keys themselves are registered by the SP if they have not been provided along with the key profile . Or if keys were submitted along with the key profile , keys may be extracted by the TSM administrator or TSM . Further, once both the key and key profiles have been registered, a link is made between the key and the key profile in step  to provide an instance of a key for usage by TSM .","In step , once one or more profiles have been registered in TSM , TSM  or the TSM administrator compiles the registered profiles to begin registering application products for deployment based on one or more possible combinations. The application product may include the following attributes: product name, logo, group, SE type, security domain application identifier (AID), and Instance AID. For example, a product instance may be composed of a Citi\u00ae type bank, Visa\u00ae issuance, Android\u00ae operating system (OS), Sprint\u00ae mobile service, and other relevant attributes. This application product registration step may be repeated until appropriate application products are registered. This step may be executed by using a suitable software or application that may be commonly known to a skilled artisan or by using specialized software or application constructed for this purpose. Further, this step may be executed by other personnel, an automated system or by other suitable systems.","Once the application products have been configured through linking various profiles, the application products may be analyzed to see if accompanying dependent application products may be appropriate in step . For example, a contactless FDC-enabled credit card applet, as an application product, may require an accompanying Payment Procedure Secure Elements (PPSE) application in order to use the respective applet in the mobile terminal . As such, providing of appropriate dependent applications may provide seamless usage of application products to ensure that the user has appropriate control mechanisms in place to use the provisioned application products.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"In step , TSM  analyzes one or more of the registered application profiles , registered SE profiles , and registered mobile terminal profiles .","Based on the profiles provided, one or more profiles are checked against the other profiles for technical incompatibility in step . If the provided profiles are compatible, then no limitations may be applied to the respective application product. However, if there is a technical incompatibility, a limitation may be applied so that the requesting user is not provided with products that may be technically incompatible.","In step , if there is no technical incompatibility, then stored business rule limitations are checked against for its applicability to the respective application product. For example, if a MNO  (e.g. Sprint\u00ae) refuses to work with a financial institution  (e.g. Citibank\u00ae), a business rule limitation may be applied to the application product.","If there are no business rule limitations that are applicable, TSM  checks the application product for certification requirements imposed by credit card issuers, such as VISA\u00ae or Master Card\u00ae, in step . If the application product has not been certified by a specified issuer, then a certification limitation may be applied to the application product. If there is no certification incompatibility, then no limitation may be imposed on the registered profiles.","While steps  to  are illustrated to flow in a particular order, this order is for illustrative purposes only and is not limited to the provided sequence. In an example, steps  to  may be conducted all at once, or in any combination of steps. Further, steps  to  may be processed in the reverse order, or any other order. Also, compatibility check at one particular step may not prevent providing other compatibility checks. All or some of the compatibility checks may be conducted by TSM . For example, TSM  may check for business compatibility only, or business and technical compatibility only. Lastly, these compatibility checks are not limited to the provided categories, and more compatibility categories may be provided to TSM .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"In step , a SP transmits provisioning data, such as credit card account information, to TSM . In step , analysis is performed by TSM  to check the data preparation level of the provisioning data. As various SPs may have different capabilities in preparing data for submission, some data may require more data preparation than others. For example, smaller financial institutions may not have the technical capabilities in providing prepared data or have the necessary bargaining power to contract out to a third party data preparation service. In an example, data provided by the individual SPs may be provided in three different formats: APDU format, Data Grouping Identifier (DGI) format, and raw data format.","If it is determined that the service provider has provided the data in a APDU format, TSM  may not require any additional processing before provisioning the data as provided by the SP as illustrated by step .","If it is determined only the logical data preparation has been performed by the SP, then TSM  may classify the data as DGI format and begin physical data preparation in step  to convert the DGI data into APDU format. Physical data preparation may be executed using one or more suitable methods available. Afterwards, the provided data may be ready for provisioning in step .","Lastly, if it is determined that the service provider did not prepare the data at all and only the raw data is provided, TSM  first conducts a logical data preparation as illustrated in step . Logical data preparation may be executed using one or more suitable methods available. Once logical data preparation is finished, another level of physical data preparation is required in step  before it is ready for provisioning in step . Since logical data preparation and physical data preparation are well known in the art, further discussion thereof will be omitted from this disclosure.","By providing data preparation service without respect to level of data preparation provided by the SP, TSM  allows even the smaller SP, which may not have the necessary commercial leverage or technical capabilities, to use the TSM  for provisioning.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Once the mobile terminal  has been provisioned according the present disclosure, the mobile terminal  may include mobile wallet application ; OTA Proxy ; Device Stack ; and Secure Element .","Mobile wallet application  may provide the user with a graphically displayed mobile wallet interface, which may include various components such as payment widgets that are tied to the installed payment applet  as well as other components (e.g. coupons, transport pass, phone bill, and etc.).","OTA proxy  may facilitate provisioning of confidential information, such as financial applications and related account information into the mobile terminal 's SE . The OTA Proxy  is a mobile client, which supports OTA post-issuance related services to the secure element in a mobile terminal. As SE types, Micro SD and Embedded SEs (i.e. non-UICC SE) cannot support conventional SAT\/SUSAT\/CAT framework, OTA Proxy over OTA may be used by a SP to transmit data to mobile terminals  equipped with the non-UICC SEs. However, if desired, OTA proxy can also provide an alternative method, over the conventional method, to provision SEs that can support conventional SAT\/SUSAT\/CAT framework (e.g. UICC\/SIM\/USIM).","SE  may include a Wallet Management Applet (WMA) ; PPSE ; and Payment Applet(s) . When a payment applet  is provisioned into the SE of the mobile terminal , the payment applet  may be located within the SE to prevent unauthorized access to account sensitive information that may stored within the payment applet. Payment applet  may include Application ID, Application label or logo, and account specific information that may not accessible by the user. Further, when payment applet  is provisioned in the SE , PPSE  may also be provisioned to manage the payment applet  during a payment transaction. In order for retailers and manufacturers to select a specific payment applet during payment at a POS terminal , PPSE  manages relevant Application ID and Application label of the payment applet for selection. However, since mobile terminals  cannot access the payment applets  directly, a copy of the account specific information stored in the payment applet  is provisioned as a separate WMA  during the original provisioning process of the payment applet . However, WMA  may be provisioned independently from the provisioning of the payment applet  according to business needs. By providing a duplicate record of the payment applet  in WMA , the user of the mobile terminal  may be access account specific information stored in SE .","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variation can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
