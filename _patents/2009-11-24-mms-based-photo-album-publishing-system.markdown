title: MMS based photo album publishing system
abstract: An MMS publishing system comprises a management tool, an authoring tool, a storage facility, a message router, and a rendering server. The management tool authenticates a first user by using a telephone number of the first user as a user ID. The authoring tool allows the first user to associate rich media content with his telephone number. The content is then stored in the storage facility in association with his telephone number. Subsequently, the message router intercepts an MMS message sent from a mobile device over a wireless network when the MMS message includes a predetermined indicator and indicates the telephone number of the first user as a destination. The rendering server then accesses the stored content associated with the telephone number and sends the content to the mobile device, for output to a user of the mobile device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional patent application No. 60\/424,733, filed on Nov. 8, 2002, and entitled, \u201cMMS Based Application Server and Content Publishing System\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","At least one embodiment of the present invention pertains to computer\/communications network, and more particularly, to techniques for publishing and accessing content and accessing application services over a network using mobile devices.","Personal mobile communication\/computing devices, such as cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and two-way pagers, have become commonplace in many countries. These devices can be collectively referred to as \u201cmobile devices\u201d. Many of the latest generation of mobile devices provide their users with the ability to access resources on the Internet via wireless telecommunications networks (or simply, \u201cwireless networks\u201d). For example, some of these mobile devices allow their users to access World Wide Web pages, exchange email and download files over the Internet. Devices which can access the World Wide Web (\u201cthe Web\u201d) include a software application called a browser, which when implemented in a small (e.g., handheld) mobile device is sometimes more precisely referred to as a \u201cminibrowser\u201d or \u201cmicrobrowser\u201d. An example of such a browser is the Openwave Mobile Browser produced by Openwave Systems Inc. of Redwood City, Calif.","A device called a gateway is often used to enable these mobile devices to do this. Typically, the gateway is (or includes) a server computer system that is coupled between the wireless network and the Internet. The gateway typically translates\/converts between the languages and protocols used on the Internet and the languages and protocols used by the mobile devices. Such a gateway is included in the Openwave Mobile Access Gateway, produced by Openwave Systems Inc. The gateway is typically operated by the communications service provider (CSP), e.g., the operator of the wireless network, also sometimes called the \u201cwireless carrier\u201d. Wireless carriers sometimes use the gateway and associated computer systems to provide additional services to their subscribers (mobile device users), such as content caching, proxying, etc. Wireless carriers also sometimes generate revenue from providing more sophisticated \u201cvalue added\u201d services and applications to their subscribers, such as location services.","Currently there is substantial interest in providing better ways for users to access published content and application services from their mobile devices. The term \u201ccontent\u201d in this context can refer to essentially any kind of information, such as text, images (e.g., graphics, photos, animations), sound, etc. One specific type of content, for example, is a Web page. There is significant interest in allowing users to browse the Web from mobile devices more efficiently. Current technology has a number of shortcomings in this regard, which discourage users from using the Web browsing capabilities of their mobile devices.","Many mobile devices use wireless access protocol (WAP) to access the Internet via wireless networks. Web pages can be sent to mobile devices as wireless markup language (WML) over WAP, for example, and displayed on the mobile devices. However, the WAP usage model for Web browsing is problematic. The problems include the fact that WAP is a synchronous protocol, that Web browsing inherently involves serial navigation, and that the Internet and wireless networks tend to have very high latencies. WAP is synchronous in that the user must wait for a response to each WAP request. This fact, combined with high network latencies and the requirement of serialize navigation, means that users have to wait repeatedly when Web browsing or accessing applications from their mobile devices, making these processes long and laborious.","For example, assume that a cellular telephone user wants to find out what the weather is currently like in Rome. Accordingly, the user starts up the browser in his cellular telephone. The user then selects an item labeled \u201cWeather\u201d from a menu screen displayed on the phone. This menu is managed by the carrier, which performs an \u201ceditorial\u201d or content management function. The user then waits for several seconds while the phone sends a WAP request via the wireless network to a remote server, until the phone receives a reply that causes the phone to display the next screen. The next screen prompts the user to specify whether he wishes to identify a city by ZIP code or by name, for his request. Assume that the user chooses to specify a city by name and makes the appropriate selection. Again the user waits for several seconds, while the telephone sends another WAP request to the remote server via a wireless network, and receives a reply that causes the phone to generate yet another screen, prompting the user to enter the name of the city. The user then uses the keypad of the telephone to type in the name \u201cRome\u201d and presses the enter key. Yet again, the user waits for several seconds, while another WAP request is sent by the phone over the wireless network, until finally, the current weather in Rome is displayed to the user.","It will be recognized that the foregoing is a time-consuming and tedious process, which discourages users from using the Web browsing capability of their mobile devices. It will also be recognized that this is a very simple example of Web browsing from a mobile device. A more in-depth browsing session would require a correspondingly longer and more tedious process. So, while WAP provides an effective way to publish content (e.g., web pages), it has serious disadvantages in terms of usability when accessing content.","WAP also has disadvantages from the standpoint of content availability. In the WAP model, content is normally expected to be produced by a third-party group of formal content providers, who generally require some financial incentive to produce content.","With the introduction of \u201c3G\u201d mobile devices, mobile devices will have a much broader range of capabilities than ever before. Consequently, it is desirable for wireless carriers to be able to provide a wider range of \u201cvalue added\u201d services and applications to their subscribers (mobile device users). Doing so would provide end users with a richer experience and would provide wireless carriers with additional ways of generating revenue. The WAP model, in addition to the above-noted shortcomings, is not well adapted to providing wireless carriers with efficient monetization opportunities. Carriers normally bill subscribers for WAP-based browsing on a per-minute or per-byte basis. This billing structure, combined with low volume of use due to the above-noted problems, translates into relatively low profit margins for wireless carriers.","On the other hand, the short messaging service (SMS) is well-adapted to efficient carrier monetization. SMS is an asynchronous person-to-person messaging protocol, by which users can exchange short messages using mobile devices such as cellular telephones. SMS is well-adapted for carrier monetization, at least partly because the infrastructure for cross-carrier tariffing and monetary settlement already exists and is in use for SMS, i.e., SMS centers (SMSCs) of different carriers are already interconnected for billing purposes. Further, SMS is usually billed on a per-message basis, at a very low rate from the perspective of most users. This billing model is also \u201cdiscrete\u201d for the user; the user is able to predict in advance exactly how much a transaction will cost and knows the unit of billing. The SMS billing model encourages a high volume of use and, therefore, leads to very high profit margins for wireless carriers (typically on the order of 90%).","Further, SMS is asynchronous, in that a user does not have to wait for a response after sending an SMS message. Because SMS is asynchronous, it is also well-adapted to use in the presence of high latency.","What is needed, therefore, is a solution that provides a powerful way for wireless subscribers to publish and access many types of content from their mobile devices, in a manner which is user friendly so as to encourage use, and which provides wireless carriers with an efficient way to derive revenue.","One aspect of the invention is a method which comprises enabling a first user to store a photo in a centrally stored photo archive associated with the first user, by the first user sending the photo in a first MMS message that includes only the photo and a predetermined indicator and that has a telephone number assigned to the first user as a destination telephone number. The method further comprises enabling a second user operating a mobile device on a wireless network to view the photo, by the second user sending from the mobile device a second MMS message that includes only a predetermined indicator and that has the telephone number assigned to the first user as a destination telephone number. In response to which the photo is sent to the mobile device for output to the second user.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","Overview","The solution described herein provides a powerful way for wireless subscribers to publish and access many types of content and to access applications from their mobile devices, in a manner which is user friendly so as to encourage use, and which provides wireless carriers with an efficient way to generate revenue from its use. The solution provides ease of publishing content, while also using an asynchronous person-to-person communication model and providing efficient monetization.","As described further below, the described solution includes a system that enables end users to use multimedia messaging system (MMS) messages to publish and access content, and to invoke applications, from their mobile devices. MMS is a 2.5 G\/3 G messaging system for asynchronous person-to-person messaging, which is based on the SMS standard, but which enables communication over wireless networks of messages containing \u201crich media\u201d content, i.e., content of types that tend to be much more data-intensive than text, such as such as graphics, digital photographs, video, animation, sound files, and\/or audio. The solution described herein is, therefore, particularly well-suited for authoring, publishing and accessing \u201crich media\u201d content from mobile devices. MMS is standardized by the WAP Forum and the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and is described in: \u201cWAP MMS, Architecture Overview,\u201d WAP-205, WAP Forum (Approved Version Apr. 25, 2001); \u201cWAP MMS, Client Transactions Specification,\u201d WAP-206, WAP Forum (Approved Version Jan. 15, 2002); \u201cWAP MMS, Encapsulation Specification,\u201d WAP-209, WAP Forum (Approved Version Jan. 5, 2002); \u201cRequirements\u201d, 3GPP specification 22.140; and \u201cArchitecture and Functionality,\u201d 3GPP specification 23.140.","The solution includes a publishing system based on MMS (the \u201cMMS publishing system\u201d) which is included in, or coupled to, an MMS center (Noise). In certain embodiments, the MMS publishing system includes a management tool, an authoring tool, a storage facility, a message router, and a rendering server. The management tool authenticates a first user who wishes to publish content, by using an MMS telephone number of the user as his user ID. The authoring tool allows the first user to associate rich media content with his MMS telephone number. The content is stored in the storage facility in association with the user's telephone number. A second user wishing to access the first user's content from another mobile device may then send an MMS message with a predetermined indicator to the first user's MMS telephone number. The message router in the MMS publishing system intercepts the MMS message and, based on the fact that the MMS message is directed to the first user's telephone number and includes a predetermined indicator, determines that the MMS message is intended for accessing the first user's published content. In response, the rendering server accesses the previously stored content associated with the telephone number and sends the content to the mobile device of the second user in an MMS message, for output to the second user.","Network Architecture and Usage Model",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","3","2","2","4","4","4","4","5","4","6","6"]},"The user of a first mobile device A which operates on the wireless network A of a first wireless carrier (the \u201coriginating carrier\u201d in this case) may send a standard MMS message to the user of a second mobile device B operating on a wireless network B of another carrier (the \u201cterminating carrier\u201d in this case). The mobile devices  may be, for example, 3G MMS-capable cellular telephones. Operation of the network for purposes of standard MMS messaging is substantially similar to SMS messaging. That is, the MMS message is addressed using the MMS telephone number of the intended recipient (the \u201cdestination telephone number\u201d), which may be simply the telephone number assigned to the recipient's cellular telephone. The MMS message is initially transmitted from the sender's mobile device A over the originating carrier's wireless network A to the originating carrier's MMSC A, then from the originating carrier's MMSC A over the P network  to the terminating carrier's MMSC B, and then from the terminating carrier's MMSC B over the terminating carrier's wireless network B to the recipient's mobile device B.","An MMS publishing system  such as mentioned above is connected to (or included in) the MMSC B of the terminating carrier. In practice, any MMSC  may have an MMS publishing system , since for any given message, an MMSC  may be the originating MMSC, the terminating MMSC, or an intermediary MMSC. Thus, in practice a network configuration may include two or more MMS publishing systems , each connected to a different MMSC .","In the case of standard MMS messaging, the MMS publishing system  need not be used. This standard MMS usage mode can be seen in , in which a first user, \u201cBill\u201d, sends an MMS message  stating, \u201cHey What's UP\u201d to another user, \u201cFred\u201d. In that case, the MMS message  is simply directed through the MMSCs A and B to Fred's mobile device B, where it is displayed to Fred. However, the MMS publishing system  is used for purposes of publishing and\/or accessing content.","Still referring to , assume for example that Fred wishes to publish content, e.g. a combination of text and\/or images like a web page, which Bill can access from a mobile device A whenever Bill wishes. Accordingly, Fred uses the authoring tool  of the MMS publishing system  to create content and place it into network storage . Fred then uses the publishing tool to associate the content with a control character or other type of predetermined indicator, such as the \u201c*\u201d character, and optionally, with one or more keywords. To facilitate description, the predetermined indicator is henceforth assumed to be the \u201c*\u201d character. Bill then can send an MMS request for Fred's stored published content, by sending to Fred's telephone number an MMS message  including the control character, \u201c*\u201d. The \u201c*\u201d character (and any associated keywords) may be placed in any predetermined location of the MMS message , such as in the subject line or in the body of the message. The MMS message  does not need to include anything else (excluding, of course, the standard headers that are automatically added). The MMS publishing system  operated by the terminating MMSC B then intercepts this request , retrieves Fred's content from the content storage  based on the destination (Fred's) telephone number in the request , and returns the content to the mobile device A of Bill, where the content is displayed to Bill.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["7","201","7","3","2","202","206","4","203","7","204","205","3"]},"MMS Publishing System Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["7","7","22","23","25","29","26","27","28","1","2","1","7","31","32","7","1","3","2","7","2","31","33","1","7"]},"In addition, the MMS publishing system may also include elements that are not shown, such as a WAP protocol router, a framework to accommodate various plug-ins to interface with and allow management of vertical applications, a reporting module to report usage of the system, and\/or an operation administration and management (OA&M) module.","When User  wishes to publish content, the management tool  authenticates User  by using an MMS telephone number assigned to User  as User 's user identifier (ID), along with a corresponding password. Once User  is authenticated, the authoring tool  allows User  to upload rich media content to the MMS publishing system  (or configure an application which is published from his telephone number), from User 's desktop PC , mobile device  or other suitable device. The storage server  stores the uploaded content in the storage facility . The content is then logically associated in the storage facility  with User 's MMS telephone number.","Subsequently, when User  wishes to access User 's content from a mobile device , User  sends an MMS message that includes the \u201c*\u201d character to User 's MMS telephone number. The MMS protocol router  in the MMS publishing system  intercepts this MMS message and, based on the fact that the MMS message is directed to the User 's telephone number and includes the \u201c*\u201d character, determines that the MMS message is actually a request for User 's published content, not a user-to-user message. In response to this determination, the rendering server  accesses User 's stored content, renders the content and sends the rendered content to the mobile device  of User  in an MMS message (via the associated wireless networks  and MMSCs ), where the content is ultimately displayed (or output in any other appropriate manner) to User .","Authoring and Publishing Content",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["1","51","1","52","1","28","28","1","1"]},"Once User  is authenticated, the management tool presents User  with a welcome screen , which identifies User 's telephone number and provides User  with various options to access the authoring tool . The options allow User  to publish new content, edit or delete already-published content, or perform other associated operations. For example, the authoring tool  may provide a graphical user interface , from which User  can specify a filename and path name identifying content  (such as an image) stored on his local device, for uploading to the MMS publishing system . User  can also associate a keyword and\/or text (e.g., a title) with the content.","Once the process of uploading and\/or editing is complete, User  is then allowed to preview and edit the content at block . User  can also tailor the content to conform to the form factors (e.g., display size) of standard mobile devices. In response to an MMS message  from User  sent to User 's telephone number, the rendering server  retrieves the stored content  and sends it to the mobile device A of User  in an MMS message.","Certain embodiments of the MMS publishing system  may provide support for \u201crenderlets\u201d. A renderlet is a component provided to end users for inclusion in dynamic MMS messages (DMMs) that they author. The rendering server  includes a runtime (RT) interface  for renderlets, and the authoring tool  includes a design time (DT) interface  for renderlets. The authoring tool  may provide, for example, a drop-down list of renderlets that can be selected by the publisher for inclusion in a given item of content, along with a way to input any parameters required by the selected renderlet(s). The RT interface  into a renderlet can support both graphical output and text-based output where necessary. For example, if a renderlet returns a number, it will be able to return the number optionally in text form or as a generated GIF image.","Three examples of renderlets that can be supported by the MMS publishing system  are a Fetch Image renderlet, a Counter renderlet, and a Date\/Time renderlet. The Fetch Image renderlet returns a graphic image within a predetermined range of dimensions. At design time, the Fetch Image renderlet takes the fully qualified uniform resource locator (URL) to an image as an input parameter, and outputs the image. The counter Renderlet returns a monotonically increasing count of the number of times its instance was invoked. Deleting the counter from an MMS message and \u201csaving\u201d the MMS message, or deleting the MMS message altogether, both result in deleting a particular instance of the counter. The Date\/Time renderlet returns a current date\/time stamp in both graphical and text forms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["7","7"]},"As another example, a restaurant might post a \u201cMMS-enabled\u201d billboard next to a highway. The billboard is MMS-enabled in that it includes the restaurant's telephone number, in association with which the owner of the restaurant has previously published content on the MMS publishing system . Consequently, a passing motorist who observes the billboard and becomes interested in the restaurant can simply send an MMS message from his cellular telephone to the advertised telephone number of the restaurant. In response, the motorist will receive at his cellular telephone the previously published content, which may include, for example, the restaurant's hours, menu, directions, or other useful information designed to entice the motorist into visiting the restaurant.","As yet another example, a young person may publish a party invitation to his friends on the MMS publishing system . Accordingly, anyone who knows his cellular telephone number can view the invitation on his cellular telephone by sending a \u201c*\u201d message to that telephone number. Of course, many other possible use scenarios can be envisioned.","Keywords to Identify Content","As noted above, a publishing user (or \u201cpublisher\u201d) can also associate keywords with content during the authoring\/publishing process. In this way, a publisher can specifically identify and publish multiple independent items of content. In this scenario, as in the above scenarios, the presence of the \u201c*\u201d character in an MMS message indicates that the message is a request for content, rather than a person-to-person message. Further, any characters appended to the \u201c*\u201d character in the MMS message are interpreted as a keyword that specifically identifies the requested content. So for example, Ralph may publish a home page (e.g., his business card) that will be sent to a requester in response to any MMS message sent to Ralph's telephone number that includes only the \u201c*\u201d character. However, Ralph may also publish a second item of content, associated with a keyword. In that case, the second item of content will only be sent to a requester in response to an MMS message sent to Ralph's telephone number that includes the keyword appended to the \u201c*\u201d character.","As a more specific example, Ralph may publish his business card as his home page, by not associating it with any keyword. Ralph may also publish, for example, the game schedule of the high school football team that he coaches, by associating the keyword \u201cfootball\u201d with the game schedule. Ralph also may publish a photo of his most recent vacation by associating the keyword \u201cvacation\u201d with the photo. Accordingly, Ralph's business card will be returned in response to any MMS message that includes only the \u201c*\u201d character, sent to his telephone number. The game schedule will be returned in response to any MMS message that includes \u201c*football\u201d sent to Ralph's telephone number; and, the vacation photo will be returned in response to any MMS message that includes \u201c*vacation\u201d sent to Ralph's telephone number.","Photo Albums","With the functionality described above, the MMS publishing system  also provides an easy way for users to publish albums of digital photographs to other users and to view photo albums of other users. A first user, User , by using a cellular telephone with a built-in camera, can take a photo with that device and send it by message to the MMS publishing system  with a special keyword, such as \u201c*save\u201d. This \u201c*\u201d message causes the photo to be stored in the User 's default photo album in the MMS publishing system . At a later time, a second user, User , can send a \u201c*\u201d message as a browse command to the telephone number of the User , to retrieve and view the photo from the User 's network storage.","The \u201c*save\u201d command (or other similar command) can also be used by User  to upload multiple photos to a photo album. In that event, in response to User  submitting the browse command \u201c*\u201d, the MMS publishing system  may simply return a predetermined number of the stored photos, i.e. the first n photos in User 's album, in the MMS response. The MMS response also indicates how User  can view the remaining photos. For example, assume the MMS response to User  initially includes photos  and  of six photos stored in User 's album. The response may then include text such as, \u201cPhotos - of 6\u201d, and, after displaying photo , the prompt, \u201cSend \u2018*\u2019 to view next photo\u201d.","User  may create multiple photo albums in the MMS publishing system , where each photo album can be identified by a different keyword or keyword suffix (e.g., \u201c*save Hawaii2002\u201d, \u201c*save Europe2003\u201d). In addition, each photo may be associated with an identifier (e.g., \u201cTommy\u201d, \u201cJane\u201d). In case that User 's \u201c*\u201d message includes specific photo identifier(s), only the photo for which there is an identifier in the \u201c*\u201d message is sent to User . Otherwise, all photos associated with User  may be sent to User  in response to User 's \u201c*\u201d message.","Publishing Voice Content","In certain embodiments of the invention, a special MMS telephone number can be set up to allow users to publish voice content or other audio content through the MMS publishing system , via telephone. In such embodiments, a user simply calls a special telephone number associated with the MMS publishing system  from his cellular or wireline telephone and records voice fragments by following a series of prompts and\/or voice menu selections. The voice fragments are associated with the user's own telephone number and a preconfigured keyword during the call (e.g., by using voice commands or DTMF tones) and are thereby stored as that user's content on the MMS publishing system . The voice fragments can then be retrieved by a requesting user via MMS.","Access to Internet-Hosted Content","Published content does not have to be stored locally in the MMS publishing system . The MMS publishing system  may also be used to access published content that is hosted remotely on the Internet or some other network.  illustrates how this may be accomplished. In the illustrated embodiment, the MMS publishing system  is connected (either directly or indirectly) to the Internet . The MMS publishing system  receives an MMS \u201c*\u201d message with a keyword (\u201cdashboard\u201d in the illustrated example) directed to the telephone number of a particular user, for requesting the content. The MMS publishing system  maps the destination telephone number to a target URL associated with a Web server  on the Internet . The MMS publishing system  responds to the request by sending, for example, a standard HTTP 1.1 GET request over the Internet  to the Web server . The keyword is passed to the Web server  as a parameter of the target URL in the GET request, as shown. The request may be \u201cstateful\u201d, such that it may include one or more cookies used by the target application on the Web server . In addition, the request may include a client certificate, which can be used in conjunction with a secure protocol, such as secure HTTP (HTTPS), effectively to authenticate the carrier. The MMS publishing system  may also provide access control and authentication services, as described further below.","Managing Session State","Typical messaging-oriented applications are stateless from message to message. In contrast, Web based (e.g. HTTP based) applications typically manage state via a client side cookie cache. The MMS publishing system  described herein can be used to manage session state for purposes of accessing content and applications. For example, the MMS publishing system  can be used to store and manage cookies from applications, on behalf of clients , as shown in .","Business Model","The above described solution is advantageous to wireless carriers from a business standpoint, because they can use it to generate revenue using existing SMS\/MMS-based billing methods and infrastructure. This business aspect is discussed further now with reference to .  illustrates the business model for conventional WAP-based publishing of content to mobile devices. The WAP business model is essentially a carrier-to-Internet model. The wireless carrier provides a low-cost, high quality of service (QOS) Internet \u201con-ramp\u201d. Content is unbundled from the network, so that the inter-carrier tariff and settlement structure  for voice calls, SMS\/MMS, etc. is completely bypassed for purposes of content publishing. Most value in content requests is serviced on a public, cost-free network, i.e., the Internet . Further, content is more easily reachable from non-carrier-bound clients, such as desktop PCs. Internet based entities (as opposed to wireless carriers) determine content availability. Furthermore, the business model is at risk from disruptive on-ramp technology, such as WiFi.","In contrast,  illustrates an example of a business model for content publishing, according to the MMS-based messaging solution introduced herein. In this model, the clients and the content are integrated into the cross-carrier network. Content is explicitly authored to conform to mobile device form factors, and the carriers subsidize content publishing and content availability. The carriers' namespaces (i.e., telephone numbers) are used to index content. The inter-carrier SMS\/MMS request tariff provides for cross-carrier settlement of tarrifs for content requests. Further, this business model is robust against changing on-ramp technology, such as WiFi.","Application Services","The MMS messaging based solution introduced herein can be employed beyond just for publishing and accessing content, to allow mobile users to access other types of application services. When using this solution to access application services, an end-user telephone number (the destination telephone number) can effectively be an application address. An example of such application services is location services, which provide a mobile user with his current location, the current location of another mobile user, and\/or the location of some other entity. Other examples of application services that can be accessed include obtaining stock quotes; obtaining current weather conditions; an electronic invitation (evite)-like application that manages an RSVP list of telephone numbers; or, corporate publishing where an employee is able to have his calendar published to a keyword for retrieval via MMS; etc. Such applications may be hosted by the user's wireless carrier, remotely on the Internet, or on some other network.","So for example, through use of the MMS publishing system , a mobile user might access location services to locate his friend, another mobile user, by sending a message including \u201c*find\u201d to his friend's mobile telephone number. Similarly, he might obtain a map of his own area by sending a \u201c*find\u201d message to his own mobile telephone number. Or, he might obtain a map to a particular business entity by sending the same type of message to a mobile telephone number assigned to the business. Further, the user might obtain a map showing the closest instance of a particular type of business, identified by a keyword, by sending a \u201c*\u201d message of the format \u201c*Find[keyword] to his mobile directory assistance telephone number (e.g., 411). Hence, by using the solution described herein, an end-user telephone number (the destination telephone number) can effectively be an application address.","Security for Application Services","The solution introduced herein inherently also provides strong protection against fraudulent or unauthorized use. Current mobile data application services based on WAP use Web-style authentication mechanisms, in which an end-user is given an ID originating from a given Web server\/service. That approach has several weaknesses. First, it involves weak, nontransferable client-side authentication (a client ID is not very easy to use across multiple sites). Second, little or no infrastructure exists to allow federated assignment or revocation of transferable user IDs across multiple sites. Third, the server-side authentication is very weak. The primary proof one has that one is talking to a given server is the domain name service (DNS) address visible in the browser address bar and\/or the certificate mapping to the DNS name. Fourth, the \u201cquality\u201d across the network for ID issuance is extremely variable. It is extremely difficult to programmatically safeguard against the difference in ID issuance security for to users with the same username and different domains, e.g., bilig@yahoo.com versus billg@msn.com. Fifth, significant processing resources must be devoted to evaluating credentials within a given application. Significant code within each application must be written to respond to authentication scenarios (e.g., password issuance, recovery, bad passwords, denial of service attacks on password forms).","In contrast, with the solution described herein, the identity of a requester, publisher or hosted application is always tied to a valid telephone number of an end user. There is a large body of existing convention regarding the \u201cquality\u201d of a telephone number as an ID, its strengths, and its spoof-proofing. It is practically impossible to impersonate someone else's telephone number and to receive telephone calls intended for that person. Wireless carriers already know how to federate and manage the ID space between them, and they adhere to conventions for managing risk relating to issuance of telephone numbers.","When a consumer buys a cellular telephone or cellular telephone service plan, he is assigned a valid telephone number for use with a particular cellular telephone. Normally, as part of the process of signing up for the service plan, the consumer must provide his name and address in writing along with proof of identity and must be approved through a credit check process. Only then is the consumer assigned a telephone number and the service plan activated. The consumer thus becomes registered with the wireless carrier in association with the assigned telephone number and a particular cellular telephone.","Thus, with the solution described herein, both the client and the server are a priori authenticated in a very strong manner before an application is ever invoked. Consequently, telephone numbers (both the source and destination numbers) act as a strong authentication handle with the solution described herein. When a consumer sends a \u201c*\u201d message from his MMS client, his telephone number is normally added to the message as a header by his carrier's MMSC and can be read by a receiving device. Likewise, a telephone number used to publish content or to host an application inherently provides the wireless carrier (and, therefore, the requester) with a high degree of confidence that the publisher or application host is who he\/it purports to be.","If a remote application has its own authentication database, it can set up a relatively secure identity mapping between a telephone number and its own authorization database. For example, if Bank of America has a customer with the userID, \u201cFred\u201d, and it knows that Fred has a certain telephone number, then Bank of America can now trust telephone number assertions for a given wireless carrier.","Thus, using this solution, access control lists (ACLs) can be set up and maintained within the MMS publishing system , to control access to published content and\/or applications. The ACLs can be such that the MMS publishing system  can be used to control access to applications (which may be hosted locally, on the Internet, or elsewhere), without revealing client identities to those applications.","This approach is in contrast with standard Web applications, where the ACL is normally managed within the application being invoked, and the client must provide some type of credentials to the application for evaluation. The standard Web technique, therefore, has the disadvantage that even if the credentials are not recognized by the called application, they can be appropriated by the application and can be used to violate the user's privacy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["7","101","7","100","101","7","7","101","101","102","101","103"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["7","3","1101","7","3","7","1102","7","1109","1103","7","1104","7","1110","1105","7","7","1106","1107","3","1108"]},"Messaging Hyperlinks","It may be desirable to incorporate hyperlinks into content accessed using the MMS messaging based techniques described above. So for example, if a user requests and receives the home page of a favorite restaurant via MMS, that home page can include hyperlinks to a separate menu page, a directions page, a business hours page, etc.  shows an example illustrating how this may be accomplished.","Initially a user of a mobile device  requests and receives an MMS page , which in this example is the home page  of a restaurant. The home page lists several hyperlinks to other pages. Rather than standard HTTP links, however, the links are MMS-type links which each include one or more keywords identifying the target of the link. For example, to access the business hours page, the link may have the following format, where the keyword is \u201chours\u201d and 555.555.1212 is the restaurant's MMS telephone number:\n\n<a href = MMS:\/\/555.555.1212\/*hours> <li> hours<\/> <\/>\n","Assume, therefore, that the user then scrolls down and selects the \u201cHours\u201d link Invoking the link causes a preaddressed and precomposed \u201c*\u201d message  to be generated, which the user can send in the standard MMS way. Note that visibility of this page aids discoverability of the keyword namespace. The consumer knows that a new message results in a new charge. The consumer subsequently receives the response message , from the MMS publishing system , containing the restaurant's business hours.","Messaging Forms","It may also be desirable to use forms in conjunction with the MMS based messaging techniques described above. Accordingly, a mechanism is needed for naming a form and its corresponding form handler in the MMS publishing system . A keyword can be used for this purpose, which may be in the format, \u201c*Form [keyword]\u201d. This approach is illustrated in . Note that in conventional HTML, a URL would normally be used to name a form.","An approach similar to that used for MMS hyperlinks can be used. Referring to , assume that a user using a mobile device  initially requests and receives a restaurant's \u201creservations\u201d form , by sending a \u201c*\u201d message  with a keyword, such as \u201creserve\u201d. The MMS client in the mobile device  allows the user to fill the form in within the context of the user's MMS Inbox. The user can keep this form  in his Inbox to create a reservation sometime in future, and he can forward the form  via MMS to friends for their use. It can be seen, therefore, that an instance of an MMS-based form can have a much longer lifespan in the network than its responding form handier (e.g., an old version of the form may be forwarded amongst people, stored in inboxes, etc.). Consequently, a mechanism to handle versioning should be provided, as described below.","After entering data into the form , the user submits the form  back to the MMS publishing system  as an MMS message . In the submitted message , the data entered into the form are specified as simple key-value pairs. The submitted message  also includes a page identifier (\u201creserv\u201d in this example) to match the data to a form handler, and a page version identifier (\u201c01ae3\u201d in this example) to match the version of the form in the mobile device with the form handler.","As an extension of this approach, messaging forms can also be used in e-mail by using a similar header.","Client-Side Address Book Features","The MMS client software in a cellular telephone or other mobile device can be configured to enhance the user's experience when using the system. For example, the client software in such mobile devices generally includes an address book from which the user can initiate a call. Accordingly, to allow easier navigation to published content, an option can be provided within the address book of the mobile device, to allow a user to directly request a published page from the address book. So, as shown in the example of , while viewing the address book  the requesting user can simply highlight the name of a contact who has published content, which causes one or more menu items  to appear, e.g., \u201cCall\u201d, \u201cSend Message\u201d, and \u201cHome Page\u201d. The user's selecting the \u201cHome Page\u201d option automatically causes a \u201c*\u201d message  to be generated, addressed to the telephone number of the addressee, which can be sent by the user to request the published content .","As shown in , the address book  in a mobile device  may also provide the user with direct access to published pages that have been previously \u201cdiscovered\u201d, either automatically or by the user. In a similar manner to that shown in , a list  of discovered pages may be associated with each entry in the address book . Selecting one of the entries in the address book  causes a list  of any discovered pages associated with that entry to be displayed. Selecting one of the discovered pages from the list  then automatically causes a request  for that page (\u201c*\u201d message) to be generated, where the destination telephone number and any keyword(s) are automatically inserted by the MMS client. The discovered pages may include published pages that have been automatically discovered by the mobile device and\/or by the MMS publishing system. The discovered pages may also include pages from a \u201crecently-requested\u201d cache (e.g., the MMS client simply remembers the last n pages requested), and\/or they may have been explicitly saved by the user as \u201cfavorites\u201d or \u201cbookmarks\u201d.","Web Services","Web Services Hosted at an End User Telephone Number","The MMS based messaging solution introduced herein can also be used to host Web services at the telephone number of an end-user. The term \u201cWeb services\u201d describes a standardized way of allowing different applications operated by different entities to communicate with each other in a distributed environment, typically over the Internet. Web services involves one application invoking another, rather than an end user invoking an application. Through Web services, applications can share business logic, data and processes through a programmatic interface across a network.","To access Web services using the MMS based solution, a calling application simply \u201clogs in\u201d as a \u201cconsumer\u201d into the MMSC of the originating carrier and submits a \u201c*\u201d message via MM7 (MMS). Some authentication mechanism may be provided to authenticate the calling application. A Web services request may be distinguished from other types of \u201c*\u201d messages by, for example, including a particular keyword in the message, such as \u201c*API GetLocation\u201d. Using this approach, MMS is essentially used as a \u201ctunnel\u201d for application program interface (API) invocations. The body of the \u201c*\u201d message includes the actual parameters of the API call. An example of such a \u201c*\u201d message is as follows, where 555-1212 is the destination telephone number, and the application being called is a location application:","<to>555-1212<\/to>","<body>","*API GetLocation","<\/body>","The source telephone number is then added to the \u201c*\u201d message by the originating MMSC, such that the \u201c*\u201d message in the above example has the form, where 333-6767 is the source telephone number:","<to>555-1212<\/to>","<from>333-6767<\/from>","<body>","*API GetLocation","<\/body>","Hence, strong, carrier-guaranteed, dual-party authentication is inherent in this approach.","The MMS publishing system  at the terminating carrier may include a mechanism for a person to publish his own Web services APIs that can take advantage of the above-described capabilities.","Consider the following example, in which a credit card issuer (e.g., a bank) uses Web services along with the solution described herein, to determine whether to authorize charges requested against one of its issued credit cards. When a credit card purchase is attempted at a merchant location, the card issuer may wish to determine if the purchase is actually being attempted by consumer to whom the card is issued (the legitimate cardholder), before approving the charges. If the legitimate cardholder is not located at the location of the merchant when the charges are requested, this could indicate a fraudulent attempt to use the credit card, triggering a higher level of scrutiny.","Hence, when charges are requested on the credit card, an authorization\/verification application operated by the card issuer automatically sends a \u201c*\u201d message to the mobile telephone number of the legitimate cardholder, which is stored in a database of the card issuer. The \u201c*\u201d message represents an application programming interface (API) call to a remote location application. The MMS publishing system  detects this API call and invokes the location application on behalf of the calling application. The location application returns the current location of the mobile device of the cardholder, which the MMS publishing system  returns to the calling application in an MMS message. Based on the indicated location, the calling application (operated by the card issuer) determines whether the legitimate cardholder is located at the merchant location.","Note that a conventional, consumer-centric Web service invocation (i.e., without using the solution described herein) requires identification\/addressing and security for three different parties: 1) the Web service requestor (e.g., the credit card issuer in the above example); 2) the service access point (e.g., api.sprint.com); and 3) the end user in relation to whom the Web service is being requested (e.g., the cardholder). It can be seen, therefore, that the end user's phone number to which a Web services \u201c*\u201d message is addressed implicitly specifies a particular service access point. Consequently, addressing requirements for a single Web service invocation are simplified using the solution described above, compared to conventional consumer-centric Web services.","Inter-Carrier Messaging to Reconcile Chargebacks for Web Services","The inter-carrier messaging infrastructure for SMS\/MMS can also be used to reconcile chargebacks for Web services. Current Web services models for mobile networks do not have a specified billing model for service invocations. In addition, there is no model in place that allows for revenue sharing between the network supporting the Web service invoker and the network supporting the called Web service. In contrast, the solution described herein layers Web service API invocations on MMS messages dispatched between carriers, to trigger billing events and cross-carrier settlement.","Inter-Carrier Messaging to Provide Cross-Carrier Web Services Connectivity","The inter-carrier SMS\/MMS infrastructure also allows Web services connectivity between different wireless carriers. Current Web services models for wireless networks require a specific binding to a service access point for a given user at a given carrier. That approach has the problem of being extremely unwieldy, from a business and technical perspective, for allowing rendezvous between a Web service provider and a user. For example, in the conventional model, in order for an application provider to invoke an API against a user hosted at Carrier A, that application provider must have some binding directly to Carrier A. If another user is hosted at Carrier B, a new binding to Carrier B must also be created. Consequently, the network never achieves \u201ccritical mass\u201d, i.e., the network never achieves cross-connections between users and Web service providers sufficient to stimulate a significant market.","In contrast, the solution described herein uses MMS inter-carrier transport and telephone number addressing to provide content providers with a single service access point, which can reach any user hosted at any member carrier. As a result, a Web service requester bound to one carrier can use the MMS inter-carrier network to invoke services for a user hosted on a different network.","Processing System Architecture","It will be apparent from the preceding discussion that the techniques introduced above can be implemented in software, which can be executed in processing systems that have conventional hardware. Hence, each of the processing systems described above (the mobile devices , the MMS publishing system , etc.) can be conventional in terms of its hardware. Alternatively, the techniques described above can be implemented in circuitry specially designed for such purposes, or in a combination of specially-designed circuitry with software executed by conventional hardware.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16"]},"The processing system shown in  includes one or more processors , i.e. a central processing unit (CPU), read-only memory (ROM) , and random access memory (RAM) , each connected to a bus system .
