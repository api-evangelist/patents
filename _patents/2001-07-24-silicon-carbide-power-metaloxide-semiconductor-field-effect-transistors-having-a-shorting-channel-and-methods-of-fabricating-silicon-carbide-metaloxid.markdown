The government may have certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and the fabrication of semiconductor devices and more particularly, to silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide semiconductor transistors (MOSFETs) and the fabrication of such MOSFETs.","To make a high current, high voltage, low on-resistance, vertical SiC power MOSFET has, so far, been impractical, at least in part, due to the poor surface mobility of electrons in the inversion layer. Recently, some processing techniques have been developed on a lateral MOSFET structure, which result in an improved surface electron mobility. However, a power MOSFET structure may involve additional processing including, for example, anneals at temperatures of greater than 1500\u00b0 C. for the activation of p-type dopants, for example, p-well\/p+ contact\/p-Junction Termination Extension (JTE) implants. Such anneals may have detrimental impact on the performance of power MOSFETs fabricated using such techniques.","A number of silicon carbide power MOSFET structures have been described in the literature.

These structures are shown in , B, C and D. With the Trench MOSFET illustrated in , however, it may be difficult to achieve a high breakdown voltage and a reproducible high inversion layer mobility along the sidewalls of the trench. Consequently, the on-resistance may become very high, which may render the structure impractical. The lateral DMOSFET, illustrated in , may suffer from high electric field in the gate oxide and higher on-resistance as compared to the vertical DIMOSFET for a given breakdown voltage.","The vertical DIMOSFET structure, illustrated in , is a variation of the Diffused (DMOSFET) structure employed in silicon technology. Typically, the p-wells are implanted with Al or Boron, the source regions (n) are implanted with nitrogen or phosphorus, and the p regions are usually implanted with Al. The implants are activated at temperatures between 1400\u00b0 C.-1700\u00b0 C. The contacts to n layers are made with nickel (Ni) and annealed and the contacts to p are made by Ni, Ti or Ti\/Al. Both contacts are annealed at high temperatures. The gate dielectric is, typically, either thermally grown (Thermal SiO) or deposited using Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) technique and subsequently annealed in various ambients. The deposited dielectric may be SiOor an Oxide\/Nitride\/Oxide (ONO) stack. One difficulty with the DIMOSFET structure may be the poor mobility of inversion layer electrons, which can result in a very high on-resistance. The cause of such a problem has been attributed to a high density of interface states near the conduction band edge as shown in FIG. . See R. Schorner, P. Friedrichs, D. Peters, and D. Stephani, \u201cSignificantly Improved Performance of MOSFETs on Silicon Carbide using the 15R\u2014SiC Polytype,\u201d IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 20, No. 5, pp. 241-244, May 1999.","The interface states near the conduction band edge tend to trap the otherwise free electrons from the inversion layer leaving a relatively small number of free electrons in the inversion layer. Also the trapped electrons may create negatively charged states at the interface which coulomb scatter the free electrons. The reduced number of free electrons and the increased scattering may reduce the conduction of current from source to drain, which may result in low effective mobility of electrons and a high on-resistance. Several factors have been attributed to the high density of states near the conduction band edge: (1) carbon or silicon dangling bonds, (2) carbon clusters, and (3) Si\u2014Si bonds creating a thin amorphous silicon layer at the interface. See S. T. Pantelides, \u201cAtomic Scale Engineering of SiC Dielectric Interfaces,\u201d DARPA\/MTO High Power and ONR Power Switching MURI Reviews, Rosslyn, Va., Aug. 10-12, 1999 and V. V. Afanas'ev, M. Bassler, G. Pensl, and M. Schulz, \u201cIntrinsic SiC\/SiOInterface States,\u201d Phys. Stat. Sol. (a), Vol. 162, pp. 321-337, 1997.","In addition to the high density of interface states, several other mechanisms have also been attributed to the poor mobility of inversion layer electrons: (1) Al segregating out of the Al-doped, p-type SiC, and (2) Surface roughness created by the high temperature activation of implanted impurities. See S. Sridevan, P. K. McLarty, and B. J. Baliga, \u201cOn the Presence of Aluminum in Thermally Grown Oxides on 6H-Silicon Carbide,\u201d IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 17, No. 3, pp. 136-138, March 1996 and M. A. Capano, S. Ryu, J. A. Cooper, Jr., M. R. Melloch, K. Rottner, S. Karlsson, N. Nordell, A. Powell, and D. E. Walker, Jr., \u201cSurface Roughening in Ion Implanted 4H-Silicon Carbide,\u201d Journal of Electronic Materials, Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 214-218, March, 1999. Researchers from Purdue University have concluded that a direct correlation exists between the inversion layer electron mobility and the implant activation temperature. Such research has concluded that lower implant activation temperature (1200\u00b0 C.) leads to higher electron mobility and higher activation temperature (1400\u00b0 C.) results in poor electron mobility. See M. K. Das, J. A. Cooper, Jr., M. R. Melloch, and M. A. Capano, \u201cInversion Channel Mobility in 4H\u2014 and 6H\u2014SiC MOSFETs,\u201d IEEE Semiconductor Interface Specialists Conference, San Diego, Calif., Dec. 3-5, 1998. These results have been obtained on planar MOSFETs (FIG. ), which do not utilize an implantation of the p-well. The p-well implanted impurity (Al or Boron) typically requires at least a 1500\u00b0 C. activation temperature.","The so-called \u201cACCUFET\u201d structure is shown in FIG. . It results in high electron mobility due to conduction across an accumulation layer instead of an inversion layer. In this structure, the p-well is implanted using Al in such a manner so as to leave a thin unimplanted n-type surface layer. This n-type layer is fully depleted due to the built-in voltage of the pn junction. However, the implant activation temperature is typically limited to 1400\u00b0 C. to avoid surface roughness as indicated before. The doping of the remaining n-layer is the same as the doping of the grown n-type layer. This structure has shown high electron mobility in 6H\u2014SiC but very poor electron mobility in 4H\u2014SiC.","Sridevan and Alok have reported high electron mobility in 4H\u2014SiC in a planar MOSFET on a p-type epitaxial layer (p-epi).

Egloff, \u201cProcess Dependence of Inversion Layer Mobility in 4H\u2014SiC Devices,\u201d Materials Science Forum Vols. 338-342, pp. 1077-1080, 2000. However, this is not a high voltage power MOSFET structure. By using p-epi, the problems associated with p-well activation and resulting surface roughness may potentially be avoided. A deposited oxide was used and the activation temperature of nitrogen implants for the source and drain regions kept to a minimum (1250\u00b0 C.) to avoid surface roughness. The contacts to the source and drain regions were not annealed in order to protect the gate oxide\/SiC interface. The high electron mobility has been attributed to the special wet anneal of the deposited SiOlayer. This anneal was done at 1100\u00b0 C. in Nbubbled through de-ionized (DI) water at 98\u00b0 C. for 400 min, followed by an in situ Ar anneal at 1100\u00b0 C. for 60 min, followed by a 950\u00b0 C. wet Nanneal for 60 min. The anneal was performed to densify the deposited oxide and reduce the interface state density. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from reproducibility. Several groups, including researches at Rensealar Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Purdue University, and Cree, Inc. have been unsuccessful in their attempts to duplicate this result.","Another method that has been reported as showing promise is the counter-doping method. K. Ueno and Tadaaki Oikawa, \u201cCounter-Doped MOSFET's of 4H\u2014SiC,\u201d IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 20, No. 12, pp. 624-626, December 1999. Again, this technique has been implemented on planar MOSFETs without the p-well implant. This is not a high voltage power MOSFET structure. By using p-epi, the problems associated with p-well activation and resulting surface roughness may be avoided. In the counter-doping method, a thin layer of n-type impurity such as Nitrogen is implanted between the source and drain. The implant is activated at a low temperature (1300\u00b0 C.) to avoid surface roughness. The doping density of the n-type region can be controlled by controlling the dose and energy of the n-type implant. By relaxing the surface field with this implant, higher channel mobilities have been reported.","Recently, annealing of a thermal oxide in a nitric oxide (NO) ambient has shown promise in a planar 4H\u2014SiC MOSFET structure not requiring a p-well implant.

This anneal is shown to significantly reduce the interface state density near the conduction band edge. G. Y. Chung, C. C. Tin, J. R. Williams, K. McDonald, M. Di Ventra, S. T. Pantelides, L. C.

High electron mobility (35-95 cm\/Vs) is obtained in the surface inversion layer due to the improved MOS interface.","Unfortunately, NO is a health hazard having a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) health danger rating of 3, and the equipment in which post-oxidation anneals are typically performed is open to the atmosphere of the cleanroom. They are often exhausted, but the danger of exceeding a safe level of NO contamination in the room is not negligible.","Growing the oxide in NO is possible. J. P. Xu, P. T. Lai, C. L. Chan, B. Li, and Y. C. Cheng, \u201cImproved Performance and Reliability of NO-Grown Oxynitride on 6H\u2014SiC,\u201d IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. 21, No. 6, pp. 298-300, June 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. Post-growth nitridation of the oxide on 6H\u2014SiC in NO at a temperature of 1100\u00b0 C. has also been investigated by Lai et al. P. T. Lai, Supratic Chakraborty, C. L. Chan, and Y. C. Cheng, \u201cEffects of nitridation and annealing on interface properties of thermally oxidized SiO\/SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor system,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 76, No. 25, pp. 3744-3746, June 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. However, Lai et al. concluded that such treatment deteriorates the interface quality which may be improved with a subsequent wet or dry anneal in Owhich may repair the damage induced by nitridation in NO. Moreover, even with a subsequent Oanneal, Lai et al. did not see any significant reduction in interface state density as compared to the case without nitridation in NO. However, this work utilized 6H\u2014SiC and it is not clear whether it would work on 4H\u2014SiC, since many improvements to 6H\u2014SiC MOSFETs have not previously resulted in any significant improvement in 4H\u2014SiC MOSFETs.","Embodiments of the present invention provide silicon carbide metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and methods of fabricating silicon carbide MOSFETs having an n-type silicon carbide drift layer, spaced apart p-type silicon carbide regions within the drift layer and having n-type silicon carbide regions therein, and an oxide layer on the drift layer.

Furthermore, the layer of n-type silicon carbide may be a silicon carbide substrate.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, implanting p-type impurities, implanting n-type impurities to provide first regions of n-type silicon carbide and implanting n-type impurities to provide second regions of n-type silicon carbide may be provided by patterning a first mask on the layer of n-type silicon carbide, the first mask having openings corresponding to the first regions of p-type silicon carbide so as to expose portions of the layer of n-type silicon carbide. Then p-type impurities (preferably, aluminum) are implanted into the layer of n-type silicon carbide utilizing the first mask and the layer of n-type silicon carbide and the first regions of p-type silicon carbide annealed at a temperature of at least about 1500\u00b0 C. An epitaxial layer of silicon carbide is then grown on the layer of n-type silicon carbide and the first regions of p-type silicon carbide. A second mask is patterned on the layer of n-type silicon carbide. The second mask has openings corresponding to the second regions of n-type silicon carbide so as to expose portions of the first regions of p-type silicon carbide. N-type impurities are implanted into the epitaxial layer n-type silicon carbide utilizing the second mask. A third mask is patterned on the layer of n-type silicon carbide. The third mask has openings corresponding to the first regions of n-type silicon carbide and exposes portions of the first regions of p-type silicon carbide. N-type impurities are implanted into the first regions of p-type silicon carbide and the epitaxial layer of silicon carbide utilizing the third mask. The oxide layer is patterned on the epitaxial layer, the first regions of n-type silicon carbide and the second regions of n-type silicon carbide to provide a gate oxide.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the step of growing an epitaxial layer of silicon carbide is provided by growing an undoped epitaxial layer of silicon carbide. In still further embodiments of the present invention, the step of growing an epitaxial layer of silicon carbide is provided by growing an epitaxial layer of silicon carbide having a sheet charge of less than about 10cm. Furthermore, the epitaxial layer of silicon carbide may be grown to a thickness of from about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 1 \u03bcm. Preferably, the epitaxial layer of silicon carbide is grown to thickness of from about 1000 to about 5000 \u212b.","In additional embodiments of the present invention, the step of annealing is preceded patterning a fourth mask, the fourth mask being on the layer of n-type silicon carbide and the first regions of p-type silicon carbide and having opening therein corresponding to second regions of p-type silicon carbide disposed in respective ones of the first regions of p-type silicon carbide the second regions of silicon carbide being adjacent the first regions of n-type silicon carbide and opposite the second regions of n-type silicon carbide. P-type impurities are implanted utilizing the fourth mask so that the second regions of p-type silicon carbide have a carrier concentration greater than the carrier concentration of the first regions of silicon carbide. Furthermore, windows may be formed in the epitaxial layer positioned to expose the second regions of p-type silicon carbide First source contacts may also be formed within the window on the second regions of p-type silicon carbide. Second source contacts may be formed on the first source contacts and the first regions of n-type silicon carbide.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. As illustrated in the Figures, the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures of the present invention. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present.","Embodiments of the present invention provide silicon carbide MOSFETs and\/or methods of fabricating silicon carbide MOSFETs which may reduce the performance degradation of the device as a result of the interface between SiC and the oxide of the MOSFET. As is clear from the previous discussion, in conventional devices utilizing conventional fabrication techniques, the interface between SiC and SiOmay be of insufficient quality to provide high surface mobility of electrons in 4H\u2014SiC. While the inventors do not wish to be bound by any theory of operation, it has been proposed that the reduced electron mobility may be due to a high density of interface traps or due to a rough interface resulting in surface potential fluctuations or both. The rough interface is schematically shown in  high degree of roughness may lead to a discontinuous inversion layer of electrons and hence poor effective mobility. This is especially true when the implanted p-well has been annealed at temperatures in excess of 1500\u00b0 C.","MOSFETs according to embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in FIG. . As seen in , in particular embodiments of the present invention, a lightly doped n drift layer  of silicon carbide is on a n layer  of silicon carbide. The n drift layer  may be a substrate or an epitaxial layer of silicon carbide and is preferably 4H polytype silicon carbide. Preferably, the n drift layer  has a carrier concentration of from about 10to about 10cm. Furthermore, the n layer  may be an implanted layer or region or an epitaxial layer. The n layer preferably has a carrier concentration of from about 10to about 10cm.","As is further seen in , spaced apart regions of p-type silicon carbide provide p-wells  in the n drift layer . The p-wells  are, preferably, implanted with Al and annealed at a temperature of at least about 1500\u00b0 C. The p-wells  may have carrier concentrations of from about 1\u00d710to about 2\u00d710cmand may extend into the n drift layer  from about 0.1 \u03bcm to about 3 \u03bcm. While various p-type dopants may be utilized, Al is preferred over Boron as the dopant of the p-wells  because Boron tends to diffuse over several microns when annealed at temperatures exceeding 1500\u00b0 C. Therefore, it may be difficult to control the precise gap between the p-wells  (the region which may be referred to as the JFET region ). If this gap is too high, the field in the gate oxide can become too high when the device is in the blocking state. However, if the gap is too narrow, the resistance of the JFET region  may become very high. Accordingly, gaps of from about 1 \u03bcm to about 10 \u03bcm are preferred. The particular gap utilized for a given device may depend upon the desired blocking voltage and on-state resistance of the device.","Regions of n silicon carbide  and, optionally, regions of p silicon carbide  are disposed within the p-wells . The regions of n silicon carbide  are preferably spaced from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm from the edge of the p-wells  adjacent the JFET region . The optional regions of p silicon carbide  are preferably adjacent the regions of n silicon carbide  and opposite the edge of the p-wells . A thin layer of n-type silicon carbide, such as a layer doped with an n-type impurity such as nitrogen or phosphorus with a preselected dose, extends from the regions of n silicon carbide  to the JFET region of the n drift layer  adjacent the gate oxide  to provide shorting channels . The shorting channels  may be implanted within the p-well and activated at a temperature of at least about 1500\u00b0 C. along with the p-well activation. Preferably, the shorting channels  extend into the p-wells  to a depth of from about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 1 \u03bcm. The doping of the shorting channels  may depend on the depth of the layer, the work function of the material for the gate contact  and the doping of the p-wells  as described below with reference to . However, in general, the shorting channels  may have a sheet charge of less than about 10cm. It is also preferable to implant the n-type impurity for the shorting channels  after implanting the Al for the p-wells  using the same mask to avoid having to realign the mask such that the shorting channels  are self-aligned with the p-wells . As described above, it is preferred that the shorting channels  not extend into the JFET region because extending such layers into the JFET region may increase the electric field in the oxide when the device is in the blocking state.","The gate oxide  extends at least between the n regions of silicon carbide  and is preferably either a thermally grown oxide with an NO or NO anneal or Oxide\/Nitride\/Oxide (ONO) where the first oxide is a thermal oxide followed by an NO or NO anneal. The gate contact material may be any suitable contact material, however, p-type polysilicon may be preferred because of its high work function. The thickness of the gate oxide  may depend on the work function of the material of the gate contact . However, in general, thicknesses of from about 100 \u212b to about 5000 \u212b are preferred.","One or more source contacts  and a drain contact  are also provided. Source contacts , are preferably formed of nickel (Ni) and may be annealed at temperatures of from about 600\u00b0 C. to about 1000\u00b0 C., for example, 825\u00b0 C., so as to provide an ohmic contact to both the p regions  and the n regions . The drain contact  may also be Ni or other such suitable material for forming an ohmic contact to n-type silicon carbide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["27","20","12","26","27","24","27","27","27","27","26","27","27","27","27"],"sup":["+","13 ","\u22122 ","16 "]},"As is further seen in , because of the regrown silicon carbide layer , a contact window is provided through the silicon carbide layer  to provide a contact \u2032 to the optional p regions  or to the p-wells  if the p regions  are not present. The contact \u2032 may be made of any suitable material for forming an ohmic contact to p-type silicon carbide, however, nickel is preferred.","While  illustrate embodiments of the present invention as discrete devices, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art,  may be considered unit cells of devices having multiple cells. Thus, for example, additional unit cells may be incorporated into the devices illustrated in  by dividing the device along its central axis (illustrated as the vertical axis in ) and rotating the divided device about an axis of the periphery of the devices illustrated in  (the vertical edges of the devices illustrated in FIGS.  and ).

As seen in , a mask  is formed and patterned on the n-type layer  and impurities implanted into the n-type layer  to provide the p-wells . Preferably, the impurities are Al implanted to the depths described above and to provide the desired carrier concentrations when activated. After formation of the p-wells , an n-type implant  is performed utilizing the mask , see FIG. B. Suitable impurities for implantation of the n-type layer include nitrogen and phosphorous. Such impurities are implanted to provide the shorting channel depth and carrier concentrations described herein. An example of one suitable composite doping profile of the p-wells  and the n-type implant  is seen in FIG. . After implantation of both the p-wells and the n-type layer , the resulting structure is heated to a temperature of at least about 1500\u00b0 C. and maintained at that temperature for a time of from about 30 seconds to about 60 minutes to activate the implanted impurities. Alternatively, such anneal may be carried out after implanting the n regions , the p regions  and the backside implant as seen in FIG. E.","As is seen in , the mask  is removed and a mask  is formed and patterned and n-type impurities are implanted utilizing the mask  to provide the n regions .

In forming the shorting channels  and \u2032, the dose and energy of the n-type impurity is preferably controlled so as to make the device normally off at zero gate bias. This can be done because there is self-depletion of the shallow n-type layer from the built-in voltage of the pn junction, the work function difference of the gate metal and the SiC, and the net charge in the oxide and the interface states. However, care should be taken so that the n-layer is not completely depleted by the buried pn junction. This ensures the existence of a bulk channel under the thin accumulation layer. The width of this bulk channel increases with positive gate biases until an accumulation layer is formed at the MOS interface, as shown in .

The high work function gate metal and thinner gate dielectric can deplete more charge under the MOS gate at zero gate bias, which turns into a bulk channel with more free carriers at a positive gate bias (see FIG. A). However, providing shorting channels alone may be insufficient to achieve very high effective channel mobilities because the number of free electrons in the bulk channel is very limited. However, shorting channels in combination with a reduction in surface state density, preferably to less than about 10evcmfor within about 0.4 eV of the conduction band energy for 4H polytype silicon carbide, to reduce surface scattering of the carriers may provide very high effective channel mobilities.","The on-state I-V characteristics of a device according to embodiments of the present invention are shown in FIG. . The device was a 3.3 mm by 3.3 mm 4HSiC power MOSFET. As seen in , 10 A of current is obtained for a 4.4 V forward drop. This device is normally-on at V=0 V due to the relatively high dose of Nitrogen implanted in the p-well. However, the device can be made normally-off by reducing this dose. The electron mobility vs. gate voltage for a 100 \u03bcm by 100 \u03bcm MOSFET according to embodiments of the present invention is shown in FIG. . In the low field regime, extremely high mobility (approaching bulk value) is obtained due to the buried nature of the channel.
