title: Audio/Video monitoring service using set-top boxes and application servers
abstract: An audio/video monitoring system is disclosed, comprising a combination of one or more set-top boxes and application servers in a service provider's network. The set-top boxes and applications services are part of a multiple services operator's (MSO) network, such as that of a cable company. Cameras and/or microphones which are directly connected to a set-top box are the sources of media signals, which the set-top box transmits to an application server. The application server continually receives the media signals from one or more set-top boxes, and determines which subset of the received media signals to forward to a selected output device, such as a television connected to another set-top box or a cellular telephone. The application server then forwards media signals of interest to the output device, such as when motion or a loud noise is detected in a media signal received from the set-top box or boxes.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to telecommunications in general, and, more particularly, to audio and\/or video monitoring based upon one or more set-top boxes and application servers.","Open Cable Application Platform (OCAP) is a standardized software environment, which has been developed to encourage compatibility and reduce hardware and\/or software costs. OCAP comprises a set of application programming interfaces (API), which is middleware that provides an operating system for the application programs themselves. The API's comprise Java software packages that provide program access to basic system resources. An OCAP-compliant application program can thus run on any OCAP compatible devices to access network services and multimedia content, among other functions. The OCAP middleware enables the development of software to provide new features and services, and also enables third-party developers to develop those new features and services.","Because OCAP facilitates \u201cwrite once, use anywhere\u201d application software, OCAP enables Multiple Services Operators (MSO) to design and deploy a variety of new interactive communications services. The MSOs include cable companies, as well as other service operators who might or might not be offering cable service to their subscribers. Generally-speaking, the MSOs are working to transform their business models from those which are dominated by basic subscriptions and equipment lease to those which are dominated by a customer service-driven model. One of the reasons for this is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and upheld court challenge that the MSOs adopt OCAP and that set-top boxes be open to new uses.","In addition to OCAP, set-top boxes (STB) are other enablers of new features and services. STBs have evolved over time, from a relatively simple switching device to what is essentially a special-purpose computer, comprising impressive storage capability, multimedia encoding and decoding capability, and processing power. For example, more advanced STBs have digital video recorder capability, based on hard-disk drives or flash memory, which provide gigabytes of available storage. The advanced audio and video codecs present in some STBs are designed to handle the requirements of High-Definition Television (HDTV). And processors such as the Broadcom BCM7118 provide over 1000 DMIPS of processing power, which can be used to support OCAP and new customer applications, as well as other enablers of new STB-based features and services.","All of these technologies set the stage for a greatly-enhanced, multimedia, customer communication experience. Indeed, telephony-based services have already been proposed, which use network-based application servers, at which telephone and set-top box association can be performed and administered. Similarly, personalized information for the display of financial data, home security information, and so forth is also known.","The present invention enables an audio\/video monitoring system, without some of the disadvantages that are known in the prior art. Although monitoring systems exist in the prior art, these prior-art systems often lack the level of integration and security provided in accordance with the illustrative embodiment of the present invention.","In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, a combination of one or more set-top boxes and application servers in a service provider's network are configured to provide an audio and video monitoring service for a customer of that service provider. The set-top boxes and applications services are part of a multiple services operator's (MSO) network, such as that of a cable company. Cameras and\/or microphones which are connected to a set-top box are the sources of media signals, which the set-top box transmits to an application server. Meanwhile, the application server continually receives the media signals from one or more set-top boxes, and determines which subset of the received media signals to forward to a selected output device, such as a television connected to another set-top box, a cellular telephone, and so forth. The application server then forwards selected media signals of interest to the output device, such as when a change is detected in a media signal received from the set-top box or boxes. Such a detected change might be the presence of motion in a signal conveying video or a loud noise in a signal conveying audio.","In a first illustrative application, the monitoring service can be used to monitor a sleeping infant in one room equipped with a microphone connected to a first set-top box. The audio, or video for that matter, is provided to the infant's parent or caregiver through an output device in the parent's vicinity. The parent can be in the same house listening to the cable provider's music programming, in another room equipped with a second set-top box. Alternatively, the parent can be at the next-door neighbor's house watching television on a third set-top box. Another possibility is that the parent is in the yard, carrying a cell phone or other type of output device. When motion or a loud noise is detected in the media signal received from the set-top box connected to the baby monitor, the service can forward the signal of interest to the parent's output device.","In a second illustrative application, a safety security service can use the monitoring service of the illustrative embodiment to monitor houses within a neighborhood or buildings belonging to a business by using cameras connected to set-top boxes in the structures being monitored. When motion or a loud noise is detected in the media signal received from one or more of the set-top boxes, the service can notify the owner of the particular home or dwelling, or a security guard who can then investigate further.","Advantageously, the monitoring service of the illustrative embodiment is enabled by the Open Cable Application Platform (OCAP) standardized software environment that is conducive to the design and implementation of the service described herein. Additionally, relatively recent advances in set-top box design not only enable the features of the illustrative embodiment, but also ensure computing security in the sense that eavesdroppers would find it difficult to hijack the media signals of the monitoring service, because of systems such as Polycipher Downloadable Conditional Access Security, or \u201cDCAS.\u201d","The illustrative embodiment of the present invention comprises: receiving, at a server: i) a first identifier of an input device, the input device being situated at a first customer premises equipment location and being capable of generating a first media signal, ii) a second identifier of an output device, the output device being capable of presenting the first media signal to a user, and iii) a trigger condition for evaluating the first media signal, the server being situated at a location that is different from the first customer premises equipment location; receiving, at the server, the first media signal originating at the input device represented by the first identifier; and when the trigger condition is met, transmitting the first media signal to the output device represented by the second identifier.","For the purpose of this Specification and the appended Claims, the term \u201ccustomer premises equipment\u201d (CPE), as well as its inflected forms, refers to terminal equipment such as a set-top box, associated equipment, and inside wiring that are located on a subscriber's premises (i.e., physical location such as a house or office building), rather than on the service provider's premises or in between, and connected to a carrier's bearer channel. The physical location at which a CPE is situated is referred to as the \u201cCPE location\u201d of that CPE. One or more set-top boxes can be situated at a CPE location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","1","101","102","103","104","1","104","105","106","107","108","109","1","109","100"]},"CPE -, wherein m has a value between 1 and M inclusive, comprises one or more set-top boxes, as well as associated equipment and inside wiring.

An input device is capable of generating a media signal which conveys content (e.g., audio, video, etc.), where the generated media signal is provided to one or more of application servers - through -N via network .","CPE - through -M are connected to bearer network , which distributes signals received from head-end system  to the set-top boxes that are part of each CPE, and provides signals received from those set-top boxes such as media signals which convey audio and\/or video content, to head-end system . Network  comprises a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable.","Head-end system  drives bearer network  in distributing media signals that are to be presented to a subscriber by CPE -. System  receives media signals from application servers - through -N. System  also receives media signals from set-top box -and provides those signals to one or more of application servers - through -N. Specifically, set-top boxes - through -M, bearer network , head-end system , and application servers - through -N constitute multiple services operator (MSO) network . The term \u201cmultiple services operator\u201d refers to a service provider that provides multiple services such as voice (mobile and landline), data, and video. MSO network  belongs to a cable company that provides additional services than cable television, such as the monitoring service described herein; however, in some alternative embodiments MSO  can belong to another type of MSO, as those who are skilled in the art will appreciate.","In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, head-end system  also transmits media signals to other endpoints, such as those which are situated within Internet network  and in Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) , which are well-known in the art. Media signals transmitted to an endpoint in network  are handled via gateway , and media signals transmitted to an endpoint in PSTN  are handled via gateway , in well-known fashion. As those who are skilled in the art will appreciate, in some alternative embodiments application servers - through -N transmit signals to gateways  and  directly.","Application server -, wherein n has a value between 1 and N inclusive, is a data-processing system that receives control messages and media signals from CPE -and distributes those media signals, in accordance with the illustrative embodiment of the present invention. For example, a camera that is part of CPE - can originate video signals which are continually forwarded to application server -; the server then determines which subset of those video signals are to be forwarded to a display-capable device, such as terminal -, in accordance with the illustrative embodiment. Server -is described below and with respect to .","Telecommunications terminals - through -P, wherein p has a value between 1 and P inclusive, are at least some of the possible output devices of the illustrative embodiment. An output device is capable of both receiving a media signal which conveys monitored content and presenting that content (e.g., audio, video, etc.) to a user.

However, it will be clear to those skilled in the art, after reading this specification, how to make and use output devices that are situated elsewhere within telecommunications network , such as office desksets or web browsers associated with Internet network , or video monitors within one or more of CPE - through -M.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","101","201","202","203","204","205"],"i":["m ","m "]},"Set-top box  is essentially a special-purpose computer for the handling of media information at an endpoint in network . The components of box  are further described below and with respect to . Box  is connected to video monitor  and loudspeaker  for the purpose of presenting video and\/or audio content received by the set-top box from a content source such as application server -. In some embodiments, video monitor  and loudspeaker  are integrated into a single device, such as a television set. In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, box  is also connected to one or more monitoring devices, such as video camera  and microphone , for the purpose of receiving media signals from these monitoring devices. In some embodiments, video camera  and microphone  are integrated into a single device. Besides the monitoring functions described with this specification, set-top box  can also be used for other functions associated with presenting content via a television, such as a cable tuner function and a digital video recorder (DVR) function.","Although set-top box  is depicted as being connected to all of video monitor , loudspeaker , camera , and microphone , in some alternative embodiments box  might be connected to a different configuration of input and output devices, as those who are skilled in the art will appreciate.

The infant is in a first room of a house with a camera connected to a first set-top box (i.e., box -), and the parent is in a second room watching television on a television set connected to a second set-top box (i.e., box -).","It will be clear to those skilled in the art, after reading this specification, how to apply the embodiments of the present invention to other monitoring scenarios. For example, the infant-monitoring scenario can be modified such that the parent is outside the house in the yard with a cell phone handy, or is watching television at a neighbor's house on a television set connected to a third set-top box (i.e., box -). In a different scenario entirely, instead of an infant being monitored, it might be a business building that is being monitored for security purposes by the business' owner, or the owner's surveillance service which is using the monitoring service of the illustrative embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"At task , a user of the monitoring service of the illustrative embodiment initiates the setup of the service. For example, by accessing set-top box - with a remote control, where the set-top box is connected to a television, the user is able to configure which input devices (e.g., camera connected to box -, etc.) are possibly going to provide media signals which convey monitoring content. Additionally, the user is able to configure which output devices (e.g., television connected to set-top box -, standalone video monitor, user's cell phone, etc.) are possibly going to receive and present media signals which convey monitoring content. An input device can be situated at any customer premises equipment location that has connectivity with the application server providing the monitoring service. Each output device might be directly connected to a set-top box, as part of the customer premises equipment, or might be separate and distinct from any customer premises equipment. Although in this example the user initiates setup through set-top box -, the user could alternatively initiate setup through another set-top box.","At task , set-top box - receives commands from the user, which specify which input devices and output devices are to be configured into the monitoring service. Set-top box - maps the user-selected devices into identifiers, and transmits the identifiers to the application server that is assigned to support the monitoring services on behalf of the particular user-server -, for example.","At task , application server - receives the identifiers of the configured input and output devices from set-top box -.","At task , server - configures information regarding the monitoring-service devices. For example, configuration can include mapping or translating one or more identifiers of the output devices into destination addresses that are recognizable throughout telecommunications network , such as a telephone number or an Internet Protocol (IP) address.","At task , server - transmits an acknowledgment back to set-top box -.","At task , set-top box - presents an acknowledgment to the user, who receives the acknowledgment at task .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},"At task , the user specifies the relevant parameters for the particular use-case being invoked. A use-case is distinguished from initial setup, in that invoking a new or stored use-case might be done fairly often, while initiating setup might be done only once or relatively infrequently. Furthermore, although all of the possible input and output devices might be specified at initial setup, the specific input and output devices that apply to a particular use-case might be specified when a new use-case is created.","By accessing set-top box - with a remote control, for example, the user is able to specify i) the particular trigger conditions (e.g., motion detected by the camera connected to box -, sound level of a microphone exceeding a threshold, etc.) that will cause application server - to forward the media signals of interest to an output device and ii) the output device or devices that are to receive the media signals of interest. Additionally, the user might specify one or more input devices associated with one or more set-top boxes that will be providing media signals to application server -. Although in this example the user invokes the use-case through set-top box -, the user could alternatively invoke the use-case through another set-top box.","In the pedagogical example of the parent monitoring her infant, the parent user specifies the microphone associated with set-top box - as the input device, the trigger condition of a sound level or pattern having been detected that correlates to stirring or crying on the part of the infant, and the television at set-top box - as the output device.","At task , set-top box - receives commands from the user, which specify the information entered by the user at task . Set-top box - transmits the parameters (e.g., trigger conditions, output devices, etc.) to assigned application server -.","At task , application server - receives the user-specified trigger conditions and selected devices from set-top box -.","At task , server - establishes the conditions in which to forward received media signals to the selected output device or devices, in accordance with the illustrative embodiment. For example, for a media signal conveying audio content, server - might establish a particular signal level threshold based on what was specified by the user, wherein a trigger condition is met when the threshold is exceeded. Trigger conditions might also be based on calendrical time such as time of day, day of the week, calendar date, and so forth, such that different thresholds are used at different times. Additionally, the particular output device to receive the forwarded media signals might be based on calendrical time as well, such that the user's television is provided with the media signals during a first time interval, while the user's cell phone is provided with the media signals during a second time interval.","In accordance with the illustrative embodiment, when there are two or more input devices specified, server - can establish different conditions for each source. For example, for media signals conveying video content, a higher threshold of motion might be applied to a camera monitoring a room with motion already present in the background, such as from an electric fan, while a lower threshold of motion might be applied to a camera monitoring a room where nothing should be in motion during the monitoring interval.","At task , server - transmits an acknowledgment back to set-top box -. In some embodiments, server - commands the set-top boxes with the selected input devices (e.g., the camera at box -, etc.) to start transmitting the media signals; the server does so either at a specified time or immediately.","At task , set-top box - presents an acknowledgment to the user, who receives the acknowledgment at task .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"At task , set-top box - transmits media signals from the input device (i.e., microphone monitoring the infant) to application server -.","At task , server - receives the media signals.","At task , server - evaluates the media signals that it receives against one or more trigger conditions, and determines whether a trigger condition established at task  has been met. If a condition has been met, task execution proceeds to task . If not, server - continues to receive media signals and to determine whether a trigger condition has been met with respect to the additional media signals received. In some alternative embodiments, set-top box - performs tasks  and  instead of server -, which in no way changes the desired function of the system, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.","At task , server - selects the particular output device to which to send the media signal of interest. The output device might be a single output device specified by the user (i.e., the television being watched by the parent and connected to box -) or it might be one of several possible output devices, where the particular device selected is based on calendrical time or on another property.","In the scenario presented, the user specifies the valid output device or devices for the particular use-case created, and server - selects the particular output device from the group of valid devices specified by the user. However, as those who are skilled in the art will appreciate after reading this specification, the particular output device selected can be based on the geo-location of the user. Techniques for determining the geo-location of the user are well-known in the art; server - can use one or more of these techniques to determine the user's geo-location, in order to select the particular device nearest to the user.","At task , server - transmits the media signal of interest to the selected output device. The destination address used for routing the media signal might be within the address space of MSO network , which is a part of telecommunications network , or the destination address might be within another address space (e.g., telephone number, Internet Protocol number, etc.).","In some alternative embodiments, server - transmits to the output device a representative message or signal, either instead of or addition to the media signal itself. For example, a text message that reads \u201cMotion detected in Room A\u201d or \u201cBaby is crying\u201d can be transmitted to the output device and then presented to the user.","In some other alternative embodiments, server - transmits to the output device an indication for the output device to preempt the presentation of whatever content was being presented to the user. For example, if the user is watching television programming through set-top box -, when server - detects a loud signal in the media signals that it is receiving from box -, server - can indicate to box - to mute the audio of the television programming and instead the audio received from box - (monitoring the infant) to the user. Alternatively, the set-top box (box - in this case) can determine whether to preempt the audio or not.","As those who are skilled in the art will appreciate, the preemption of one signal with another can apply to video as well, in that some or all of the video screen can be borrowed from the ongoing video, in order to present the video received from the monitoring source such as set-top box -.","At task , the output device presents the media signal to the user.","It is to be understood that the disclosure teaches just one example of the illustrative embodiment and that many variations of the invention can easily be devised by those skilled in the art after reading this disclosure and that the scope of the present invention is to be determined by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","100"],"i":"m "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["201","101"],"i":"m.
