No. 10\/655,152, entitled Communication System Having a Community Wireless Local Area Network for Voice and High Speed Data Communication, filed Sep. 3, 2003, now abandoned which is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/342,591 entitled Communication System Having a Community Wireless Local Area Network for Voice and High Speed Data Communication, filed Jan. 14, 2003, now abandoned which claims the priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/353,815, entitled Communication System Having a Community Wireless Local Area Network for Voice and High Speed Data Communication, filed Jan. 31, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and more particularly to a communication system including a community Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) to provide voice and data communication between a number of user equipment terminals and a public network via the community WLAN, and a method for using the same.","The use of communication networks and devices, including telephones, pagers, facsimile machines, computers and network access appliances, has increased exponentially in recent years. In many areas and communities, this increased demand for voice and data communication services has outpaced the growth in the public infrastructure required to support these services.","One possible solution to the above problem is the use of conventional public or private wireless networks. However, this approach is not wholly satisfactory for a number of reasons. A fundamental drawback to the use of conventional wireless networks is the cost associated with radios or user equipment terminals (UEs) capable of communicating with conventional GSM (Global Systems for Mobile communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) or 3G (third generation cellular) wireless networks. Although the expense of these UEs is generally not borne by a service provider of a wireless network providing voice and\/or data communication to a community, it will be appreciated that higher costs translates to fewer potential subscribers. Thus, it is less likely the service provider would be willing to bear the expense of installing necessary base stations and switching centers in the community.","Another problem in areas or communities that are under served by an existing wireless network, is the difficulty and expense of scaling the network to provide services to additional users or additional services. For example, the typical approach used by wireless network service providers to provide increased capacity, is to install additional base stations and switching centers. As noted above, due to the expense this is unacceptable in certain rural or impoverished areas and communities. Moreover, this is also unacceptable in many developed and urban areas, where overcrowding of the licensed frequency bands leads to diminishing increases in capacity for additional base stations and switching centers due to interference with overlapping base stations.","Accordingly, there is a need for an inexpensive communication system and method of operating the same, that are capable of providing voice and high speed data communication to users in communities hitherto un-served or under served by conventional communication systems. There is a further need for a communication system and method of operating the same that can be quickly and inexpensively scaled up to provide service to increasing numbers of users. There is a still further need for a communication system and method of operating the same that provides a high capacity for voice and data communication.","The system and method of the present invention provides these and other advantages over the prior art.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a communication system having capable of providing high capacity voice and high speed data communication between a number of user equipment terminals (UEs) and a public network via a community Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).","In one aspect the invention is directed to a communication system for providing voice and data communication between a public network and a number of UEs.

Preferably, the CBTS and RTSs are adapted to communicate using GSM technology at a frequency band within (ETSI) specification. More preferably, the CBTS and RTSs are adapted to communicate using GSM technology at a frequency band of at least about 3.5 Ghz.","In another aspect, the invention is directed to a transceiver station for use in a communication system. Generally, the transceiver station includes an antenna, a Global Systems for Mobile communication (GSM) transceiver, and a frequency converter coupled between the GSM transceiver to enable communication using GSM technology at a frequency above conventional GSM frequency bands. Preferably, the transceiver station is adapted to communicate using GSM technology at a frequency band within (ETSI) specification. More preferably, the transceiver station is adapted to communicate using GSM technology at a frequency band of at least about 3.5 Ghz.","In one embodiment, the GSM transceiver is a GSM\/General Packet Radio Service (GSM\/GPRS) transceiver, and the transceiver station is adapted to communicate data as well as voice.","In yet another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of providing voice and data communication between a number of UEs and a public network, using a communication system including a community WLAN. Generally, the method includes steps of: (i) receiving call information in the community WLAN; (ii) providing subscriber identification and security information for the UE to the community WLAN; and (iii) coupling the UE to the public network over the community WLAN.","In one embodiment, the public network includes a public switched telephone network and the Internet, and the step of coupling the UE to the public network involves coupling the CBTS to the public network via a trunk. Alternatively, the CBTS may be coupled to the public network via a satellite link or other public wireless network.","In another embodiment, the CBTS and each RTS includes a Global Systems for Mobile communication\/General Packet Radio Service (GSM\/GPRS) transceiver, and the step of coupling the UE to the public network is accomplished by coupling the CBTS to the RTS using a GSM standard to provide data communication between the public network and the UEs. In one version of this embodiment, the CBTS and each RTS further includes a WLAN transceiver, and the step of coupling the UE to the public network involves coupling the CBTS to the RTS using a WLAN standard to provide voice communication between the public network and the UEs. Preferably the WLAN standard is an open standard protocol, such as the HIgh Performance Local Area Network (HiperLAN\/1) standard, the HiperLAN\/2 standard, or an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.11 (IEEE 802.11) standard.","In yet another embodiment, the CBTS and each of the RTSs includes a frequency converter, and the step of coupling the UE to the public network includes the step of up-converting a frequency of a signal generated in at least one of the GSM\/GPRS and the WLAN transceivers to couple the CBTS to the RTS via a radio signal at a frequency above a standard GSM frequency band of 900 Mhz.

More preferably, the step of up-converting the frequency of the signal involves up-converting the frequency of the signal to a frequency band of at least about 3.5 Ghz.","Advantages of the apparatus and method of the present invention include: low cost to manufacture and install; high speed transmission of data, up to 54 to 100 Mbps; high capacity for voice and data communication; and easy scalability since, an 802.11 based WLAN, for example, permits up to 256 RTSs per CBTS.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide a communication system that bridges the gap between an existing public network and WLANs to provide authentication and roaming capabilities of the former with the high-speed and high-bandwidth of the latter.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a communication system in which a UE terminal of a WLAN operating in an unregulated frequency band is able to access a public network, such as a public switched telephone network, a public GSM cellular network, public 3G network, or the Internet, and\/or a private network, such as a private cellular network, a campus or enterprise 3G network, or a private branch exchange (PBX) with a functionality and capabilities similar to those available from mobile stations of more expensive GSM cellular networks and 3G cellular networks.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a communication system in which GSM\/GPRS\/3G broadband services are provided using WLAN broadband technology and in particular using 802.11 based technology.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to communication system which enables a user to access a public network through low powered unregulated user equipment terminals (UEs) or transceivers.

Optionally, the communication system further includes a private cellular network coupled to the WLAN to facilitate communication between the UEs and mobile stations associated with the private cellular network.","In one embodiment, the communication system further comprises a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server to authenticate UEs accessing the communication system through the WLAN and to authorize access to the communication system. Where the communication system includes multiple linked WLANs, a home location registry (HLR), including, for example, a home location register and\/or a home subscription sever, and visitor location registry (VLR) coupled to the RADIUS server provide roaming capabilities for the UEs among the plurality of WLANs.","In another embodiment, the UE includes a computer program to enable it to access and control supplementary services and\/or value-added services provided by the public and\/or private network.

For example, a European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standard for Broadband Radio Access Networks (BRAN), such as a high performance local area network (HiperLAN\/1), HiperLAN\/2, or a high performance Metropolitan Access Network (HiperMAN). Other examples, include Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.11 standards (IEEE 802.11), such as 802.11(a) and 802.11(b).","A communication system according to the present invention is particularly useful to operators of hotels, hotel chains, airports, airport building maintenance, and other like enterprises for deployment of in-building broadband RF services, or for users of UEs with e-mail messaging capabilities.","In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of enabling a number of UEs to communicate with a public network and\/or private network via the WLAN.

Each of the UEs  within a particular site  can be directly connected to the RTS  through a dedicated connection, or can be connected through a local area network (LAN ), such as an Ethernet, 100Base T, Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet, at the site.","In a preferred embodiment, the community WLAN  further includes a private home location registry\/authentication server (HLR\/AuC ) coupled to the CBTS  for recording and storing information relating to users or subscribers of the community WLAN. In operation, a RTS  or a UE  first introduced into an area served by the community WLAN  must provide authentication or authorization information to the HLR\/AuC . Generally, the authentication\/authorization is provided in a manner similar to that of a Global Systems for Mobile communication (GSM) mobile station in a conventional GSM wireless network. There are several are several ways of accomplishing this: (i) each UE  can be provided with a subscriber identity module (SIM) cards similar to those cards commonly found in GSM mobile stations; (ii) each RTS  can be provided with a number of SIM cards which it can associate with the UEs  on a permanent or temporary basis; or (iii) each RTS can be coupled to a memory system in which is stored subscriber identification and security information that constitutes a virtual SIM (VSIM), described in greater detail in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/002,551, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Use of the HLR\/AuC  and SIMs enables generation and recording of call detail records (CDRs) for billing purposes, facilitates incoming communication from the public network , and allows communication between UEs  at different sites  with the community WLAN  service area.","Optionally, the community WLAN  also include a visitor location registry (VLR) (not shown) to maintain subscriber information for visitors or roamers to the cell or area served by the community WLAN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","114","110","112","108","130","132"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","114","110","112","134"]},"The major components of the community WLAN , that is the CBTS  and the RTSs , will now be described in greater detail with reference to .","Referring to , preferably the CBTS  is a complete stand-alone Network-In-a-Box (NIB), such as a WAVEXpress NIB platform, commercially available from Interwave Communications, of Menlo Park, Calif.

Preferably, the","frequency of the signal is up-converted to a frequency band within the specification developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) for GSM communication. More preferably, the frequency of the signal is up-converted to a frequency band of at least about 3.5 Ghz.","Referring to , the RTSs  generally include: (i) a power supply ; (ii) at least one GSM\/GPRS transceiver ; (iii) a WLAN transceiver ; (iv) a frequency converter ; and (v) an antenna . Additionally, depending on the UEs  coupled to a particular RTS  and the manner in which they are coupled, the RTS can further include a number of interfaces or modules (not shown) for interfacing with the UEs. Such interfaces can include for example, TCP\/IP interfaces, ethernet interfaces and SCSI interfaces.","A process or method for operating communication system  according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to .  is a flowchart showing an embodiment of a method for providing voice and data communication between the UEs  and the public network  via the community WLAN .

A frequency of signals generated in at least one of the transceivers in the CBTS  and the RTS  is up-converted to couple the CBTS to the RTS via a radio signal at a frequency above the standard GSM frequency band (step ), and the UE  is coupled to the public network  over the community WLAN  (step ).","In another aspect, the invention is directed to a communication system and method for enabling UEs associated with a WLAN to communicate with a public network.","A communication system according to the present invention will now be described with reference to .  is an exemplary block diagram of a communication system having a WLAN coupled to a public network including a GSM network and a 3G network according to an embodiment of the present invention. For purposes of clarity, many of the details of communication systems and in particular of GSM networks and 3G-networks that are widely known and are not relevant to the present invention have been omitted.","Referring to , the communication system  generally comprises a public core network or public network  including a public cellular network  with connections to a PSTN  and the Internet . The public cellular network  can include a GSM  network for communicating with public MSs  and a 3G-network , such as a 3G-UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications system), for communicating with public UEs .

Access points (not shown in this figure) of the WLAN  can be coupled to the NIB  through a wired local area network (LAN ), such as an Ethernet, 100Base T, Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet, or through a wireless or radio-link (not shown). One advantage of the communication system  of the present invention is the ability to enable communication between the public network  and less expensive, low-power, unregulated private UEs  while providing substantially the same functions and services available from much more expensive radios, MSs  or UEs  of the public cellular network  and\/or private cellular network .","It will be understood, that the communication system  can include a number of private cellular networks , each with an associated WLAN , and each linked by a private wide area network (PWAN) (not shown) to provide wireless or cellular type communication via a WLAN over an extended service area.

Alternatively, the SIM  encompasses subscriber identification and security information stored in a memory system (not shown) of the private UE . This latter version has the advantage of enabling the SIM  to be downloaded from the WLAN  along with computer software or programs that enable the private UE  to emulate or function as a communication terminal.

Identity modules and virtual identifiers and described in greater detail in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/002,551, filed Nov. 1, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference. Generally, the virtual identifiers include algorithms and a key to support authentication and encryption necessary to facilitate communication with the public network  or private cellular network .

Alternatively, the virtual identifiers can be associated with the private UEs  on a many-to-one basis to provide a single private UE with multiple different user profiles that can be selected by a user for record or billing purposes. For example, a user placing a call from a private UE  over the public cellular network  could enter a first code selecting a first user profile when the call is for business purposes, and a second when the call is for private purposes. In addition, the communication system  or the user can select a GSM-type SIM identifier (virtual SIM) when the communication is over the GSM network , and a 3G-type USIM identifier (virtual USIM) when it is connected or routed over the 3G network .","Preferably, the SIM  or identity module , and programs or software in the private UE  that allow it to emulate a communication terminal, are also adapted to enable the private UE to control or access supplementary and\/or value added services provided by the private cellular network  or public network  service provider.

These standards serve to ensure the interoperability of wireless communications equipment operating in the same spectrum but manufactured by different manufacturers. In particular, BRAN is a set of communication standards for Broadband Radio Access Networks developed by ETSI in response to growing market pressure for low-cost, high capacity radio link, and is used chiefly in European countries. BRAN provides broadband wireless access at a rate of 25 Mbit\/s or more to networks or WLANs operating in either licensed or license exempt spectrum. IEEE 802.11 standards are a similar set of WLAN standards. There are two types of HiperLAN: (i) HiperLAN\/1, which provides communications at up to about 20 Megabytes Per Second (Mbps) in the 5 GHz band; and (ii) HiperLAN\/2, which provides communications at up to 54 Mbps in the same band. HiperMAN is a similar standard used for systems serving a metropolitan area. Although, HiperMAN is generally used in larger communication systems that could be defined as a wireless metropolitan area network, rather than a WLAN, it will be appreciated that the principles of the present invention can be applied to such a communication system. Accordingly, it will be understood that as used herein the term WLAN refers to both wireless local area networks and a wireless metropolitan area networks. IEEE 802.11 refers to a line of related specifications or standards developed by the IEEE for wireless communication, including 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.1x. 802.11 is similar to HiperLAN and applies to WLANs having from 1 or 2 Mbps transmission rates in the 2.4 GHz band using either frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) or direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). 802.11a is an extension to 802.11 that applies to WLANs, provides up to 54 Mbps in the 5 GHz band, and uses an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing encoding scheme rather than FHSS or DSSS. 802.11b, also known as 802.11 High Rate or WiFi, is another extension that provides up to 11 Mbps transmission rates in the 2.4 GHz band, allowing wireless functionality comparable to Ethernet. Thus, 802.11b is particularly useful interfacing with or coupling to GPRS systems according to the present invention for wireless transmission of data. 802.11g applies to WLANs and provides greater than 20 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band.","In still another embodiment, the WLAN  is further coupled to the Internet  through a firewall , to enable the private UE  to transfer video and audio data, and\/or to transfer or download large files or attachments to or from other data processing systems or servers. Preferably, the private UE  is adapted to enable a user to simultaneously carry on communication, for example voice communication, with a telephone or terminal in the private cellular network  or public network , and communication, for example data communication, with a terminal coupled to the Internet . More preferably, the private UE  includes a computer program to simultaneously enable voice over an internet protocol network communication (VoIP), with a telephone or terminal (not shown) coupled to the Internet , WLAN , LAN  or another IP network. The VoIP program can include a standard VoIP program native to the private UE , which comes standard on many computers and portable computers, or a VoIP program included with computer software or programs downloaded from the WLAN , such as the virtual SIM or emulator program, as described above.","In still another embodiment, computers or terminals  coupled to the NIB , through the LAN , are also adapted to communicate voice and data with telephones or terminals in the public cellular network  and\/or private cellular network  via the NIB  and the interface functions or links from the NIB to the public and private cellular networks , .","An embodiment of the communication system  of the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to . Referring to , the public network  includes a public HLR\/VLR  coupled to the GSM network  and the 3G-network . The public HLR of the HLR\/VLR , can include, for example, a home location register and\/or a home subscription sever HSS, and records and stores information relating to users or subscribers of the public network. The VLR of the HLR\/VLR  maintains subscriber information for visitors or roamers to the cells or area served by the public cellular network . Generally, the HLR\/VLR  also includes an authentication and accounting server or function (not shown) used by many service providers to authorize access to the public GSM network  and\/or the public 3G-network .","The GSM network  includes a gateway mobile services switching center (GMSC ) coupled to the PSTN  through a landline or trunk , and to the HLR\/VLR  through a C interface or link . The GMSC  is a gateway switching center or exchange that directs or routes calls from the PSTN  to the MSs , and from the MS to the PSTN. A third generation mobile services switching center (3G-MSC ) coupled to the HLR  through a D interface or link  provides switching services and co-ordination between mobile stations  in the GSM network  and public UEs  in the 3G network . Optionally, the 3G-MSC  also include another or second VLR to maintain subscriber information for visitors or roamers to the cells or area served by the 3G-MSC. The 3G-MSC  also couples to one or more MSCs , only one of which is shown, through an E interface or link . As with the 3G-MSC , the MSC  can also include a VLR to maintain subscriber information for visitors or roamers to the cell or area served by the MSC. The MSC  in turn couples through an A interface or link  to one or more BSC , each of which controls one or more BTS  through an Abis interface or link . The MSC  also couples to the private cellular network  through a private A-link intelligent multiplexor interface function or link (PALIM ). PALIM functions or links are described detail in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,818,824, 5,734,699, 5,999,813 and 6,212,395, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","In the embodiment shown, the 3G-network  includes a third-generation gateway GPRS support node (3G-GGSN ) coupled to the Internet  through a Gi interface or link , and to the HLR  through a Gc interface or link . The 3G-GGSN  provides an interface between the 3G cellular network  and an IP network, such as the Internet . A third generation serving GPRS support node (3G-SGSN ) coupled to the HLR  through a Gr interface or link  and to the 3G-MSC  through a Gi link , handles data traffic in an area served by the 3G cellular network . Optionally, the 3G-SGSN  is further coupled to a local, second generation (2G) or GPRS SGSN  through a Gn interface or link  to provide an interface between the 3G cellular network  and the WLAN . The 3G-SGSN  also couples to one or more 3G radio network controllers (3G-RNC ), only one of which is shown, through an Iu-PS interface or link . Each 3G-RNC  controls one or more Node Bs  through an Iub interface or link . The 3G-RNC  also couples to the 3G-MSC  through an Iu-CS interface or link  to provide communication between the public UEs  and the MSs  of the GSM network  or telephones (not shown) connected to the PSTN .","As shown in , and as noted above, the WLAN  can include one or more separate and discrete networks or access points A, B, C, each using a number of different protocols including HiperLAN, HiperMAN and 802.11, as described above. The particular network or protocol used in the WLAN  can be selected based on factors including cost, desired bandwidth or bit-rate, or required range, frequency and regulatory limitations. For example, a communication system  in Europe or other states or nations adopting the HiperLAN standards might use the HiperLAN\/1 or HiperLAN\/2 standard depending on the desired bit-rate, while systems in the United States might use one of the 802.11 standards. Communication systems  serving a metropolitan area or requiring a higher capacity or bandwidth might use the HiperMAN standard.","As also shown in , the WLAN  can be coupled to the Internet  and to a number of different components in the GSM network  and\/or the 3G-network . For example, in the 3G-network  the WLAN  can be coupled to the 3G-GGSN  through the NIB  and via an IuPSWLAN interface or link , the GPRS SGSN  via an IuPSWLAN interface or link , the 3G-RNC  via an IubisWLAN interface or link , and\/or to one or more Node Bs  via a NodeBWLAN interface or link . In the GSM network  the WLAN  can be coupled to the BTS  via a BTSWLAN interface or link , to the BSC  via an AbisWLAN interface or link , and\/or to the MSC  via an AWLAN interface or link . In addition, the WLAN  can be coupled to the MSC  through the NIB  and over the PALIM link , described above.","It will be understood that where the WLAN  includes multiple separate networks or access points A, B, C, which may or may not use different protocols, each of the separate access points can be coupled through the NIB  to different components in the public network . For example, it might be desirable to couple an access point C using an 802.11b standard for high speed transmission of data to the GPRS SGSN .","In yet another embodiment, the communication system  further includes a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) system , having a RADIUS authentication and accounting gateway or server . The RADIUS system can be combined with the NIB , as shown, or can comprise a standalone RADIUS server  separate and distinct from the NIB. RADIUS is an authentication and accounting system used by many service providers to authorize access to a communication system. Though not an official standard, the RADIUS specification is maintained by a working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Generally, RADIUS requires users to enter a username and password, which is passed to the RADIUS server  to check that the information is correct, and authorize access to the communication system . A separate authentication\/authorization server (not shown in this figure) within the RADIUS system  or coupled to the RADIUS server  provides or supports roaming capabilities for the private UEs  among the plurality of access points A, B, C and the public cellular network . Additionally, the RADIUS server  receives accounting packets or call detail records (CDRs) generated by the different access points A, B, C, and forwards these accounting packets to a billing server (not shown) through a RADIUS proxy interface (not shown) to bill telecommunications charges to the appropriate parties.","Preferably, the RADIUS server  is coupled via a VRAD  to the public HLR\/VLR  and, to a private HLR (PHLR ) and\/or private VLR (PVLR ). The VRAD , private HLR  and private VLR  can be combined with the RADIUS system , as shown, or can comprise a standalone server separate and distinct from the RADIUS system. For example the VRAD , private HLR  and private VLR  can be combined with the NIB , and the system  or server  can be separate and distinct from the NIB , as described above. The private HLR  is stores information on UEs  registered or subscribing to the communication system , and more particularly to the WLAN  and\/or the private cellular network . The private VLR  is capable of temporarily storing information on subscribers or UEs  considered as roaming within the service area of the WLAN . The VRAD  is a VLR-RADIUS interface, and includes an internal integral VLR  and an extensible authentication protocol (EAP) interface  for signaling to the public HLR\/VLR  and the private HLR . The RADIUS server  couples to the public HLR\/VLR  via an EAP over RADIUS link (EAP\/RADIUS Link ). The RADIUS server  further couples to the public HLR\/VLR  via the LAN  and the Internet  over an EAP over SIM link (not shown in this figure) for transmission of data. The RADIUS server  couples to one or more access points A, B, C, via the NIB  and the LAN .","The RADIUS server  supports roaming of private UEs  based on a RADIUS\/DIAMETER roaming model along with traditional GSM subscriber roaming based upon the mobile application part (MAP) standard for address registration of roamers and inter-system hand-off procedures. Part of the SS7 protocol used in GSM, MAP standardizes address registration of roamers and inter-system hand-off procedures. In case of a communication system  having a number of private cellular networks , each with an associated WLAN  and linked by a PWAN (not shown), the RADIUS server  can act as a proxy to forward an authentication request via the VRAD  to a single, central public HLR\/VLR  and\/or a single, central private HLR  Alternatively, where the communication system  includes either a distributed public HLR\/VLR  and\/or a distributed private HLR , the RADIUS server  routes an interpretation of either a username or a user identity provided in the authentication procedure, to the appropriate public or private HLR. In one version of this embodiment, the RADIUS server  is enhanced to contact the appropriate or controlling public or private HLR , , either by: (i) querying a standalone Central Address Table server (not shown) coupled thereto to match International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) information provided in the authentication procedure to the corresponding HLR; or (ii) using a configuration table that matches the IMSI ranges with the appropriate or controlling public or private HLR. This last model works well if IMSI partitioning is implicitly or explicitly enabled for subscriber provisioning across multiple public or private HLR , .","Moreover, because the location of the private UEs  become known in the RADIUS server  and\/or the VLR  during the authentication or registration process, the communication system  of the present invention has the ability to build or provide services based on location or location based services.","Coupling between the private UEs  and the RADIUS server , and between the RADIUS server and the public or private HLR , , can be seen more clearly in . Referring to , the access point C couples to the RADIUS server  via the LAN  or via a separate radio link (not shown) and via an EAP\/SIM Link , and to the private HLR  via EAP\/RADIUS link . In an alternative to the embodiment shown in , the authentication\/authorization can be handled by a separate authentication\/authorization server  coupled to the private HLR  via a proprietary link , as shown. As indicated previously and as shown in , the private UE  must provide authentication information in a manner similar to a GSM MS . Generally, this there are three different ways or methods of accomplishing this, including: (i) use of a universal serial bus (USB) adapter  that enables the private UE  to communicate with a GSM-type SIM card or a 3G-type USIM card via a USB bus ; (ii) use of a PCMCIA adapter (not shown) that enables the private UE  to communicate directly with a GSM-type SIM card; or (iii) use of a virtual SIM as described briefly above and in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/002,551.","A preferred embodiment in which the WLAN  includes an 802.11 network will now be described with reference to . Referring to , the public cellular network  includes a GSM network  and a 3G-network , as described above. The WLAN  includes an 802.11 network having one or more 802.11 access points  (only one of which is shown), and adapted in accordance with the present invention to couple communication between the private UEs  and the public network  and\/or private cellular network . The private UEs  can include voice communication devices A, such as wireless telephones or mobile stations, and data communication devices C, such as pagers, facsimile machines, portable computers, network access appliances and personal digital assistants (PDAs).","In the 3G-network  the 802.11 access point C is coupled to the 3G-GGSN  through the NIB  and via an IuPS802.11 interface or link , the GPRS SGSN  through the NIB and via an IuPS802.11 interface or link , the 3G-RNC  through the NIB  and via an Iubis802.11 interface or link , and\/or to one or more Node Bs  through the NIB  and via a NodeB802.11 interface or link  In the GSM network  the 802.11 access point C can be coupled to the BTS  through the NIB  and via a BTS802.11 interface or link , to the BSC  through the NIB  and via an Abis802.11 interface or link , and\/or to the MSC  through the NIB  and via an A802.11 interface or link  In addition, the WLAN  can be coupled to the MSC  through the NIB  and over the PALIM link , described above.","A method or process for operating communication system  according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to .  is a flowchart showing steps of a method for facilitating communication between private UEs  and the public network  via a WLAN .

Subscriber identification and security information for the private UE  is provided to the RADIUS system  (step ), and the private UE is coupled to the public network over the WLAN (step ). In one preferred embodiment, the communication between the private UEs  and the public network  is voice communication, and the method further includes the step of controlling or accessing supplementary services for the UE provided by the private cellular network  or public network  service provider (step ).","As noted above, the subscriber identification and security information can be provided from a 3G-type USIM or GSM-type SIM  associated with each private UE , or from an identity module  in the private cellular network . Moreover, where the identity module  of the communication system  includes a memory system (not shown) having subscriber identification and security information stored therein, and the step of providing subscriber identification and security information for the private UE  to the RADIUS system , step , is accomplished by providing subscriber identification and security information associated with the private UE from the memory system. Alternatively, where the communication system  further includes a card holder\/reader holding a number of cards associated with the private UEs , and step  involves reading subscriber identification and security information stored in one of the number of cards held in the card holder\/reader.","Certain exemplary embodiments of a communication system according to the present invention, their uses and advantages will now be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["200","360","228","204","310","328","360","228","362","329","228","228","228","342","364","310","200","328","230","328","328","228","204","310","328","200","328","230","364","204","310","228","204","230","230","328"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["310","310","328","328","224","224","366","228","360","360"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 10","FIG. 12"],"b":["230","220","220","204","230","260","2130","220","364","360","202","204","230","200","230","360","312","220","312","230","216","316","220","312","366","316","328","220","230","316","316","230"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["200","360","312","316","328","228","229","364","228","228","228","368","220","368","362","208","366","316","316","328","370","366","222","360","316","316","316","328","328","230"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"],"b":["200","228","372","230","208","228","228","229","240","230","204","310","374","376","378","374","376","230","200","378","230","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":["200","200","224","396","398","316","318","396","398","400","316","318","322","224","228","230","228","230","224","402","234","404","200","406"]},"The NIB  couples to a network management center (NMC) or RADIUS server  through the VRAD . In the embodiment shown, the RADIUS server  includes an operations maintenance center (OMC ), RADIUS proxy function , and an underlying operating system . The RADIUS server  also couples to the WLAN access points C through an 802.11 over RADIUS link, thereby enabling the RADIUS server to authorize and control access to the communication system .","The NIB  also couples to a subscriber management graphical user interface (SM) to allow management of the communication system  and the subscriber profiles maintained in the private HLR  and private VLR . The SM generally includes a service configuration function  for management of communication system configuration, a service management function  for management of subscriber profiles, and an underlying operating system .","The RADIUS server  couples via an IP network or link to other remote RADIUS servers B, and through the remote RADIUS servers to other GSM networks or PLMN . The RADIUS server  couples via an IP network or link to a billing server  or service. This particularly useful for forwarding billing information on roaming or visiting UEs .","The WLAN access points C are further coupled to an IP network, such as LAN , and through the LAN to the Internet , an enterprise network , and various WLAN services .","Some of the important aspects of the present invention will now be repeated to further emphasize their structure, function and advantages.","It will be appreciated that WLAN standards, such as IEEE 802.1X, HiperLAN\/1 or HiperLAN\/2, HiperMAN, and BRAN, can be used to derive authentication and encryption keys for use with any cipher, and can also be used to periodically refresh keys and re-authenticate so as to make sure that the keying material is fresh. These standards do not specify a single authentication method; rather they utilize Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) as its authentication framework. This allows WLAN enabled access points  to support a wide range of authentication methods, including certificate-based authentication, smartcards, token cards, one-time and passwords. Moreover, since switches and access points A, B, C, act as a pass-through for EAP, new authentication methods can be added without the need to upgrade the switch or access point, by adding software on the host and back-end authentication server .","A major advantage of using an WLAN based authentication scheme is that the access control capability is built into each access point A, B, C. An 802.11 enabled access point A, B, C, can directly communicate with a RADIUS system  or server  to authenticate a user or UE  and generate encryption key for the session. The access point A, B, C, can also store billing records for the subscriber and transfer them to the RADIUS system  using the RADIUS accounting protocol. The WLAN  based approach can be used to provide access to the Internet  in both wired LANs  as well as WLANs  operated by a service provider. Also, the client part of the network can be greatly simplified by using authentication functions for WLAN  based on WLANs built into many operating systems, such as the Windows XP\u00ae operating system, commercially available from Microsoft, Inc.","Another advantage of a communication system  according to the present invention is that the cellular service provider or service provider needs only to install a limited number of WLAN-enabled access points A, B, C, in the served areas, each access point directly communicating with a RADIUS system  or server . The use of EAP and WLAN-standards provides the required security in message exchange between the access point A, B, C, and the RADIUS system.","Yet another advantage is that EAP allows different authentication methods to be used by the authentication server  based upon configuration of the RADIUS system  and\/or the authentication server. Thus, a cellular service provider can employ SIM based authentication to integrate 802.11 access information with a GSM user profile. A draft proposal outlining SIM based authentication using EAP, entitled EAP SIM authentication, is available from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and is incorporated herein by reference.","In one embodiment, an EAP interface  to a RADIUS server  is added to a VLR  in a NIB . This will allow authentication credentials to be exchanged between the WLAN  client UE  and a private HLR  following a GSM based authentication, encapsulated in EAP. The private HLR  will also be able to supply the access point A, B, C, with any user specific information, such as subscription profile, quality of service (QoS), etcetera, to enable any service differentiation.","In another embodiment, compact SIM card readers  which connect via a USB bus  to a UE , such as a personal computer (PC) or a laptop computer, can be used to support for SIM based authentication at client end. For example, an obtain\/write interface layer between a WLAN driver of a Windows\u00ae based computer and the SIM card reader  allows authentication credentials to be generated and exchanged between the SIM and the access point A, B, C.","In still another embodiment, support for WLAN-session key generation can be accomplished using an algorithm similar to GSM ciphering key generation to ensure the WLAN solution offers a level of security close to that offered in GSM.","In yet another embodiment, inter-working capability between RADIUS based accounting and current GSM call data records or CDRs is accomplished by use of a separate accounting server (not shown). This accounting server receives the RADIUS accounting data from the access points A, B, C, converts the data into GSM based CDRs, for example, based upon subscriber profile, and transfers it to the billing entity using file transfer protocol (FTP).","In another embodiment, the communication system  according to the present invention has the ability to support roaming of WLAN  UEs  based upon a RADIUS\/DIAMETER roaming model along with traditional GSM subscriber roaming based upon MAP. Requirements for different UEs , such as an 802.11 network access platform, include subscription to a WLAN service offered by a carrier. Generally, the user or subscriber would access the service provider's network through a WLAN enabled client device or UE , such as a laptop computer. Preferably, the client computer's operating system includes WLAN support, either natively or through additional drivers or an emulator program downloaded from the service provider, as described above. Two known operating systems satisfying this requirement are Microsoft Windows 2000\u00ae and Microsoft Windows XP\u00ae.","The UE  could authenticate in way similar to that of a GSM mobile station. There are several feasible methods of achieving this. In one method the UE  will need an authentication driver to interface with a GSM-type SIM card . This can be accomplished either through the use of a PCMCIA adapter or a USB adapter  that provides the ability for the UE  to communicate with the GSM-type SIM card . A USB adapter  being more compact and reasonably priced than the PCMCIA adapter, it is the preferred interface. To emulate GSM authentication on the WLAN security framework, an EAP extension module or interface  is required. The EAP interface  will communicate with GSM-type SIM card  using an application programming interface (API), such as a PC Smartcard (PC\/SC) interface, obtained from the service provider and plugged into the UE  as a dynamic linked library file (DLL).","The generation and use of session key for encryption of WLAN packets in conventional WLANs generally follows vendor specific interfaces. Thus, session key for encryption of WLAN packets depend on vendor specifications. In a preferred embodiment, in the communication system of the present invention the encryption key is generated based upon one or more ciphering key (Kc) generated during EAP\/GSM authentication.","The access points A, B, C, required to work with the communication system  of the present invention must contain WLAN based authentication and session encryption support. The access point points A, B, C, will also be required to act as a RADIUS client to the RADIUS system  or server  and as a Network Access Server (NAS) in user authentication processes, causing EAP messages to be exchanged via RADIUS messaging. Two vendors offering access points A, B, C, meeting the above specifications include Proxim Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., and Cisco Inc., of San Jose, Calif.","In addition to the above, preferably the communication system  further includes a RADIUS server  capable of performing following functions:\n\n","1. Query a standalone Central Address Table (CAT) Server (not shown) to match the HLR corresponding to subscriber IMS1; or","2. Use a configuration table (not shown) that matches IMSI ranges of the UE  with the controlling HLR. (This model works if IMS1 partitioning is implicitly or explicitly enabled for subscriber provisioning across multiple HLRs)\n\n","Preferably, the RADIUS or private HLR  supports all of the following attributes or capabilities:\n\n","More preferably, the RADIUS or private HLR  of the communication system  will support following Read-only attributes:\n\n","As noted above, the RADIUS or private HLR  will communicate with the RADIUS server  using an EAP interface only. This will avoid use, creation and maintenance of a proprietary protocol between RADIUS server and the HLR. To support the EAP interface :\n\n","Finally, in one embodiment, a subscriber management user interface (SMGUI ) is provided to allow provisioning of the WLAN  service attributes including, for example, display of read-only attributes of the communication system . In one version of this embodiment, the display of the SMGUI  could be auto refreshed using an asynchronous mechanism with the private HLR . Alternatively, for simplicity of implementation, a refresh button on the SMGUI  could be used to get updates from the private HLR .","The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
