{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application 61\/372,127, filed Aug. 10, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. DE-FC26-07NT43214 awarded by the Department of Energy. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.","The present invention generally relates to semiconductor devices capable of switching high currents and, more particularly, to a hybrid switching device or circuit particularly suited for use in high power switching circuits such as resonant power converters to increase the efficiency thereof.","At the present time, most power distribution is achieved using high voltage alternating current (AC) such that resistive losses in long power distribution lines can be reduced to acceptable levels. Alternating current allows high voltage power at reduced currents to be converted to a lower voltage and higher current near the location where the power will be consumed by the simple expedient of a transformer. However, most electronic devices or other apparatus that includes such electronic devices as well as power storage devices such as batteries require direct current (DC) power at a closely regulated voltage. DC power can be easily obtained from AC power by rectification using diodes or the like and filtering to obtain an approximate DC voltage from which the required DC voltage may be obtained. Maintaining a DC voltage at a particular desired level within a small tolerance, however, generally requires regulation by an active circuit since practical filters generally cannot hold a DC voltage within tolerances generally required by electronic devices.","While analog voltage regulators have been known for many years, they are inefficient to provide any significant current because of the voltage drop developed across them and the power they consume for that reason. Accordingly, at the present time, switching regulators and power converters such as inverters are much preferred because of the increased efficiency they can potentially provide by rapidly connecting and disconnecting the power input thereto as required to maintain the output voltage at a desired level. Thus, the period when a voltage drop occurs across the regulator or power converter will be limited to relatively short periods of time and overall efficiency can be improved.","However, such switching is necessarily cyclic and some portions of the switching cycle may be less efficient than others due to the instantaneous conduction conditions in the regulator or power converter circuit. The amount of current passing through the regulator or power converter can vary widely over a single switching cycle and between switching cycles, depending on input voltage or output current.","For example, at light loads where conduction losses are reduced, the amount of power consumed by the rapid switching, referred to as switching losses, becomes a significant fraction of the total power consumption of the regulator or power converter. Switching losses can be substantially eliminated by so-called soft switching using MOSFETs such that the internal diode (referred to as a body diode) of the MOSFET will begin to conduct before the MOSFET is switched on. Conversely, at heavy loads where high current is drawn through the regulator or power converter, conduction losses in the switches, generally MOSFETs since they are well-suited to operation in a soft-switching mode, tend to predominate because the conduction path in MOSFETs is substantially resistive. Conduction losses theoretically could be mitigated by placing a large number of MOSFETs in parallel to reduce currents in individual MOSFETs and thus reduce the voltage drop. However such a parallel connection of many switches is not generally practical due to the cost of multiple switching devices.","Other attempts to improve efficiency of switching devices in regulators and power converters by control of mode of operation have yielded only marginal improvements. Such attempts to tailor mode of operation to load levels are necessarily complex, increasing cost and reducing power density and require some amount of power for operation as well as load sensing. Further, such arrangements have not been able to alter modes of operation within a single switching cycle.","Some of the above causes of inefficiency are particularly intractable in regard to high power inverters which produce AC current from DC input power. While inverters have been known, particularly for low-power applications, they have become of increasing interest in recent years in connection with renewable or so-called \u201cgreen\u201d energy sources such as solar power or wind-powered generators where conditions for generation of power is necessarily intermittent and energy must be stored in some form such as charge in batteries. Energy stored in such a manner will necessarily be available as a DC voltage which may require conversion to AC power for distribution.","Thus, the inverter output voltage and current will ideally vary sinusoidally at the desired line frequency and the current through the switches on each side of the inverter circuit will vary from zero to a maximum and back to zero during respective half-cycles of the line frequency with the maximum current depending ultimately on the load. Thus, it can be clearly seen that the full range of output current that may be required by the load will be carried by the respective switches of the inverter during respective half-cycle periods of the output and improvements in efficiency have been limited since both light and heavy loads must be accommodated in a single half-line cycle.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a hybrid switch of improved efficiency that minimizes voltage drop across the hybrid switch at both heavy and light loads without requiring load sensing or control of mode of operation.","It is another object of the invention to provide inverter circuits of improved efficiency using a hybrid switch to reduce voltage drop across the switches of the inverter under all load conditions.","In order to accomplish these and other objects of the invention, a hybrid switch and a power converter such as an inverter are provided, wherein the hybrid switch comprises an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), and a power MOSFET, wherein conduction terminals of said IGBT and Said power MOSFET are connected in parallel, and wherein control terminals of said IGBT and said power MOSFET are responsive to a control signal.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of reducing conduction losses in a high current switching circuit is provided comprising controlling two switches to conduct concurrently, wherein one of the two switches exhibits a substantially resistive voltage drop as a function of current and another of the two switches exhibits a substantially constant voltage drop plus a small resistive voltage drop characteristic as a function of current, wherein conduction current is shared between switches in accordance with their respective voltage drop characteristics.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there is shown a schematic diagram of the hybrid switch  in accordance with the invention. The hybrid switch  essentially comprises a power insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT\u2014Q)  and a power MOSFET  (M) having the conduction terminals and control terminals of both transistors essentially connected in parallel. For soft switching, the IGBT will also preferably have a diode D () connected in parallel with the conduction terminals thereof. MOSFET  inherently includes a similarly connected diode referred to as a body diode. Both transistors are controlled by the same signal G although it is preferred and generally necessary in very high voltage, high power applications to provide a turn-on delay  in the application of signal G to MOSFET  as will be discussed in greater detail below. No delay is generally required for turn-off of MOSFET  (M) and the delay structure  can be as simple as a series resistor (e.g. in series with the gate capacitance of MOSFET ) with a diode connected in parallel with the resistor to quickly discharge the gate capacitance, as shown in the circuit of . However, a delay can also be applied to turn-off by adding a resistor in series with the diode Dy and\/or Dy.","The basic principle of operation of hybrid switch  can be readily understood from  which is a plot of the forward voltage drop of the MOSFET  (M) and the IGBT  (Q) and the parallel combination thereof (M\/Q). As can be seen, the forward voltage drop characteristic of the MOSFET M is essentially linear with current and thus is essentially resistive as is to be expected since there is no junction in the conduction path of a field effect transistor. The forward voltage drop characteristic of a power IGBT is a constant for even minimal forward current plus an additional and near-negligible voltage that rises with increase of forward current although not linearly at relatively low currents and rises less with increased current than the forward voltage drop of a MOSFET.","Since the characteristics illustrated in  are plots of the voltage drop as a function of forward current, they represent a comparison of resistances at a continuum of currents and, as is known, current will be apportioned between parallel conduction paths in inverse proportion to the relative resistances of the parallel conduction paths. Therefore, at low current where the M resistance is much lower than the Q resistance, conduction through MOSFET  will predominate. As the resistances become more similar (at about 75 \u212b in this example) conduction will be shared between IGBT  and MOSFET  and will be equal when the resistances are equal (at 150 A in this example). Above that point greater current will be carried by the IGBT until (above about 200 A in this example) the current through MOSFET  becomes relatively small and the M\/Q curve becomes substantially parallel to the Q curve. The M\/Q curve will always lie below the Q curve since the parallel conduction path through the MOSFET will always exist and, even though the resistance can become relatively high for larger currents, it will not become infinite (which would cause the M\/Q curve to converge with the Q curve but not cross it) while the MOSFET is turned on and remains intact. It follows from the M\/Q curve being below the Q curve and never exceeding the M curve, that the hybrid switch  will have a lower voltage drop across it than would be developed at any forward current than either the IGBT or MOSFET alone except at very low currents where the conduction losses in the MOSFET would be very small. Therefore, the efficiency of the hybrid switch will be greater than either a MOSFET or an IGBT at large currents and equal to the small conduction losses of the MOSFET at very low currents. Further, the relative conduction currents in the IGBT  and the MOSFET  will inherently shift between the IGBT and MOSFET depending on the current drawn by the load.","It should be appreciated, however, that such a simple expedient for significantly increasing efficiency is not appropriate for hard-switching inverters because when turning on the switch on one side of the inverter, the switch on the other side of the inverter which includes the body diode of the power MOSFET must be turned off. The reverse recovery time of the body diode of a high power MOSFET is very slow and a large reverse diode current will create a short circuit between DC+ and DC\u2212, resulting in a large loss or even failure of the hybrid switch .","In sharp contrast, with soft switching (e.g. using either an IGBT and diode or a power MOSFET having a body diode), the diode current is always diverted to the diode on the opposite side of the inverter before the switch on the opposite side of the inverter is turned on to allow the switch to be turned on under a zero voltage condition. In this case, the slow reverse recovery is not an issue and a hybrid switch in accordance with the invention can be adopted for most zero voltage switching inverters even though such a possibility is clearly counter-intuitive in regard to the design of most currently available high-power inverters which employ hard switching.","As alluded to above, the only concern regarding use of the hybrid switch in accordance with the invention in soft-switching inverters is the possibility during the turn-on process of the hybrid switch that most load current may flow through the power MOSFET and cause transient over current therein. This concern can be completely answered by the inclusion of turn-on delay circuit  which, as alluded to above, may be very simple and inexpensive to provide. Since the delay and the corresponding diversion of some current through the IGBT can be very short, the brief increase in forward conduction voltage drop does not significantly compromise the reduction in conduction loss that is achieved by use of the hybrid switch in accordance with the invention. It can also be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that the need for a corresponding delay in turn-off of the MOSFET depends of the proportion of MOSFET and IGBT sizes In general, the turn-off of IGBT  and MOSFET  can occur simultaneously and a corresponding turn-off delay is unnecessary. However, if MOSFET  carries the majority of the load current under most load conditions, then a delayed turn-off of the MOSFET can reduce the turn-off loss of the IGBT which tends to have a slow turn-off, sometimes referred to as a \u201ctail current, as is well-known.","Referring now to , the first of several exemplary inverter circuits employing the hybrid switch of the invention will now be discussed. It should be understood that these exemplary inverter circuits and corresponding use of the hybrid switch in other zero voltage switching inverters are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.","As illustrated in , the inverter circuit principally comprises two switches , , which alternately connect the DC+ and DC\u2212 busses, which receive power from a power supply, battery or the like, generically illustrated as Vand C, to the load . (The current return path from the load is not shown.) The upper switch comprises M, Q and D and the lower switch comprises M, Q and D. In a conventional hard-switching inverter, only IGBTs Q and Q and diodes D and D are used. IGBT Q conducts the positive current, while diode D conducts the negative freewheeling current. Similarly, IGBT Q conducts the negative current, while D conducts the positive freewheeling current. With added MOSFETs M and M, the positive currents are shared between M and Q and the negative currents are shared between M and Q while the positive and negative freewheeling currents are shared between the diodes D, D and the body diodes of the MOSFETs M and M, respectively. Only one gate signal is required for each switch: G for the upper switch and G for the lower switch. The auxiliary resonant current Ican be created by an auxiliary circuit that comprises additional auxiliary switches such as Qx! and Qx and auxiliary diodes Dx and Dx and a resonant inductor as shown in . Resonant capacitors C and C are preferably connected across the respective switches , , to reduce the device voltage slew rate and consequent turn-off losses.","The soft-switching inverter circuit of  is perhaps the simplest and most generalized inverter circuit possible and its operation will be readily understood by those skilled in the art. Similarly, from the above discussion in connection with , it can be readily appreciated that the reduction of voltage drop across the hybrid switches (compared with the conventional circuit in which only the IGBTs Q and Q are used) will significantly improve efficiency when any significant current is drawn by the load and particularly at light loads which will occur near the times when the on-state is reversed between switches  and .","As a second example of the use of hybrid switches  in an inverter circuit, a phase leg of a coupled-magnetic type soft-switching inverter is schematically illustrated in . This Figure represents an exemplary type of implementation of the basic circuit of . As alluded to above, the turn-on delay is illustrated as being simply implemented with resistors Rand Rwhich slows charging of the gate capacitances of the MOSFETs M and M. Since no turn-off delay is needed, a diode is provided in parallel with each of the resistors.","Transistors Qx and Qx are auxiliary switches to produce the resonant current, I, as depicted more generically in . Dx and Dx are small diodes that protect IGBTs Qx and Qx from any negative voltage failure. Two resonant inductors are coupled together. The inductor that connects between the middle point of switches Qx and Qx and the middle point of hybrid switches  and  is considered the primary side, and the inductor that connects between the middle point of diode Dx and Dx and the middle point of hybrid switches  and  is considered the secondary side. The voltages controlling the IGBTs and MOSFETs and IGBT and MOSFET currents are also illustrated and will be discussed in connection with the operational waveforms shown in .","Referring now to , the timing and operational waveforms of the circuit of  will be discussed in detail. It will be appreciated that these timing and operational waveforms are also applicable to some applications of the circuit of . It is assumed that the load current Iis initially positive (appearing constant over the short time period depicted) and conducted by the bottom freewheeling diode D. At time to, the bottom main hybrid switch  gates Vand Vturn off. Because their anti-paralleled diodes conduct initially, the turn-off action does not create any change in the voltage and current waveforms. At time t, the upper auxiliary switch gate Vis turned on by, for example, a pulse width modulation (PWM) command. The auxiliary switch Qx conducts and produces a resonant current Iwhich initially rises linearly with a slope proportional to the bus voltage and anti-proportional to the inductance of the coupled magnetics. At time t, Iexceeds the load current and the excess portion will charge and discharge the resonant capacitors C and C, respectively. With C being discharged, top switch voltage Vstarts falling and with C being charged, bottom switch voltage Vstarts rising. At time t, C and c are fully discharged and charged, respectively, Vfalls to zero and M and Q can be turned on under zero voltage conditions. At time t the main switch Q gate Vis turned on by the control circuit. The delay between T and t, t, can be controlled by a fixed delay timer or by zero-voltage detection. The load current starts shifting to Q and Istarts rising. At time T, a small delay following t to avoid M from initially carrying too much current, as discussed above, the MOSFET switch M gate is turned on and the load current will be shared by both M and Q. With both M and Q conducting, the secondary winding of the coupled magnetics will see a reverse voltage due to Dx conducting. The resonant current will be reset by this reverse voltage. At time t, the resonant current Ifalls to zero. The slope of the resonant current falling rate depends on the secondary inductance of the coupled magnetics. With a turns ratio larger than 1, the slope can be more gentle and the zero-voltage crossing period can be widened.","At time t, both M and Q are turned off. Diode Dy helps accelerate discharging the gate-source capacitance of M to avoid the load current being shifted to M, which is generally a smaller device than the corresponding IGBT and designed to carry a smaller current. The currents in both M and Q start shifting out to charge and discharge C and C. With C being charged, top switch voltage Vstarts rising and with C being discharged, bottom switch voltage Vstarts falling. At time t, capacitor C is fully charged and Vrises to the DC bus voltage and capacitor C is fully discharged and Vfalls to zero, while the load current is conducted by the bottom freewheeling diode D. At time t, the bottom auxiliary switch is turned on by a PWM command. With bottom freewheeling diode D conducting, the voltage across the coupled magnetic is zero, so the resonant current cannot be established, Also, with VCE being zero, the bottom switch gate signals Vand Vcan be turned on under zero voltage conditions. The process is then repeated for the bottom side of the inverter circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 4 and 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"],"sub":["dc","L","GE-Qx1 ","lr ","L ","CE1 ","CE1 "],"b":["42","1","1"]},"To explain the current sharing further, voltage and current waveforms of a simulation with a lower (50 A) load current is shown in . The bottom window shows that the MOSFET M carries the majority of the current (33 A) while the IGBT carries a lesser current (17 A) under lighter load conditions due to the principally resistive voltage drop of the MOSFET being reduced at lower current compared to the substantially fixed voltage drop of the IGBT, as discussed above. It should be appreciated that these simulations are in good agreement with the timing and operational waveforms discussed above in connection with .","The hybrid switch is usable in virtually any soft-switching inverter, regulator or power converter. For example,  schematically shows a full-bridge resonant snubber inverter (RSI) circuit including hybrid switches in accordance with the invention. In this case, the auxiliary resonant current is created by the other phase switches along with the auxiliary circuit that comprises Sr and Sr, auxiliary diodes Dr and Dr and resonant inductor Lr.","The full bridge operation is to have hybrid switches  and  turning on and off simultaneously (with slight turn-on delay for the MOSFETs of each hybrid switch) for the positive load current and hybrid switches  and  turning on and off simultaneously (with the same slight turn-on delay for the MOSFETs) for the negative load current. To achieve soft switching for switches  and , the resonant current relies on the turning on of auxiliary switch Sr which creates a positive current to discharge C and C so that switches  and  can be turned on under zero voltage conditions. Similarly, for the negative current cycles, the negative resonant current relies on the turning on of auxiliary switch Sr to discharge C and C to achieve soft switching for switches  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","2","1","1","1","1","1","91","94"],"sub":["Lr1 ","Lr1 "]},"In view of the foregoing, it is seen that the hybrid switch in accordance with the basic principles of the invention facilitates design and operation of soft switching power regulator and converters and power inverters in particular while providing a significant improvement in light load efficiency in any such application.
