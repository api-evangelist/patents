title: Method for determining local inner and outer boundary layer length scales from drag measurements in high Reynolds number turbulent flows
abstract: A method is presented for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales from a succession of drag measurements of a cylindrical body in order to estimate flow noise and for computational modeling of the dynamics of towed arrays in a fluid medium. A succession of measurements of the total drag on a cylinder under tow at uniform known conditions (flow speed, fluid density, fluid viscosity, cylindrical body geometry) is taken. After each measurement, the cylinder is truncated by a fixed amount, and the process is repeated for the length of the cylinder. The measurements provide a spatially and temporally averaged measure of the mean wall shear stress and momentum thickness, from which the inner and outer length scales can be determined. The inner and outer boundary layer length scales may then be used for estimation of flow noise on towed cylindrical bodies and arrays.

Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to the estimation of the flow noise on a cylindrical body in a turbulent flow and, more particularly, to a method for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales from a succession of drag measurements of a long thin cylindrical body in any fluid as a precursor to estimating flow noise.","2. Description of the Prior Art","There is a significant practical need to know the drag and flow noise of towed long thin cylindrical bodies. The need arises in a variety of contexts including torpedoes and towed sonar arrays.","Towed sonar arrays are sonar systems that are designed to be towed by a submarine or a surface vessel in order to detect other submarines. The arrays are typically long, hose-like structures measuring up to a thousand feet or longer that contain specially designed acoustic sensors, called hydrophones, which receive acoustic waves. The arrays include electronics that convert the acoustical waves from analog to digital form and transmit that data to electronic processors on board the towing vessel.","The processor must distinguish radiated sound from other submarines from ambient and self noise, which includes the flow noise of the towed array. Thus, it is important to accurately estimate flow noise in advance, for design purposes. Moreover, towed arrays must be designed to withstand the extreme environmental stresses of operation in the ocean depths, and so it is necessary to accurately estimate drag, and estimate the local wall shear stress as well. Accomplishing this requires an understanding of the turbulent boundary layers which exist on the arrays.","The inner region of the boundary layer is dominated by viscous effects, and the outer region is dominated by inertial effects. Two dimensional flat plate turbulent boundary layers have been explored thoroughly for several decades, and it is generally accepted that the (inner) viscous length scale and the (outer) boundary layer momentum thickness scale adequately characterize the flow.","Most practical engineering flows, however, are characterized as high-Reynolds number flows. Since the viscous length scale decreases rapidly with increasing Reynolds number, and the outer length scales are only a weak function of Reynolds number, the inner and outer scales become increasingly disparate with increasing Reynolds number. Thus, more complex turbulent flows are often not well described by the Reynolds number alone, and must be described using inner and outer boundary layer length scales.","In the context of a towed array, the hydrodynamic flow is a high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer, which may be equilibrium or nonequilibrium depending on the ship motion. Consequently, it is necessary to know the inner and outer boundary layer length scales, which characterize the flow field, for estimation of flow noise on long thin cylinders, and in particular, current and next generation towed sonar arrays.","Currently there are no viable approaches for determining the inner and outer boundary layer length scales in tow tank testing or full scale sea trials. Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) have been used extensively for measurements of turbulence in laboratories. However, oceanic field applications are impractical. It would be greatly advantageous to provide a method for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales and, more particularly, from a succession of drag measurements of a long thin cylindrical body, in order to estimate flow noise and for improved computational modeling of the dynamics of towed arrays in water or other towed bodies in air.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales from a succession of drag measurements of a long thin cylindrical body.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales of a long thin cylindrical body in order to estimate flow noise and for improved computational modeling of the dynamics of towed arrays in water.","In accordance with the stated objects, a method is provided for determining the local inner and outer turbulent boundary layer length scales from experimental measurements of the drag on a long thin cylindrical body at low or high momentum thickness Reynolds numbers. A succession of measurements of the total drag on a cylinder under tow is taken for particular conditions (flow speed, fluid density, fluid viscosity, cylindrical body geometry). After each measurement the cylinder is truncated by a fixed amount, and the process is repeated for the entire length of the cylinder. The collective measurements provide a spatially and temporally averaged measure of the mean wall shear stress and momentum thickness, from which the inner and outer length scales can be determined directly, for each separate segment of the cylinder. The inner and outer boundary layer length scales may then be used for estimation of flow noise on long thin cylinders, and in particular, current and next generation towed sonar arrays. In particular, this method also allows the spatial variation of the length scales down the length of the cylinder to be determined directly.","The present invention reduces the time and overhead required to produce the accurate flow data needed for proper engineering of towed sonar arrays.","The present invention is a method for determining inner and outer boundary layer length scales from a succession of drag measurements of a long thin cylindrical body in any fluid as a precursor to estimating drag and flow noise.","The methodology begins by towing a unit under test (UUT), preferably a long thin neutrally buoyant cylinder , in a controlled environment such as a towing tank, or from a surface platform under conditions for which the ambient flow field is known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","10","40","12","14","12","16","14","16"]},"The load cell computer interface  may be a conventional multi-meter as will be described or any other interface capable of digitizing the analog voltage signal produced by a load cell . A conventional fixed tow strut  extends beneath the tow carriage  into the fluid medium . The load cell  is mounted distally on the tow strut  behind a common fairing  which minimizes the generation of turbulence. The load cell  may be any common type of tensile load measuring device, such as a strain gage load cell. An axial type load cell usually consists of a hollow or solid cylindrical shaft and four strain gages mounted around the circumference.","The strain gages are mounted and connected to form a Wheatstone bridge circuit. The load cell  is tethered by a leader line  to the UUT , which is depicted as a small diameter cylinder. The leader line  separates the UUT  from any turbulence generated by the tow strut .","In practicing the method of the invention, the UUT  is towed and the total drag on the towed cylinder is measured directly by the load cell , which outputs an analog signal that is digitized by the load cell computer interface . The digitized load is processed using a control volume analysis extended to the case of axisymmetric flows to exactly calculate the momentum thickness (which is the outer length scale) of the turbulent boundary layer at the end of the cylinder UUT .","A suitable control volume analysis is detailed below in reference to . This calculation requires the angle of tow of the UUT  to be within one degree, and the tow speed Uto be steady temporally.","Next, a fixed-length segment of the UUT  is removed from its trailing end, and the total drag on the towed cylinder is measured directly as described above by the load cell , and the control volume analysis of axisymmetric flow is repeated to calculate the momentum thickness of the truncated cylinder UUT.","The foregoing procedure is repeated successively, with a fixed segment of the cylinder UUT  being removed for each drag measurement. A typical UUT segment length to remove is approximately 1 m, but could be larger or smaller, depending on the desired spatial resolution. The foregoing procedure is repeated for the entire length of the UUT .","It can be seen that the difference in drag between consecutive measurements yields the spatially and temporally averaged mean wall shear that exists on each particular segment. By repeating this procedure over the entire length of the UUT , the spatial dependence of the mean wall shear stress is determined, as well as the spatial dependence of the momentum thickness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["a cylinder radius (ft)","u(r) temporal mean streamwise velocity at radial location r (ft\/sec)","r radial distance from the center of the cylinder (ft)","x streamwise distance from the leading edge of the cylinder (ft)","Utow speed of the cylinder (ft\/sec)","CS control surface of the control volume (ft)","dA incremental annular surface area at the end of the control volume (ft)","{overscore (F)} vector force applied to the surface of the control volume (lbf)","F streamwise scalar force applied to the surface of the control volume (lbf)","Atotal surface area of the cylinder (ft)","Aannular surface area at the end of the control volume (ft)","L length of the cylinder (ft)","Ctangential drag coefficient (nondimensional)","s boundary layer inner length scale (ft)","\u03bd kinematic viscosity of the fluid (ft\/sec)","\u03bc friction velocity (ft\/sec)","\u03c4temporally averaged mean wall shear stress (psf)","\u03c4spatially and temporally averaged mean wall shear stress (psf)","\u03c1 fluid density (slugs\/ft)","\u03b4 boundary layer thickness at the end of the cylinder (ft)","boundary layer momentum thickness at the end of the cylinder (ft)","{overscore (V)} temporal mean velocity vector (ft\/sec)","d connotes the derivative of the associated term"]}}}},"The outer boundary layer length scale is the momentum thickness  itself, and the inner boundary layer length scale is given by \u03bd\/\u03bc, where \u03bc=(\u03c4\/\u03c1).","Using cylindrical coordinates, as shown in , an expression for the momentum thickness  is derived.
