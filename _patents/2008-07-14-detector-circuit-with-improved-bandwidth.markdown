At millimeter wave frequencies these diodes are typically single discrete devices that are mounted on a substrate. Impedance matching and video filtering for the detector circuit are also mounted on the substrate, with the input matching network on the input side of the discrete diode, and the output video filter network on the other side of the discrete diode. Such a detector circuit is described in \u201cDevelopment of Compact Broadband Receivers at Submillimeter Wavelengths\u201d by J. L. Hesler, D. W. Porterfield, W. L. Bishop, T. W. Crowe, and P. Racette, 2004 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings IEEE, pages 735-740. The resulting detector circuit is a physically large circuit with limited sensitivity.","Another example of the prior art is a W band detector developed at HRL Laboratories, LLC. This detector circuit is similar to detectors implemented in commercial millimeter wave imaging cameras. The W band detector is implemented using discrete diodes mounted on a circuit board. Input filtering is provided on the input side of the detector, and output filtering on the output side. This W band detector has high sensitivity, but very narrow bandwidth and is described in \u201cSb-Heterostructure Diode Detector W-band NEP and NEDT Optimization\u201d by H. P. Moyer, R. L. Bowen, J.

For example, for the shunt connected diode of  the output filter network  may consist of an inductor in series with the load. This circuit ensures detection down to zero Hz (DC) and has high impedance at the center frequency, thereby blocking the RF signal from the output transmission lines  and , while not degrading the RF operation of the circuit. An example of a circuit that would not work well for  is a large shunt capacitor connected directly across the diode. Although this allows DC to pass to the output transmission lines  and , and blocks RF from the output signal, it effectively short circuits the diode at RF, which disrupts the RF operation of the detector circuit.","What is needed is a detector circuit that has a wide operational bandwidth, while isolating the RF input signal from the output signal. The embodiments of the present disclosure answer these and other needs.","In a first embodiment disclosed herein, a detector circuit for an operational bandwidth having a center frequency comprises a diode, a first inductor in series with the diode, a transmission line coupled across the diode on a first end of the transmission line, the transmission line having an impedance and being in length a quarter wavelength of a frequency near the center frequency of the operational bandwidth, and a capacitor coupled across a second end of the transmission line.","In another embodiment disclosed herein, a detector circuit for an operational bandwidth having a center frequency comprises an input transmission line, a diode coupled across the input transmission line, a first inductor in series with the diode, a second transmission line coupled across the diode on a first end of the second transmission line, the second transmission line having an impedance and being in length a quarter wavelength of a frequency near the center frequency of the operational bandwidth, and a capacitor coupled across a second end of the transmission line.","In another embodiment disclosed herein, a detector circuit for an operational bandwidth having a center frequency comprises an input transmission line coupled to a first inductor and a second inductor, a diode coupled between the first inductor and the second inductor, a second transmission line coupled to the first inductor and the second inductor on a first end of the second transmission line, the second transmission line having an impedance and being in length a quarter wavelength of a frequency near the center frequency of the operational bandwidth, and a capacitor coupled across a second end of the transmission line.","These and other features and advantages will become further apparent from the detailed description and accompanying figures that follow. In the figures and description, numerals indicate the various features, like numerals referring to like features throughout both the drawings and the description.","Referring now to , one embodiment of a detector circuit  is shown. The signal input to the detector circuit  is via an input transmission line, which has a signal line , a return line , and an impedance of Z. An inductor  is in series with a diode  and the input transmission line is attached across inductor  in series with a diode  at first terminal  and second terminal . The inductor  improves the operational bandwidth of the detector circuit by resonating with the capacitance inherent in the diode.

The second transmission line has an impedance of Zand a length of L. A second end of the second transmission line is attached across capacitor , with the second signal line  attached to the first capacitor terminal  and the second return line  attached to the second capacitor terminal . The output signal of the detector circuit is the voltage across the capacitor  between first capacitor terminal  and second capacitor terminal . The capacitor  effectively filters the RF signal from the output signal and the capacitance of the capacitor  is typically chosen to be substantially greater than (1\/(2 f\u00d7Z)).","The combination of capacitor  and the second transmission line (second signal line  and second return line ) with impedance Zand a length of Lprovides an additional resonance for providing a wide bandwidth for the detector circuit. Choosing the capacitance of capacitor  to be substantially greater than the inverse of (2 f\u00d7Z), effectively creates a short circuit to the RF signal frequencies, thereby removing the RF signal frequencies from the output signal. By choosing the length Lof the second transmission line (,), to be about a quarter wavelength of a frequency near the center of the operating bandwidth, the combination of the capacitor  with the second transmission line (second signal line  and second return line ) appears to be a parallel resonator. In a preferred embodiment the length Lof the second transmission line is a quarter wavelength of the center frequency of the operating bandwidth.","It is important that the capacitor  is not connected directly across diode . As discussed above, a large shunt capacitor connected directly across the diode would allow DC to pass to the output transmission lines  and , and would block RF from the output signal. However, a large shunt capacitor connected directly across the diode would also effectively short circuit the diode at RF signal frequencies, which would not allow the diode to detect the envelope of the RF signal.

Incorporating the detector circuit of  or B directly on the integrated circuit simplifies external circuitry and significantly improves detector performance, especially at millimeter wave (30-300 GHz) frequencies. Employing the circuitry or portions of the circuitry off chip at these frequencies would lead to narrowband operation due to the unavoidable parasitic reactances associated with the RF transitions on and off chip. Incorporating this circuitry on chip reduces these parasitics, increasing the bandwidth and sensitivity of the detector. An integrated circuit also reduces the overall circuit size and thereby the integrated circuit cost. As important, the size of the integrated circuit, which is approximately 0.5 mm by 0.5 mm, allows the circuit to be integrated into compact systems such as receiver antennas with improved performance over more discrete component embodiments.","The embodiment using a waveguide input is just one of many possible embodiments.
