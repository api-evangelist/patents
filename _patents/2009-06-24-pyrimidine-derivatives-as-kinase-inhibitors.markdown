kinase inhibitors, more particularly novel pyrimidine derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and their use as pharmaceuticals.","Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling is highly implicated in cancer, with the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) as the predominating factor. IGR-1R is important for tumor transformation and survival of malignant cells, but is only partially involved in normal cell growth. Targeting of IGF-1R has been suggested to be a promising option for cancer therapy. (Larsson et al., Br. J. Cancer 92:2097-2101 (2005)).","Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a member of the insulin receptor superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, has been implicated in oncogenesis in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumors. The aberrant expression of full-length ALK receptor proteins has been reported in neuroblastomas and glioblastomas; and ALK fusion proteins have occurred in anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with, for example, C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example H or H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In other examples, an F or labeled compound may be used for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopic variations of the compounds have the potential to change a compound's metabolic fate and\/or create small changes in physical properties such as hydrophobicity, and the like. Isotopic variations also have the potential to enhance efficacy and safety, enhance bioavailability and half-life, alter protein binding, change biodistribution, increase the proportion of active metabolites and\/or decrease the formation of reactive or toxic metabolites. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","In each of the above formula, each optionally substituted moiety may be substituted with Calkyl, Calkenyl or Calkynyl, each of which may be optionally halogenated or optionally having a carbon that may be replaced or substituted with N, S, O, or a combination thereof (for example, hydroxylC-Calkyl, C-CalkoxyC-Calkyl); halo, amino, amidino, Calkoxy; hydroxyl, methylenedioxy, carboxy; Calkylcarbonyl, Calkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, Calkylcarbamoyl, sulfamoyl, cyano, oxo, nitro, or an optionally substituted carbocyclic ring, heterocyclic ring, aryl or heteroaryl as previously described.","Pharmacology and Utility","The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro in cell-free kinase assays and in cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.","In one aspect, the compounds of the invention may inhibit insulin like growth-factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R), and may be useful in the treatment of IGF-1 R mediated diseases. Examples of IGF-1R mediated diseases include but are not limited to proliferative diseases, such as tumors, for example breast, renal, prostate, colorectal, thyroid, ovarian, pancreas, neuronal, lung, uterine and gastro intestinal tumors, as well as osteosarcomas and melanomas. The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity may be demonstrated using a cellular capture ELISA. In this assay, the activity of the compounds of the invention against (IGF-1)-induced autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R is determined.","In another aspect, the compounds of the invention may inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the fusion protein of NPM-ALK. This protein tyrosine kinase results from a gene fusion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and ALK, rendering the protein tyrosine kinase activity of ALK ligand independent. NPM-ALK plays a key role in signal transmission in a number of hematopoetic and other human cells leading to hematological and neoplastic diseases, for example in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), specifically in ALK+NHL or Alkomas, in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and neuroblastomas. (Duyster et al. 2001 Oncogene 20, 5623-5637). In addition to NPM-ALK, other gene fusions have been identified in human hematological and neoplastic diseases; for example, TPM3-ALK (a fusion of nonmuscle tropomyosin with ALK).","The inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity may be demonstrated using known methods, for example using the recombinant kinase domain of the ALK in analogy to the VEGF-R kinase assay described in J. Wood et al. Cancer Res. 60, 2178-2189 (2000). In general, in vitro enzyme assays using GST-ALK protein tyrosine kinase are performed in 96-well plates as a filter binding assay in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH=7.5, 3 mM MgCl, 10 mM MnCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 \u03bcCi\/assay (=30 \u03bcl) [\u03b3-P]-ATP, 2 \u03bcM ATP, 3 \u03bcg\/mL poly (Glu, Tyr 4:1) Poly-EY (Sigma P-0275), 1% DMSO, 25 ng ALK enzyme. Assays are incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. Reactions are terminated by adding 50 \u03bcl of 125 mM EDTA, and the reaction mixture is transferred onto a MAIP Multiscreen plate (Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA), previously wet with methanol, and rehydrated for 5 min with HO. Following washing (0.5% HPO), plates are counted in a liquid scintillation counter. ICvalues are calculated by linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition.","The compounds of the invention may potently inhibit the growth of human NPM-ALK overexpressing murine BaF3 cells (DSMZ Deutsche Sammiung von Mikroorganismen and Zelikulturen GmbH, Germany). The expression of NPM-ALK may be achieved by transfecting the BaF3 cell line with an expression vector pClneo\u2122 (Promega Corp., Madison Wis., USA) coding for NPM-ALK and subsequent selection of G418 resistant cells. Non-transfected BaF3 cells depend on IL-3 for cell survival. In contrast, NPM-ALK expressing BaF3 cells (named BaF3-NPM-ALK hereinafter) can proliferate in the absence of IL-3 because they obtain proliferative signal through NPM-ALK kinase. Putative inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase therefore abolish the growth signal and may result in antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity of putative inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase can however be overcome by addition of IL-3, which provides growth signals through an NPM-ALK independent mechanism. An analogous cell system using FLT3 kinase has also been described (see, E Weisberg et al. Cancer Cell; 1, 433-443 (2002)).","The inhibitory activity of the compounds of the invention may be determined as follows. In general, BaF3-NPM-ALK cells (15,000\/microtitre plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtitre plates. Test compounds dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are added in a series of concentrations (dilution series) in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1% (v\/v). After the addition, the plates are incubated for two days during which the control cultures without test compound are able to undergo two cell-division cycles. The growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells is measured by means of YOPRO\u2122 staining [T Idziorek et al. J. Immunol. Methods; 185: 249-258 (1995)]: 25 \u03bcl of lysis buffer comprising 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0, 26.8 mM sodium chloride, 0.4% NP40 and 20 mM EDTA is added to each well. Cell lysis is completed within 60 min at room temperature and total amount of YOPRO\u2122 bound to DNA is determined by measurement using the Cytofluor II 96-well reader (PerSeptive Biosystems) with the following settings: Excitation (nm) 485\/20 and Emission (nm) 530\/25.","The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment and\/or prevention of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes (type I and II) and the disorders associated therewith, respiratory diseases such as asthma or inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders or illnesses, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis), inflammatory eye diseases, e.g. Sjoegren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis or uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.","In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention provides:","(1) a compound of the invention for use as a pharmaceutical;","(2) a compound of the invention for use as an IGF-1R inhibitor, for example for use in any of the particular indications hereinbefore set forth;","(3) a pharmaceutical composition, e.g. for use in any of the indications herein before set forth, comprising a compound of the invention as active ingredient together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers;","(4) a method for the treatment of any particular indication set forth hereinbefore in a subject in need thereof which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising same;","(5) the use of a compound of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a disease or condition in which IGF-1R activation plays a role or is implicated;","(6) the method as defined above under (4) comprising co-administration, e.g. concomitantly or in sequence, of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more further drug substances, said further drug substance being useful in any of the particular indications set forth hereinbefore;","(7) a combination comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more further drug substances, said further drug substance being useful in any of the particular indications set forth hereinbefore;","(8) use of a compound of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a disease which responds to inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase;","(9) the use according to (8), wherein the disease to be treated is selected from anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, neuroblastomas and neoplastic diseases;","(10) the use according to (8) or (9), wherein the compound is any one of the examples, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;","(11) a method for the treatment of a disease which responds to inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, especially a disease selected from anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, non Hodgkin's lymphomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, neuroblastomas and neoplastic diseases, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions","In general, compounds of the invention will be administered in therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents. A therapeutically effective amount may vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, for the treatment of neoplastic diseases and immune system disorders, the required dosage will also vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.","In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.01 to about 100 mg\/kg per body weight, or particularly, from about 0.03 to 2.5 mg\/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, may be in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 2000 mg, or more particularly, from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form.

For example, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent may be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms for oral administration contain, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active substance.","In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are solutions of the active ingredient, including suspensions or dispersions, such as isotonic aqueous solutions. In the case of lyophilized compositions comprising the active ingredient alone or together with a carrier such as mannitol, dispersions or suspensions can be made up before use.

In the reactions described, reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, may be protected to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (see e.g., T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, John Wiley and Sons, 1991).","The compounds of the invention, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals may include for example the solvent used for crystallization (present as solvates). Salts can usually be converted to compounds in free form, e.g., by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogen carbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. A compound of the invention in a base addition salt form may be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc.). In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and those in the form of their salts, including those salts that may be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds, any reference to the free compounds is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding salts, as appropriate.","Salts of the inventive compounds with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of Formula (1), (2), (3) and (4), may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention may be formed, for example, as acid addition salts, with organic or inorganic acids, from compounds of Formula (1), (2), (3) and (4), with a basic nitrogen atom.","Suitable inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, halogen acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid.

For isolation or purification purposes, it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts, for example picrates or perchlorates. For therapeutic use, only pharmaceutically acceptable salts or free compounds are employed (where applicable in the form of pharmaceutical preparations).","Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form may be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80\u00b0 C.","Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the invention may be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example, appropriate prodrugs may be prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound of the invention with a suitable carbamylating agent (e.g., 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).","Protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention may be made by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal may be found in T. W. Greene, \u201cProtecting Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, 3edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999.","Compounds of the invention may be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. Resolution of enantiomers may be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of the invention, or by using dissociable complexes (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and may be readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. The diastereomers may be separated by fractionated crystallization, chromatography, or by separation\/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture may be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, \u201cEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions\u201d, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981.","In summary, the compounds of the invention may be made by a process as described in the Examples; and","(a) optionally converting a compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt;","(b) optionally converting a salt form of a compound of the invention to a non-salt form;","(c) optionally converting an unoxidized form of a compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide;","(d) optionally converting an N-oxide form of a compound of the invention to its unoxidized form;","(e) optionally resolving an individual isomer of a compound of the invention from a mixture of isomers;","(f) optionally converting a non-derivatized compound of the invention into a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug derivative; and","(g) optionally converting a prodrug derivative of a compound of the invention to its non-derivatized form.","Insofar as the production of the starting materials is not particularly described, the compounds are known or can be prepared analogously to methods known in the art or as disclosed in the Examples hereinafter.

drug may be determined constructing a dose-response curve and examining the effect of different concentrations of antagonist on reversing agonist activity. ICvalues may be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration needed to inhibit half of the maximum biological response of the agonist. To calculate ICvalues, a series of dose-response data (e.g., drug concentrations x1, x2, . . . , xn and growth inhibition y1, y2, . . . , yn, the values of y are in the range of 0-1) is generated. ICvalues may be determined by a computer-aided system using the formula:\n\n+(()\/(1+10)\n","where A is the ratio of growth inhibition between lowest drug concentration and control; B is the slope of sigmoidal curvel; and D is the ratio of growth inhibition between highest drug concentration and control.","The ICvalue is given as that concentration of the test compound that results in growth inhibition that is 50% lower than that obtained using the control without inhibitor. The compounds of the invention in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form may exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, for example, as indicated by the in vitro tests described in this application. In general, compounds of the invention have ICvalues from 1 nM to 10 \u03bcM. In some examples, compounds of the invention have ICvalues from 0.01 \u03bcM to 5 \u03bcM. In other examples, compounds of the invention have ICvalues from 0.01 \u03bcM to 1 \u03bcM, or more particularly from 1 nM to 1 \u03bcM. In yet other examples, compounds of the invention have ICvalues of less than 1 nM or more than 10 \u03bcM. The compounds of the invention may exhibit a percentage inhibition of greater than 50%, or in other embodiments, may exhibit a percentage inhibition greater than about 70%, against IGF-1R at 10 \u03bcM.","Ba\/F3 Cell Line Panel and Reagents","Ba\/F3 is a murine IL-3-dependent pro-B lymphoma cell line. Parental Ba\/F3 cells are used to generate a panel of sublines whose proliferation and survival is rendered IL-3-independent by stable transduction with individual tyrosine kinases activated by fusion with the amino-terminal portion of TEL (amino acid 1-375) or BCR. In order to generate Ba\/F3 cell lines transformed by Tel-Tyrosine Kinase (TK) fusions, parental Ba\/F3 cells are infected with a retrovirus harboring each TEL-fusion kinase and subjected to puromycin selection and IL-3 withdrawal to obtain IL-3-independent, transformed Ba\/F3 cells.","Each transformed Ba\/F3 cells are cultured in RPMI-1640 media (Gibco Cat #11875093, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone Cat #SV30014.03, Logan, Utah), 4.5 g\/L glucose (Sigma #G5400, St. Louis, Mo.), 1.5 g\/L sodium bicarbonate (Biowhittaker #17-613E, Walkersville, Md.) and Pen\/Strep (Gibco #10378-016, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells are splitted twice weekly.","Ba\/F3 Cell Viability Inhibition Assay","The potency of test compounds against various Tel-TK transformed Ba\/F3 lines is determined as follows. Exponentially growing BaF3 Tel-TK cells are diluted in fresh medium to 75,000 cells\/mL and seeded into 384-well plates (3750 cells\/well) at 50 \u03bcL\/well using a gill liquid dispenser (BioTek, Winooski, Vt., USA). Duplicate plates are run for each cell line. Test and control compounds are serially diluted with DMSO and arrayed in a polypropylene 384-well plate. 50 mL of compound is transferred into the assay plates using a pin-transfer device, and the plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. (5% CO) for 48 hours. 25 \u03bcL Britelite (Perkin Elmer) is added and luminescence is quantified using Analyst GT (Molecular Devices). Custom curve-fitting software is used to produce a logistic fit of percent cell viability as a function of the logarithm of inhibitor concentration. The ICis interpolated as the concentration of compound needed to reduce cell viability to 50% of a DMSO control. Parental Ba\/F3 cells that are maintained and cultured in presence of IL-3 (1 ng\/ml in final) are diluted in fresh medium containing IL-3 (1 ng\/ml in final) to 75,000 cells\/mL following the same procedure as described above.","Enzymatic HTRF Assay","IGF-1R and INSR (insulin receptor) are purchased from Upstate. Following reagents are prepared in-house; 10\u00d7 kinase buffer (KB) (200 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 100 mM MgCl, 30 mM MnCl, 50 nM NaVO), 10 mM ATP, 100 mg\/ml BSA, 0.5 M EDTA, 4 M KF. Proxiplate-384 from Perkin-Elmer is used for set up assay. All the HTRF reagents including substrate (Biotin-poly-GT (61GT0BLB), Mab PT66-K, (61T66KLB), Streptavidin-XL(611SAXLB)) are purchased from CIS-US, Inc.","The substrate\/ATP mix is prepared by adding ATP (final concentration, 3 \u03bcM) and biotinylated poly-GT (final concentration, 10 ng\/\u03bcl) into 1\u00d7KB, and dispensed into Proxiplate-384 at 5 \u03bcl\/well using gill (Bio-TEK). Serially diluted compounds (in DMSO) are transferred into plate using 50 mL pinhead. 5 \u03bcL of prepared Enzyme mix (enzyme (final concentration, 5 ng\/\u03bcl), mixed with BSA and DTT in 1\u00d7KB) is added to initiate kinase reaction using gill (Bio-TEK). Assay plate is incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Detection mix is prepared by adding both Mab PT66-K and Streptavidin-XLinto 0.5\u00d7KB solution containing KF (final concentration, 125 mM), EDTA (final concentration, 50 mM) and BSA (final concentration, 100 \u03bcg\/ml) in. At the end of reaction, 10 \u03bcL of detection mix is added and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature before measurement. HTRF signal is detected using Analyst-GT (molecular Devices).","Cancer Cell Proliferation Inhibition Assay","For luciferizing cancer cell line, each cell line is transduced by ampholytic retrovirus carrying both luciferase gene and puromycin-resistant gene whose expression is driven by LTR. Briefly, the retroviral vector pMSCV-Puro-Luc is transfected into Phoenix cell line using Fugene6 (Roche) according to manufacturer's instruction. Two days after transfection, supernatant containing virus is harvested and filtered with 0.2 \u03bcm filter. Harvested virus is used immediately or stored at \u221280\u2032C. For infection, cultured cancer cells are harvested and plated (5\u00d710cells\/well in 1 ml medium) on 6-well tissue culture plate. For each well, 3 ml virus supernatant is added together with 400 \u03bcl FBS, 40 \u03bcl 1 M HEPES (pH8.0) and 4 \u03bcl of polybrene (10 \u03bcg\/ml, Specialty media). The plate is centrifuged down for 90 minutes at 2500 rpm for spin-infection and is transferred into an incubator for overnight infection. Next day, infected cell line is transferred into T-75 flask containing fresh medium and incubated for one day. Two days after infection, puromycin is added at the final concentration of 1 \u03bcg\/ml to begin selection. Within 1-2 weeks, puromycin-resistant cell line is established after at least two subsequent splits and is preserved as luciferized stock.","Each cell line is harvested while in log phase growth by trypsinization and diluted in respective media to appropriate density prior to plating. Cells are dispensed using \u03bcFill (BioTeK) at 50 \u03bcl\/well into white walled clear bottom plates (Greiner\u2014custom for GNF). Cells are then placed in 37\u00b0 C. incubator supplying 5% COovernight. Compounds are transferred using 50mL\/well Pintool technology via Platemate (Matrix). Assay plates are then placed back into the incubator for 3 days. On the third day following compound transfer, BRITELITE\u00ae (Perkin Elmer, diluted according to manufacturer's suggestion) is added to assay plates and read on Analyst GT (Molecular Devices) or Envision (Perkin Elmer). Raw data is generated in RLU.","Tumor Activity of Exemplary Compounds","Three to 4\u00d710human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells resuspended in HBSS and mixed in 50% matrigel were injected subcutaneously (0.05 ml\/mouse) into female nude (HsdNpa:athymic\/nu) mice 10-12 weeks of age. Treatments were initiated when the mean tumor volumes were approximately 150-200 mm. Body weights and tumor volumes were recorded three times a week. Tumor volumes were measured with calipers and determined according to the formula length\u00d7diameter\u00d7\u03c0\/6. In addition to presenting fractional changes of tumor volumes over the course of treatments, antitumor activity is expressed as T\/C % (mean change of tumor volume of treated animals\/mean change of tumor volume of control animals)\u00d7100. Efficacy of test compounds was determined by initiating oral dosing on day 19 post-cell injection following randomization of the mice so that each group has similar mean tumor size. Dosing with an appropriate schedule continued for 7 days based on the general health condition of the animals. All test compounds were formulated in NMP\/PEG300 (10:90) and applied daily by gavage. Vehicle consisted of NMP\/PEG300 (10:90). All application volumes were 5 ml\/kg.
