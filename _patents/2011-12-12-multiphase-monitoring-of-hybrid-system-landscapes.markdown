{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A hybrid computer system landscape is characterized by including at least two distinct parts, e.g., separate computer system environments. Typically, one such environment is locally built, e.g., on-premise, and another environment is hosted by a third party. The entities use hybrid computer system landscapes to execute different types of distributed work or business processes across the distinct parts. Thus, a task or a group of tasks of a business process runs locally while another task, group of tasks, or even different parts of the same task of the business process may run at the third party. For example, the mobile workforce of a company needs on-demand access to pertinent data and functionality to facilitate onsite activities related to various business processes. Such pertinent on-demand data and functionality may be hosted by a third party Web-services provider. The same business processes executed on-demand by the mobile workforce may require operations or at least data exchange with the on-premise computer system environment of the company. For example, the on-demand operations of a business process may involve changing the data for a particular customer, registering onsite purchase request, etc. The on-premise operations of the same business process may include updating the customer master data, generating and processing of purchase orders, backend accounting, etc.","Generally, the execution of distributed business processes are characterized with higher risks based from the lack of centralized control over the availability and operability of the hybrid computer system landscapes. Often, the entities maintaining spread business processes are required to ensure a certain level of availability of the different parts of the involved hybrid computer system environments. Therefore, such entities apply various direct and indirect techniques to control the entire business processes distributed across hybrid landscapes. Often, the companies providing the business processes rely on different service-level agreements with the hosting third parties. The only possibility for direct control is based on offline, and usually post-hoc reporting for the planned and\/or encountered availability of the on-demand services.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for multi-phase monitoring of hybrid system landscapes are described herein. Calendar information for planned and unplanned downtimes is collected at a number of computer system environments of a system landscape. According to one aspect, a central computer system environment of the hybrid landscape requests the collected calendar data from a service provider hosting separate computer system environment. According to another aspect, the calendar information received from the service provider is consolidated with the local calendar information. The consolidation of the calendar information could include synchronization of the downtimes of the systems of the local environment with the downtimes of the systems of the hosted environment. According to yet another aspect, the availability of at least one business process executed in the hybrid system landscape is reported based on the consolidated calendar information.","These and other benefits and features of the embodiments will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for multi-phase monitoring hybrid computer system landscapes are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the presented ideas can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","130","110","110","110","100"]},"For example, the company SAP AG is a service provider of a group of on-demand services combine under the trade name Business ByDesign\u00ae. Respectively, SAP AG hosts a computer system environment where an entity may execute a number of business processes. At the same time, SAP AG is a vendor of on-premise enterprise business systems. An entity or company, customer of SAP AG, can build an on-premise computer system environment to execute a number of business processes using the solutions provided by SAP AG. In a hybrid landscape scenario, mobile users may instantiate or execute business processes at an on-demand computer system environment, e.g., managing customer data in customer relationship management (CRM) ByDesign\u00ae system hosted by SAP AG. The same business process may also include backend operations that are processed on-premise systems, such as updating customer records at enterprise resource planning (ERP) business solution provided by SAP AG.","In one embodiment, the hosted computer system environment  includes at least one system  related to business processes. For example, the at least one system may be embodied by a computer system configured to run one or more computer business applications. In one embodiment, such computer business applications can be lightweight on-demand versions of one or more computer business applications run in the on-premise computer system environment. Generally, the term \u201csystem\u201d or \u201csubsystem\u201d, as used in this document, refers to one or more computer applications running on one or more computer system configurations within a computer system environment to provide particular functionality.","The services provided by system  provide functionality corresponding to at least one task or operation of business processes running across the hybrid computer system landscape . Typically, the operations or tasks executed by business process related system  utilize business interface  to exchange data with the other elements of the hybrid computer system landscape . In one embodiment, business interface  exposes the available data and functionality of the at least one system  as a set of various Web-services. Further, the business interface  may provide physical port through which systems  exchange data outside the hosted computer system environment .","Normally, service providers ensure complex and reliable mechanisms for monitoring and managing the operability and availability of the computer system environments they host. Monitoring system  and management system  illustrate components of computer system environment  that are dedicated to monitoring and managing the rest of the components of the service provider environment, including the at least one system . Managing and monitoring may include a variety of automated administrative tasks, depending on the exact implementation of the computer system environment . Generally, such tasks are related to monitoring the availability and performance of the at least one system  related to one or more business processes spread across the hybrid computer system landscape . Therefore, the functionality of system  could be enhanced to provide monitoring and management data to systems  and , respectively.","In one embodiment, monitoring system  and management system  are separate components of the computer system environment  hosted by a service provider. Alternatively, the monitoring system  and the management system  components could be integrated into a single system. Further, one or both of the monitoring system  and the management system  can be part of the at least one system . The different components of the service provider environment  communicate with each other via network .","The computer system environment  is built on-premise, e.g., implemented by the company or entity providing the business processes executed in the hybrid computer system landscape . In one embodiment, the computer system environment  may have a structure and components similar to those of the hosted computer system environment . Similarly, at least one system  is included to execute tasks or operations related to one or more business processes running across the hybrid computer system landscape . The at least one system  utilizes business interface  to expose its functionality, and to exchange requests and data relevant to the distributed business processes with the other elements of the hybrid computer system landscape . Monitoring system  and management system  control the work of the components of the on-premise computer system environment . In one embodiment, the different components of computer system environment  communicate with each other via network . In one embodiment, the monitoring system  and\/or management system  may be integrated with the at least one system , e.g., as additional modules. In one embodiment, a single system or module may be responsible for both monitoring and managing the on-premise computer system environment .","The computer system environment  hosted by a service provider and the on-premise computer system environment  can communicate via medium network . The network  may be based on different network technologies, both on physical connection and on communication protocol level. The natural example for the medium network  is the Internet, but other networks, including mobile and private networks, also can be used as a communication medium between the elements of hybrid computer system environment . Furthermore, according to one embodiment, more than one networks or communication channels, public and\/or private, may compose the medium network .","One or more users  may utilize different client systems  to instantiate or participate in the business processes that are running across the hybrid computer system environment . Client systems  may be selected from a virtually unlimited variety of user interface devices, including personal computers, system terminals, handhelds, etc.","In one embodiment, one or more tasks or operations of a distributed business process may be started at the service provider environment  by a user  through a client system  via medium network . The execution of these operations could result in sending various data, including business requests, to on-premise environment  through business interface . The data relevant to the execution of the distributed business process are received at the business interface  of the on-premise environment , and processed at the at least one related system . As a result of the processing, feedback data, e.g., execution results and\/or further operation requests, may be sent from the on-premise environment  to the service provider environment through data interfaces  and  via medium network . In one embodiment, the hosted environment  may present the results of the execution of the business process to the at least one users  through client systems .","In addition to other functions, the monitoring system  and the management system  observe and control the availability of the systems and subsystems of service provider environment , according to one embodiment. The systems and subsystems of the environment  may include system  related to the executed business processes, business interface , network , etc. For example, system  may encompass a number of subsystems, e.g., printing service, storage service, a number of business and system software applications, etc.","The normal lifecycle of the systems and subsystems of a computer system environment include planned and unplanned downtimes. For example, the one or more business process related systems  are stopped for maintenance, software and hardware upgrades, etc. The same applies to the rest of the components of the computer system environment . Additionally, there are unplanned downtimes that result from hardware and\/or software related problems. In one embodiment, the planned downtimes are scheduled at the management system  and maintained in calendar . The unplanned downtimes are observed by the monitoring system  and may be maintained by the calendar , too. The calendar  could be a module of the management system , or a separate component of the computer system environment , e.g., a system or a subsystem. In one embodiment, calendar  provides service, e.g., Web based, for accessing the maintained calendar data.","Monitoring system  and management system  observe and control the availability of the systems and subsystems of the on-premise environment . The monitoring system  and management system  may collect and maintain controlling information, such as downtime data, for the hardware and\/or software modules and components of the environment . In one embodiment, the monitoring system  and\/or the management system  may collect and store information about planned and unplanned downtimes of the systems and subsystems of the local environment . In one embodiment, the downtime data is maintained by a calendar component. Generally, there is no need to provide service access to the calendar information for the local computer system environment . Therefore, the calendar data for planned and unplanned downtimes may be simply stored as calendar records , e.g., in a database in repository .","It may be useful for an entity to monitor the execution of its distributed business processes across the hybrid computer system landscape. For example, the company where the on-premise computer system environment  is implemented needs to be aware whether and when the relevant systems and subsystems of the hybrid environment  are available. Therefore, according to one embodiment, the service provider environment  is enhanced with calendar interface  to expose calendar service  to the management system  and\/or to the monitoring system  of the on-premise environment . Through the calendar interface , an instant visibility over the availability of the systems and subsystems of the hosted environment  may be achieved at the on-premise environment . In one embodiment, a calendar interface  may be implemented in the on-premise environment  to facilitate the access to the calendar . In one embodiment calendar interface  may expose calendar  as a Web-service.","In one embodiment, the service provider environment  may be enhanced by adding monitoring interface  to enable access to relevant data and functionalities of monitoring system  and\/or management system . Depending on the embodying technology, the monitoring interface  may expose access to a Web-service that can be requested over medium network . In one embodiment, monitoring interface  may be included in the on-premise environment  to transfer requests generated by the management system  and\/or the monitoring system  to the monitoring interface . The monitoring interface  may receive data relevant to the monitoring and management of the service provider environment .","In one embodiment, calendar interfaces  and  and\/or monitoring interfaces  and  may provide separate physical ports through environments  and  exchange calendar and monitoring data separately from the business data exchange. Thus, even if one of the communication channels between the different interfaces, e.g., business, calendar or monitoring, fails, the others could be able to continue communication. In one embodiment, calendar interface  and monitoring interface  could be one and the same component of the hosted computer system environment to provide alternative route for servicing calendar and monitoring requests. Similarly, calendar interface  and monitoring interface  may be a same component of the local computer system environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","205"]},"At , information regarding planned and unplanned downtimes of one or more systems and\/or subsystems hosted at the service provider is received. At , the received information regarding downtimes is imported into the local calendar system or service. In one embodiment, one or more calendar records may be created at the on-premise computer system environment to store the received calendar data for the planned and unplanned downtimes of the service provider environment.","At  it is verified whether there is information for planned local downtimes, e.g., for planned downtimes of the systems or subsystems implemented in the on-premise computer system environment and related to the execution of a distributed business process. According to one embodiment, either of the tasks corresponding to blocks  and , may be omitted. In the latter case, process  may continue directly at  with optimizing the planned local downtimes based on the received information. In one embodiment, whenever there are planned downtimes of one or more of the local systems or subsystems, the periods of these downtimes may be synchronized with the downtimes of the systems and subsystems hosted at the service provider. The planned overall downtime for the hybrid computer system landscape may be further optimized based on different criteria taking into account factors like business hours at different locations, expected load, planned batch operations, etc. The synchronization of the downtime information may be performed on system level and on subsystem level based on various predefined algorithms, depending on the business processes distribution between the parts of the hybrid computer system landscape.","When there are no local downtimes planned, or after the optimization of the downtimes, process  continues at  with consolidating the received information with the local calendar data. The consolidation may involve updating the currently stored calendar records, e.g., in a database repository. At , the consolidated calendar information is reported. A number of reporting techniques may be utilized based on different reporting formats and\/or based on different reporting channels. For example, a special form may be generated for the IT administrator staff. In one embodiment, one or more personalized emails may be created and sent to one or more users executing tasks in the hybrid computer system landscape. Thus, the users may plan their activity according to the availability of the relevant systems and subsystems.","Table 1 included below shows an operable embodiment of a class or protocol for exchanging calendar data regarding downtimes.

Examples of computer readable instructions include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example, an embodiment may be implemented using Java, C++, or other object-oriented programming language and development tools. Another embodiment may be implemented in hard-wired circuitry in place of, or in combination with machine readable software instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","605","655","600","640","655","610","615","610","615","605","615","600","625","630","600","625","630","600","635","600","650","650","600","645","600","620","660","660","660","650","660"]},"A data source is an information resource. Data sources include sources of data that enable data storage and retrieval. Data sources may include databases, such as, relational, transactional, hierarchical, multi-dimensional (e.g., OLAP), object oriented databases, and the like. Further data sources include tabular data (e.g., spreadsheets, delimited text files), data tagged with a markup language (e.g., XML data), transactional data, unstructured data (e.g., text files, screen scrapings), hierarchical data (e.g., data in a file system, XML data), files, a plurality of reports, and any other data source accessible through an established protocol, such as, Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC), produced by an underlying software system (e.g., ERP system), and the like. Data sources may also include a data source where the data is not tangibly stored or otherwise ephemeral such as data streams, broadcast data, and the like. These data sources can include associated data foundations, semantic layers, management systems, security systems and so on.","Although the processes illustrated and described herein include series of steps, it will be appreciated that the different embodiments are not limited by the illustrated ordering of steps, as some steps may occur in different orders, some concurrently with other steps apart from that shown and described herein.
