{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is entitled to and claims priority benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/390,747, filed Jun. 21, 2002, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/398,180, filed Jul. 24, 2002 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/398,287, filed Jul. 24, 2002, each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to a method for screening and identifying compounds that modulate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated messenger ribonucleic acid (\u201cmRNA\u201d) decay by screening and identifying compounds that modulate the post-transcriptional expression of any gene with a premature translation stop codon. A compound that modulates premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of a target gene is identified using standard methods known in the art to measure changes in translation or mRNA stability of the gene product or mRNA of the gene with the premature stop codon. The methods of the present invention provide a simple, sensitive assay for high-throughput screening of libraries of compounds to identify pharmaceutical leads.","Protein synthesis encompasses the processes of translation initiation, elongation, and termination, each of which has evolved to occur with great accuracy and has the capacity to be a regulated step in the pathway of gene expression. Recent studies, including those suggesting that events at termination may regulate the ability of ribosomes to recycle to the start site of the same mRNA, have underscored the potential of termination to regulate other aspects of translation. The RNA triplets UAA, UAG, and UGA are noncoding and promote translational termination. Termination starts when one of the three termination codons enters the A site of the ribosome signaling the polypeptide chain release factors to bind and recognize the termination signal. Subsequently, the ester bond between the 3\u2032 nucleotide of transfer RNA (\u201ctRNA\u201d) located in the ribosome's P site and the nascent polypeptide chain is hydrolyzed, the completed polypeptide chain is released, and the ribosome subunits are recycled for another round of translation.","Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a surveillance mechanism that minimizes the translation and regulates the RNA stability of nonsense RNAs that contain chain termination mutations (see, e.g., Hentze & Kulozik, 1999, Cell 96:307-310; Culbertson, 1999, Trends in Genetics 15:74-80; Li & Wilkinson, 1998, Immunity 8:135-141; and Ruiz-Echevarria et al., 1996, Trends in Biological Sciences, 21:433-438). Chain termination mutations are caused by a base substitution or frameshift mutation changes a codon into a termination codon, i.e., a stop codon that causes translational termination. In nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, mRNAs with premature stop codons are subject to degradation. In some cases, a truncated protein is produced if the premature stop codon is located near the end of an open reading frame.","Certain classes of known antibiotics have been characterized and found to interact with RNA. For example, the antibiotic thiostreptone binds tightly to a 60-mer from ribosomal RNA (Cundliffe et al., 1990, in The Ribosome: Structure, Function & Evolution (Schlessinger et al., eds.) American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C. pp. 479-490). Bacterial resistance to various antibiotics often involves methylation at specific rRNA sites (Cundliffe, 1989, Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 43:207-233). Aminoglycosidic aminocyclitol (aminoglycoside) antibiotics and peptide antibiotics are known to inhibit group I intron splicing by binding to specific regions of the RNA (von Ahsen et al., 1991, Nature (London) 353:368-370). Some of these same aminoglycosides have also been found to inhibit hammerhead ribozyme function (Stage et al., 1995, RNA 1:95-101). In addition, certain aminoglycosides and other protein synthesis inhibitors have been found to interact with specific bases in 16S rRNA (Woodcock et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:3099-3103). An oligonucleotide analog of the 16S rRNA has also been shown to interact with certain aminoglycosides (Purohit et al., 1994, Nature 370:659-662). A molecular basis for hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides has been found to be located in a single base change in mitochondrial rRNA (Hutchin et al., 1993, Nucleic Acids Res. 21:4174-4179). Aminoglycosides have also been shown to inhibit the interaction between specific structural RNA motifs and the corresponding RNA binding protein. Zapp et al. (Cell, 1993, 74:969-978) has demonstrated that the aminoglycosides neomycin B, lividomycin A, and tobramycin can block the binding of Rev, a viral regulatory protein required for viral gene expression, to its viral recognition element in the IIB (or RRE) region of HIV RNA. This blockage appears to be the result of competitive binding of the antibiotics directly to the RRE RNA structural motif.","Aminoglycosides have also been found to promote nonsense suppression (see, e.g., Bedwell et al., 1997, Nat. Med. 3:1280-1284 and Howard et al., 1996, Nat. Med. 2:467-469). Nonsense mutations cause approximately 10 to 30 percent of the individual cases of virtually all inherited diseases. Although nonsense mutations inhibit the synthesis of a full length protein to one percent or less of wild-type levels, minimally boosting the expression levels of the full length protein to between five and fifteen percent of normal levels can greatly reduce the severity or eliminate the disease. Clinical approaches that target the translation termination event to promote nonsense suppression have recently been described for model systems of cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that causes translational misreading and allowed the insertion of amino acids at the site of the nonsense codon in models of cystic fibrosis, Hurlers Syndrome, and muscular dystrophy (see, e.g., Barton-Davis et al., 1999, J. Clin. Invest. 104:375-381). These results strongly suggest that drugs that promote nonsense suppression by altering translation termination efficiency of a premature termination codon can be therapeutically valuable in the treatment of diseases caused by nonsense mutations.","Citation or identification of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that such reference is available as prior art to the present invention.","The present invention provides methods for identifying a compound that modulates premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated \u201cmRNA decay.

Reporter Genes","Any reporter gene well-known to one of skill in the art may be used in reporter gene constructs to ascertain the effect of a compound on premature translation termination. Reporter genes refer to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide that is readily detectable either by its presence or activity. Reporter genes may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the elements determined by any method well-known to one of skill in the art. The nucleotide sequence of a reporter gene can be obtained, e.g., from the literature or a database such as GenBank. Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding a reporter gene may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular reporter gene is not available, but the sequence of the reporter gene is known, a nucleic acid encoding the reporter gene may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g. a cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the reporter gene) by PCR amplification. Once the nucleotide sequence of a reporter gene is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the reporter gene may be manipulated using methods well-known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate reporter genes having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, a reporter gene is any naturally-occurring gene with a premature stop codon. Genes with premature stop codons that are useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the genes described below.

Alternatively, a reporter gene can also be a protein tag, such as, but not limited to, myc, His, FLAG, or GST, so that nonsense suppression will produce the peptide and the protein can be monitored by an ELISA, a western blot, or any other immunoassay to detect the protein tag.

The luciferase genes from fireflies have been well characterized, for example, from the and species (see, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO 95\/25798 for , European Patent Application No. EP 0 524 448 for and , and Devine et al., 1993, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1173(2):121-132 for ). Other eucaryotic luciferase genes include, but are not limited to, the click beetle (, see, e.g., Wood et al., 1989, Science 244:700-702), the sea panzy (, see, e.g., Lorenz et al., 1991, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88(10):4438-4442), and the glow worm (, see e.g., Sula-Newby et al., 1996, Biochem J. 313:761-767). The click beetle is unusual in that different members of the species emit bioluminescence of different colors, which emit light at 546 nm (green), 560 nm (yellow-green), 578 nm (yellow) and 593 nm (orange) (see, e.g, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,475,719; 6,342,379; and 6,217,847, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties). Bacterial luciferin-luciferase systems include, but are not limited to, the bacterial lux genes of terrestrial (see, e.g., Manukhov et al., 2000, Genetika 36(3):322-30) and marine bacteria and (see, e.g., Miyamoto et al., 1988, J Biol. Chem. 263(26):13393-9, and Cohn et al., 1983, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 80(1):120-3, respectively). The luciferases encompassed by the present invention also includes the mutant luciferases described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,265,177 to Squirrell et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In a specific embodiment, the luciferase is a firefly luciferase, a renilla luciferase, or a click beetle luciferase, as described in any one of the references listed supra, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.","5.1.1.2. Green Fluorescent Protein","Green fluorescent protein (\u201cGFP\u201d) is a 238 amino acid protein with amino acid residues 65 to 67 involved in the formation of the chromophore which does not require additional substrates or cofactors to fluoresce (see, e.g., Prasher et al., 1992, Gene 111:229-233; Yang et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnol. 14:1252-1256; and Cody et al., 1993, Biochemistry 32:1212-1218).","As used herein, the term \u201cgreen fluorescent protein\u201d or \u201cGFP\u201d is intended to embrace all GFPs (including the various forms of GFPs which exhibit colors other than green), or recombinant enzymes derived from GFPs which have GFP activity. In a preferred embodiment, GFP includes green fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein cyan fluorescent protein, and blue fluorescent protein. The native gene for GFP was cloned from the bioluminescent jellyfish (see, e.g., Morin et al., 1972, J. Cell Physiol. 77:313-318). Wild type GFP has a major excitation peak at 395 nm and a minor excitation peak at 470 nm. The absorption peak at 470 nm allows the monitoring of GFP levels using standard fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter sets. Mutants of the GFP gene have been found useful to enhance expression and to modify excitation and fluorescence. For example, mutant GFPs with alanine, glycine, isoleucine, or threonine substituted for serine at position 65 result in mutant GFPs with shifts in excitation maxima and greater fluorescence than wild type protein when excited at 488 nm (see, e.g., Heim et al., 1995, Nature 373:663-664; U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,048; Delagrave et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13:151-154; Cormack et al., 1996, Gene 173:33-38; and Cramer et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnol. 14:315-319). The ability to excite GFP at 488 nm permits the use of GFP with standard fluorescence activated cell sorting (\u201cFACS\u201d) equipment. In another embodiment, GFPs are isolated from organisms other than the jellyfish, such as, but not limited to, the sea pansy, ","Techniques for labeling cells with GFP in general are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,491,084 and 5,804,387, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties; Chalfie et al., 1994, Science 263:802-805; Heim et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Beta Galactosidase","Beta galactosidase (\u201cbeta-gal\u201d) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-galactosides, including lactose, and the galactoside analogs o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (\u201cONPG\u201d) and chlorophenol red-beta-D-galactopyranoside (\u201cCPRG\u201d) (see, e.g., Nielsen et al., 1983 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80(17):5198-5202; Eustice et al., 1991, Biotechniques 11:739-742; and Henderson et al., 1986, Clin. Chem. 32:1637-1641). The beta-gal gene functions well as a reporter gene because the protein product is extremely stable, resistant to proteolytic degradation in cellular lysates, and easily assayed. When ONPG is used as the substrate, beta-gal activity can be quantitated with a spectrophotometer or microplate reader.","As used herein, the term \u201cbeta galactosidase\u201d or \u201cbeta-gal\u201d is intended to embrace all beta-gals, including lacZ gene products, or recombinant enzymes derived from beta-gals which have beta-gal activity. The beta-gal gene functions well as a reporter gene because the protein product is extremely stable, resistant to proteolytic degradation in cellular lysates, and easily assayed In an embodiment where ONPG is the substrate, beta-gal activity can be quantitated with a spectrophotometer or microplate reader to determine the amount of ONPG converted at 420 nm. In an embodiment when CPRG is the substrate, beta-gal activity can be quantitated with a spectrophotometer or microplate reader to determine the amount of CPRG converted at 570 to 595 nm. In yet another embodiment, the beta-gal activity can be visually ascertained by plating bacterial cells transformed with a beta-gal construct onto plates containing Xgal and IPTG. Bacterial colonies that are dark blue indicate the presence of high beta-gal activity and colonies that are varying shades of blue indicate varying levels of beta-gal activity.","5.1.1.4. Beta-Glucuronidase","Beta-glucuronidase (\u201cGUS\u201d) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a very wide variety of beta-glucuronides, and, with much lower efficiency, hydrolyzes some beta-galacturonides. GUS is very stable, will tolerate many detergents and widely varying ionic conditions, has no cofactors, nor any ionic requirements, can be assayed at any physiological pH, with an optimum between 5.0 and 7.8, and is reasonably resistant to thermal inactivation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,463, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).","In one embodiment, the GUS is derived from the beta-glucuronidase gene. In alternate embodiments of the invention, the beta-glucuronidase encoding nucleic acid is homologous to the beta-glucuronidase gene and\/or may be derived from another organism or species.","GUS activity can be assayed either by fluorescence or spectrometry, or any other method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,463, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. For a fluorescent assay, 4-trifluoromethylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucuronide is a very sensitive substrate for GUS. The fluorescence maximum is close to 500 nm\u2014bluish green, where very few plant compounds fluoresce or absorb. 4-trifluoromethylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucuronide also fluoresces much more strongly near neutral pH, allowing continuous assays to be performed more readily than with MUG. 4-trifluoromethylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucuronide can be used as a fluorescent indicator in vivo. The spectrophotometric assay is very straightforward and moderately sensitive (Jefferson et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8447-8451). A preferred substrate for spectrophotometric measurement is p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucuronide, which when cleaved by GUS releases the chromophore p-nitrophenol. At a pH greater than its pK(around 7.15) the ionized chromophore absorbs light at 400-420 nm, giving a yellow color.","5.1.1.5. Beta-Lactamases","Beta-lactamases are nearly optimal enzymes in respect to their almost diffusion-controlled catalysis of beta-lactam hydrolysis, making them suited to the task of an intracellular reporter enzyme (see, e.g., Christensen et al., 1990, Biochem. J. 266: 853-861). They cleave the beta-lactam ring of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, generating new charged moieties in the process (see, e.g., O'Callaghan et al., 1968, Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 8: 57-63 and Stratton, 1988, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 22, Suppl. A: 23-35). A large number of beta-lactamases have been isolated and characterized, all of which would be suitable for use in accordance with the present invention (see, e.g., Richmond & Sykes, 1978, Adv. Microb. Physiol. 9:31-88 and Ambler, 1980, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Ser.B.] 289: 321-331, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties).","The coding region of an exemplary beta-lactamase employed has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,205, Kadonaga et al., 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259: 2149-2154, and Sutcliffe, 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 3737-3741, the disclosures of which re incorporated by reference in their entireties. As would be readily apparent to those skilled in the field, this and other comparable sequences for peptides having beta-lactamase activity would be equally suitable for use in accordance with the present invention. The combination of a fluorogenic substrate described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,472,205, 5,955,604, and 5,741,657, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, and a suitable beta-lactamase can be employed in a wide variety of different assay systems, such as are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,459, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","5.1.1.6. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase","Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (\u201cCAT\u201d) is commonly used as a reporter gene in mammalian cell systems because mammalian cells do not have detectable levels of CAT activity. The assay for CAT involves incubating cellular extracts with radiolabeled chloramphenicol and appropriate co-factors, separating the starting materials from the product by, for example, thin layer chromatography (\u201cTLC\u201d), followed by scintillation counting (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,041, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","As used herein, the term \u201cchloramphenicol acetyltransferase\u201d or \u201cCAT\u201d is intended to embrace all CATs, or recombinant enzymes derived from CAT which have CAT activity. While it is preferable that a reporter system which does not require cell processing, radioisotopes, and chromatographic separations would be more amenable to high through-put screening, CAT as a reporter gene may be preferable in situations when stability of the reporter gene is important. For example, the CAT reporter protein has an in vivo half life of about 50 hours, which is advantageous when an accumulative versus a dynamic change type of result is desired.","5.1.1.7. Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase","The secreted alkaline phosphatase (\u201cSEAP\u201d) enzyme is a truncated form of alkaline phosphatase, in which the cleavage of the transmembrane domain of the protein allows it to be secreted from the cells into the surrounding media. In a preferred embodiment, the alkaline phosphatase is isolated from human placenta.","As used herein, the term \u201csecreted alkaline phosphatase\u201d or \u201cSEAP\u201d is intended to embrace all SEAP or recombinant enzymes derived from SEAP which have alkaline phosphatase activity. SEAP activity can be detected by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, measurement of catalysis of a fluorescent substrate, immunoprecipitation, HPLC, and radiometric detection. The luminescent method is preferred due to its increased sensitivity over calorimetric detection methods. The advantages of using SEAP is that a cell lysis step is not required since the SEAP protein is secreted out of the cell, which facilitates the automation of sampling and assay procedures. A cell-based assay using SEAP for use in cell-based assessment of inhibitors of the Hepatitis C virus protease is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,280,940 to Potts et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","5.1.2. Proteins that Regulate the Expression of Reporter Genes","The invention provides a nucleic acid sequence comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a regulatory protein or a component or subunit thereof, which regulatory protein binds to a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene and regulates the expression of the reporter gene. The expression of the full-length regulatory protein or component or subunit thereof is suppressed or inhibited in the absence of a compound that suppresses premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay because of the presence of a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation within the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequence encoding the regulatory protein. The expression of the full-length regulatory protein or component or subunit thereof is, thus, contingent on the suppression of the premature stop codon or nonsense mutation by a compound. As the expression of the reporter gene is regulated by a regulatory element responsive to the full-length regulatory protein, reporter gene expression should only be detected in the presence of a compound that suppresses the premature stop codon or nonsense mutation.","The location of the premature stop codon or nonsense mutation is N-terminal to the native stop codon of the regulatory protein or component or subunit thereof. In a specific embodiment, the premature stop codon or nonsense mutation is at least 15 nucleotides, preferably at least 25 nucleotides, at least 50 nucleotides, at least 75 nucleotides or at least 100 nucleotides from the start codon in the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequence encoding the regulatory protein or a component or subunit thereof. In another embodiment, the premature stop codon or nonsense mutation is at least 15 nucleotides, preferably at least 25 nucleotides, at least 50 nucleotides, at leat 75 nucleotides or at least 100 nucleotides from the native stop codon in the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequence encoding the regulatory protein or a component or subunit thereof. In another embodiment, the premature stop codon in the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequences. In another embodiment, the premature stop codon in the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequence encoding the regulatory protein or a component or subunit thereof is in the context of UGAA, UGAC, UGAG, UGAU, UAGA, UAGC, UAGG, UAGU, UAAA, UAAC, UAAG or UAAU. In yet another embodiment, the nucleotide sequence encoding the regulatory protein or a component or subunit thereof, contains or is engineered to contain two, three, four or more stop codons. In another embodiment, the premature stop codon in the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequences encoding the regulatory protein or a component or subunit thereof is UAG or UGA.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a nucleic acid sequence comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a regulatory protein with a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation. In accordance with this embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence can encode a naturally-occurring gene with a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation or the nucleic acid sequence can be engineered to contain a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation using techniques well-known in the art. In this case, the expression of the full-length regulatory protein regulates the expression of the reporter gene which is detected by techniques well-known in the art or described herein.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a first nucleic acid sequence and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a first fusion protein comprising (or alternatively, consisting of) a DNA binding domain and a first protein, and the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a second fusion protein comprising (or alternatively, consisting of) an activation domain and a second protein. In accordance with this embodiment, the nucleotide sequence encoding the first or second fusion protein may contain or be engineered to contain a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation. The first fusion protein and second fusion protein interact and produce a regulatory protein when the premature stop codon or nonsense mutation is suppressed by a compound. Thus, the production of a functional regulatory protein is dependent on suppression of a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation. In this case, the production of the functional regulatory protein regulates the expression of the reporter gene which is detected by techniques well-known in the art or described herein.","In one embodiment of the invention, the protein that regulates expression of a gene contains domains which are associated with various activities related to transcriptional regulation, including, but not limited to, binding and activation. In one embodiment, a binding domain of a regulatory protein is one that recognizes and specifically associates with a sequence of at least two nucleotides of a nucleic acid. Nucleic acids that can be recognized by a binding domain of a protein, include, but are not limited to, DNA and RNA both single and multiple stranded. In a more specific embodiment, a binding domain can adopt one of a number of conformations or motifs, known in the art, including but not limited to, zinc finger, leucine zipper, helix turn helix and helix loop helix. In a more preferred embodiment, the binding domain protein is one that specifically recognizes a region of a nucleic acid. Such recognition can occur through a number of interactions, including, but not limited to, covalent, hyrophobic and van der Waals. In another embodiment, an activation domain is one that modulates, regulates, enhances, suppresses or controls the expression of a gene. In such an embodiment, the activation domain can modulate, regulate, enhance, suppress or control the expression of a gene by interacting, either directly or indirectly, with other compounds or proteins that are required or involved in gene expression. In one embodiment, such domains can be expressed as proteins that are fused with other proteins suitable for the described assays. For example, in one embodiment, the activation domain of a regulatory protein is expressed as part of a protein or polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid, and the binding domain of a regulatory protein is expressed as a part of a protein or polypeptide encoded by another nucleic acid. In a more specific embodiment, such binding and regulatory domains are expressed as fusion proteins with other proteins with properties that are suitable to the assay. In an example of an embodiment suitable to the described assays, the binding and regulatory domains are expressed on separate fusion proteins with proteins that interact with each other. For example, the binding domain can be expressed as a chimeric protein that is fused to another protein known to associate with another protein that is expressed from a separate nucleic acid and fused to the activation domain. In such an embodiment, a regulatory complex is formed by the association between the binding domain and the activation domain expressed as parts of the described fusion proteins. Interaction between the two domains can be mediated or initiated by a number of means, preferably through inter or intra molecular associations between the parts of the described fusion proteins that are known to interact with one another. Examples of proteins or complexes that contain domains that bind to nucleic acids in addition to possessing regulatory functions include, but are not limited to, GAL4, glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors (GR and ER), Xfin protein, GCN4, and the transcription factor Max in complex with oncogene Myc.","The invention relates to the identification of compounds that modulate premature translation termination or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, using, in some instances, a reporter based assay. The invention provides for the identification of compounds that modulated premature translation termination via a nonsense stop codon in a nucleic acids. Such nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, DNA and RNA. In a more certain embodiment, the nucleic acid is RNA. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid is single stranded. In other embodiments, the nucleic acids are single stranded. In yet other embodiments, the nucleic acids are more than single stranded, e.g., double, triple or quadruple stranded.","5.1.3. Stop Codons","The present invention provides for methods for screening and identifying compounds that modulate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. A reporter gene may be engineered to contain a premature stop codon or may naturally contain a premature stop codon. Alternatively, a protein, polypeptide or peptide that regulates (directly or indirectly) the expression of a reporter gene may be engineered to contain or may naturally contain a premature stop codon. The premature stop codon may any one of the stop codons known in the art including UAG, UAA and UGA.","The stop codons are UAG, UAA, and UGA, i.e., signals to the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis, presumably through protein release factors. Even though the use of these stop codons is widespread, they are not universal. For example, UGA specifies tryptophan in the mitochondria of mammals, yeast, , protozoa, and plants (see, e.g., Breitenberger & RajBhandary, 1985, Trends Biochem Sci 10:481). Other examples include the use of UGA for tryptophan in and, in ciliated protozoa, the use of UAA and UAG for glutamine (see, e.g., Jukes et al., 1987, Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 52:769-776), the use of UGA for cysteine in the ciliate Euplotes aediculatus (see, e.g., Kervestin et al., 2001, EMBO Rep 2001 August; 2(8):680-684), the use of UGA for tryptophan in Blepharisma americanum and the use of UAR for glutamine in Tetrahymena, and three spirotrichs, , and (see, e.g., Lozupone et al., 2001, Curr Biol 11(2):65-74). It has been proposed that the ancestral mitochondrion was bearing the universal genetic code and subsequently reassigned the UGA codon to tryptophan independently, at least in the lineage of ciliates, kinetoplastids, rhodophytes, prymnesiophytes, and fungi (see, e.g., Inagaki et al., 1998, J Mol Evol 47(4):378-384).","The readthrough of stop codons also occurs in positive-sense ssRNA viruses by a variety of naturally occurring suppressor tRNAs. Such naturally-occurring suppressor tRNAs include, but are not limited to, cytoplasmic tRNATyr, which reads through the UAG stop codon; cytoplasmic tRNAsGln, which read through UAG and UAA; cytoplasmic tRNAsLeu, which read through UAG; chloroplast and cytoplasmic tRNAsTrp, which read through UGA; chloroplast and cytoplasmic tRNAsCys, which read through UGA; cytoplasmic tRNAsArg, which read through UGA (see, e.g., Beier & Grimm, 2001, Nucl Acids Res 29(23):4767-4782 for a review); and the use of selenocysteine to suppress UGA in (see, e.g., Baron & B\u00f6ck, 1995, The selenocysteine inserting tRNA species: structure and function. In S\u00f6ll, D. and RajBhandary, U. L. (eds), tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function, ASM Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 529 544). The mechanism is thought to involve unconventional base interactions and\/or codon context effects.","As described above, the stop codons are not necessarily universal, with consideration variation amongst organelles (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts), viruses (e.g., single strand viruses), and protozoa (e.g., ciliated protozoa) as to whether the codons UAG, UAA, and UGA signal translation termination or encode amino acids. Even though a single release factor most probably recognizes all of the stop codons in eucaryotes, it appears that all of the stop codons are not suppressed in a similar matter. For example, in the yeast , nonsense suppression has to be strictly codon specific (see, e.g., Hottinger et al., 1984, EMBO J 3:423-428). In another example, significant differences were found in the degree of suppression amongst three UAG codons and two UAA codons in different mRNA contexts in and in human 293 cells, although data suggested that the context effects of nonsense suppression operated differently in and human cells (see, e.g., Martin et al., 1989, Mol Gen Genet 217(2 3):411 8). Since unconventional base interactions and\/or codon context effects have been implicated in nonsense suppression, it is conceivable that compounds involved in nonsense suppression of one stop codon may not necessarily be involved in nonsense suppression of another stop codon. In other words, compounds involved in suppressing UAG codons may not necessarily be involved in suppressing UGA codons.","In a specific embodiment, a reporter gene or a gene encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide that regulates the expression of a reporter gene contains or is engineered to contain the premature stop codon UAG. In another embodiment, a reporter gene or a gene encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide that regulates the expression of a reporter gene contains or is engineered to contain the premature stop codon UGA. In yet another embodiment, a reporter gene or a gene encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide that regulates the expression of a reporter gene contains or is engineered to contain a premature stop codon in the context of UGAA, UGAC, UGAG, UGAU, UAGA, UAGC, UAGG, UAGU, UAAA, UAAC, UAAG or UAAU.","In a particular embodiment, a reporter gene or a gene encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide that regulates the expression of a reporter gene contains or is engineered to contain two, three, four or more stop codons. In accordance with this embodiment, the stop codons are preferably at least 10 nucleotides, at least 15 nucleotides, at least 20 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides, at least 30 nucleotides, at least 35 nucleotides, at least 40 nucleotides, at least 45 nucleotides, at least 50 nucleotides, at least 75 nucleotides or at least 100 nucleotides apart from each other.

Vectors","The nucleotide sequence encoding for a protein, polypeptide or peptide (e.g., a reporter gene, or a protein, polypeptide or peptide that regulates the expression of a reporter gene) can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i.e., a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein-coding sequence. The necessary transcriptional and translational elements can also be supplied by the protein, polypeptide or peptide. The regulatory regions and enhancer elements can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. In a specific embodiment, a reporter gene is operably linked to regulatory element that is responsive to a regulatory protein whose expression is dependent upon the suppression of a premature stop codon.","A variety of host-vector systems may be utilized to express a protein, polypeptide or peptide. These include, but are not limited to, mammalian cell systems infected with virus (e.g., vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus (e.g., baculovirus); microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, DNA, plasmid DNA, or cosmid DNA; and stable cell lines generated by transformation using a selectable marker. The expression elements of vectors vary in their strengths and specificities. Depending on the host-vector system utilized, any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements may be used.","Any of the methods previously described for the insertion of DNA fragments into a vector may be used to construct expression vectors containing a chimeric nucleic acid consisting of appropriate transcriptional\/translational control signals and the protein coding sequences. These methods may include in vitro recombinant DNA and synthetic techniques and in vivo recombinants (genetic recombination). Expression of a first nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide, such as a reporter gene, may be regulated by a second nucleic acid sequence so that the first nucleic acid sequence is expressed in a host transformed with the second nucleic acid sequence. For example, expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide, such as a reporter gene, may be controlled by any promoter\/enhancer element known in the art, such as a constitutive promoter, a tissue-specific promoter, or an inducible promoter.

In the first approach, the presence of a particular nucleic acid sequence inserted in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to the inserted nucleic acid sequence. In the second approach, the recombinant vector\/host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain \u201cmarker\u201d nucleic acid functions (e.g., thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, transformation phenotype, occlusion body formation in baculovirus, etc.) caused by the insertion of the nucleic acid sequence of interest in the vector. For example, if the nucleic acid sequence of interest is inserted within the marker nucleic acid sequence of the vector, recombinants containing the insert can be identified by the absence of the marker nucleic acid function. In the third approach, recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying the product expressed by the recombinant. Such assays can be based, for example, on the physical or functional properties of the particular nucleic acid sequence.","In a preferred embodiment, nucleic acid sequences encoding proteins, polypeptides or peptides are cloned into stable cell line expression vectors.

In another preferred embodiment, the host cells are immortalized cell lines derived from a source, e.g. a tissue. Other host cells that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, yeast cells, virally-infected cells, or plant cells.","Preferred mammalian host cells include but are not limited to those derived from humans, monkeys and rodents, (see, for example, Kriegler M. in \u201cGene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual\u201d, New York, Freeman & Co. 1990), such as monkey kidney cell line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC Accession No. CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney cell lines (293, 293-EBNA, or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J.

Transformation may be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus and transducing a host cell with the virus, and by direct uptake of the polynucleotide. The transformation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Mammalian transformations (i.e., transfections) by direct uptake may be conducted using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham & Van der Eb, 1978, Virol. 52:546, or the various known modifications thereof. Other methods for introducing recombinant polynucleotides into cells, particularly into mammalian cells, include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the polynucleotides into nuclei.

Such stable cells lines may be generated by introducing a construct comprising a selectable marker, allowing the cells to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched medium, and then growing the cells on a selective medium. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler, et al., 1977, Cell 11:223), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 1962, Proc.

Cell-Free Extracts","The invention provides for the translation of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein, polypeptide or peptide (with or without a premature translation stop codon) in a cell-free system. Techniques for practicing the specific aspect of this invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA manipulation and production, which are routinely practiced by one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition; DNA Cloning, Volumes I and II (Glover, Ed. 1985); and Transcription and Translation (Hames & Higgins, Eds. 1984).","Any technique well-known to one of skill in the art may be used to generate cell-free extracts for translation. For example, the cell-free extracts can be generated by centrifuging cells and clarifying the supernatant. In one embodiment, the cells are incubated on ice during the preparation of the cell-free extract. In another embodiment, the cells are incubated on ice at least 12 hours, at least 24 hours, at least two days, at least five days, at least one week, at least longer than one week. In a more specific embodiment, the cells are incubated on ice at least long enough so as to improve the translation activity of the cell extract in comparison to cell extracts that are not incubated on ice.

No. 4,668,625 to Roberts, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. In a preferred embodiment, the cell-free extract is an extract isolated from human cells. In a more preferred embodiment, the human cells are HeLa cells. It is preferred that the endogenous expression of the genes with the premature translation codons is minimal, and preferably absent, in the cells from which the cell-free translation extract is prepared.","Systems for the in vitro transcription of RNAs with the gene of interest cloned in an expression vectors using promoters such as, but not limited to, Sp6, T3, or T7 promoters (see, e.g., expression vectors from Invitrogen, Carlesbad, Calif.; Promega, Madison, Wis.; and Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), and the subsequent transcription of the gene with the appropriate polymerase are well-known to one of skill in the art (see, e.g., Contreras et al., 1982, Nucl. Acids. Res. 10:6353). In another embodiment, the gene encoding the premature stop codon can be PCR-amplified with the appropriate primers, with the sequence of a promoter, such as but not limited to, Sp6, T3, or T7 promoters, incorporated into the upstream primer, so that the resulting amplified PCR product can be in vitro transcribed with the appropriate polymerase.","Alternatively, a coupled transcription-translation system can be used for the expression of a gene encoding a premature stop codon in a cell free extract, such as the TnT\u00ae Coupled Transcription\/Translation System (Promega, Madison, Wis.) or the system described in U.S. Pat.

Examples of libraries that can be screened in accordance with the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, peptoids; random biooligomers; diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides; vinylogous polypeptides; nonpeptidal peptidomimetics; oligocarbamates; peptidyl phosphonates; peptide nucleic acid libraries; antibody libraries; carbohydrate libraries; and small molecule libraries (preferably, small organic molecule libraries). In some embodiments, the compounds in the libraries screened are nucleic acid or peptide molecules. In a non-limiting example, peptide molecules can exist in a phage display library. In other embodiments, the types of compounds include, but are not limited to, peptide analogs including peptides comprising non-naturally occurring amino acids, e.g., D-amino acids, phosphorous analogs of amino acids, such as \u03b1-amino phosphoric acids and \u03b1-amino phosphoric acids, or amino acids having non-peptide linkages, nucleic acid analogs such as phosphorothioates and PNAS, hormones, antigens, synthetic or naturally occurring drugs, opiates, dopamine, serotonin, catecholamines, thrombin, acetylcholine, prostaglandins, organic molecules, pheromones, adenosine, sucrose, glucose, lactose and galactose. Libraries of polypeptides or proteins can also be used in the assays of the invention. In some embodiments, the compounds are nucleic acid or peptide molecules. In a non-limiting example, peptide molecules can exist in a phage display library.","In a preferred embodiment, the combinatorial libraries are small organic molecule libraries, such as, but not limited to, benzodiazepines, isoprenoids, thiazolidinones, metathiazanones, pyrrolidines, morpholino compounds, and benzodiazepines. In another embodiment, the combinatorial libraries comprise peptoids; random bio-oligomers; benzodiazepines; diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides; vinylogous polypeptides; nonpeptidal peptidomimetics; oligocarbamates; peptidyl phosphonates peptide nucleic acid libraries; antibody libraries; or carbohydrate libraries. Combinatorial libraries are themselves commercially available (see, e.g., ComGenex, Princeton, N.J.; Asinex, Moscow, Ru, Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; ChemStar, Ltd, Moscow, Russia; 3D Pharmaceuticals, Exton, Pa.; Martek Biosciences, Columbia, Md.; etc.).","In a preferred embodiment, the library is preselected so that the compounds of the library are more amenable for cellular uptake. For example, compounds are selected based on specific parameters such as, but not limited to, size, lipophilicity, hydrophilicity, and hydrogen bonding, which enhance the likelihood of compounds getting into the cells. In another embodiment, the compounds are analyzed by three-dimensional or four-dimensional computer computation programs.","In one embodiment, the combinatorial compound library for the methods of the present invention may be synthesized. There is a great interest in synthetic methods directed toward the creation of large collections of small organic compounds, or libraries, which could be screened for pharmacological, biological or other activity. The synthetic methods applied to create vast combinatorial libraries are performed in solution or in the solid phase, i.e., on a solid support. Solid-phase synthesis makes it easier to conduct multi-step reactions and to drive reactions to completion with high yields because excess reagents can be easily added and washed away after each reaction step. Solid-phase combinatorial synthesis also tends to improve isolation, purification and screening. However, the more traditional solution phase chemistry supports a wider variety of organic reactions than solid-phase chemistry.","Combinatorial compound libraries of the present invention may be synthesized using the apparatus described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,619 to Kilcoin et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,619 discloses a synthesis apparatus capable of holding a plurality of reaction vessels for parallel synthesis of multiple discrete compounds or for combinatorial libraries of compounds.","In one embodiment, the combinatorial compound library can be synthesized in solution. The method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,612 to Boger et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, features compounds useful as templates for solution phase synthesis of combinatorial libraries. The template is designed to permit reaction products to be easily purified from unreacted reactants using liquid\/liquid or solid\/liquid extractions. The compounds produced by combinatorial synthesis using the template will preferably be small organic molecules. Some compounds in the library may mimic the effects of non-peptides or peptides. In contrast to solid phase synthesize of combinatorial compound libraries, liquid phase synthesis does not require the use of specialized protocols for monitoring the individual steps of a multistep solid phase synthesis (Egner et al., 1995, J. Org. Chem. 60:2652; Anderson et al., 1995, J. Org. Chem. 60:2650; Fitch et al., 1994, J. Org. Chem. 59:7955; Look et al., 1994, J. Org. Chem. 49:7588; Metzger et al., 1993, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 32:894; Youngquist et al., 1994, Rapid Commun. Mass Spect. 8:77; Chu et al., 1995, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117:5419; Brummel et al., 1994, Science 264:399; Stevanovic et al., 1993, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 3:431).","Combinatorial compound libraries useful for the methods of the present invention can be synthesized on solid supports. In one embodiment, a split synthesis method, a protocol of separating and mixing solid supports during the synthesis, is used to synthesize a library of compounds on solid supports (see e.g., Lam et al., 1997, Chem. Rev. 97:41-448; Ohlmeyer et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10922-10926 and references cited therein). Each solid support in the final library has substantially one type of compound attached to its surface. Other methods for synthesizing combinatorial libraries on solid supports, wherein one product is attached to each support, will be known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Nefzi et al., 1997, Chem. Rev. 97:449-472).","As used herein, the term \u201csolid support\u201d is not limited to a specific type of solid support. Rather a large number of supports are available and are known to one skilled in the art. Solid supports include silica gels, resins, derivatized plastic films, glass beads, cotton, plastic beads, polystyrene beads, alumina gels, and polysaccharides. A suitable solid support may be selected on the basis of desired end use and suitability for various synthetic protocols. For example, for peptide synthesis, a solid support can be a resin such as p-methylbenzhydrylamine (pMBHA) resin (Peptides International, Louisville, Ky.), polystyrenes (e.g., PAM-resin obtained from Bachem Inc., Peninsula Laboratories, etc.), including chloromethylpolystyrene, hydroxymethylpolystyrene and aminomethylpolystyrene, poly(dimethylacrylamide)-grafted styrene co-divinyl-benzene (e.g., POLYHIPE resin, obtained from Aminotech, Canada), polyamide resin (obtained from Peninsula Laboratories), polystyrene resin grafted with polyethylene glycol (e.g., TENTAGEL or ARGOGEL, Bayer, Tubingen, Germany) polydimethylacrylamide resin (obtained from Milligen\/Biosearch, California), or Sepharose (Pharmacia, Sweden).","In some embodiments of the present invention, compounds can be attached to solid supports via linkers. Linkers can be integral and part of the solid support, or they may be nonintegral that are either synthesized on the solid support or attached thereto after synthesis. Linkers are useful not only for providing points of compound attachment to the solid support, but also for allowing different groups of molecules to be cleaved from the solid support under different conditions, depending on the nature of the linker. For example, linkers can be, inter alia, electrophilically cleaved, nucleophilically cleaved, photocleavable, enzymatically cleaved, cleaved by metals, cleaved under reductive conditions or cleaved under oxidative conditions. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are cleaved from the solid support prior to high throughput screening of the compounds.","In certain embodiments of the invention, the compound is a small molecule.","Various in vitro assays can be used to identify and verify the ability of a compound to modulate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Multiple in vitro assays can be performed simultaneously or sequentially to assess the affect of a compound on premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In a preferred embodiment, the in vitro assays described herein are performed in a high throughput format (e.g., in microtiter plates).","5.3.1. Cell-Based Assays","After a vector containing the reporter gene construct and\/or a vector(s) containing a nucleic acid sequence comprising a regulatory protein, a component or a subunit thereof is transformed or transfected into a host cell and a compound library is synthesized or purchased or both, the cells are used to screen the library to identify compounds that modulate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The reporter gene-based assays may be conducted by contacting a compound or a member of a library of compounds with a cell (e.g., a genetically engineered cell) containing a reporter gene construct comprising a reporter gene containing within the open reading frame of the reporter gene a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation; and measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene. The reporter gene cell-based assays may also be conducted by: (a) contacting a compound with a cell containing a first nucleic acid sequence and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene and the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence with a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation that encodes a regulatory protein that binds to the regulatory element of the first nucleic acid sequence and regulates the expression of the reporter gene; and (b) measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene.","The reporter gene cell-based assays may also be conducted by: (a) contacting a compound with a cell containing a first nucleic acid sequence, a second nucleic acid sequence and a third nucleic acid sequence, wherein (i) the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a first fusion protein comprising a DNA binding domain and a first protein, the nucleotide sequence of the DNA binding domain or the first protein containing a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation, (ii) the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a second fusion protein comprising an activation domain and a second protein, the second protein interacting with the first protein to produce a regulatory protein, and (iii) the third nucleic acid sequence comprises a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene, the expression of the reporter gene being regulated by the binding of the regulatory protein to the regulatory element: and (b) measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene. Further, the reporter gene cell-based assays may also be conducted by: (a) contacting a compound with a cell containing a first nucleic acid sequence, a second nucleic acid sequence and a third nucleic acid sequence, wherein (i) the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a first fusion protein comprising a DNA binding domain and a first protein, (ii) the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a second fusion protein comprising an activation domain and a second protein, the nucleotide sequence of the activation domain or the second protein containing a premature stop codon, and the second protein interacting with the first protein to produce a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation, and (iii) the third nucleic acid sequence comprises a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene, the expression of the reporter gene being regulated by the binding of the regulatory protein to the regulatory element: and (b) measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene.","The alteration in reporter gene expression and\/or activity in the reporter gene cell-based assays relative to a previously determined reference range, or to the expression or activity of the reporter gene in the absence of the compound or the presence of an appropriate control (e.g., a negative control such as phosphate buffered saline) indicates that a particular compound modulates premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In particular, an increase in reporter gene expression or activity relative to a previously determined reference range, or to the expression in the absence of the compound or the presence of an appropriate control (e.g., a negative control) may, depending upon the parameters of the reporter gene assay, indicate that a particular compound reduces or suppresses premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In contrast, a decrease in reporter gene expression or activity relative to a previously determined reference range, or to the expression in the absence of the compound or the presence of an appropriate control (e.g., a negative control) may, depending upon the parameters of the reporter gene-based assay, indicate that a particular compound enhances premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.","The step of contacting a compound or a member of a library of compounds with cell in the reporter gene-based assays described herein is preferably conducted under physiologic conditions. In specific embodiment, a compound or a member of a library of compounds is added to the cells in the presence of an aqueous solution. In accordance with this embodiment, the aqueous solution may comprise a buffer and a combination of salts, preferably approximating or mimicking physiologic conditions. Alternatively, the aqueous solution may comprise a buffer, a combination of salts, and a detergent or a surfactant. Examples of salts which may be used in the aqueous solution include, but not limited to, KCl, NaCl, and\/or MgCl. The optimal concentration of each salt used in the aqueous solution is dependent on the cells and compounds used and can be determined using routine experimentation. The step of contacting a compound or a member of a library of compounds with a cell containing a reporter gene construct and in some circumstances, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a regulatory protein, may be performed for at least 0.2 hours, 0.25 hours, 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, at least 1 day, at least 2 days or at least 3 days.","The expression of a reporter gene and\/or activity of the protein encoded by the reporter gene in the cell-based reporter-gene assays may be detected by any technique well-known to one of skill in the art. The expression of a reporter gene can be readily detected, e.g., by quantifying the protein and\/or RNA encoded by said gene. Compounds that modulate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay may be identified by changes in the gene encoding the premature translation stop codon, i.e., there is readthrough of the premature translation stop codon and a longer gene product is detected. If a gene encoding a naturally-occurring premature translation stop codon is used, a longer gene product in the presence of a compound that modulates premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay can be detected by any method in the art permits the detection of the longer polypeptide, such as, but not limited to, immunological methods.","Many methods standard in the art can be thus employed, including, but not limited to, immunoassays to detect and\/or visualize gene expression (e.g., Western blot, immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunocytochemistry, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, or an epitope tag using an antibody that is specific to the polypeptide encoded by the gene of interest) and\/or hybridization assays to detect gene expression by detecting and\/or visualizing respectively mRNA encoding a gene (e.g., Northern assays, dot blots, in situ hybridization, etc), etc. Preferably, the antibody is specific to the C-terminal portion of the polypeptide used in an immunoassay. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody which recognizes the antigen to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1 to 4 hours) at 40\u00b0 C., adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 40\u00b0 C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%-20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody which recognizes the antigen) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., P or I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding a primary antibody (which recognizes the antigen) conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","Methods for detecting the activity of a protein encoded by a reporter gene will vary with the reporter gene used. Assays for the various reporter genes are well-known to one of skill in the art. For example, as described in Section 5.1.1., luciferase, beta-galactosidase (\u201cbeta-gal\u201d), beta-glucoronidase (\u201cGUS\u201d), beta-lactamase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (\u201cCAT\u201d), and alkaline phosphatase (\u201cAP\u201d) are enzymes that can be analyzed in the presence of a substrate and could be amenable to high throughput screening. For example, the reaction products of luciferase, beta-galactosidase (\u201cbeta-gal\u201d), and alkaline phosphatase (\u201cAP\u201d) are assayed by changes in light imaging (e.g., luciferase), spectrophotometric absorbance (e.g., beta-gal), or fluorescence (e.g., AP). Assays for changes in light output, absorbance, and\/or fluorescence are easily adapted for high throughput screening. For example, beta-gal activity can be measured with a microplate reader. Green fluorescent protein (\u201cGFP\u201d) activity can be measured by changes in fluorescence. For example, in the case of mutant GFPs that fluoresce at 488 nm, standard fluorescence activated cell sorting (\u201cFACS\u201d) equipment can be used to separate cells based upon GFP activity.","Changes in mRNA stability of the gene encoding the premature translation stop codon can be measured. As discussed above, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay alters the stability of an mRNA with a premature translation stop codon so that such mRNA is targeted for rapid decay instead of translation. In the presence of a compound that modulates premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the stability of the mRNA with the premature translation stop codon is likely altered, i.e., stabilized. Methods of measuring changes in steady state levels of mRNA are well-known to one of skill in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, Northern blots, dot blots, solution hybridization, RNase protection assays, and S1 nuclease protection assays, wherein the steady state levels of the mRNA of interest are measured with an appropriately labeled nucleic acid probe. Alternatively, methods such as semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) can be used to measure changes in steady state levels of the mRNA of interest using the appropriate primers for amplification.","Alterations in the expression of a reporter gene may be determined by comparing the level of expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene to a negative control (e.g., PBS or another agent that is known to have no effect on the expression of the reporter gene) and optionally, a positive control (e.g., an agent that is known to have an effect on the expression of the reporter gene, preferably an agent that effects premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). Alternatively, alterations in the expression and\/or activity of a reporter gene may be determined by comparing the level of expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene to a previously determined reference range.","5.3.2. Cell-Free Extracts","After a vector containing the reporter gene construct and\/or a vector(s) containing a nucleic acid sequence comprising a regulatory protein, a component or a subunit thereof is produced, a cell-free translation extract is generated or purchased, and a compound library in synthesized or purchased or both, the cell-free translation extract and nucleic acid sequences are used to screen the library to identify compounds that modulate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The reporter gene-based assays may be conducted in a cell-free manner by contacting a compound with a cell-free extract and a reporter gene construct comprising a reporter gene containing within the open reading frame of the reporter gene a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation, and measuring the expression and\/or activity of said reporter gene. The reporter gene cell-free assays may also be conducted by contacting a compound with a cell-free extract and an in vitro transcribed RNA of a reporter gene, wherein the RNA product contains a premature stop codon or a nonsense mutation and measuring the expression and or activity of the protein encoded by the RNA product. Techniques for in vitro transcription are well-known to one of skill in the art or described herein (see, e.g. the Example in section 7). The reporter gene cell-free assays may also be conducted by: (a) contacting a compound with a cell-free extract, a first nucleic acid sequence and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene and the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence with a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation that encodes a regulatory protein that binds to the regulatory element of the first nucleic acid sequence and regulates the expression of the reporter gene; and (b) measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene.","The reporter gene cell-free assays may also be conducted by: (a) contacting a compound with a cell-free extract, a first nucleic acid sequence, a second nucleic acid sequence and a third nucleic acid sequence, wherein (i) the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a first fusion protein comprising a DNA binding domain and a first protein, the nucleotide sequence of the DNA binding domain or the first protein containing a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation, (ii) the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a second fusion protein comprising an activation domain and a second protein, the second protein interacting with the first protein to produce a regulatory protein, and (iii) the third nucleic acid sequence comprises a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene, the expression of the reporter gene being regulated by the binding of the regulatory protein to the regulatory element: and (b) measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene. Further, the reporter gene cell-free assays may also be conducted by: (a) contacting a compound with a cell-free extract, a first nucleic acid sequence, a second nucleic acid sequence and a third nucleic acid sequence, wherein (i) the first nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a first fusion protein comprising a DNA binding domain and a first protein, (ii) the second nucleic acid sequence comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a second fusion protein comprising an activation domain and a second protein, the nucleotide sequence of the activation domain or the second protein containing a premature stop codon or nonsense mutation, and the second protein interacting with the first protein to produce a regulatory protein, and (iii) the third nucleic acid sequence comprises a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene, the expression of the reporter gene being regulated by the binding of the regulatory protein to the regulatory element: and (b) measuring the expression and\/or activity of the reporter gene.","In the cell-free reporter gene assays described herein, the alteration in reporter gene expression or activity relative to a previously determined reference range, or to the expression or activity of the reporter gene in the absence of the compound or the presence of an appropriate control (e.g., a negative control) indicates that a particular compound modulates premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In particular, an increase in reporter gene expression or activity relative to a previously determined reference range, or to the expression in the absence of the compound or the presence of an appropriate control (e.g., a negative control) may, depending upon the parameters of the reporter gene assay, indicate that a particular compound reduces or suppresses premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In contrast, a decrease in reporter gene expression or activity relative to a previously determined reference range, or to the expression in the absence of the compound or the presence of an appropriate control (e.g., a negative control) may, depending upon the parameters of the reporter gene-based assay, indicate that a particular compound enhances premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.","In accordance with the invention, the step of contacting a compound with a cell-free extract and a nucleic acid sequence in the reporter gene-based assays described herein is preferably conducted in an aqueous solution comprising a buffer and a combination of salts (such as KCl, NaCl and\/or MgCl). The optimal concentration of each salt used in the aqueous solution is dependent on, e.g., the protein, polypeptide or peptide encoded by the nucleic acid sequence (e.g., the regulatory protein) and the compounds used, and can be determined using routine experimentation. In a specific embodiment, the aqueous solution approximates or mimics physiologic conditions. In another specific embodiment, the aqueous solution further comprises a detergent or a surfactant.","The cell-reporter gene assays of the present invention can be performed using different incubation times. The cell-free extract and the nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene) can be incubated together before the addition of a compound or a member of a library of compounds. In certain embodiments, the cell-free extract are incubated with a nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene) before the addition of a compound or a member of a library of compounds for at least 0.2 hours, 0.25 hours, 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, or at least 1 day. In other embodiments, the cell-free extract, or the nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene) is incubated with a compound or a member of a library of compounds before the addition of the nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene), or the cell-free extract, respectively. In certain embodiments, a compound or a member of a library of compounds is incubated with a nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene) or cell-free extract before the addition of the remaining component, i.e., cell-free extract, or a nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene), respectively, for at least 0.2 hours, 0.25 hours, 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, or at least 1 day. Once the reaction vessel comprises the components, i.e., a compound or a member of a library of compounds, the cell-free extract and the nucleic acid sequence(s) (e.g., a reporter gene), the reaction may be further incubated for at least 0.2 hours, 0.25 hours, 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, or at least 1 day.","The progress of the reaction in the cell-free reporter gene-based assays can be measured continuously. Alternatively, time-points may be taken at different times of the reaction to monitor the progress of the reaction in the cell-free reporter gene-based assays.","The activity of a compound in the cell-free extract can be determined by assaying the activity of a reporter protein encoded by a reporter gene, or alternatively, by quantifying the expression of the reporter gene by, for example, labeling the in vitro translated protein (e.g., with S-labeled methionine), northern blot analysis, RT-PCR or by immunological methods, such as western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation. Such methods are well-known to one of skill in the art. Examples of assays which can be used to measure the expression and\/or activity of a reporter gene are described in Section 5.3.1 supra.","If the library comprises arrays or microarrays of compounds, wherein each compound has an address or identifier, the compound can be deconvoluted, e.g., by cross-referencing the positive sample to original compound list that was applied to the individual test assays.","If the library is a peptide or nucleic acid library, the sequence of the compound can be determined by direct sequencing of the peptide or nucleic acid. Such methods are well known to one of skill in the art.","A number of physico-chemical techniques can be used for the de novo characterization of compounds that mediate premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.","5.4.1. Mass Spectrometry","The invention provides, in part, for mass spectrometry methods to identify or characterize the compounds of the invention. Any mass spectrometric method can be used, for example, those employing an ionizer, ion analyzer and detector.","A number of techniques can be used in order to ionize a sample for invetigative or characterization purposes. Such techniques form the charged particles required for analysis. Examples of ionization methods include, but are not limited to, electron impact, chemical ionization, electrospray ionization, fast atom bombardment and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization. The technique used for ionization will depend on the type of analyte being examined and the conditions necessary for acquisition. For example, electron impact and chemical ionization would be preferred with a relatively small volatile sample with a mass of 1 to 1000 daltons; electrospray ionzation would be preferred with peptides, proteins and non-volatile samples with a mass of up to 200,000 daltons, fast atom bombardment would be preferred with carbohydrates, organometallics, peptides and nonvolatile compounds and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization would be preferred when examining peptides, proteins and nucleotides.","A number of ion analysis techniques can be used, in particular those where molecular ions and fragment ions are accelerated by manipulation of charged particles through the mass spectrometer. Such analyzers include, but are not limited to, quadropole, sector (magnetic and\/or electrostatic), time of flight (TOF), and ion cyclotron resonance (ICR). The technique used for analysis would depend on the sample and the conditions for acquisition. For example, one might prefer quadropole when desiring a unit mass resolution, fast scan time, and low cost; one might prefer a sector analyzer when desiring high resolution and an exact mass; one might prefer time of flight when desiring no limitation for m\/z maximum and a high throughput; and one might prefer ion cyclotron resonance when desining very high resolution an exact mass and also to perform ion chemistry.","Any ionizer method can be combined with any ion analyzer technique. There are many types of detectors that may be used as part of the mass spectrophotometric methods of the invention, in particular those that produce an electronic signal when struck by an ion. Calibration would be necessarily performed by introducing a well known compound into the instrument and adjusting the circuits so that the compound's molecular ion and fragment ions are reported accurately.","Mass spectrometry (e.g., electrospray ionization (\u201cESI\u201d) and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (\u201cMALDI\u201d), Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (\u201cFT-ICR\u201d) can be used both for high-throughput screening of compounds that bind to a target RNA and elucidating the structure of the compound.","MALDI uses a pulsed laser for desorption of the ions and a time-of-flight analyzer, and has been used for the detection of noncovalent tRNA:amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase complexes (Gruic-Sovulj et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:32084-32091). However, covalent cross-linking between the target nucleic acid and the compound is required for detection, since a non-covalently bound complex may dissociate during the MALDI process.","ESI mass spectrometry (\u201cESI-MS\u201d) has been of greater utility for studying non-covalent molecular interactions because, unlike the MALDI process, ESI-MS generates molecular ions with little to no fragmentation (Xavier et al., 2000, Trends Biotechnol. 18(8):349-356). ESI-MS has been used to study the complexes formed by HIV Tat peptide and protein with the TAR RNA (Sannes-Lowery et al., 1997, Anal. Chem. 69:5130-5135).","Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (\u201cFT-ICR\u201d) mass spectrometry provides high-resolution spectra, isotope-resolved precursor ion selection, and accurate mass assignments (Xavier et al., 2000, Trends Biotechnol. 18(8):349-356). FT-ICR has been used to study the interaction of aminoglycoside antibiotics with cognate and non-cognate RNAs (Hofstadler et al., 1999, Anal. Chem. 71:3436-3440; Griffey et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:10129-10133). As true for all of the mass spectrometry methods discussed herein, FT-ICR does not require labeling of the target RNA or a compound.","An advantage of mass spectroscopy is not only the elucidation of the structure of a compound, but also the determination of the structure of the compound bound to a target RNA. Such information can enable the discovery of a consensus structure of a compound that specifically binds to a target RNA.","5.4.2. NMR Spectroscopy","The invention provides, in part, NMR spectroscopic techniques that may be used, for example, to characterize and identify small and large molecules of the invention. NMR methods are advantageous in understanding characteristics of the compounds of the invention because it allows rapid acquisition of single and multi-dimensional structural data about a compound in solution. Moreover, the NMR technique is a non-destructive technique that also provides dynamic information relating to a compound's behavior in complex or in association with other molecules of interest. There are a variety of techniques that can be used to examine compounds of the invention using NMR methods. In particular, any type of NMR spectrometer can be used, including, but not limited to, those of low, medium and high magnetic field. In a preferred embodiment, the NMR spectrometer that is used has a high magnetic field, in particular, if the compound has a high molecular weight, such as, those greater than 1000 daltons.","Any technique known in the art can be used to acquire data on the compounds and also to produce spectra for interpretation, including, but not limited to, those that measure through bond correlations and through space correlations. Both single and multi-dimensional spectra can be produced. In another embodiment, the technique that is used is homonuclear. In yet another embodiment, the technique is heteronuclear. In one embodiment of the invention, correlation spectroscopy, e.g., COSY or TOCSY, methods are used to measure through bond correlations. In another embodiment of the invention, nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy methods, e.g., NOESY, are used to measure through space correlations. In yet another embodiment of the invention, multi-dimensional methods are used to identify relationships between heterologous nucleii, e.g., heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC).","In another embodiment of the invention, NMR methods are used to characterize compounds that are associated with other molecules. For example, complexed target nucleic acids can be examined by qualitatively determining changes in chemical shift, specifically from distances measured using relaxation effects, and NMR-based approaches have been used in the identification of small molecule binders of protein drug targets (Xavier et al., 2000, Trends Biotechnol. 18(8):349-356). The determination of structure-activity relationships (\u201cSAR\u201d) by NMR is the first method for NMR described in which small molecules that bind adjacent subsites are identified by two-dimentional H-N spectra of the target protein (Shuker et al., 1996, Science 274:1531-1534). The signal from the bound molecule is monitored by employing line broadening, transferred NOEs and pulsed field gradient diffusion measurements (Moore, 1999, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 10:54-58). A strategy for lead generation by NMR using a library of small molecules has been recently described (Fejzo et al., 1999, Chem. Biol. 6:755-769).","Other examples of NMR methods that can be used for the invention include, but are not limited to, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three dimension, four dimensional NMR methods as well as correlation spectroscopy (\u201cCOSY\u201d), and nuclear Overhauser effect (\u201cNOE\u201d) spectroscopy. Such methods of structure determination of compounds are well known to one of skill in the art.","Similar to mass spectroscopy, an advantage of NMR is the not only the elucidation of the structure of a compound, but also the determination of the structure of the compound bound to the target RNA. Such information can enable the discovery of a consensus structure of a compound that specifically binds to a target RNA.","5.4.3. X-ray Crystallography","X-ray crystallography can be used to elucidate the structure of a compound. For a review of x-ray crystallography see, e.g., Blundell et al. 2002, Nat Rev Drug Discov 1(1):45-54. The first step in x-ray crystallography is the formation of crystals. The formation of crystals begins with the preparation of highly purified and soluble samples. The conditions for crystallization is then determined by optimizing several solution variables known to induce nucleation, such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and specific concentrations of organic additives, salts and detergent. Techniques for automating the crystallization process have been developed to automate the production of high-quality protein crystals. Once crystals have been formed, the crystals are harvested and prepared for data collection. The crystals are then analyzed by diffraction (such as multi-circle diffractometers, high-speed CCD detectors, and detector off-set). Generally, multiple crystals must be screened for structure determinations.","A number of methods can be used to acquire a diffraction patter so that a compound can be characterized. In one embodiment, an X-ray source is provided, for example, by a rotating anode generator producing an X-ray beam of a characteristic wavelength. There are a number of sources of X-ray radiation that may be used in the methods of the invention, including low and high intensity radiation. In one example, the tunable X-ray radiation is produced by a Synchrotron. In another embodiment, the primary X-ray beam is monochromated by either crystal monochromators or focusing mirrors and the beam is passed through a helium flushed collimator. In a preferred embodiment, the crystal is mounted on a pin on a goniometer head, that is mounted to a goniometer which allows to position the crystal in different orientations in the beam. The diffracted X-rays can be recorded using a number of techniques, including, but not limited to image plates, multiwire detectors or CCD cameras. In other embodiments, flash cooling, for example, of protein crystals, to cryogenic temperatures (\u02dc100 K) offers many advantages, the most significant of which is the elimination of radiation damage.","5.4.4. Vibrational Spectrscopy","Vibrational spectroscopy (e.g., but not limited to, infrared (IR) spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy) can be used for elucidating the structure of a compound.","Infrared spectroscopy measures the frequencies of infrared light (wavelengths from 100 to 10,000 nm) absorbed by the compound as a result of excitation of vibrational modes according to quantum mechanical selection rules which require that absorption of light cause a change in the electric dipole moment of the molecule. The infrared spectrum of any molecule is a unique pattern of absorption wavelengths of varying intensity that can be considered as a molecular fingerprint to identify or characterize any compound.","Infrared spectra can be measured in a scanning mode by measuring the absorption of individual frequencies of light, produced by a grating which separates frequencies from a mixed-frequency infrared light source, by the compound relative to a standard intensity (double-beam instrument) or pre-measured (\u2018blank\u2019) intensity (single-beam instrument). In a preferred embodiment, infrared spectra are measured in a pulsed mode (\u201cFT-IR\u201d) where a mixed beam, produced by an interferometer, of all infrared light frequencies is passed through or reflected off the compound. The resulting interferogram, which may or may not be added with the resulting interferograms from subsequent pulses to increase the signal strength while averaging random noise in the electronic signal, is mathematically transformed into a spectrum using Fourier Transform or Fast Fourier Transform algorithms.","Raman spectroscopy measures the difference in frequency due to absorption of infrared frequencies of scattered visible or ultraviolet light relative to the incident beam. The incident monochromatic light beam, usually a single laser frequency, is not truly absorbed by the compound but interacts with the electric field transiently. Most of the light scattered off the sample will be unchanged (Rayleigh scattering) but a portion of the scatter light will have frequencies that are the sum or difference of the incident and molecular vibrational frequencies. The selection rules for Raman (inelastic) scattering require a change in polarizability of the molecule. While some vibrational transitions are observable in both infrared and Raman spectrometry, must are observable only with one or the other technique. The Raman spectrum of any molecule is a unique pattern of absorption wavelengths of varying intensity that can be considered as a molecular fingerprint to identify any compound.","Raman spectra are measured by submitting monochromatic light to the sample, either passed through or preferably reflected off, filtering the Rayleigh scattered light, and detecting the frequency of the Raman scattered light. An improved Raman spectrometer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,893 to Fink et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Vibrational microscopy can be measured in a spatially resolved fashion to address single beads by integration of a visible microscope and spectrometer. A microscopic infrared spectrometer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,085 to Reffner et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. An instrument that simultaneously performs a microscopic infrared and microscopic Raman analysis on a sample is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,139 to Sostek et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In one embodiment of the method, compounds are synthesized on polystyrene beads doped with chemically modified styrene monomers such that each resulting bead has a characteristic pattern of absorption lines in the vibrational (IR or Raman) spectrum, by methods including but not limited to those described by Fenniri et al., 2000, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123:8151-8152. Using methods of split-pool synthesis familiar to one of skill in the art, the library of compounds is prepared so that the spectroscopic pattern of the bead identifies one of the components of the compound on the bead. Beads that have been separated according to their ability to bind target RNA can be identified by their vibrational spectrum. In one embodiment of the method, appropriate sorting and binning of the beads during synthesis then allows identification of one or more further components of the compound on any one bead. In another embodiment of the method, partial identification of the compound on a bead is possible through use of the spectroscopic pattern of the bead with or without the aid of further sorting during synthesis, followed by partial resynthesis of the possible compounds aided by doped beads and appropriate sorting during synthesis.","In another embodiment, the IR or Raman spectra of compounds are examined while the compound is still on a bead, preferably, or after cleavage from bead, using methods including but not limited to photochemical, acid, or heat treatment. The compound can be identified by comparison of the IR or Raman spectral pattern to spectra previously acquired for each compound in the combinatorial library.","The invention provides for naturally occurring genes with premature stop codons to ascertain the effects of compounds on premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In general, the expression of the gene product, in particular, a full-length gene product, is indicative of the effect of the compounds on premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.","In a preferred embodiment, the naturally occurring genes with premature stop codons are genes that cause diseases which are due, in part, to the lack of expression of the gene resulting from the premature stop codon. Such diseases include, but are not limited to, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, heart disease (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia), p53-associated cancers (e.g., lung, breast, colon, pancreatic, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian, and esophageal cancer), colorectal carcinomas, neurofibromatosis, retinoblastoma, Wilm's tumor, retinitis pigmentosa, collagen disorders (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta and cirrhosis), Tay Sachs disease, blood disorders (e.g., hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, b-Thalassemia), kidney stones, ataxia-telangiectasia, lysosomal storage diseases, and tuberous sclerosis. Genes involved in the etiology of these diseases are discussed below.","The recognition of translation termination signals is not necessarily limited to a simple trinucleotide stop codon, but is instead recognized by the sequences surrounding the stop codon in addition to the stop codon itself (see, e.g., Manuvakhova et al., 2000, RNA 6(7):1044-1055, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Thus, any genes containing particular tetranucleotide sequences at the stop codon, such as, but not limited to, UGAC, UAGU, UAGC, UAGG, UAGA, UGAA, UGAG, UGAU, UAAC, UAAU, UAAG, and UAAA, are candidates of naturally occurring genes with premature stop codons that are useful in the present invention.

Cystic Fibrosis","Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (\u201cCFTR\u201d) gene.

For example, a phenotypic or physiological readout can be used to assess the premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of the RNA product encoded by the gene of interest in the presence and absence of the lead compound.","In one embodiment, a phenotypic or physiological readout can be used to assess the premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of an RNA product of interest in the presence and absence of the lead compound. In accordance with this embodiment, cell-based and cell-free assays described herein, or in International Publication No. WO 01\/44516 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) may be used to assess the premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of the RNA product of interest. Where the gene product of interest is involved in cell growth or viability, the in vivo effect of the lead compound can be assayed by measuring the cell growth or viability of the target cell. Such assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in a particular disease or disorder (e.g., leukocytes such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils). A lower level of proliferation or survival of the contacted cells indicates that the lead compound is effective to treat a condition in the patient characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Alternatively, instead of culturing cells from a patient, a lead compound may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line or an endothelial cell line. Specific examples of cell culture models include, but are not limited to, for lung cancer, primary rat lung tumor cells (see, e.g., Swafford et al., 1997, Mol. Cell. Biol., 17:1366-1374) and large-cell undifferentiated cancer cell lines (see, e.g., Mabry et al., 1991, Cancer Cells, 3:53-58); colorectal cell lines for colon cancer (see, e.g., Park & Gazdar, 1996, J. Cell Biochem. Suppl. 24:131-141); multiple established cell lines for breast cancer (see, e.g., Hambly et al., 1997, Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 43:247-258; Gierthy et al., 1997, Chemosphere 34:1495-1505; and Prasad & Church, 1997, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 232:14-19); a number of well-characterized cell models for prostate cancer (see, e.g., Webber et al., 1996, Prostate, Part 1, 29:386-394; Part 2, 30:58-64; and Part 3, 30:136-142 and Boulikas, 1997, Anticancer Res. 17:1471-1505); for genitourinary cancers, continuous human bladder cancer cell lines (see, e.g., Ribeiro et al., 1997, Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 72:11-20); organ cultures of transitional cell carcinomas (see, e.g., Booth et al., 1997, Lab Invest. 76:843-857) and rat progression models (see, e.g., Vet et al., 1997, Biochim. Biophys Acta 1360:39-44); and established cell lines for leukemias and lymphomas (see, e.g., Drexler, 1994, Leuk. Res. 18:919-927 and Tohyama, 1997, Int. J. Hematol. 65:309-317).","Many assays well-known in the art can be used to assess the survival and\/or growth of a patient cell or cell line following exposure to a lead compound; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (see, e.g., Hoshino et al., 1986, Int. J. Cancer 38:369 and Campana et al., 1988, J. Immunol. Meth. 107:79) or (3H)-thymidine incorporation (see, e.g., Chen, 1996, Oncogene 13:1395-403 and Jeoung, 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270:18367-73), by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcription, translation or activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers (Rb, cdc2, cyclin A, D1, D2, D3, E, etc.). The levels of such protein and mRNA and activity can be determined by any method well known in the art. For example, protein can be quantitated by known immunodiagnostic methods such as western blotting or immunoprecipitation using commercially available antibodies. mRNA can be quantitated using methods that are well known and routine in the art, for example, using northern analysis, RNase protection, the polymerase chain reaction in connection with reverse transcription (\u201cRT-PCR\u201d). Cell viability can be assessed by using trypan-blue staining or other cell death or viability markers known in the art. In a specific embodiment, the level of cellular ATP is measured to determined cell viability. Differentiation can be assessed, for example, visually based on changes in morphology.","The lead compound can also be assessed for its ability to inhibit cell transformation (or progression to malignant phenotype) in vitro. In this embodiment, cells with a transformed cell phenotype are contacted with a lead compound, and examined for change in characteristics associated with a transformed phenotype (a set of in vitro characteristics associated with a tumorigenic ability in vivo), for example, but not limited to, colony formation in soft agar, a more rounded cell morphology, looser substratum attachment, loss of contact inhibition, loss of anchorage dependence, release of proteases such as plasminogen activator, increased sugar transport, decreased serum requirement, or expression of fetal antigens, etc. (see, e.g., Luria et al., 1978, General Virology, 3d Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, pp. 436-446).","Loss of invasiveness or decreased adhesion can also be assessed to demonstrate the anti-cancer effects of a lead compound. For example, an aspect of the formation of a metastatic cancer is the ability of a precancerous or cancerous cell to detach from primary site of disease and establish a novel colony of growth at a secondary site. The ability of a cell to invade peripheral sites reflects its potential for a cancerous state. Loss of invasiveness can be measured by a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, induction of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Such E-cadherin-mediated adhesion can result in phenotypic reversion and loss of invasiveness (see, e.g., Hordijk et al., 1997, Science 278:1464-66).","Loss of invasiveness can further be examined by inhibition of cell migration. A variety of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cellular matrices are commercially available (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. San Diego, Calif.). Cell migration across or into a matrix can be examined using microscopy, time-lapsed photography or videography, or by any method in the art allowing measurement of cellular migration. In a related embodiment, loss of invasiveness is examined by response to hepatocyte growth factor (\u201cHGF\u201d). HGF-induced cell scattering is correlated with invasiveness of cells such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (\u201cMDCK\u201d) cells. This assay identifies a cell population that has lost cell scattering activity in response to HGF (see, e.g., Hordijk et al., 1997, Science 278:1464-66).","Alternatively, loss of invasiveness can be measured by cell migration through a chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe\/Precision Biochemicals Inc. Vancouver, BC). In such assay, a chemo-attractant agent is incubated on one side of the chamber (e.g., the bottom chamber) and cells are plated on a filter separating the opposite side (e.g., the top chamber). In order for cells to pass from the top chamber to the bottom chamber, the cells must actively migrate through small pores in the filter. Checkerboard analysis of the number of cells that have migrated can then be correlated with invasiveness (see e.g., Ohnishi, 1993, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 193:518-25).","A lead compound can also be assessed for its ability to alter the expression of a secondary protein (as determined, e.g. by western blot analysis) or RNA, whose expression and\/or activation is regulated directly or indirectly by the gene product of a gene of interest containing a premature stop codon or a nonsense mutation (as determined, e.g., by RT-PCR or northern blot analysis) in cultured cells in vitro using methods which are well known in the art. Further, chemical footprinting analysis can be conducted as described herein (see, e.g., Example 7) or also well-known in the art.","5.6.2. Animal Models","Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the lead compounds identified in the nonsense suppression assays described above. The lead compounds identified in the nonsense suppression assay can then be tested for biological activity using animal models for a disease, condition, or syndrome of interest. These include animals engineered to contain the target RNA element coupled to a functional readout system, such as a transgenic mouse.","There are a number of methods that can be used to conduct animal model studies. Briefly, a compound identified in accordance with the methods of the invention is introduced into an animal model so that the effect of the compound on the manifestation of disease can be determined. The prevention or reduction in the severity, duration or onset of a symptom associated with the disease or disorder of the animal model that is associated with, characterized by or caused by premature translation termination and\/or nonsense mediated mRNA decay would indicate that the compound administered to the animal model had a prophylactic or therapeutic effect. Any method can be used to introduce the compound into the animal model, including, but not limited to, injection, intravenous infusion, oral ingestion, or inhalation. In a preferred embodiment, transgenic hosts are constructed so that the animal genome encodes a gene of interest with a premature translation termination sequence or stop codon. In such an embodiment, the gene, containing a premature translation termination sequence or stop codon, would not encode a full length peptide from a transcribed mRNA. The administration of a compound to the animal model, and the expression of a full length protein, polypeptide or peptide, for example, corresponding to the gene containing a premature stop codon would indicate that the compound modulates premature translation termination. Any method known in the art, or described herein, can be used to determine if the stop codon was modulated by the compound. In another embodiment, an animal is transfected with a reporter construct comprising a regulatory element operably linked to a reporter gene so that the expression the reporter gene is regulated by a regulatory protein or subunit thereof encoded by a nucleic acid sequence that contains a premature translation termination sequence or stop codon suppression. In such an embodiment, the animal can be cotransfected with a recombinant vector comprising the nucleic acid sequence encoding the regulatory protein with a premature stop codon. In another embodiment, the animal host genome encodes a native gene containing a premature stop codon. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the animal host is a natural mutant, i.e., natively encoding a gene with a premature stop codon. For example, the animal can be a model for cystic fibrosis wherein the animal genome contains a natural mutation that incorporates a premature stop codon or translation termination sequence.","Examples of animal models for cystic fibrosis include, but are not limited to, cftr(\u2212\/\u2212) mice (see, e.g., Freedman et al., 2001, Gastroenterology 121(4):950-7), cftr(tm1HGU\/tm1HGU) mice (see, e.g., Bernhard et al., 2001, Exp Lung Res 27(4):349-66), CFTR-deficient mice with defective cAMP-mediated Cl(\u2212) conductance (see, e.g., Stotland et al., 2000, Pediatr Pulmonol 30(5):413-24), C57BL\/6-Cftr(m1UNC)\/Cftr(m1UNC) knockout mice (see, e.g., Stotland et al., 2000, Pediatr Pulmonol 30(5):413-24), an animal model of the human airway, using bronchial xenografts engrafted on rat tracheas and implanted into nude mice (see, e.g., Engelhardt et al., 1992, J.

Toxicity","The toxicity and\/or efficacy of a compound identified in accordance with the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). Cells and cell lines that can be used to assess the cytotoxicity of a compound identified in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Caco-2 cells, and Huh7 cells. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. A compound identified in accordance with the invention that exhibits large therapeutic indices is preferred. While a compound identified in accordance with the invention that exhibits toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of a compound identified in accordance with the invention for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","The compounds which display the desired biological activity can be used as lead compounds for the development or design of congeners or analogs having useful pharmacological activity. For example, once a lead compound is identified, molecular modeling techniques can be used to design variants of the compound that can be more effective. Examples of molecular modeling systems are the CHARM and QUANTA programs (Polygen Corporation, Waltham, Mass.). CHARM performs the energy minimization and molecular dynamics functions. QUANTA performs the construction, graphic modelling and analysis of molecular structure. QUANTA allows interactive construction, modification, visualization, and analysis of the behavior of molecules with each other.","A number of articles review computer modeling of drugs interactive with specific proteins, such as Rotivinen et al., 1988, Acta Pharmaceutical Fennica 97:159-166; Ripka, 1998, New Scientist 54-57; McKinaly & Rossmann, 1989, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxiciol. 29:111-122; Perry & Davies, OSAR: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships in Drug Design pp. 189-193 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1989); Lewis & Dean, 1989, Proc. R Soc. Lond. 236:125-140 and 141-162; Askew et al., 1989, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:1082-1090. Other computer programs that screen and graphically depict chemicals are available from companies such as BioDesign, Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.), Allelix, Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and Hypercube, Inc. (Cambridge, Ontario). Although these are primarily designed for application to drugs specific to particular proteins, they can be adapted to design of drugs specific to any identified region. The analogs and congeners can be tested for binding to translational machinery using assays well-known in the art or described herein for biologic activity. Alternatively, lead compounds with little or no biologic activity, as ascertained in the screen, can also be used to design analogs and congeners of the compound that have biologic activity.","The present invention provides methods of preventing, treating, managing or ameliorating a disorder associated with premature translation termination and\/or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or one or more symptoms thereof, said methods comprising administering to a subject in need thereof one or more compounds identified in accordance with the methods of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol.

In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of a target RNA of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.","Compositions comprising the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (\u201ccompound compositions\u201d) can additionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient.","In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, mammals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201cvehicle\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered. Such pharmaceutical vehicles can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical vehicles can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. When administered to a patient, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles are preferably sterile. Water is a preferred vehicle when the compound of the invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. Compound compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.","Compound compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Alfonso R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co. Easton, Pa., 19th ed., 1995, pp. 1447 to 1676, incorporated herein by reference.","In a preferred embodiment, the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions may contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order-delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions may also include a solubilizing agent.","In another embodiment, the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be formulated for intravenous administration. Compositions for intravenous administration may optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water-free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The amount of a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof that will be effective in the treatment of a particular disease will depend on the nature of the disease, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. However, suitable dosage ranges for oral administration are generally about 0.001 milligram to about 500 milligrams of a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof per kilogram body weight per day. In specific preferred embodiments of the invention, the oral dose is about 0.01 milligram to about 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, more preferably about 0.1 milligram to about 75 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, more preferably about 0.5 milligram to 5 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. The dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one compound is administered, or if a compound is administered with a therapeutic agent, then the preferred dosages correspond to the total amount administered. Oral compositions preferably contain about 10% to about 95% active ingredient by weight.","Suitable dosage ranges for intravenous (i.v.) administration are about 0.01 milligram to about 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, about 0.1 milligram to about 35 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, and about 1 milligram to about 10 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.01 pg\/kg body weight per day to about 1 mg\/kg body weight per day. Suppositories generally contain about 0.01 milligram to about 50 milligrams of a compound of the invention per kilogram body weight per day and comprise active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight.","Recommended dosages for intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, epidural, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal administration or administration by inhalation are in the range of about 0.001 milligram to about 200 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. Suitable doses for topical administration are in the range of about 0.001 milligram to about 1 milligram, depending on the area of administration. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Such animal models and systems are well known in the art.","The compound and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are preferably assayed in vitro and in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays can be used to determine whether it is preferable to administer the compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and\/or another therapeutic agent. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate safety and efficacy.","This Example describes a method of preparing a cell extract to perform in vitro translation reactions to monitor nonsense suppression or to produce proteins in vitro. This method is different from other methods used to prepare translation extracts for several reasons. First, the centrifugation step is performed at low speed (12000\u00d7g) compared to most other protocols that use a 100,000\u00d7g spin; and second, the cells are incubated on ice for several hours to weeks, which increases the activity of the extract significantly.","HeLa S3 cells were grown to a density of 10cells\/ml in DMEM; 5% CO, 10% FBS, 1\u00d7P\/S in a spinner flask. Cells were harvested by spinning at 1000\u00d7g. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. The cell pellet sat on ice for 12 to 24 hours before proceeding. By letting the cells sit on ice, the activity of the extract is increased two-fold. The length of time on ice can range from 0 hours to 1 week. The cells were resuspended in 1.5 volumes (packed cell volume) of hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES (KOH) pH 7.4; 15 mM KCl; 1.5 mM Mg(OAc); 0.5 mM Pefabloc (Roche); 2 mM DTT). Cells were allowed to swell for 5 minutes on ice and dounce homogenized with 10 to 100 strokes using a tight-fitting pestle. The cells were spun for 10 minutes at 12000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was carefully collected with a Pasteur pipet without disturbing the lipid layer and transferred into Eppendorf tubes (50-200 mL aliquots) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  shows the amount of wild-type luciferase produced in an in vitro translation reaction when the amount of wild-type luciferase RNA and the amount of HeLa cell extract are varied.  shows the amount of wild-type luciferase produced in an in vitro translation reaction when the amount of luciferase RNA containing the nonsense mutation RGA and the amount of the cell are varied.","As shown in , incubating cells on ice prior to preparation of the translation extract improves the translation activity up to 20 fold. Further, in the presence of the aminoglycoside gentamicin, nonsense suppression activity (as measured by the amount of luciferase activity produced from a luciferase RNA containing a UGA premature termination codon) is increased 2 to 3 fold above untreated extracts (see ). These results demonstrate that extracts prepared by this method actively translate wild type RNA as well as mediate nonsense suppression.","Two assays were developed for use in high throughput screens to identify small molecules that promote nonsense suppression. Each assay utilized luciferase because it is a functional reporter gene assay (light is only produced if the protein is functional) and it is extremely sensitive (Light intensity is proportional to luciferase concentration in the nM range). The first assay was a cell-based luciferase reporter assay and the second was a biochemical assay consisting of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and a nonsense-containing luciferase reporter mRNA. In the cell-based assay, a luciferase reporter construct containing a UGA premature termination codon was stably transfected in 293T Human Embryonic Kidney cells. In the biochemical assay, mRNA containing a UGA premature termination codon was used as a reporter in an in vitro translation reaction using rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with tRNA, hemin, creatine kinase, amino acids, KOAc, Mg(OAc), and creatine phosphate. Translation of the mRNA was initiated within a virus derived leader sequence, which significantly reduced the cost of the assay because capped RNA was not required. Synthetic mRNA was prepared in vitro using the T7 promoter and the MegaScript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). In both of the biochemical and cell-based assays, addition of gentamicin, a small molecule known to allow readthrough of premature termination codons, resulted in increased luciferase activity and was, therefore, used as an internal standard.","The assays described above in Section 7.1 were used in two high throughput screens. Approximately eight hundred thousand compounds were screened in the cell-based and biochemical assays. From these initial screens two hundred hits were retested with both luciferase assays and seven compounds were subsequently selected for further investigation. These compounds fall into four classes of scaffolds. One class of compound is a nucleoside analog; the second class is a quinazoline compound; the third class is an oxadiazole compound similar to diarylfuran antibiotics; and the final class is a unique scaffold harboring one or more phenyl, amide, or similar functional groups. Interestingly, none of the compounds are similar in structure to gentamicin. Compound A (molecular formula CHNO), a member of the fourth class and Compound B (molecular formula CHNO), a compound synthesized independently of the screen, because of its potential RNA binding properties were the focus of subsequent attention.","Based on the results of the high throughput screen, Compound A was characterized further with the in vitro luciferase nonsense suppression assay. To ensure that the observed nonsense suppression activity of the selected compounds was not limited to the rabbit reticulocyte assay system, HeLa cell extract was prepared and optimized (Lie & Macdonald, 1999, Development 126(22):4989-4996 and Lie & Macdonald, 2000, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 270(2):473-481).  shows that Compound A and Compound B exhibit greater nonsense suppression activity of the UGA codon than gentamicin in the HeLa cell translation extracts.","Compound A and Compound B increase the level of nonsense suppression in the biochemical assay three to four fold over untreated extracts. To determine whether these compounds also function in vivo, a stable cell line harboring the UGA nonsense-containing luciferase gene was treated with each compound. Cells were grown in standard medium supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P\/S) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to 70% confluency and split 1:1 the day before treatment. On the following day, cells were trypsinized and 40,000 cells were added to each well of a 96-well tissue culture dish. Serial dilutions of each compound were prepared to generate a six-point dose response curve spanning 2 logs (30 \u03bcM to 0.3 \u03bcM). The final concentration of the DMSO solvent remained constant at 1% in each well. Cells treated with 1% DMSO served as the background standard, and cells treated with gentamicin served as a positive control. As shown in , these two compounds are more potent and efficacious than gentamicin at these concentrations.","Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids harboring the UGA, UAA or UAG nonsense alleles of luciferase in each codon context (UGAA, UGAC, UGAG, UGAU, UAGA, UAGC, UAGG, UAGU, UAAA, UAAC, UAAG, and UAAU) then the cells were treated overnight with Compound A, and gentamicin. The following day, the level of suppression was determined by measuring the amount of luminescence produced. The fold suppression above control cells treated with solvent was calculated and is numerically reported. The results are presented in Table 2 and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0295","num":"0294"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Gentamicin","Compound A"]},{"entry":[{},"Context","3 mg\/ml","10 uM"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"UAAA","0.71","0.17"]},{"entry":[{},"UAAC","2.32","0.67"]},{"entry":[{},"UAAG","0.01","0.02"]},{"entry":[{},"UAAU","0.92","0.33"]},{"entry":[{},"UAGA","1.31","0.64"]},{"entry":[{},"UAGC","2.16","3.05"]},{"entry":[{},"UAGG","0.64","0.51"]},{"entry":[{},"UAGU","0.54","0.31"]},{"entry":[{},"UGAA","0.76","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"UGAC","1.91","2.96"]},{"entry":[{},"UGAG","0.45","0.23"]},{"entry":[{},"UGAU","6.74","1.67"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Previous studies have demonstrated that gentamicin and other members of the aminoglycoside family that decrease the fidelity of translation bind to the A site of the 16S rRNA. By chemical footprinting, UV cross-linking and NMR, gentamicin has been shown to bind at the A site (comprised of nucleotides 1400-1410 and 1490-1500, numbering) of the rRNA at nucleotides 1406, 1407, 1494, and 1496 (Moazed & Noller, 1987, Nature 327(6121):389-394; Woodcock et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10(10):3099-3103; and Schroeder et al., 2000). These observations prompted us to determine whether similar experiments could provide information on the mechanism of action of Compound A. To do this, ribosomes prepared from HeLa cells were incubated with the small molecules (at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM), followed by treatment with chemical modifying agents (dimethyl sulfate [DMS] and kethoxal [KE]). Following chemical modification, rRNA was phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, analyzed in primer extension reactions using end-labeled oligonucleotides hybridizing to different regions of the three rRNAs and resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels. The probes used for primer extension cover the entire 18S (7 oligonucleotide primers), 28S (24 oligonucleotide primers), and 5S (one primer) rRNAs. Controls in these experiments include DMSO (a control for changes in rRNA accessibility induced by DMSO), paromomycin (a marker for 18S rRNA binding), and anisomycin (a marker for 28S rRNA binding).","The results of these foot-printing experiments indicated that Compound A alters the accessibility of the chemical modifying agents to specific nucleotides in the 28S rRNA. More specifically, the regions protected by Compound A include: (1) a conserved region in the vicinity of the peptidyl transferase center (domain V) implicated in peptide bond formation (see ) and (2) a conserved region in domain II that may interact with the peptidyl transferase center based on binding of vemamycmin B to both these areas (Vannuffel et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 22(21):4449-4453; see ).","To address the effects of the nonsense-suppressing compounds on mRNAs altered in specific inherited diseases, a bronchial epithelial cell line harboring a nonsense codon at amino acid 1282 (W1282X) was treated with Compound A (20 \u03bcM) and CFTR function was monitored as a cAMP-activated chloride channel using the SPQ assay (Yang et al., 1993, Hum Mol Genet. 2(8):1253-1261 and Howard et al., 1996, Nat Med. 2(4):467-469). These experiments showed that cAMP treatment of these cells resulted in an increase in SPQ fluorescence, consistent with stimulation of CFTR-mediated halide efflux (). No increase in fluorescence was observed when cells were not treated with compound or if the cells were not stimulated with cAMP. These results indicate that the full-length CFTR expressed from this nonsense-containing allele following compound treatment also functions as a cAMP-stimulated anion channel, thus demonstrating that cystic fibrosis cell lines increase chloride channel activity when treated with Compound A.","The mutation in the mdx mouse that premature termination of the 427 kDa dystrophin polypeptide has been shown to be a C to T transition at position 3185 in exon 23 (Sicinski et al., 1989, Science. 244(4912):1578-1580). Mouse primary skeletal muscle cultures derived from 1-day old mdx mice were prepared as described previously (Barton-Davis et al., 1999, J Clin Invest. 104(4):375-381). Cells were cultured for 10 days in the presence of Compound A (20 \u03bcM). Culture medium was replaced every four days and the presence of dystrophin in myoblast cultures was detected by immunostaining as described previously (Barton-Davis et al., 1999, J Clin Invest. 104(4):375-381). A primary monoclonal antibody to the C-terminus of the dystrophin protein (F19A12) was used undiluted and rhodamine conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The F19A12 antibody will detect the full-length protein produced by suppression of the nonsense codon. Staining was viewed using a Leica DMR micropscope, digital camera, and associated imaging software at the University of Pennsylvania. As shown in , full-length dystrophin protein is produced and localized to the muscle myotubes in cultures treated with 20 \u03bcM Compound A and gentamicin (200 \u03bcM). In addition, cells from untreated cultures exhibited minimal staining. These results indicate that full-length dystrophin protein is produced as a consequence of nonsense suppression.","Since the results of the mdx cell culture experiments demonstrated production of full-length dystrophin in cells treated with Compound A, it was asked whether suppression of the nonsense codon in the mdx mouse could be observed. As previously described (Barton-Davis et al., 1999, J Clin Invest. 104(4):375-381), compound was delivered by Alzet osmotic pumps implanted under the skin of anesthetized mice. Two doses of Compound A were administered. Gentamicin served as a positive control and pumps filled with solvent only served as the negative control. Pumps were loaded with appropriate compound such that the calculated doses to which tissue was exposed were 10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM. The gentamicin concentration was calculated to achieve tissue exposure of approximately 200 \u03bcM. In the initial experiment, mice were treated for 14 days, after which animals were anesthetized with ketamine and exsanguinated. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the experimental animals was then excised, frozen, and used for immunofluorescence analysis of dystrophin incorporation into striated muscle. The presence of dystrophin in TA muscles was detected by immunostaining, as described previously (Barton-Davis et al., 1999, J Clin Invest. 104(4):375-381; see mdx primary cells in Section 7.8 supra). As shown in , these experiments demonstrated that mice treated with both concentrations of compound elicited production of full-length dystrophin. Importantly, a significant portion of the full-length dystrophin protein was properly localized to the membrane. These important results demonstrate that Compound A can function in an animal model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0301","num":"0300"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Genes, Locations and Genetic Disorders on Chromosome 1"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Gene","GDB Accession ID","OMIM Link"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ABCA4","GDB: 370748","MACULAR DEGENERATION, SENILE"]},{"entry":[{},{},"STARGARDT DISEASE 1;
