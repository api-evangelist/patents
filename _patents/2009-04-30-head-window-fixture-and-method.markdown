Description of the Prior Art","During manufacture of a head window for a submarine periscope system, a critical thickness space should be established between the glass window and the wall of a frame for the glass window. The critical thickness space forms a gap that cushions the head window against sea pressures. Uniform thickness of the critical thickness space is essential.","The following U.S. patents describe various prior art fixtures.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,146, issued Mar. 28, 1962, to D. S. George, provides a precision stage assembly for an optical microscope which comprises an outer frame adapted to be rigidly mounted on the main structure of an optical microscope, an inner frame for carrying an X and Y traverse device on which a specimen may be carried, an intermediate frame between the inner and outer frames adjustable relative to the outer frame by a coarse focus drive, and releasable clamping means for rigidly clamping together the intermediate and outer frames, the inner frame being adjustable relative to the intermediate frame by a fine focus control mechanism and the inner frame being located with reference to the intermediate frame such that significant relative movement therebetween is restricted to movement in a vertical direction. The George reference concerns specific application of controlled two axis movement of a stage of a microscope. The third axis is that of the microscope itself. The cited reference does not discuss any kind of process of forming a cushion.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,349, issued Nov. 14, 1989, to D. A. Woodward, discloses a ceramic substrate held in position, while being processed, by vacuum. The substrate is positioned on an intermediate plate and held down by a vacuum. The intermediate plate is supported on an air bearing while being moved into correct location on a support member, after which the intermediate plate is held in position by a vacuum. The locating of the intermediate plate can be caused to move into position during movement of the support member to a processing position. As such, the cited reference uses vacuum technology and air bearings to support and position ceramic substrates. The reference does not discuss the means by which positioning is controlled, nor a process for use and fabrication of a cushion.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,894, issued Jan. 25, 1994, to Witcraft et al., discloses a fixture which includes a lower base for supporting and protecting the front surface of a semiconductor wafer and a clamp. The lower base has an upper end having a central surface portion recessed from a peripheral surface portion for supporting by means of an O ring the peripheral portion of the front surface of the wafer. The clamp rests on a peripheral portion of the back surface of the wafer with the remaining back surface exposed to the backside etching process. A pin and hole arrangement help align the clamp to the base. Holes in the base equalize pressure on both sides of the wafer.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,400,674, issued Mar. 28, 1994, to Arnone et al., discloses a precision component mounting and positioning apparatus with a frame member and a stage member suspended in the frame member.
