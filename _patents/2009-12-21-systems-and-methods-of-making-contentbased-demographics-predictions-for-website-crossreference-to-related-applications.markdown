abstract: Systems and methods for making demographic predictions for websites and web-pages. Embodiments include a system and a method of making demographic predictions for websites. The system and method select one or more websites with known demographic attributes for use as training websites, obtain demographic attributes data of the training websites, determine first features of web-pages of the training websites and develop a prediction model using the determined first features and the obtained demographic attributes data. The prediction model predicts one or more values for a target demographic attribute. The system and method determine second features of web-pages of a target website and apply the prediction model to the determined second features of the target website to predict one or more values for the target demographic attribute of the target website.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/139,422, filed on Dec. 19, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/233,789, filed on Aug. 13, 2009, the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","Demographics play an important role in web advertising, web searching and generally the personalization of web applications. Applications like web search engines might adjust the ranking of search results based on the demographic attributes of a user like age, gender and occupation. Another important domain where demographics play an important role is online advertising. With the growth of web usage, online advertising is growing rapidly in recent years. In particular, contextual advertising is becoming popular. Behavior targeting using demographic attributes helps advertisers to target specific users with demographic relevant advertisements.","One approach to obtain demographics of a website is through panel studies similar to that of TV program rating. In this approach, panels with known demographic information are recruited and their browsing histories are recorded. These browsing histories of panels with different demographic attributes are used to compute demographics of websites. However, this approach requires impractically large sizes of panels to guarantee any reasonable coverage of websites. Additionally, if a site is not visited by any of the panels, then the demographics of the website cannot be estimated.","Another approach to obtain demographics of a particular website is by using information provided by that website's registered visitors or by asking some of its visitors to participate in online surveys. These techniques capture information only about the limited subset of visitors that have chosen to register and\/or participate in the surveys. In addition, since not all segments of a website's visitors are equally likely to participate in the above activities, the resulting information is subjected to a sampling bias. Furthermore, since each individual can potentially register and\/or take the surveys multiple times, the demographics obtained via this approach may not be accurate. Additionally, since the information provided by the visitors during registration or during their participation in surveys can potentially be used to describe and\/or identify them, their use for any other purpose other than the one intended, represents a potential intrusion upon a user's expectation of privacy.","Another approach is to build a computational or statistical model to predict a website's demographic information. The existing approaches for building such models use data obtained by tracking users' browsing behavior across different websites, information about the content of the web-pages that the users visit, and information associated with the users' profile. The profile of a user (or a group of users) is often constructed by integrating various elements across different websites and contains information related to any data provided during registration, web-pages viewed, products purchased, advertisement clicked, etc. With the growing concern regarding privacy on the Internet, people are reluctant to share their personal data, and therefore, the applicability of existing approaches relying on such personal data can be limited.","Due to the combination of the above factors, and other factors, the methods in use today for characterizing the audience characteristics of websites are limited in their accuracy, their ability to cover a large number of websites with substantial audience traffic, and the failure to protect a user's right to information privacy.","Systems and methods provide many advantages over the prior art. Embodiments include a system and method of making demographic predictions for websites and\/or web-pages. The system or method selects one or more websites with known demographic attributes for use as training websites, obtains demographic attributes data of the training websites, determines features of web-pages of the training websites and develops a prediction model using the determined features of web-pages of the training websites and the obtained demographic attributes data. The prediction model predicts one or more values for a target demographic attribute. The system or method determines features of web-pages of a target website and applies the prediction model to the determined features of web-pages of the target website to predict one or more values for the target demographic attribute of the target website.","Embodiments further include a system and method of making demographic predictions for websites. The system or method includes developing a prediction model using extracted features and demographic attributes data of a set of training websites, determining features of web-pages of a target website, and applying the prediction model to the determined features of the target website to predict one or more values for the target demographic attribute of the target website.","Embodiments further include a system and method of making demographic predictions for websites. The system or method identifies one or more websites with known demographic characteristics as training websites and compares a first set of features of the training websites to a second set of features of one or more target websites.","Embodiments further include a system and method of making demographic predictions for websites that may obtain demographic attributes data of a set of training websites, determine first features of web-pages the set of training websites, correlate the determined first features of web-pages the set of training websites and the obtained demographic attributes data of the set of training websites, determine second features of web-pages of a target website, and predict values of a second demographic attribute of the target website based on the correlating.","Likewise, embodiments include a computer readable medium comprising instructions stored thereon that may be executed by a computer for making demographic predictions for websites without using user information for the websites by developing a prediction model using extracted features and demographic attributes data of a set of training websites, determining features of web-pages of a target website, and applying the prediction model to the determined features of the target website to predict one or more values for the target demographic attribute of the target website.","Additionally, embodiments include a system for making demographic predictions for websites. The system may include a processor, a memory, and a network connection for connecting to a network and accessing training and target websites. The memory includes instructions stored thereon that are executed by the processor for making content-based demographic predictions for websites without using user information for the websites by developing a prediction model using extracted features and demographic attributes data of a set of training websites, determining features of web-pages of the target website, and applying, utilizing the processor, the prediction model to the determined features of the target website to predict the target demographic attribute of the target website.","Described herein are systems for and methods of making content-based demographic predictions for websites. Embodiments predict demographic attributes of websites based solely on the content of the websites. As used herein in, embodiments of the systems and methods, a website's content may include many features that may be extracted from the website's web-pages, including the textual features of the website's web-pages, the structural features of the website's web-pages, the type and category of the website, the intra- and inter-web-page and website linkage structure, the features of web-page(s) and website(s) linked to by the website's web-pages, the hyper-text markup language (\u201cHTML\u201d) of the website's web-pages, the HTML of a subset of the web-pages that link to the website's web-pages (in-links) (both from the same website or different websites), and the HTML of the web-pages that are linked by the website's web-pages (out-links) The predicted demographic attributes of a website are the expected demographic attributes of the users of the website, typically expressed as a percentage of users that have a particular demographic characteristic or fall within a particular demographic (e.g., a prediction that 55% of a website's users will be male, 45% female). Note, throughout this application, the persons that visit a website or a web-page are referred to as users, visitors, people, persons, audience, and in other manners. It is to be understood that these terms are used interchangeably and should be understood to mean the persons, whether individually or collectively and in the broadest sense, that access one or more web-pages of a website or a specific web-page, e.g., via navigating to the URL of the web-page(s) on an Internet browser on a computer, mobile device, etc.","Embodiments avoid disadvantages of the prior art, including without limitation the prior art disadvantages of relying on or requiring the use of data obtained directly or indirectly from the visitors of a website to predict the demographic attributes of the website. Instead, the systems and methods predict the demographic attributes of websites using only the content of the web-pages of the websites and without using the browsing behavior or browsing history of the websites' visitors or the visitors' click-through data.","Any demographic attribute may be predicted using embodiments of the systems and methods described herein. Gender, age distribution, income distribution, nationality, language, etc., are all examples of demographic attributes that may be predicted. Even though the systems and methods described herein may be used to predict a wide range of demographic attributes, examples provided herein focus on methods to predict the gender and age distribution of a website's audience\/users. As used herein, the gender attribute specifies the male and female percentages of a website's audience, whereas the age attribute provides a break-down of a website's audience in different age groups. Table 1 below shows the five age groups that used in the examples provided herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Age Group"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Group Name","Age (in years)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Kid","\u20023-12"]},{"entry":[{},"Teen","13-17"]},{"entry":[{},"Young Adult","18-34"]},{"entry":[{},"Adult","35-49"]},{"entry":[{},"Old","50+"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Embodiments of the system and method for predicting a website's demographic attributes follow a supervised learning framework. Within this framework, a set of websites with known demographic attributes are used as a training set, a set of features for these websites or for a subset of the web-pages wherein is extracted, and a model is learned or developed to predict the demographic attributes of a website based on these features. Features for the training websites and for the websites or web-pages whose demographic attributes are being predicted (target websites or web-pages) are extracted from the content of the web-pages of these websites. The prediction model is applied to the extracted features, in effect comparing features of target websites or web-pages to features from training websites and predicting demographic attributes based thereon.","A key characteristic of the underlying prediction problem is that demographic attributes that need to be predicted are probability distributions that take a discrete set of values. This is different from most traditional value estimation problems that focus on building models to estimate a single value. Note that for those demographic attributes that take only two values (e.g., gender), the distribution prediction problem can be transformed to a single-value prediction problem, by predicting only one of the two values and estimating the other from that prediction. For example, if x % is the percentage of a website's audience that is male, then the percentage of the female audience can be estimated as (100-x) %.","Embodiments of the system and method may perform two overall activities. First, embodiments may use standard regression-based techniques to estimate each discrete value of a demographic attribute by treating the prediction problem as an independent single-value estimation problem. In embodiments, prediction models may be generated, e.g., using regression-based techniques, and then predictions generated by inputting target website content features into the prediction models. The prediction models may be generated using various techniques, including without limitation support vector regression, linear regression, logistic regression, non-linear regression, nonparametric regression, probabilistic estimations and Markov random fields.","Second, embodiments may use these individual predictions as input to a second learning problem whose goal is to estimate the overall distribution of the demographic attribute. In these embodiments, the individual models may be estimated using regression-based techniques (e.g., support vector regression), whereas the individual estimations may be coupled using an approach that is designed to predict a multi-dimensional vector such as the matrix approximation, as described below.","In embodiments described herein, the prediction models are generated using support vector regression (SVR). Support vector machines (SVMs) are an implementation of SVR that may be used to generate prediction models. A specific implementation of SVM, known as \u201cSVMlight,\u201d may be used to generate the prediction models and predict the demographic attribute values in embodiments. Such an implementation is described in, e.g., http:\/\/svmlightjoachims.org\/. See also, e.g., Joachims, T., , In Proceedings of the 10th European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML), Chemnitz, Germany, 137142 (1998), which is incorporated by reference herein, for a general description of SVM.","With reference now to , illustrated is an embodiment of a method  of making content-based demographic predictions for websites. Method , and the other methods described herein, may be a computer-implemented method. Accordingly, the steps of method , and the other methods described herein, or a subset of those steps, may be executed by a computer. The computer may be a general purpose computer that includes a processor and memory that runs a computer program or other set of instructions that may be stored in the memory and programmed to perform the method steps when executed by the processor. The computer may be a special purpose specifically programmed to perform the method(s) described herein.","Method  identifies and selects websites with known demographic attributes, block . The websites with known demographic attributes may be thought of or referred to as training websites. The content of a subset of the web-pages from these training websites, and the training websites' demographic attributes data, are used by method  to develop the prediction model. The training websites may be identified based on input from a user, automated analysis of a set of websites with known demographic attributes received from commercial providers of such data for websites (including, for example, without limitation, Nielson Online (see http:\/\/en-us.nielsen.com\/tab\/product_families\/nielsen_netratings), Alexa (see www.alexa.com\/topsites), Quantcast (see http:\/\/www.quantcast.com) and Comscore (see http:\/\/www.comscore.com)), a combination of these or other manners. The training websites for use in method  may be selected based on various factors, such as size of a website's audience, the website's gender or age (or other demographic) distribution (e.g., to attempt to achieve a balance of training websites), the reliability, if known, of demographic attributes data, etc. For example, method  may select a group of 450 websites, with a balanced distribution of gender and age demographics, of the top 2000 most visited websites provided by a commercial provider or providers of website demographic attributes data.","If not already gathered or obtained as part of selecting  the training websites (e.g., if training websites were selected at least in part based on actual demographic distributions, then such demographic attributes may have been fetched as part of selecting ), the demographic attributes data of the identified and selected training websites is gathered or obtained, block . The demographic attributes data may be gathered or obtained from various sources; for example, the demographic attributes data may be obtained from commercial providers of demographic data for websites such as Nielson Online, Alexa, Quantcast, and Comscore. The demographic attributes data may include data for just one demographic attribute, such as age, or for a plurality of demographic attributes.","Method  determines features of web-pages of the training websites from the content of the web-pages, block . In embodiments, determining  may obtain the content of the web-pages and then extract features from the obtained content. Different features may be extracted from the same content. As noted above, a website's content may encompass many features that may be extracted from the web-pages of the website.","In embodiments, web-page features include a plurality of types of web-page features that may be extracted from the training website web-pages. The determining  may determine features from all or a subset of the web-pages of the training websites. One such feature captures a web-page's textual content (e.g., terms), while another feature captures the web-page's structure (e.g., organization, style, sections (e.g., forums, FAQs, etc.)). Other features that may be determined include the type and category of the website (e.g., corporate site, entertainment site, issue site, shopping site, social networking site, blogging site, health site, etc.), the intra- and inter-web-page and website linkage structure (e.g., links between web-page sections, links between the web-page and another web-page for the same website, links between the web-page and a web-page of another website), the features of the web-page(s) and website(s) linked to by the web-page, the HTML of the website's web-pages, the HTML of a subset of the web-pages that link to the website's web-pages (in-links) (both from the same website or different websites), and the HTML of the web-pages that are linked by the website's web-pages (out-links) In embodiments, a web-graph including the training websites and websites with web-pages in-linked or out-linked from training website web-pages may be generated. A web graph is a set of vertices u and v and edges, the vertices corresponding to websites and one of the edges being a directed edge (u, v) between two websites if there are web-pages in the website corresponding to vertex u that link to web-pages in the website corresponding to vertex v. Websites that are linked to by training websites, or which link to training websites, may be referred to as web-graph neighbors of the training websites. In embodiments described herein, these features are determined entirely by analyzing the web-pages themselves and do not rely on any information about the users visiting the corresponding web-pages and websites. This is done by design, as one of the primary features of embodiments of the systems and methods is the accurate prediction of the demographic characteristics of a website's audience without relying on any data that directly or indirectly intrudes on the website's users' private information. The determination  of the content is described in more detail below.","The content of the web-pages may be obtained using a web-page crawler, robot or similar feature extraction tool or process, such as, e.g., the Heritrix Crawler (see crawler.archive.org). The same or other tools may extract the desired features from the obtained content. The content that may be obtained by the web-page crawler or other tool may include the in-linking and out-linking features described above. For example, a web-page crawler or other tool may identify links to other web-pages from a training website web-page, follow the links to the linked web-pages, and obtain the HTML from the linked web-pages and extract different features from this HTML. The web-page crawler may also obtain in-linking features in a similar manner.","Using the determined features and obtained demographic attributes, the prediction model is developed, block . In embodiments, SVR is used to develop a function \u0192 (a prediction) given the following inputs: the determined features of a subset of the web-pages of the training websites, a web-graph that contains both the training websites and other websites that are not part of the training set, and the obtained\/gathered demographic attribute(s) data of the training websites. The function \u0192 will predict\/estimate the demographic attribute(s) of a website (or web-page). During prediction, the function \u0192 (the prediction model) will predict\/estimate a discrete value demographic attribute of a target website (or web-page) based on the input of the determined content of the target website(s) (or web-page(s)). Developing the prediction model and using it to predict\/estimate a demographic attribute are described in more detail below.","With continuing reference to , method  identifies a website or websites with unknown demographics for demographic prediction, block . The unknown or target website or websites may be identified for demographic prediction for a variety of reasons. For example, an advertiser may want to obtain a demographic prediction for a website to determine whether an advertisement on the website would likely reach an audience with the desired demographics. Once the target website or websites are identified, the content of web-pages of the target website (or websites) is determined and the set of features for these web-pages is determined\/extracted from their content, block . Method  may determine  the same web-page features as determined for the web-pages of the training websites, or a subset thereof. Likewise, the determining  may only extract features from a subset of a target website's web-pages. After determining  the features of a subset of the web-pages of the target websites, method  applies the prediction model to the determined features of the target website's web-pages to predict the demographics of the target website, block .","With reference now to , illustrated is an embodiment of a method  of determining\/extracting features of a web-page from the web-page content that may be used in embodiments of systems and methods of making content-based demographic predictions for websites. Determining ,  the features of the web-pages of the training and target websites may include performing all or a portion of the embodiment of method  illustrated in . Likewise, method  illustrated in  may be repeated for all or a subset of the web-pages of each training and target website. As described above, method  may determine various web-page features, including, without limitation, textual features, structural features, type and category of the web-page, the intra- and inter-web-page and website linkage structure, and the content-derived features of the web-page(s) and website(s) linked-to and linked-by the web-page (i.e., web-graph neighbors), etc.","With reference to , method  determines the textual features of a web-page. To determine the web-page's textual features, embodiments of method  retrieves terms from the web-pages, block , and generates a representation of those terms, block . The retrieved terms may include terms that appear on the web-pages, terms that appear in the web-pages that link-to these web-pages, and terms that appear in the web-pages that are linked-by the web-pages. The retrieving  may use known processes and\/or tools to scan the web-pages and extract\/retrieve the terms from the web-pages. Generating  may include generating a representation of the retrieved terms using a vector-space model for information retrieval, such as the popular vector-space model from information retrieval described in Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, Mass., 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this model, each web-page is represented as a sparse term vector in the space of the distinct terms that exist in the collection. The non-zero entries of that term vector correspond to the terms that are present in the web-page. Each non-zero entry may be equal to the number of occurrences of a corresponding term in the web-page.","Method  may apply a weight to the retrieved terms, block . Method  may use a standard Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) team weighting scheme that assigns a weight to each term that is linearly related to the term's occurrence frequency in the web-page and inversely related to the number of web-pages in the website on which the term occurs, to weigh  the retrieved terms. The TF-IDF term weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document (e.g., a web-page) in a collection or corpus (e.g., all of the web-pages in the website). For each term, the term frequency is the number of times that word appears in a web-page, whereas the term's document frequency is the number of web-pages in which the term occurs. The importance increases proportionally to the term's term frequency but is offset by the term's document frequency (i.e., terms that appear in many web-pages become less important). In an embodiment of this method, the size of the document collection (i.e., web-pages) used in the IDF component when determining  the content of the training websites is equal to the number of web-pages across the entire set of training websites. In another embodiment, the size of the document collection is normalized so that each website contributes an equal weight to the overall collection. The normalization may be done by assigning a weight to each web-page of the ith website that is 1\/n, where nis the number of web-pages from the ith website that exist in the collection.","With continuing reference to , method  may process the retrieved terms, block . For example, following standard information retrieval practices, the retrieved terms may be processed  to eliminate terms and transform terms. Processing  may use a stop list to eliminate certain unimportant words and use Porter's stemming algorithm to transform each term to its stem. Likewise, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve the generalization of resulting models, processing  may further eliminate terms that occur in less than a certain percent, e.g., ten percent (10%), of the total number of web-pages. If a vector space model is used to model the terms of a web-page, the web-page's terms are represented as a term vector, method  may also normalize the web-page's term vector to be of a unit length, block . A term vector may be normalized to a unit length by dividing all of the components (all of the non-zero entries representing present terms not eliminated by processing ) by the original length of the term vector. The normalized term vector may be referred to as the T representation of the web-page.","A challenge associated with extracting the textual features of modern web-pages is that in addition to the portions of the web-pages that contains information specific to those web-pages, web-pages also contain additional information that is irrelevant to the information that they provide. Such examples include but are not limited to headers, footers, navigation panels, and advertisements. Quite often, the portion of a web-page's text and HTML elements that is directly related to the web-page's specific information is much smaller than that occupied by the irrelevant portions. To address this problem, embodiments of method  of determining the web-page textual features may identify a web-page's specific information by collectively analyzing the entire set of web-pages that were obtained from the same website, determining the irrelevant information or form HTML elements and removing the irrelevant information or form HTML elements from consideration.","With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of a method of determining irrelevant or form content of website, which may be included as part of method . The method of determining irrelevant or form content of website is related to template identification methods used by web search engines to determine parts of web-pages that the web search engine indexes. See, e.g., D Chakrabarti, R Kumar, K Punera, -, Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2007, pp 61-70, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Given a set of web-pages that belong to the same website, the method may construct a Document Object Model (DOM) tree of all the web-pages in the website, block  (other representations of web-pages may be used instead of DOM trees; the DOM tree representation enables a method to easily compare web-pages to determine common, repetitive terms). The DOM is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents (e.g., web-pages). DOM defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM, documents have a logical structure that is represented via a rooted tree. For instance, consider this table, taken from an HTML document:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<TABLE>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TBODY>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TR>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TD>Shady Grove<\/TD>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TD>Aeolian<\/TD>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/TR>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TR>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TD>Over the River, Charlie<\/TD>"]},{"entry":[{},"<TD>Dorian<\/TD>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/TR>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/TBODY>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/TABLE>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"HTML TABLE"},{"entry":"A graphical representation of the DOM of the example table is:"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"56.90mm","wi":"60.45mm","file":"US08412648-20130402-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["222","224","226","204"],"figref":"FIG. 2A"},"In addition to the above web-page-specific textual content, embodiments of method  of determining web-page features may also use the semi-structured nature of HTML documents to emphasize terms that occur in certain HTML tags on the web-pages. With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of a method identifying relevant web-page HTML tag terms, which may be included as part of method . Embodiments of the method identifying relevant web-page HTML tag terms may focus on the title and section-defining tags (header tags) (i.e., the TITLE and H1-116 tags, respectively of HTML documents) and separately models the terms that these tags contain (e.g., as a separate term vector). Accordingly, method of identifying relevant web-page HTML tag terms extracts terms from title and section defining tags of each web-page, block , and generates a representation of these terms, e.g., as a term vector in the vector-space model, block . Method of identifying relevant web-page HTML tag terms may further apply a weighting to the tag terms in the term vector, e.g., using the TF-IDF weighting scheme to determine the weights of each term, block . The resulting term vector may be normalized to be of unit length, block . This normalized tag term vector may be referred to as the H representation of the web-page tag terms. In embodiments, the title and header tags are extracted only from the parts of the web-page's DOM tree that are not pruned. In embodiments, each web-page may be represented as the concatenation of the original term and this new (tag term) representations (e.g., term vectors). As such, a web-page's textual features may be obtained by concatenating the original term representation, e.g., term vector T, and the tag term representation, e.g., term vector H, block . The concatenated term vectors may be referred to as the TH representation of the web-page. In embodiments, the relative importance of the two components may be controlled by multiplying the T and H vectors with non-zero weights prior to concatenation. The greater the weight used to multiply the vector, the greater the vector's importance.","In addition to determining textual features of web-pages, determining web-page features according to embodiments of systems and methods of making content-based demographic predictions for websites may also include determining structural features of the web-pages. Specifically, systems and methods of making content-based demographic predictions for websites may also extract features from web-pages of a website that capture the web-page structure by focusing, among others, on characteristics that relate to the web-page's style and organization. In embodiments, the structure of each web-page may be measured in terms of the web-page's visual appearance. The visual appearance of a web-page greatly influences the way a user interacts with the web-page and the type of users that the web-page attracts. As a result, the existence of certain structural elements can provide valuable clues as to the demographics of a web-page's users (or its indented users).","Accordingly, with reference now to , illustrated is an embodiment of a method of determining the structural features of a web-page, which may be included as part of method  or performed separately. Determining ,  the features of the training and target web-pages may include performing all or a portion of the embodiment of method illustrated in . As shown, method of determining the structural features of a web-page may include extracting the number of different visual blocks in the web-page, block , extracting the number of hyperlinks in the web-page, block , extracting the number of images in the web-page, block , extracting the number of menus\/lists in the web-page, block , and extracting the number of paragraphs in the web-page, block . The method may extract this information by counting the corresponding HTML tags like DIV, TABLE, H1-H6, A, IMG, LI, etc.","Embodiments of method of determining the structural features of a web-page extract these features from the entire web-page and not only from the portions of the web-page that were used to derive textual features (e.g., see ). In embodiments, these structural features are used as additional features to augment the term-vectors extracted from the web-page's specific content. Consequently, method of determining the structural features of a web-page may also include creating a representation of these structural features, e.g., a vector that includes the extracted structural features, block , normalizing the structural feature vector (which may be referred to as the S vector) to be of unit length, block , and appending the normalized structural feature vector S to the vector of the web-page's TH representation, block . The combined web-page feature vector may be referred to as the THS representation of the web-page.","Other content features of a web-page may also be determined by embodiments described herein. For example, embodiments may determine the type and\/or category of a web-page. Such information may be determined from third-party services that categorize websites or web-pages, from metadata, web-page title or other textual features on the web-page or through other techniques known to those of skill in the art. In addition, embodiments may determine additional features for a web-page by analyzing the content of the web-pages that link-to that web-page or the web-pages that are being linked-by the web-page. These features may be textual features extracted by using method  of  or any of the other types of features described earlier. Embodiments may extract the textual or other features of the web-pages that link-to or are linked-to by the web-page for which the features are determined by analyzing the text that appears in the vicinity of the hyperlink(s) that link-to the web-page whose features are determined. These additional feature vectors may be appended to the feature vector of the entire website (e.g., S\u2014see below) or separately to the feature vectors of the web-pages (e.g., to the THS vector). Different weights can be assigned to the different feature vectors prior to concatenation in order to control the relative importance of the different types of features. Embodiments of the method may also use some of these features (e.g., the type and\/or category) to determine the prediction model.","With reference now to , method  is shown to include determining website in-linked and out-linked websites, block . Determining  may be performed by using a web-crawler or other tool to determine websites, or a subset thereof, that have web-pages linking to a web-page(s) (in-links) of the websites (e.g., training and\/or target). Determining  may also extract out-links from the websites' web-pages or subset thereof. Method  may further build a web-graph of the websites and the in-linked and out-linked websites, block . Collectively, such in-linked and out-linked websites may be referred to as web-graph neighbors of the websites. Method  may further extract content features of web-pages of the web-graph neighbor websites, block , e.g., as described above with reference to . Method  may link the extracted features to the web-graph, block .","With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of a method  of developing a prediction model. As described above, embodiments of the systems and methods described herein use the extracted features of a subset of the web-pages of the training websites and the obtained demographic attribute(s) data for the training websites to develop a prediction model. Each prediction model may be for a single demographic attribute or a plurality of demographic attributes. Likewise, prediction models may be developed for one or more values of the demographic attribute or attributes. In the embodiment described with reference to , the prediction model is for a single demographic attribute and a single value of that demographic attribute. The prediction models may be developed through regression, such as through SVR. When such a regression model is developed for a single value of a multi-valued demographic attribute (e.g., the child value of the age attribute\u2014see Table 1), embodiments include methods for combining such single-value regression models (referred to as uni-variable regression models) in order to predict a distribution for the multiple-values.","Developing  a prediction model, as seen in , may include performing all or a portion of the steps of method . Method  may determine a demographic attribute, or attributes, for which to develop prediction model, block , and may determine a discrete value (e.g., kids, male, etc.) of the determined demographic attribute for the prediction model, block . Using the extracted\/determined feature vectors and the obtained demographic attribute(s) of the training websites, method  develops a prediction model for the determined discrete value(s) of the determined demographic attribute(s), block . In embodiments described herein, the prediction model is a function that provides a prediction p of the determined discrete demographic attribute value based on a website (or web-page) having certain content (e.g., having certain textual features and\/or structure features as described above). The content of the web-pages or a subset of the web-pages for the website for which the prediction is to be made may be extracted  from the web-pages in the same or similar manner as described above in  and then input into the prediction model function. The resulting prediction may be a probability that a website's users have the determined discrete demographic attribute\u2014e.g., the probability that a website user is a kid (see Table 1).","The prediction model for the determined discrete demographic attribute value may be developed  using a regression approach, such as SVR, to estimate a regression model for the determined discrete demographic attribute value, as described above. The regression model may be estimated based on the content representations of the training websites (e.g., THS feature vectors or a subset thereof (e.g., only the T, H, or S vectors, or a combination of two of these vectors)). Likewise, embodiments of the systems and methods of making content-based demographic predictions may build  the prediction models using as training instances the training websites or the individual web-pages of the training websites. These two types of models will be referred to as website-level models and web-page-level models, respectively.","With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of a method  developing website-level prediction models. The developing  may perform method  to build a website-level prediction model. Combined web-page feature representations determined from training website web-page content may be used to develop website-level prediction models. Likewise, combined web-page feature representations determined from target website web-pages may be input into such models to predict demographic attribute values.","Embodiments that develop  website-level prediction models may compute the feature representation for a training website by combining the feature representations gathered, e.g., by embodiments described with reference to  for the selected subset of the web-pages of that training website. Consequently, as shown, embodiments of method  may include repeating the above-described steps (e.g., blocks -) for each web-page (or each web-page of a selected subset of web-pages) of the training website (e.g., or target website) to generate feature representations, e.g., feature vectors THS, or a subset thereof, for each of the web-pages, block . Certain web-pages (e.g., a home web-page) of a website may be considered more relevant or more valuable for predicting demographic attributes. Consequently, the feature vectors of web-pages may be weighted based on their determined relevance or value, block . Such weighting would affect the summing of the feature vectors for the entire website. Method  sums the feature representations, e.g., normalized feature vectors (e.g., THS), of the constituent web-pages (or subset thereof) of the website, block . For example, when the THS features are used to represent each web-page, the feature vector for the ith website Scan be computed by adding the THS feature vectors for a subset of the web-pages of the ith's website. The feature vector Sfor the ith website may be further scaled, for example, by dividing Sby the number of constituent web-pages in the ith website or by scaling Sto be unit length. It is noted that embodiments may use, and therefore only sum together, a subset of the features of the web-pages (e.g., only the T, H or S vector, or any combinations of these vectors). Additionally, other feature vectors (or other feature representations) may be generated and summed together to generate the feature vector S.","For training websites, known demographic attribute(s) data for each website may be appended or otherwise linked to the feature vector Sfor the website, block . For example, the attributes data for each training website may be placed in a vector and a matrix or table is generated with all of the attributes data vectors for the training websites, where the ith row (or column) of the table includes the demographic attributes for the ith website in the training set. In yet another embodiment, the prediction model may be only generated for one demographic attribute; accordingly, only the demographic attribute data for the one demographic attribute for which a training model is being developed may be appended or linked  to the feature vector for the training website.","It is also noted that certain training websites may be determined or thought to be more or less relevant for the prediction model. For example, a training website may be determined or thought to be more or less relevant because of the size of the training website's audience. In other words, a larger training website audience may make the website's content and demographic attribute data more relevant for the prediction model. Likewise, a training website may be considered more or less relevant to the determination of a specific demographic attribute. Moreover, a training website may be considered more or less relevant based on the number of other training websites or web-pages that link to it. Accordingly, the feature representation (e.g., feature vector S) of a training website may be assigned a weight based on its relevancy, block . The weighting may affect how much the training website feature vector impacts the prediction model and may, therefore, e.g., be input into the regression process.","To complete building the website-level prediction model, the preceding blocks  to  may be repeated for each training website, block . Once the feature vectors Sfor each training website has been generated, the prediction model for the discrete value of the demographic attribute may be developed using SVR with the feature vectors S, the web graph and the linked  demographic attribute data, block . As noted above, the prediction model may be developed  using the SVMlight implementation of SVR.","Embodiments that develop  web-page-level prediction models may use the features extracted from a subset of the web-pages of each training website as the training instances of these web-page level models. During training, the value of the training website's demographic attribute under consideration is used as the value for that attribute for all of its web-pages (i.e., all web-pages are assigned the same value). Accordingly, in these embodiments, the feature vector of each web-page is linked to the row of the table of demographic attributes data of the corresponding website. Then, the prediction model is generated using the feature vector for each web-page and the linked demographic attribute data for that web-page. For example, for the prediction model used to predict the percentage of users that are kids (ages 3-12, Table 1), the value of the target variable for the SVR model for all the web-pages of a certain website will be the percentage of users that are kids for that website. During prediction, the SVR models are used to estimate that values for the different demographic attributes for all the web-pages of a website. These web-page-level predictions are then combined to obtain the prediction at the website level. For example, the percentage of users that are kids may be determined by averaging the corresponding prediction for all the web-pages of a website. Embodiments may also use information about the web-pages from the training website and\/or other websites that link to the various web-pages of the target website in determining how the web-page-based predictions may be combined. In these embodiments, predictions of web-pages that are linked to by a larger number of other web-pages will be given a higher weight than other linked web-pages. For example, if {p, . . . , p} are the predictions for the k web-pages of website and n, is the number of in-links of the ith page, then the prediction p for the website may be given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"p","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["n","i"]},"mo":"+","mi":"\u03b4"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["p","i"]}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"k"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["n","i"]},"mo":"+","mi":"\u03b4"}}}}],"mo":"\/"}},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"Embodiments of method  may implement a cascade learning system or similar learning system (see discussion of cascading classifiers below), to develop and refine the prediction model. Accordingly, in such embodiments, prediction models developed  as described above may be referred to as first-level models which may be further refined into second-level prediction models. With reference again to , method  may generate a prediction of the discrete value of the demographic attribute for the websites that are neighbors to the training websites in the web-graph, block . A website A is considered to be a neighbor of another website B if there are web-pages in A that link to web-pages in B and vice versa. The prediction may be generated  by applying the first-level prediction model developed  as described above. For example, feature representations of the training websites' web-graph neighbors may be input into the first-level prediction model, which then generates predictions p for the discrete value of the first-level prediction model.","These predictions p may be used to build a second-level prediction model, block . Building  the second-level prediction model may be based upon and be similar to approaches used to build cascading classifiers that are used extensively in bioinformatics. See, e.g., George Karypis, YASSPP: , In Journal of Proteins, August 2006, Volume 64-3, pages 575-586, and Huzefa Rangwala and George Karypis, , In Journal of BMC Bioinformatics, 2006, vol., , page 455, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The second-level model may be built  in a similar manner as described above with reference to the developing . To build  the second-level prediction model, the following inputs, among others, may be used: the various features (e.g., as represented, for example, in feature vectors THS) used to develop the first-level model, the predicted discrete value p of the demographic attribute for each (or a subset) of the web-graph neighbors, and the known discrete demographic attribute value for each (or a subset) of the training websites. In other words, the second-level prediction model may be built from the same input used to develop the first-level model plus the predictions p generated  as described above, in affect utilizing a feedback loop to refine the first-level prediction model. Embodiments may repeat this feedback loop to further refine the prediction model. The second-level prediction model, by incorporating predicted demographic attribute value information from the neighboring websites, relies on the principle of homophily as websites that cater to similar audiences will tend to be connected to each other. Embodiments for building this second-level model may use regression-based techniques (e.g., SVR), relational estimation methods (e.g., graphical models, relational Markov networks, Markov random fields, relaxation labeling, iterative estimation), and others.","With continuing reference to , method  may generate a prediction of the discrete value of the demographic attribute for one or more training (or other) websites, e.g., using the developed second-level prediction model, block . The prediction may be generated  in order to test the prediction model. The generated  prediction(s) may be used to build a distribution prediction model (see below). Method  may further repeat the above for the remaining discrete values of the determined demographic attribute, block , in order to produce prediction models for the remaining discrete values. Note, in embodiments, this is not done for demographic attributes with two discrete values (see description herein for such demographic attributes).","Method  produces a prediction model for each discrete value of a demographic attribute with more than two discrete values (e.g., age). When content features of web-pages of a target website (or content features of a target web-page) are input into each prediction model, the prediction model estimates a probability for the discrete value of the demographic attribute. In other words, the prediction model estimates the probability that a target website (or target web-page) visitor has the discrete value for the demographic attribute (e.g., probability that the visitor is a teenager\u2014has an age that fits within the teenager discrete value (see Table 1)).","With continuing reference to , a potential limitation of certain embodiments described herein is that by estimating the probability for each discrete value of the demographic attribute (variable) independently of the other discrete values, the embodiments may fail to take into account certain correlations that may exist among the different discrete values of the demographic attribute (i.e., between demographic groups of values). For example, if a website has a large fraction of kids (see Table 1), then the website may have a somewhat larger fraction of teenagers (then other websites) as kids and teenagers often share some common interests (at least among the users that are at the boundary of the age breakdown). To address this problem, embodiments of method  may build a distribution prediction model that uses as input predictions obtained by the individual prediction models (e.g., the individual SVR prediction models for each discrete attribute value), block .","With reference now to , building  a distribution prediction model may include creating a n\u00d7k matrix P that will contain website-level predictions p produced by the first-level prediction models, block , where n is the number of training websites and k is the number of values of the discrete random variable (i.e., of the demographic attribute) under consideration (e.g., 5 for the age variable). The predictions p used to create the n\u00d7k matrix may be generated  using training websites. Building  may also include creating another n\u00d7k matrix A that contains the actual demographic attribute value distributions of the n training websites in the same order as P, block . The goal of the distribution prediction model is to estimate a k\u00d7k matrix W that minimizes \u2225PW\u2212A\u2225. Accordingly, building , estimates a k\u00d7k matrix W that minimizes \u2225PW\u2212A\u2225, block . Matrix W may be estimated, e.g., using the Moore-Penrose method to obtain the pseudo-inverse Pof the non-square matrix P at which point W=PA. See Moore, E. H., , Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 26: 394395 (1920) and Penrose, Roger, , Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 51: 406-413 (1955), which are hereby incorporated by reference. Matrix W may also be estimated from P by using a cross-validation approach. For example, the training set (set of training websites) may be split into five groups or folds. Each four-fold subset of these five folds may then be used to estimate the prediction model (e.g., the SVR model) and predict the omitted fold. The resulting set of predictions forms matrix P and is, therefore, used to estimate W. See description of  below for a description of the application of the distribution prediction model.","With reference again to , method  may repeat the above for other selected demographic attributes, block . Accordingly, method  may produce a plurality of prediction models for discrete values of each selected demographic attributes. In embodiments, the prediction models for each discrete value of a demographic attribute can be combined into one prediction model for all discrete values of the demographic attribute.","Once the prediction model (e.g., the first-level prediction model, second-level prediction model and prediction distribution model) is developed and acceptable, embodiments of the systems and methods of making content-based demographic predictions for websites may identify  the target website(s) (or web-page(s)) for prediction, obtain  the content of the target website(s) (or web-page(s)), and predict  the demographic(s) of the target website(s) (or web-page(s)).

First, any predictions that are negative are set to zero and second, predictions are linearly scaled so that their sum is one.","Note that, in embodiments, the above approach is only used for demographic attributes that take more than two values (i.e., the age demographic attribute).

If pis the prediction obtained by that model, then when 0\u2266p\u22661, the value of the other attribute is p=1\u2212p. When p<0, {p, p}={0, 1} and when p>1, {p, p}={1, 0}.

The set of training websites were identified as follows. First, the top 2000 websites from Alexa's one million most visited domains was selected, and their demographic information of their visitors as they relate to gender and age was obtained from Quantcast, which is a commercial provider of website demographic data. A subset of 450 websites was selected from that list so that the selected training websites would provide a balanced coverage of the age and gender distribution. For gender, this was done by dividing the male distribution into 10 equal sized buckets and an equal random sample was picked from each bucket. For age, websites were sorted based on each of the age groups and an equal number of top sites were picked from each group. This list of 450 websites was then crawled using the open source Heritrix crawler, and a maximum of 1000 web-pages were fetched from each website in a breadth-first fashion. The set of crawled pages was subsequently pruned to eliminate web-pages with less than 100 words. Furthermore, any websites with fewer than 50 web-pages remaining were also eliminated from the set of training websites. Note that a website can have a small number of web-pages because either the crawler failed to fetch (e.g., pages generated by scripts that the crawler could not handle) or the web-pages fetched contained a small number of words. These steps reduced the total number of websites to 128, which is the set of training websites used in the evaluation.","Evaluation Methodology. For all evaluations, the training website data set was divided into five folds at the website level and a five-fold cross validation was performed. This website level partitioning ensures that the web-pages from a given website are never in both the training and the test sets.","For the distribution prediction approaches based on the pseudo inverse method (see above), matrix W was estimated from P by using a cross-validation approach during training. Specifically, the training set was itself split into five folds and each four-size subset of these folds was used to estimate an SVR prediction model and predict the left-out fold. The resulting set of predictions formed matrix P and was used to estimate W. During the actual prediction, a domain was then predicted using the five different SVR models that were estimated during the within-training five-fold cross-validation, the predictions of the five SVR models were averaged, and then matrix W was used to predict the final distribution. A SVMlight implementation of SVR was used to perform the learning (generation of the prediction model) and prediction. The prediction model generation was performed using a linear kernel function. For the models that were trained on individual web-pages (see above), in order to ensure that each domain contributed equally during training, a mis-prediction weight of 1\/nwas assigned to the individual web-pages of the ith domain, where nis the number of web-pages of that domain. These weights ensured that the sum of the weights of the training instances for each domain were the same. The width of the regression tube in the SVR (w parameter in SVMlight) was set to 0.025, which was determined after performing a limited set of experiments using different values of w from the set {0.05, 0.025, 0.0125, 0.00625}.","Evaluation Metrics. The evaluation used two different metrics to measure the performance of the predictions computed by the different methods (see below). The first measured the accuracy of the overall predicted discrete distribution, whereas the second measured the accuracy of the individual values of the discrete distribution. The accuracy of the distribution was measured using the root mean squared error (RMSE). The accuracy of the prediction for a specific value of a discrete distribution was measured using absolute error (AE). For all these metrics, the reported results corresponded to the averages over all the websites across the five-fold cross validation.","Baseline Predictions. In order to get a better sense about the quality of the prediction results produced by embodiments described herein, another approach in which the predictions for each variable (each demographic attribute) was computed as the average of the corresponding values in the training set. For example, the percentage of users that belong to the teen group (Table 1) was obtained by computing the average percentage of users that belong to the teen group in the training set. The same 5-fold cross-validation approach used in the evaluation of the prediction models as described above, was used to split the data set into training and test groups in order to obtain the predictions of this averaging model. This is referred to below as the baseline model.","Results. In this section, the results of the experimental evaluation of embodiments for predicting the gender and age distributions of a website's audience are presented.","Performance of Different Features.

These results indicate that the two models are intrinsically different, and that the best prediction performance is achieved when the test\/target data has the same characteristics as the data used for training.","Comparing the relative performance of the website and web-page level models, it may be seen that for both prediction tasks, the models trained and applied at the website level achieve better results than those achieved by the corresponding web-page models. Moreover, for both prediction tasks, the relative performance advantage of the website level models is quite substantial. These results suggest that by representing the web-pages of an entire website into a single training instance better captures the website's overall characteristics, leading to better models and more accurate predictions. Moreover, the additional advantage of this approach over the web-page level models is that they are computational less expensive for both model learning and prediction.","Determining Anomaly Websites","As described above with reference to , embodiments of the systems and methods identify training websites. Embodiments may be configured to further identify anomaly websites and remove them from the set of training websites. For example, an embodiment of the system and method may seek to identify anomaly websites by extracting the content features of a training website and inputting the features into a previously generated prediction model for a demographic attribute value or a set of prediction models for a plurality of demographic attribute values. The system and method then predicts the demographic attribute value(s) for the training website and compares the predicted demographic attribute value(s) to the actual demographic attribute value(s) for the training website. If the predicted attribute value(s) is sufficiently different (e.g., >20%) from the actual demographic attribute value(s), the training website may be an anomaly website that is so different from the norm, that it should be removed from the set of training websites. The system and method may repeat this process for a number of demographic attributes. If substantial number of the predicted attribute value(s) for the other demographic attributes are substantially different from the actual values, the training website may be defined as an anomaly website and removed from the training set. This process may be repeated until all of anomaly websites have been identified and removed. Then, the prediction model may be re-generated. The difference between the mix of actual and predicted demographic attributes values may be computed in a number of ways, which include, but are not limited, to Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, Kullback-Leibler divergence, etc.","Predicting Characteristics of a User","With reference to , shown is an embodiment of a method  of predicting characteristics of a user. Method  utilizes the systems and methods described herein to predict the demographic attributes of a specific, individual user. Method  may receive or obtain as input the current session browsing history of the user, block . It is noted that the user's browsing history is only used to identify the websites or web-pages visited by a user so that the user's demographic attributes may be predicted. The browsing history is not used to generate prediction models or make predictions. For a user that is currently visiting a website, embodiments use the browsing information of the user and the websites visited by the user to predict the demographic attributes values of that user. If the websites include known websites, method  may retrieve the known demographic attributes data for those websites, block . If the websites include unknown websites, systems and method may predict the demographic attributes values for those unknown websites as described above, block . Using the retrieved and\/or predicted website demographic attributes values, method  may combine these values and use statistical methods to predict the distribution of the demographic attributes for that specific user, block .

A target demographic mix is a set of users\/visitors with desired demographic attribute values. For example, a target demographic segment, T1, may be a set of users\/visitors that are male, young adult and earning in excess of $150,000 a year. Another target demographic segment, T2, may be a set of users\/visitors that are female, adult and with kids. A target demographic mix is the percentage distribution of target demographic segments in an advertisement campaign. For example, a target demographic mix for one advertisement campaign, that wants to reach 100,000 users\/visitors, has 70% of users (70,000) belonging to T1, and 30% of users (30,000) belonging to T2. Embodiments of the systems and methods determine a set of websites and associated number of impressions of advertisements for each website, such that 70,000 users\/visitors belonging to T1 see the advertisement and 30,000 users\/visitors belonging to T2 see the advertisement.","With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of a method  of determining a combination of websites (and\/or web-pages) and the number of impressions of advertisements to obtain a target demographic mix. The method  is described with reference to websites; it is understood that method  may be used to identify individual web-pages instead or in addition to websites. In an embodiment, method  may predict a mix of demographic attributes values for a set of ad-carrying target websites, block . The prediction  may be performed as described above with reference to . Inputs including, without limitation, the predicted demographic attributes values for each of the target websites, a listing of the target websites, the cost of advertising in the target websites, the available advertising space in the target websites, and the target demographic mix may be received, block . The desired demographic attributes may include any demographic attributes that have been predicted, including without limitation, age distribution, gender, and income distribution. The method  may also consider training or other websites with known demographic attributes. Accordingly, received  inputs may also include a listing of training and known websites, demographic attributes, cost of advertising and the available advertising space for the training and known websites.","Method  may receive or otherwise obtain the number of visitors for the ad-carrying target websites, block . Likewise, the method  may receive a selection or input of secondary objectives, block . The method  may then determine a combination of websites (or web-pages) that provide the target demographic mix, block . The determining  may process, e.g., using an optimization method, the predicted demographic attributes of the ad-carrying target websites, the received inputs, and the number of visitors for the ad-carrying target websites to determine the combination of websites (or web-pages) that provide the target demographic mix.","In embodiments, method  may determine  the combination of websites (or web-pages) that provide the target demographic mix while also meeting or minimizing the secondary objectives. Accordingly, method  may utilize or include an optimization method to determine  the combination of websites that can be used to achieve the desired demographic attributes values mix while minimizing or meeting one or more secondary objectives. The secondary objectives may include without limitation the total advertising cost, the total time that is required to reach the audience with the target demographic mix, the number of ads that may be placed, etc. The optimization method may be implemented in a number of ways and can include, but is not limited to, discrete optimization, continuous optimization, exact methods, and heuristics methods such as simulated annealing or genetic algorithms. The determining  may produce an optimized list of websites on which an advertiser may place ads for an ad campaign. Method  may monitor the results of such an ad campaign, receiving and tracking inputs including the number of visits and any relevant information about the characteristics of the ad campaign audience, and may dynamically re-optimize an initial solution to ensure that the initial constraints are still satisfied while still minimizing or best meeting the secondary set of objectives.","Accordingly, based on the demographic attribute values predicted according to embodiments described herein, specific websites and web-pages can be recommended for an ad campaign to achieve the target demographic mix. Notably, these predictions are made based upon the analysis of the content of the websites, and without the use of data representing specific potential customers, offering a true \u201cuser data free\u201d method of targeted ad placement. As such, the prediction for and recommendation of target websites is based purely on content of web-pages, via estimated or gathered audience characteristics (in a group level, but not in a specific user level) of similar, known websites.","Keywords to Buy for a Target Demographic Mix","Systems and methods described herein may also be used to determine a set of keywords to bid on in order for a keyword-based online advertising campaign (e.g., similar to the AdSense keyword-based advertising bid and placement provided by Google) to reach a set of website visitors that have a desired target demographic mix, as defined above. With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of method  of identifying keywords to buy to obtain a target demographic mix. Embodiments of these methods may receive as input a desired target demographic mix, block . Embodiments may then identify one or more sets of website combinations to reach the target demographic mix, as described above (see, e.g., ), block . Embodiments of method  analyze a subset of the web-pages of the identified websites and determine the set of terms that occur in the web-pages, block . Certain objectives may be received, block . Embodiments may utilize feature selection methods and optimization methods to identify a set of terms that appear in the web-pages of these website combinations, referred to as keywords, which simultaneously optimize certain objectives, block . Those objectives may include at least one of the following: (i) the relative occurrence frequency of these keywords in the web-pages of the identified website combinations being much higher than their relative occurrence frequency in all the websites, (ii) the sets of keywords being selected from the different websites in the same proportions that are identified by the identified website combination required to reach the target demographic attribute value mix, and (iii) the sets of keywords corresponding to the least costly keywords. The optimization method may be implemented in a number of ways and may include, but is not limited to, discrete optimization, continuous optimization, exact methods, and heuristics methods such as simulated annealing or genetic algorithms. The feature selection methods might include methods in which each keyword is assigned multiple scores with respect to the above objectives, and the sum of these scores is used to rank and select keywords. Embodiments of these methods may assign different weights to these scores so as to give higher importance to the various optimization objectives, block . These keywords can then be bid on in order to reach the identified website combinations, and consequently the audience that has the desired target demographic mix.","Selection of Websites for Market Research whose Visitors have a Target Demographic Mix","Systems and methods described herein may also be used to select a set of websites whose audience subsets will be targeted for market research purposes. With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of method  of selecting websites for market research. Embodiments of these methods may receive as input a desired target demographic mix, block . Embodiments may then identify multiple sets of website combinations to reach the target demographic mix, using a method similar to that described above (e.g., see ), block . Embodiments of these methods may utilize additional objectives in the optimization procedure for identifying and selecting among the multiple sets of website combinations that reach the target demographic mix such as total cost of acquiring the users to be enlisted in the market research, the total time that is required to enroll the required number of users, etc. The market research can be performed on the identified websites in a number of ways, including without limitation placing ads asking people to participate in a market research study, pop-ups asking people to complete short surveys, etc. Embodiments may monitor the results of a market research campaign, block , by taking into account the number of visits and any relevant information about the demographic attributes of the visitors, and dynamically re-optimize the initial solution to ensure that the initial constraints are still satisfied while still minimizing the initial set of objectives, block . As part of the dynamic re-optimization, embodiments of these methods may identify a new set of website combinations that are better suited for identifying visitors that have the target demographic mix of the yet to be enrolled people in the market research.","Planning Tool for Ad Networks","Systems and methods described herein may also be used to determine the websites with which ad networks should establish ad placement relations in order to achieve an audience with a desired target demographic mix for a forecasted demand. Embodiments of these methods may take as input the desired target demographic mix of the forecasted demand. Embodiments may then identify multiple sets of website combinations to reach the target demographic mix, using a method similar to that described above (e.g., see ). Embodiments of these methods may utilize additional objectives in the optimization procedure for identifying and selecting among the multiple sets of website combinations that reach the target demographic mix such as total advertising cost, the total time that is required to reach the forecasted target audience, prior partnership information, competitor information, etc. These sets of websites may then be used by the ad networks as the potential new partners that need to be brought into their networks in order to meet the forecasted demand.","Website Design Tool for Designing Websites That Appeal To an Audience with Desired Demographic Characteristics","Systems and methods described herein may also be used to determine how a website should be designed or re-designed or what new websites should be designed in order to appeal to an audience with a desired set of demographic characteristics. With reference now to , shown is an embodiment of method  of designing websites to appeal to an audience with desired demographic characteristics. Embodiments of these methods may receive as input a set of desired values for one or more demographic attributes that will define the demographic characteristics of the website's audience, block  Embodiments may analyze the prediction models developed as described above to determine correlation between different features describing the intrinsic properties of a website (e.g., textual content, structural content, linkings, etc.) and the set of training websites whose visitors have the desired demographic characteristics, block . The analysis  may identify combinations of features that if present in a website, would be predicted to result in an audience having the desired demographic characteristics. The method used to perform the analysis and identification  of the desired feature combinations may depend on the specific statistical or machine learning method that was used to build the estimation models (see, e.g., ) for the demographic attribute values used in the method described above. Embodiments of the methods above that build the prediction model using SVR with linear kernel functions may identify the feature combination directly from the estimated linear model by utilizing the dimensions of the model (that correspond to the various textual, structural, and other features used to describe the web-pages or websites) and by considering the dimensions that have the highest positive coefficients. These dimensions correspond to the features that, if present in a website, will lead to the website being estimated as having the desired value for the demographic attribute under consideration. Combinations of these attribute-value specific features over all the attribute-values defining the demographic characteristics of the desired audience may then be used to define the overall set of features that need to be present in a website in order to be estimated as having the desired demographic attributes. A website may then be designed or re-designed to incorporate such content features, block .","Hardware Implementation","As stated above, the methods described above may each be implemented as one or more computerized systems.
