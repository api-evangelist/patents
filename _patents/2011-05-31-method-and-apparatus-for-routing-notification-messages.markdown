title: Method and apparatus for routing notification messages
abstract: An approach is presented for facilitating automated processing of targeted (push) notification messages for integration with notification recipients of different type and function. A universal notification platform receives data for identifying one or more notification recipients, one or more attributes of the one or more notification recipients, or a combination thereof. It then processes the data along with one or more other attributes pertaining to one or more service providers of the notification recipients in order to determine one or more rules for specifying routing of one or more notification messages to the one or more notification recipients by one or more information sources.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of interest is the development of services for transmitting targeted notification messages to the devices of subscribers to the service. The notification messages may be generated or provided as push messages conforming to various formats for accommodating different device or application types. Given the wide array of differing device types, operating systems and carrier networks to which the devices are configured, the notification messages must be adapted accordingly to ensure delivery. Unfortunately, there is currently no convenient means for ensuring the proper adaptation or generation of singular notification messages to account for the varying requirements and capabilities of the differing devices, applications or services to which the messages are to be directed.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for facilitating automated processing of targeted (push) notification messages for integration with notification recipients of different type and function.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises receiving data for identifying one or more notification recipients, one or more attributes of the one or more notification recipients, or a combination thereof.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for facilitating automated processing of targeted (push) notification messages for integration with notification recipients (e.g., devices, applications or services) of different type and function are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","Although various embodiments are described with respect to notification-enabled services, it is contemplated the approach described herein may be used as, or in connection with, any platform, service, web host or application for facilitating the delivery or generation of content, data, media or the like by way of a communication network. Also, providers of such services (service providers) may include, for example, any software entity that sends notifications (e.g., a weather alert service) to wireless device users, a communication service provider (e.g., cell network operator) that supports intelligent message routing\/filtering for its network of cellular subscribers, a generic notification-enabled service provider that delivers messages to recipients on behalf of other service providers, or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Targeted, or push messages, include for example network-based communications where the request for a given transaction is initiated by a publisher or central server, i.e., a application service provider having access to one or more notification-enabled services. This is in contrast to pull messages, where the request for transmission of information is initiated by the notification recipient (e.g., client device). Notification recipients receive information via the various notification-enabled services, and whenever new content (a notification message) is available, the notification-enabled service pushes the information out to the list of registered notification recipients. Push messaging architectures, underlying protocols and formats vary, and may include for example, SMS, e-mail, cloud to device messaging (C2DM), Apple\u00ae Push Notifications (APN), wireless application protocol (WAP) push and others.","Given the wide array of different notification recipients, protocols, operating systems and carrier networks to which the list of registered notification recipients may be configured, notification-enabled service providers must ensure their push messages are delivered accordingly. For example, if the notification provider wants to send notification messages to only those subscribers who use Apple\u00ae iPhone\u00ae devices, the provider must separately send a notification to the list of devices that are iPhones. However, for devices based on the Google Android\u2122 operating system (OS), the provider must separately send a separate notification to the list of notification recipients featuring this OS. The list of notification recipients as well as their capabilities and requirements must therefore be maintained by the provider at all times even though the content to be presented via the message is the same. In addition, the provider must persistently track device status changes or query the status of each device before broadcasting the notification to account for network, application, service or device conditions that could affect the delivery of notifications. Unfortunately, this places an additional burden on the service provider, which is only further exacerbated as the list of subscribers grows and\/or as different technologies, protocols and architectures are introduced to the market. Currently, there is no solution for supporting the unified delivery of notifications regardless of the technology used to actually deliver the push message.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to facilitate single push processing of notification messages across notification recipients, such as user devices -. The system  includes a universal notification platform  that is configured to route notification messages as generated by a notification-enabled service -to respective recipient devices -. The notification-enabled services , which may include network or protocol specific push messaging mechanisms (e.g., Short Messaging Service, Apple\u00ae Push Notification-enabled service), are relied upon by one or more application service providers . The application service providers  facilitate transmission of specific data via the services  such as traffic alerts, weather alerts, stock data, news data, etc.; the data being transmitted to respective notification recipients\/devices relative to a particular push notification requirement.","Devices or notification recipients may include, for example, any hardware, software, firmware or virtual entity to which notification messages may be received and\/or processed. For example, this may include a laptop, cellular phone or personal data assistant; an application operable by a laptop, cellular phone or personal data assistant such as an e-mail client, messaging application, etc.; a service such as a third-party messaging solution or web browser application (e.g., applet); or any combination thereof for which the various messages and\/or tags may be generated and directed. For example purposes, a device may be taken as synonymous with a notification recipient. The universal notification platform  facilitates routing of notification messages generated by respective notification-enabled services -to the various notification recipients (e.g., devices -) regardless of underlying platform, protocol, etc.","Routing of messages is facilitated by specifying one or more filter expressions and\/or conditions of message delivery, wherein the filter expressions and\/or conditions are then applied to notification recipients that correspond to (and are specifically tagged) for execution of the condition. In certain embodiments, the universal notification platform  is configured to facilitate a \u201cregistration\u201d process wherein each user device -, which features a respective application -for receiving the messages, registers itself with the universal notification platform \u2014i.e., as opposed to a respective notification-enabled service -. This registration process entails the receipt of a registration request, which includes the sharing of device, user, carrier or other information with the platform . For example, each device sends a set of tokens, identifiers or other data for describing various attributes of the device, including a platform\/OS name, vendor, platform\/OS version number, carrier name and other information. In addition, the universal notification platform  may also associate the attributes pertaining to the device -with attributes pertaining to properties of the associated device service provider\u2014i.e., mobile network, carrier or operator to which the device is configured. By way of example, the platform  may process the request in part by associating, with the request, attributes for indicating the roaming status of the device relative to the carrier network, subscriber home city, subscriber home country, current geo-location and position data, etc.","It is noted that the universal notification platform  serves as a proxy or intermediate service (e.g., domain naming service) for use in connection with respective notification-enabled services -, the one or more devices -, or a combination thereof. As a facilitation mechanism, the universal notification platform  enables the notification messages of respective services -to be routed to one or more devices -on their behalf. Of note, the platform  does not require the adherence or enforcement of a particular messaging protocol, but rather, enables the list of recipients to be restricted\/filtered without having to specify the delivery method. The specific protocol or transmission method is specified according to what each notification recipient supports, but is not required to enable the tagging process to be facilitated. For the purpose of illustration, the universal notification platform  is shown as a separate entity, although in certain embodiments, the platform  may be implemented as the notification-enabled service -","In the above described approach, the attributes of the device and\/or the service provider associated with the device (e.g., wireless communication provider) may be processed by the universal notification platform  for evaluation purposes. For example, each of the attributes (e.g., device OS, carrier network) may be processed and evaluated against one or more rules (tagging rules) for determining or specifying routing of the one or more notification messages received from the notification-enabled services -. The rules, which may include instructions for the generation of one or more tags or association of generated tags with a notification recipient, may indicate the conditions and\/or criteria for which messages are to be directed to the one or more devices -. In certain embodiments, the rules may include one or more logical expressions for evaluating the notification messages with respect to these conditions and\/or criteria; these expressions capable of being encapsulated in one or more tags . For example, the attributes for indicating the device is in a roaming status may be expressed as \u201cis_roaming\u201d variable of type Boolean that has a logical determinative value of \u201cTRUE\u201d or \u201cFALSE.\u201d As another example, the attribute for representing the platform version may be expressed as a \u201cplatform_version\u201d variable with a string value (e.g., \u201c2.2\u201d for representing version 2.2).","In certain embodiments, the notification-enabled services -registered to the platform  access it in order to configure the one or more tagging rules. The tagging rules define the various criteria for the generation of tags to be associated with respective registered devices -. The one or more tags are data elements, such as those conforming to a specific data structure or suitable as metadata, temporarily associated with each device on an automatic basis depending on the result of the evaluation process described above. The tagging rules are configured globally for each of the respective services -. The configuration process may include, for example, the sending of one or more requests to the platform  that contain the various logical expression(s) and the associated tag(s) to be assigned for encapsulating the expression. Once assigned, the evaluation process of the expression may occur, including determining a true (Boolean), string value, or the like.","The expressions may be expressed according to various syntaxes or programming semantics, including mark up languages such as extensive markup language (XML), as a tree of elements, or any other methods. Some examples are shown below in pseudo-language form. By way of example, the \u201c=>\u201d symbol as shown in the example expressions indicates that \u201cif the expression is \u2018TRUE,\u2019 then associate the following tag(s) with a given device.\u201d\n\n","In addition to the above described tags , some of the documented tags may be those that change automatically when the determined state of the subscriber and\/or notification recipient changes. Device state changes for example, may include those changes pertaining to the current status of the device relative to a given data network to which a respective device -is configured, a change in subscription preferences, a network operator specific change, etc. Geographical\/location data changes may be encapsulated as tags as \u201cgeo_latitude=<value>\u201d or \u201cgeo_longitude=<value>.\u201d As another example, time zone data may be encapsulated as \u201ccurrent_time_zone=<value>.\u201d Subscriber advertisement preferences may be captured as \u201cglobal_ads_opted_out.\u201d Tags featuring such nomenclature, expressions and references may therefore be evaluated against specified tag filters.","As part of the registration process, when a given device -registers with the universal notification platform , it sends information about its operating system\/platform and other capabilities (e.g., as tokens). Per the execution described above, the platform  evaluates the rule(s) configured for the associated notification-enabled service -for that device -and assigns the appropriate tag(s) as part of the registration data . The tags depend on the attributes used in the expression(s) evaluated at the registration. Hence, if one or more attributes involved in these expression(s) changes, then the tagging rules are re-evaluated, resulting in the updating of the tags as associated with respective notification recipients. The re-evaluation process can be performed automatically or upon request, such as by the recipient application.","It is noted, with respect to the registration process that the universal notification platform  serves as a proxy or intermediate service for the devices -and\/or the notification-enabled services -; enabling notification messages to be routed to one or more devices -accordingly by the universal notification platform . It is also noted that the tagging rules, as maintained by the platform  for enabling tag generation, can be hierarchical\u2014i.e., some of the rules are offered by the device -carrier\/network operator while others are prescribed by the notification-enabled service -","Once the tags are established for each respective device -, the notification-enabled service is able to perform one or more of: querying the registration database  to determine the list of tags associated a given device; send a notification to all subscribers based on their associated tags; restrict the delivery of notifications based on use of filter expressions against notification recipients based on their associated tag references, i.e., address only iPhone\u00ae tagged devices, send a notification that uses some Blackberry\u00ae-specific elements, send the notification only to non-roaming tagged subscribers; generate conditional notification messages, i.e., if the service wants to send one notification to all subscribers with additional elements specific to iPhone\u00ae with iOS 4.0 or higher, it would include a conditional part into the notification message that uses the tag filter; restrict messaging by geographic area, i.e., apply a tag filter indicating specific \u201cgeo_longitude\u201d and \u201cgeo_latitude\u201d tags and their values with the function \u201cwithin_range_from\u201d (hypothetical function taking two geo-locations and returning true if they are within certain specified maximum distance).","As shown in , the system  comprises user equipment (UE)  or devices having connectivity to the universal notification platform  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , universal notification platform  and notification-enabled service  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["113","113","113","201","203","205","207","207","207","113","209","211","213","113","215","109"]},"In one embodiment, an authentication module  authenticates users, user devices -and notification-enabled services -for interaction with the universal notification platform . In embodiments where the user devices -need not be authenticated, the authentication module  may be used to identify (rather than to authenticate) the appropriate notification recipients for interaction with the universal notification platform . The above described registration process is facilitated, at least in part, by the authentication module . By way of example, the authentication module  receives a request to subscribe to the platform  for enabling the directing\/routing of notification messages to devices . The subscription process, from the perspective of the subscribing user device , may include sending information (e.g., tokens) for identifying the operating system or platform of the device, a version number corresponding to the operating system or platform, a vendor name or vendor identifier associated with the user device, a model number of the device, a carrier or operator name or identifier, etc. This information may be passed onto the authentication module  by way of a request\/query process with the device , an extraction interaction, reading of device subscriber identity module (SIM) credentials, etc. Additional information may also be associated with the device data as indicated by the network operator or communications carrier, including roaming status data, subscriber home country, state and city information, current location data, etc. Preferences and settings information may be referenced to a specific user, user device , or combination thereof, and maintained as registration data .","From the perspective of the notification-enabled service , the registration process facilitated by the module  may include the sharing of data for enabling routing of messages by the platform , including: a listing of user devices -to which notification messages are to be sent, a subscription status, a periodicity of push messaging, reporting requirements, etc. It is contemplated, in certain embodiments, that the notification-enabled service  may specify various message compilation preferences to be performed by the platform , including the location of specific databases in which certain content is held, alternative data sources, etc. Of note, this feature may be suited for accommodating dynamic push messaging, wherein notification messages featuring multiple content types (e.g., images, media, text) may be dynamically compiled at the time of push rather than prior.","The authentication process performed by the module  may also include receiving and validating a login name and\/or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user (device user or notification developer) during a subscription or registration process with the platform . The login name and\/or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user by way of a graphical user interface to the platform  (e.g., as enabled by user interface module ). Registration data  for respective subscribers, which contains pertinent user or device profile data, may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively, the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings maintained as registration data  with an IP address, a carrier detection signal of a user device, mobile directory number (MDN), subscriber identity module (SIM) (e.g., of a SIM card), radio frequency identifier (RFID) tag or other identifier. The ability of the platform  to associate devices  with a particular notification-enabled service  may be based on a predetermined notification agreement also maintained by the authentication module (e.g., as registration data .","For the purpose of example, registration data  as processed\/received by the authentication module  includes information pertaining to the notification recipient, a user of the notification recipient, a notification-enabled service, a developer of the notification-enabled service, or a combination thereof. In addition, the authentication module  may also receive one or more tagging rules to be associated with specific subscribers. By way of example, the authentication module  maintains the tagging rules in the appropriate database, while operating in connection with a tag association module  to ensure proper association of a set of tagging rules  with a subscriber by way of one or more tags ","In one embodiment, a message retrieval module  receives notification messages from the one or more notification-enabled services -based on the registration data . By way of example, the message retrieval module  may operate in connection with a communication interface  for establishing a message delivery channel. The delivery channel may serve as a port or gateway through which specific content, messages or other data is to be received. In certain instances, the message retrieval module  may be configured to compile messages from varying sources at the discretion of the notification-enabled service .","In addition, when a particular service -sends a notification message, the message retrieval module  determines the notification message payload(s) as well as parses\/determines any tag filter expressions associated with the message. The expressions can apply to the notification message itself as well as to individual portions of the payload. Upon detection, the tag filter expressions may be passed on to the tag association and generation module  accordingly for processing and interpretation. It is noted, therefore, that the message retrieval module  is configured to interpret tag filters\/expressions specified in association with a given message by a sending service . By way of example, the message retrieval module  may interpret tag filters expressions such as:\n\n","A tag generation and association module , condition monitor  and push module , in certain embodiments, operate in connection with the message retrieval module . The tag generation and association module , for example, facilitate automated generation of tags to be associated with a registered\/subscribed device  based on the tagging rules . In addition, the module  facilitates an evaluation process for determining which devices correspond to the particular expression\/tag filters received by the message retrieval module . Evaluation may include performing an analysis or lookup of tags as maintained with respect to registration data  to determine which devices correspond to the expression. For example, when the \u201c!iphone\u201d expression as indicated above is provided in connection with a notification message, the analysis or lookup process may entail retrieving a list of all subscribed devices that are not iPhone\u00ae operating system tagged. The restricted list is then passed on to a push module  for execution of the notification message according to the predetermined schedule\u2014i.e., immediately or at a later time.","It is noted that there are two types of expressions and two evaluation processes capable of being performed by the tag generation and association module . One process is evaluating the attribute-based, logical expressions upon recipient registration as well as during runtime when some condition(s) change. The evaluation at this stage results in one or more tags being temporarily associated with the registration. The second type of expression is associated with the outgoing notification message. This expression is based on the tags previously associated with the registrations, wherein the expression effectively defines the \u201crouting\u201d for this particular message. Re-evaluation of the expression(s) of the first type does not happen for every message being sent, but rather when one or more attributes involved in these expressions change (or upon explicit request from the service provider). Such changes may be observed by a condition monitor .","The condition monitor  monitors attribute changes that may affect the out of an expression, and thus the generation of a tag. Resultantly, tags may be removed or added accordingly by the tag generation and association module  based on conditions (e.g., logical conditions, environmental conditions, network conditions) as expressed. This also corresponds to adaptation of the list of notification recipients to which messages are to be directed to by the push module . For example, for the iphone && !roaming && within_range (geo_longitude, geo_latitude, 45.47229, \u221273.519306, \u201c3 km\u201d) expression shown above; a device that was previously within the specified range but currently out of the range is not enabled for receipt of the notification message. The condition monitor  may retrieve device, network or other status information by performing a periodic query. Alternatively, devices -or the operator network (e.g., server) may be configured to provide updated state data in response to specific state\/event occurrences.","In one embodiment the user interface module  enables presentment of a graphical user interface for facilitating the device or notification-enabled service provider registration process. By way of example, the user interface module  generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces (APIs) or other function calls corresponding to the browser application or web portal application of the user devices -; thus enabling the display of graphics primitives.
