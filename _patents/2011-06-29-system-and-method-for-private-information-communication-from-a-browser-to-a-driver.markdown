{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the information processing. In particular, the present invention relates to a system and method for private information communication from a browser to a driver.","Electronic systems and circuits have made a significant contribution towards the advancement of modern society and are utilized in a number of applications to achieve advantageous results. Numerous electronic technologies such as digital computers, calculators, audio devices, video equipment, and telephone systems have facilitated increased productivity and reduced costs in analyzing and communicating data in most areas of business, science, education and entertainment. Frequently, these activities involve using various auxiliary components in presenting browser related information. However, communicating information to and from browsers can be difficult as communications to and from browser are often limited.","Typically, something that is running within a browser is running within a \u201csandbox\u201d environment and has no or very limited ability to communicate outside the browser. Due to security concerns browsers typically limit the communications to anything running within the browser and do not typically allow communication with other files within the computer. This can be particularly problematic for scenarios that could use private information (e.g., metadata, arguments, etc.) outside the browser. For example, it is typically difficult or prohibited for something in a browser to communicate private information with a driver. This in turn often limits user experiences. For example, scenarios associated with stereoscopic video streaming within a browser do not typically permit communication of private information that could enable more advanced three dimensional (3D) stereoscopic video display.","Systems and methods for communicating private information from a browser to a driver are presented. In one embodiment a private information communication method comprises: performing a private information communication process in which private information is communicated through a private information communication plug-in of a browser to a driver; and performing a driver process based upon the private communication information communicated in the private information communication process. In one exemplary implementation the private information communication process comprises: determining private information content; communicating the private information to the private information communication plug-in coupled to a private communication channel; calling a graphics driver from the private information communication plug-in using the private communication channel; and forwarding the private information from the private information communication plug-in to the driver via the private communication channel. The driver process can comprise: determining if there is an association between normal information and the private information, and processing the normal information in accordance with associated private information. In one embodiment, the private information is associated with stereoscopic 3D video streaming.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of procedures, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the means generally used by those skilled in data processing arts to effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A procedure, logic block, process, etc., is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps or instructions leading to a desired result. The steps include physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, optical, or quantum signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated in a computer system. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present application, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201ccomputing\u201d, \u201ccalculating\u201d, \u201cdetermining\u201d, \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar processing device (e.g., an electrical, optical, or quantum, computing device), that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities. The terms refer to actions and processes of the processing devices that manipulate or transform physical quantities within a computer system's component (e.g., registers, memories, other such information storage, transmission or display devices, etc.) into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within other components.","The present systems and methods facilitate communication of private information from a browser to a driver. In one embodiment, private communication information is forwarded from a browser to a driver through a private information communication plug-in. In one exemplary implementation, private communication information is forwarded in a dedicated private information communication channel. The private information communication can be utilized to allow applications in a browser that are not naturally aware of a characteristic or feature (e.g., stereoscopic three dimensional video, audio bit-rate, etc.) to communicate information about the feature or characteristic to a driver. In one embodiment, the private information (e.g., metadata, arguments, etc.) is utilized by the driver in the processing of corresponding normal information (e.g., video content, audio content, etc.) for communication to a component being driven.","It is appreciated that present systems and methods can be implemented in a variety of situations or environments. Present systems and methods can facilitate rendering of stereoscopic 3D video for an in-browser player application. In one embodiment, metadata corresponding to the stereoscopic 3D video is forwarded from a player that is running in a browser via a private information communication plug-in through a private information communication channel to a graphics processing unit (GPU) software display driver. In one exemplary implementation, calls associated with normal information (e.g., surface information, content bit stream, etc.) from the application communicated on a normal information communication channel are \u201cintercepted\u201d by the driver and processed utilizing the corresponding private information (e.g., metadata, arguments, etc.) communicated on the private communication channel in order to facilitate displaying the stereo views correctly on a 3D capable display.

In one embodiment, the private information is communicated in a dedicated private information communication channel (e.g., path, pipeline, etc.). In one exemplary implementation, the private information is communicated via a private information communication plug-in within the browser. The private information can include metadata. The metadata can be associated with or related to normal information communicated to the driver (e.g., video content, audio content, etc.). In one exemplary implementation, the private information communication process comprises: determining private information content; communicating the private information to the private information communication plug-in coupled to a private communication channel; calling a graphics driver (e.g., GPU display driver, GPU audio driver, etc.) from the private information communication plug-in using the private communication channel; and forwarding the private information from the private information communication plug-in to the driver via the private communication channel.","In block , a driver process is performed utilizing the private information communicated in the private information communication process of block . In one embodiment, the private information is utilized in coordination with normal information communicated to the driver. In one exemplary implementation, normal information communicated to a driver includes content and the private information includes metadata corresponding to the content, and the metadata is utilized in driver processing activities associated with the content. The metadata can be utilized to impact how the driver prepares content (e.g., processes associated normal information, configures information, etc.) for communication to a driven component (e.g., an auxiliary component, a display component, a speaker component, etc.). In one embodiment, the driver process comprises: determining if there is an association between normal information and the private information, and processing the normal information in accordance with associated private information. In one embodiment, the private information is associated with stereoscopic 3D video streaming.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","100","300"]},"Private communication system  includes browser , driver , normal communication channel  and private communication channel . In one exemplary implementation, driver  is a graphics processing unit (GPU) display driver. Browser  is communicatively coupled to normal communication channel  and private communication channel  which in turn are communicatively coupled to driver .","In one embodiment, browser  includes an application component , runtime component  and private information communication plug-in component . It is appreciated that the application component can include a variety of different types of application components (e.g., video player application component, an audio player application component, etc.). Similarly, the runtime component  can include a variety of different types of corresponding runtime components. It is also appreciated that a private information communication plug-in component can include a variety of different types of plug-ins. The private information communication plug-in can correspond to the type of browser. In one embodiment, a HTML bridge component (not shown) between runtime component  and private information communication plug-in  invokes a JavaScript component to call and forward the information to the appropriate private information communication plug-in .","It is appreciated that there can be a variety of different types of browsers. In one embodiment, the browser is an Internet Explorer browser and the private information communication plug-in is an ActiveX control plug-in. The browser can be a Firefox or Chrome browser and the private information communication plug-in is a Netscape plug-in application programming interface (NPAPI) based plug-in. It is also appreciated that there can be a variety of different types of applications within the browser. In one embodiment, the application is a video player within the browser (e.g., a Silverlight 4 player, a Flash player, etc.). The video player can include a graphical user interface for viewing a video (e.g., viewing area, play indicator, stop indicator, fast forward indicator, reverse indicator, pause indicator, etc.). In one exemplary implementation, a video player does not need to change to implement the present systems and methods.","The components of private communication system  cooperatively operate to communicate information from the browser  to the driver . Browser  performs a variety of browser operations including forwarding normal information to normal communication channel  and private communication information to private communication channel  via private information communication plug-in . Normal communication channel  communicates normal information to driver  and private communication channel  communicates private information to driver . In one embodiment, driver  acts as an interface and forwards information to a component (not shown) driven by driver . It is appreciated a variety of different drivers can be included (e.g., a graphics processing unit driver display driver, an audio speaker driver, etc.). Driver  performs various driver operations and processing, including coordinating utilization of the private communication in performing driver processing or operations on corresponding or associated information received on normal communication channel .","In one embodiment, metadata is sent from the in-browser player application to the driver, through the browser private information communication plug-in, enabling the driver to properly intercept and process corresponding normal information calls from the application. In one exemplary implementation, the private communication channel communicates metadata associated with streaming stereoscopic 3D video and the normal communication channel communicates BLIT calls. A BLIT is basically an operation of transferring a surface for display or a way for the runtime to indicate to the driver that there is a certain amount of surface content (e.g., a rectangle, a primitive, etc.) for presentation on a display. The metadata sent by the in-browser application to the browser private information communication plug-ins can include the width of the player window, the height of the player window, the stereo mode (to indicate whether the stereo source data layout is left-right, right-left, top-bottom, etc.) and a flag indicating whether to enable or disable stereoscopic 3D rendering. The metadata can also include the process id of the browser window, along with other commands (e.g., to indicate whether the metadata record should be added to, or removed from, the driver's cached record store, etc). In one exemplary implementation the browser private information communication plug-in sends the private information to the driver using a private backdoor driver interface.","As described above, in one embodiment the driver intercepts the normal information and processes it in accordance with the private information. In one exemplary implementation, if the player has bitmap caching enabled on it, then the player, through the runtime, makes per frame surface or texture BLIT calls to the driver with the video data as the input surface. The metadata (e.g., metadata described above, etc.) sent by the in-browser private information communication plug-in is used to indicate to the driver which surface or texture BLIT calls from the normal communication channel are to be intercepted. In one embodiment, if criteria in the private information corresponds to criteria in the normal information the private information is utilized in the driver processing of the private information. In one exemplary implementation, if the width, height and process id specified in the metadata matches the width, height and process identification (ID) respectively for a surface or texture BLIT, then the driver \u201cintercepts\u201d the call and performs additional processing on the data (e.g., processing in accordance with the metadata, etc.).","It is appreciated there a variety of different types of private information that can be communicated. The private information metadata can include description of features or characteristics of the normal information (e.g., the bit rate or frequency of the stream, the content type, format of the content, etc.). In one embodiment, metadata associated with still images can be communicated (e.g., what the image content type is, JPEG, etc.). In one embodiment, metadata associated with audio can be communicated. The metadata can include information that would enable a driver to use the metadata to enable higher-level quality algorithms to decrypt or decompress the normal information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"In block , a private information communication process is preformed in which private information is communicated from a browser to a driver. In block  normal information and private information from an application is forwarded to a runtime component. The normal information can include image information, surface or texture information, audio information, and various other types of information. In block , the normal information is forwarded from the runtime component to a driver and the private information is forwarded to a private information communication plug-in. In one embodiment, prior to the start of video playback, a browser player application determines the associated metadata, and sends that to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) by invoking a JavaScript function using an HTML Bridge. Depending on the browser that is detected (e.g., by the JavaScript, etc.), the JavaScript then sends this metadata to the appropriate private information communication plug-in. In one exemplary implementation, if the browser is an Internet Explorer browser the information is forwarded to an ActiveX control plug-in and if the browser is a Firefox or Chrome browser the information is forwarded to a Netscape plug-in application programming interface (NPAPI) based plug-in. In block  the private information communication plug-in calls into a driver. In one exemplary implementation, if a call from the JavaScript is Set_Stereo Info(XXX, YYY, ZZZ) in which XXX, YYY and ZZZ are arguments, the private information communication plug-in scrambles the arguments and repacks them in a private backdoor call to the driver. In one embodiment, the private information communication plug-in calls into a graphics processing kernel mode driver by using a backdoor interface in order to send the metadata to the driver.","In block , a driver process is performed utilizing the private information communicated in the private information communication process of block . In one embodiment, the private information is utilized in coordination with normal information communicated to the driver. In one exemplary implementation, normal information communicated to browser includes content and the private information includes metadata corresponding to the content, and the metadata is utilized in driver processing activities associated with the content. In one embodiment, the metadata is associated with stereoscopic 3D video information. While one present example is described in terms of an implementation in which the source stereoscopic data is in a left-right format, it is appreciated similar logic can be extended to apply to other layout formats as well. In block , the driver copies the left and the right view data from the source texture into two separate surfaces, which are then page flipped. In block  active shutter glasses can ensure that the right \u201ceye\u201d is blanked out when the left view is being flipped, and that the left \u201ceye\u201d is blanked out when the right view is being flipped.","Present systems and methods can also include various security measures for the private information communication. In one embodiment, additional measures (e.g., obfuscating, replacing with symbols that appear nonsensical, scrambling, encrypting, etc.) can be implemented on the private information to increase security for the private information communication. In one exemplary implementation, the private information communication plug-in is implemented in a decompiled setting and susceptibility to attempts at maliciously overwriting registers is minimized. In one embodiment, the application component includes a communication component (e.g., communication box ) that restricts information flow into the application component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","501","502","520","521","525","504","507","508","550","570","500","500","591","521","520","501","592","521","520","502","593","520","550","594","597","525","520","504","507","508","550","551","555","559"]},"The components of computer system  cooperatively operate to perform a variety of processing tasks and facilitate efficient memory accesses.
