title: Progressive categoration and treatment of refund abusers
abstract: Various methods and systems are provided to manage on-line transactions by categorizing users who request refunds of purchases (e.g., digital goods) and requiring certain conditions to be met before a refund is issued or processed. The conditions change for different categories of users. In one embodiment, a refund process is made progressively harder or burdensome as users are categorized in worsening refund abuse categories.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to on-line purchases and purchasers and in particular to methods of handling on-line purchasers.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks, such as the Internet. Consumers routinely search for and purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions can take place directly between an on-line merchant or retailer and the consumer, where payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions can also take place with the aid of an on-line payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties. Purchasing through the Internet from the convenience of a consumer's home, office, or virtually anywhere (with mobile devices) is one main reason why on-line purchases are growing faster and faster.","However, with the proliferation and ease of on-line purchasing, abuse of on-line purchasing has also increased, especially with the growing popularity of digital goods through social networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace. An expanding area of abuse is with returns or refunds of purchased items. For example, a user may purchase a digital good, such as a virtual beer or virtual flowers, to send to someone on a social networking site. After downloading or sending the digital good, the user may then request a refund from the merchant, with or without cause. For the latter, many merchants allow unconditional refunds on purchases of digital goods or other types of items, as a means to promote sales and use. Even if the digital goods are very inexpensive, e.g., 99 cents, the volume of refunds can result in both a not insignificant revenue loss for the merchant and large losses of time processing the refund request for the payment provider and\/or the merchant. With digital goods, the consumer realizes the benefit (e.g., ability to download or send the good), without any cost (a refund of the purchase price).","One response to users abusing refund policies is to increase the requirements for a refund. This may include requiring a purchaser to provide a reason for the return, allowing returns only within a certain time period, giving only partial returns once the good or item is purchased, or something as harsh as an absolute no-refund policy. However, increasing requirements for refunds may reduce the effectiveness of the merchant's goals to attract consumers to the site and for purchases.","Thus, there is a need for a more effective way handling on-line refunds without alienating desirable consumers.","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a system and method first categorizes or rates users or purchasers within two or more categories of refund \u201cabusers\u201d and makes the process of obtaining a refund for higher abusers more difficult than with lesser abusers. Categorization of abusers can be by any suitable method or algorithm, such as based on the number of refunds made during a specified period of time, the time between a purchase and a refund request, the total dollar amount of refunds, and\/or purchase and refund history of the user with a particular merchant. The refunds can be based on digital goods, such as apps or objects sent in MySpace, Facebook, etc., or physical goods. In one embodiment, abusers are placed in three categories: 1) low abuser, which includes non-abusers, 2) medium abuser, and 3) high abuser.","In one example, a low abuser simply complies with the standard policy for refunds, which may be stating a reason for the refund and replying to a short Captcha (e.g, 5 characters). The refund is then processed and the funds are received in the consumer's account quickly, e.g., one business day. Medium abusers may be required to answer specific questions, e.g., 5, reply to a longer Captcha (e.g., 10 characters), and then wait a longer time for the refund to show up (e.g., 3-5 business days). High abusers are then required to go through an even more difficult and time-consuming process, for example, answering more specific questions (e.g., 10), replying to an even longer Captcha (e.g., 15 characters), and then waiting an even longer time for the refund to be processed (e.g., 7-10 business days). High abusers may even be subject to the merchant refusing to accept further transactions from the high abuser.","The categorization of abusers may be dynamic, such that an individual can be moved between different categories of abusers, based on changes to the user profile. For example, if the abuser has made numerous purchases without refund requests, the abuse may be moved from a medium abuser rating to a low abuser rating. Conversely, if an abuser makes many purchases and refund requests within a short period of time, the abuser may move from a low abuser rating to a high abuser rating. Notifications can be made to users whenever a user's abuser rating changes.","As a result, non-abusers or low abusers still enjoy the convenience of purchases and refunds, and the merchant still can attract these desirable consumers. However, consumers who continually purchase and refund will be deterred from either purchasing or requesting refunds, due to the higher inconvenience for the user.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"After use, the consumer may decide to return the good and request a refund for any number of reasons. There are legitimate reasons, such as the good being defective (e.g., not accessible or downloadable), different than advertised (e.g., receiving a different digital good than what was shown), or poor quality (e.g., the received image was blurred, distorted, or of low resolution). There are also reasons that, while allowed by the merchant or site guidelines, may be dishonest and aim to abuse the refund policies of the merchant or site. One such example is a site that has a \u201cno questions asked\u201d refund policy, which allows the consumer to obtain a refund simply by requesting one. The consumer retains or has already used the digital good, but is still given a refund per the guidelines. Such guidelines may be used because 1) the cost of the digital good for the merchant or site is so low, 2) the purchase price of the digital good is low, 3) desire to attract more users\/consumers to the site, and 4) reduce or eliminate the work needed to process refund requests for such low value\/cost items. Merchants may tolerate and expect consumers will purchase digital goods, use them, and ask for a refund. However, if this becomes prevalent, either with multiple consumers or with a single consumer who abuse the system, the merchant may want to address this specifically, while not alienating consumers who do not abuse the system.","Returning to , the merchant, site, and\/or payment provider receives information about the \u201cabuser\u201d at step  As used herein, \u201cabuser\u201d refers to consumers who make a purchase. The consumer does not necessarily have to requested a refund previously, either warranted or unwarranted. Information about the abuser may include the length of time the consumer has been a customer of the site, number of refunds requested and given within a time period, e.g., the last 30 days, the number of purchases made within a time period, the percentage of refunds from purchases made over a time period, the average number of days between a purchase and a refund, the total dollar value of refunds, the average dollar value of a refund, and\/or the total dollars spent at the site, merchant, or with the payment provider. Depending on the algorithm or methodology used, some, all, or additional information may be provided.","Next, at step , the information is processed to rate or categorize the abuser. Processing may include determining which information is needed and which is not. The useful or relevant information is applied to a suitable algorithm to obtain a value or rating for the abuser. In one embodiment, the relevant information includes the percentage of refunds in the past month and the number of days between a purchase and a refund request. The percentage of refunds can be calculated by dividing the number of refunds requested in the past month by the number of purchases made in the past month. Thus, the percentage number can be any number between 0 (representing an abuser who has not requested any refunds in the past month with at least one purchase) to 100 (representing an abuser who has requested refunds for all purchases made in the past month). If the rating is the first time for the abuser, i.e., the abuser has not been rated before, the number of days is the average number of days between purchase and refund. If the rating is for an update to an existing abuser rating, the number of days is the number of days between the most recent purchase and refund. An average number of days can also be used for updating an abuser rating. The number of days can be anywhere between 0 (representing an abuser who made a purchase and a refund request on the same day) and 300 or more (representing an abuser who has kept a purchased good for a very long time before requesting a refund). A high number of days may indicate undesirable abusers who gain the advantage of a purchased good for a long time and then ask for their money back. This information can be used to calculate a number that places the abuser in a certain category, as will be discussed below, or the information can be processed and placed within categories.","In one embodiment, there are three categories of abusers. Note that there can be any number, and the use of three is just one example. The three categories can be \u201clow\u201d abuse, \u201cmedium\u201d abuse, and \u201chigh\u201d abuse. If the information is processed to place ranges within a category, a percentage ranging from 0 to 30 can be low abuse, 30+ to 40 can be medium abuse, and 40+ to 100 can be high abuse in this example. Number of days between a purchase and refund ranging from zero to two days can be low abuse, over two days up to five days can be medium abuse, and over five days can be high abuse.","This processed information is then used, at step , to categorize or rate the abuser, e.g., assigning a value to the abuser and then using the value to categorize the abuser. Continuing with the example, abuse points or value ranging from 0 to 0.6 is low abuse, 0.601 to 2 is medium abuse, and 2.0+ on up is high abuse. This corresponds to multiplying the refund rate (percentage) with the time between purchase and refund. For example, in the low abuse category, the refund rate is 0 to 0.3 and the time between purchase and refund is 0 to 2, giving a range of 0 to 0.6. Similarly, in the medium abuse category, the refund rate of 0.30+ to 0.4 and the time of 2.0+ to 5.0 results in abuse points ranging from 0.6+ to 2.0. In the high abuse category, the refund rate of 0.4+ to 1.0 and the time range of 5.0+ on up gives a range of abuse points from 2.0+ on up.","In another embodiment, the categorization in step  can be determined by simply calculating an abuser's point value based on the abuser's information regardless of what category that information is placed into. Thus, using the above example, an abuser with a refund rate of 45% or 0.45 and a time between purchase and refund of only one day would have an abuse value of 0.45, which would place that abuser in the low abuse category (0 to 0.6).","Regardless of how an abuser is rated or categorized, once done, the abuser is placed in a category or is associated with a rating or point value. This new current rating may be better, worse, or the same as the previous rating. A better rating may be due the abuser reducing the percentage of refunds and\/or reducing the number of days between purchase and refund. A worse rating may be due to the abuser increasing the percentage of refunds and\/or increasing the number of days between purchase and refund. A same rating, which may be exactly the same or within a range defined as being the \u201csame,\u201d may be due to the latest actions being consistent with the abuser's previous history. At step , the new rating or category is compared with the abuser's previous category or rating. If that has changed, the abuser may be notified of that change at step . Notification can be by email to the abuser or any other suitable method, including a text message, a call to the abuser, or a mailed letter. In addition to the new rating, the notification may also include conditions required for a refund that are associated with the new rating. In some embodiments, a user may be notified even if the rating has not changed.","Notifications are useful to inform abusers of their current ratings, but may also be useful for motivating abusers to improve their ratings. For example, if the abuser rating has improved, with easier requirements for obtaining refunds, the abuser may continue to try and improve or try and maintain the improved rating. If the abuser rating has gotten worse (along with more strenuous requirements for receiving a refund), the abuser may strive to improve the rating.","Next, at step , the merchant, site, or payment provider determines whether the abuser is requesting a refund. Updating the abuser's rating may be prompted without an actual refund request, such as if the abuser has purchased several goods recently, without any requests for return. If no refund was requested, the process ends, and the system waits for the next chance to update the abuser's rating, e.g., after a certain amount of time passes, after a purchase or refund, etc. However, if a refund was requested, the system selects, at step , the conditions the abuser will be required to meet before a refund is issued. The worse the abuser's categorization or rating is, the more difficult the refund process will be. The process can differ, as long as it is more difficult, burdensome, or inconvenient as the abuse rating goes up.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Abuse Rating","Low Abuse","Medium Abuse","High Abuse"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Abuse Points","0 to 0.6","0.6+ to 2","2+ on up"]},{"entry":["Captcha Size","5","10","15"]},{"entry":["Text Field","Yes","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":"Requirement"},{"entry":["Number of","0","\u20025","10"]},{"entry":"Questions"},{"entry":["Number of days","0","3-5 business days","7-10 business"]},{"entry":["before refund",{},"days"]},{"entry":["Merchant can deny","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":"user"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"At step , a determination is made as to which set of requirements are applicable to the user requesting a refund, based on the abuse rating or abuse points, i.e., whether the user has a low, medium, or high abuse rating. Once determined, the merchant, site, or payment provider sends the user a Captcha, with the size of the Captcha depending on the user abuse rating. For a low abuse rating, the Captcha size is five characters, for medium abuse, it is ten characters, and for high abuse, the Captcha size is 15 characters in length. Thus, high abusers are required to recognize and reply with longer Captchas than low or medium abusers. If, as determined at step , the Captcha received from the user is incorrect, the user may be notified and another Captcha is transmitted to the user if is allowed another try, as determined at step . If the user has not replied with a correct Captcha and the user has no more attempts, the refund request is not processed, and user rating is updated, which may be the same, higher, or lower, as discussed above with respect to . The user may be notified of the refund request being denied, reason(s) for the denial, and\/or an updated abuse rating.","However, if as determined at step , the user has responded with a correct Captcha, a series of questions is transmitted to the user at step . There may be no questions if the user has a low abuse rating, five questions if the user has a medium abuse rating, and ten questions if the user has a high abuse rating. The questions may be the same or different between different abuse categories. For example, the questions may include objective questions, such as purchase date, method of payment, purchase date, received date, merchant name, etc., and\/or subjective questions, such as reason(s) for return, satisfaction with merchant, etc. A determination is then made, at step , as to whether all the questions were answered by the user. If not, the user is notified, such as by a re-transmission of the question(s), assuming the user is allowed another try, as determined at step . If the user has not answered all the required questions and the user is not allowed another try, the refund is not processed, and the user rating is updated as needed at step .","If the required questions have all been answered, the next determination, at step , is whether the answers to the questions are acceptable. This may involve determining whether the answers to objective questions were correct, such as by comparing the answers to known information. For subjective questions, the length of the answer or whether the answer actually corresponds to the question asked may be determined. If an answer does not meet a length requirement or the answer does not appear to answer the question asked, the conclusion may be that the answer(s) are not acceptable. If that is the case, the user is allowed to re-enter answers until no more attempts are allowed. At that point, if the answers are still not acceptable, the user rating is updated as needed at step , and the refund request is denied.","However, if as determined at step , the answers are acceptable to the merchant, site, or payment provider, a determination is made as to whether the time requirement has been met at step . In this example, a low abuse user's request for a refund is processed immediately, a medium abuse user's request is processed in three to five business days, and a high abuse user's request is processed in seven to ten business days. If the time requirement has been met (e.g., the user has waited the required number of days), the refund request is processed at step , and the user receives the funds in a designated account, such as an account with the merchant or payment provider. Processing the refund may include notifying the user, such as by email or text, that the funds are now in the user's account (e.g., shown as a credit from the earlier purchase).","Once the refund is processed at step , the user's abuse rating is updated at step . In one embodiment, the merchant has the option of not accepting future transactions from the user. Thus, using the example above, if the user is categorized as a high abuse user, the merchant may decide to not allow the user to purchase any more goods at the merchant site or store. The payment provider may send a notice to the merchant asking the merchant whether it wishes to cancel the user's account. On instructions from the merchant, the payment provider and\/or merchant takes the necessary steps to not allow any future transactions with the merchant. The payment provider may also elect to not handle any payment services for the user. The user may be notified of any such action. The user may also be notified before such action is taken, for example as a warning that if the refund requests continue, the user's account will be canceled with the merchant and\/or payment provider. This advance warning, as opposed to a cancellation without warning, gives the user the opportunity to improve the abuse rating, which would be beneficial to both the user and merchant or payment provider.","Treating users differently based on how they are categorized or ranked as to refund abuse allows desirable users to continue with and take advantage of \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201cno questions asked\u201d refund policies from merchants, while making it harder for refund abusers to obtain a refund. Making the refund process progressively harder or more burdensome may discourage users from abusing a merchant's refund policy and\/or give a merchant or payment provider the option of canceling an undesirable user's account.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","340","370","360","370"]},"Client device , merchant server , and payment service provider server  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein.
