{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application, entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Providing Products and Services Upgrades and Work Order Status in a Cable Services Network\u201d, filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Oct. 26, 2004 and assigned U.S. Ser. No. 60\/622,110.","The present invention relates to ordering products and services and checking the status of pending work orders via an interactive television session in a cable services network.","With the advent of cable services networks, cable customers have grown accustomed to receiving a variety of television programming from numerous broadcasting sources. In recent years, technology advances have enabled customers to receive an even greater variety of products and services through cable services networks. Modern cable services networks provide traditional video television programming, telephone services, high speed internet access, electronic mail services, video-on-demand, information services, and the like. Through the use of set-top boxes (computing systems), cable services providers can provide interactive television services to customers. Such interactive television services allow customers to interact directly with services providers in response to services and product offerings presented to the customers through their television sets.","Unfortunately, according to prior systems, once a customer decides to order an offered or promoted product or service, or if the customer desires information on a pending work order associated with a previously ordered product, service or upgrade, the customer must call the product\/services provider to complete an order or to determine the status of a pending work order. Often when the customer calls the product\/services provider, the customer is placed on hold for a lengthy period of time. Because many calls to product\/services providers are based on impulse buying a calling customer may hang up rather than stay on hold resulting in a lost sale. Even after the customer is connected to a sales agent, the customer may have to spend a lengthy period of time providing information to the sales agent. And, in many cases, the customer calls the product\/services provider to check the status of a previous order, but finds the difficulty of receiving the status information unacceptable.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for methods and systems for allowing cable services customers to order offered products and services and to check the status of pending work orders associated with previously ordered products and services via an automated interactive session between the customer and the cable services provider. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing methods and systems for self-provisioning offered products and services and for automatically determining the status of pending work orders associated with previously offered products and services via an interactive television services session between a customer and a cable services network.","According to aspects of the present invention, a cable services provider may offer a variety of products and\/or services via one or more promotional screen displays or user interfaces presented to a customer at the customer's television set. Upon selection of a given product or service offering or upon a request for information regarding a pending work order associated with a previously ordered product or service, an upgrade center user interface is launched at the customer's television set. If the customer requests work-order status information on a previously ordered product or service, a status request is sent from the customer's cable services set-top box to a backend application server. From the application server, a data call is passed to a web services system from which a query is sent to one or more data services containing information requested by the customer. In response to the data call from the web services system, information regarding the status of the customer's previously ordered product or service is passed back to the application server via the web services system. At the application server, a work order status update message is formatted and is passed to the customer's set-top box which, in turn, presents the work order status to the customer at the customer's television set.","If the customer desires to order an offered product or service, the customer may select a given offered product or service through one or more promotional displays or user interfaces presented to the customer. Upon selection of a particular product or service, a product\/service description may be requested from the customer's set-top box for presentation to the customer at the customer's television set. If the customer selects the presented product or service for provisioning to the customer via the customer's cable services set-top box, a determination is made as to whether the selected product or service is presently available for provisioning to the customer. If the selected product or service is not presently available, a customer lead generation form may be automatically generated and populated with information about the customer from a customer data profile maintained for the customer at the customer's set-top box. In addition to the information pre-populated into the customer lead generation form from the customer data profile, additional information may be requested from the customer through an interactive television session in which the customer may provide information using the customer's television remote control device. Once the customer lead generation form is completed, the form may be submitted to the backend application server via the customer's set-top box so that sales personnel of the cable services network may receive the customer lead generation form and follow-up with the customer once the requested product or service becomes available.","If the selected product or service is available, an order form for the selected product or service may be automatically generated and pre-populated from customer information maintained in the customer data profile maintained for the customer at the customer's set-top box. Prior to processing an order for the selected product or service, an order qualification analysis is performed for the selected product or service. First, a determination is made as to whether the selected product or service is available at the service address associated with the customer. If not, an error message may be presented to the customer, and a customer lead generation form may be prepared for the customer for forwarding to cable services network sales personnel. Next, a determination may be made as to whether services codes for the ordered product or service are already provisioned for the customer. That is, a determination is made as to whether the ordered product or service is already provisioned on the customer's set-top box. Next, a determination is made as to whether a work order for the selected product or service order is already opened for the customer's service address. Next, a determination may be made as to whether any other prerequisites for providing the ordered product or service are met for the ordering customer, for example whether a customer requesting electronic mail services has a required high speed Internet connection. According to aspects of the invention, the order qualification determinations described herein are made by requesting information about the customer from a backend data services system by passing an identifier for the customer's set-top box to the backend data services system via a backend application server and web services system.","If the selected product or service order is qualified, as described, order completion options may be requested from the customer via an interactive television services session from the customer's cable services set-top box. For example, the customer may be asked whether the product or service may be self-installed, or whether professional installation is required. For another example, the customer may be provided with a number of installation times available at the customer's service address. For another example, the customer may be provided with options such as product equipment types, data transmission speeds associated with ordered services, and the like. Once required product\/service order options selections are made by the customer, the customer's product or service order is processed by the customer's cable services provider, and information regarding the customer's order including installation times and pricing are forwarded to the customer's set-top box from the cable services provider for presentation to the customer at the customer's television set. If the customer is not satisfied with the provided information, the customer may make changes to the product\/service order through additional interactive communication with the cable services provider. Once the customer is satisfied with information confirming the customer's product or service order, an order confirmation is presented to the customer at the customer's television set.","These and other features and advantages, which characterize the present invention, will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and systems for allowing a cable services customer to self-provision offered products and services, and for allowing the customer to automatically obtain work order status information for previously ordered products and services via an interactive television services session in a cable services network. These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures, embodiments of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.","Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["115","120","115","110","115","105","140"]},"According to embodiments of the present invention, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side (backend) head end  and a client-side customer via a client-side set-top box (STB) functionally connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, modern CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video-on-demand, and information services.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, the \u201cin band\u201d signaling space operates at a frequency between 54 and 860 megahertz. The signaling space between 54 and 860 megahertz is generally divided into 6 megahertz channels in which may be transmitted a single analog signal or a greater number (e.g., up to ten) digital signals.","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range generally lies between zero and 54 megahertz. According to embodiments of the present invention, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box . According to one embodiment of the present invention, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments of the present invention, the application server  obtains customer profile data from services provider data services  for preparing a customer profile that may be utilized by the set-top box  for tailoring certain content provided to the customer and for pre-populating product\/services order forms and customer lead generation forms. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer. For example, a billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. An electronic mail system  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information and electronic mail usage data. An authentication system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services.","The customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database may also include information on products and services subscribed to by a customer from her cable services provider. For example, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the customer information database may contain data to allow a determination as to whether a particular product or service is already provisioned at a customer service address or whether a work order is pending for a particular product or service provisioning at the customer service address. The customer information database may also include information that allows for a determination as to whether prerequisites for provisioning a requested product of service are met by a requesting customer. For example, if a customer requests electronic mail services and high speed Internet access is a prerequisite for electronic mail services, the customer information database may be queried to determine whether the required Internet access is provisioned at the requesting customer location or address.","As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments of the present invention, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . When the application server  requires customer profile data from one or more of the data services  for preparation or update of a customer profile, the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any available data for a given customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer profile data. The customer profile data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.","Operation","According to embodiments of the present invention, in order for a cable services customer to order an offered product or service, or to obtain work order status information for a previously ordered product or service, or for obtaining information regarding special offers provided by the customer's cable services provider, the customer may launch an upgrade center user interface , illustrated in .

According to an embodiment of the present invention, the particular customer is identified by passing an identification of the customer's set-top box  to the application server with the data call.","The web services system  using the set-top box identification queries the data services system  for data representing the status of previously ordered products or services directed to the requesting customer. As described above with reference to , one or more databases may be maintained at the data services system , for example the customer information database , for containing a variety of information on a given cable services customer and associated with an identified set-top box . Accordingly, in response to the data call from the web services system , data from the data services system  representing the status of any pending product or services work orders associated with the identified set-top box or customer service location\/address are returned to the web services system  which in turn passes the data to the application server . For a detailed discussion of data flow between the set-top box  and the server side of the cable services system, see United States patent application, entitled Preparation and Utilization of Customer Profile Data in a Cable Services Network, Ser. No. 10\/885,292, filed Jul. 2, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set out herein.","At block , the application server formats the data received from the web services system  for presentation to the customer in response to the customer's work order status request. At block , the status data formatted at the application server  is passed to the set-top box  via the HFC network . At block , the set-top box  passes the formatted data to the customer's television set  and presents a television screen showing the status of the customer's pending work order. According to an embodiment of the present invention, if the customer has more than one pending work order, status for all pending work orders may be presented to the customer at block , or the customer may be provided with a list of pending work orders from which to select. Once the customer selects one of the one or more pending work orders, status information for the selected pending work order may be retrieved from the data services system  for presentation to the customer as described herein. According to an alternative embodiment, the work order status data may be passed from the application server to the set-top box , and the set-top box  may format the data for presentation to the customer at block .","Referring back to block , if the customer selects a particular product, service or special offer from the upgrade center user interface , as described above with reference to , or alternatively, if the customer's system is configured to allow the customer to select a product or service directly from an alternative user interface, for example, the user interfaces described with reference to , the routine proceeds to block . At block , the product or services selection by the customer causes the set-top box  to retrieve a product or service presentation providing information about the selected product or service. The product or service presentation is passed to the customer's television set by the set-top box  and is presented to the customer as a television screen to allow the customer to review helpful information about the selected product including general product description, product availability at the customer's service address, and pricing. As should be understood, other presentation information including video clips associated with the selected product or service and customer critiques of the selected product or service may be presented.","At block , a determination is made as to whether the selected product or service is available for provisioning to the requesting customer at the customer's service location\/address. According to one embodiment, the determination of selected product\/service availability may be performed at the set-top box  which may be pre-populated on a periodic basis with data representing the availability of offered products and\/or services for the service address associated with the identified set-top box. According to an alternative embodiment, each time a product or service is selected, the set-top box  may query the application server  via the HFC network . The application server  may query the data services system  via the web services system  for information regarding the availability of the selected product or service for the service address associated with the identified set-top box .","If a determination is made that the selected product or service is not available for the customer's service address, the routine proceeds to block , illustrated in . At block , the set-top box  prepares a lead generation form for the customer for passing to products\/services sales representatives of the customer's cable services provider to notify the cable services provider that the customer would like the selected product or service, and that the customer should be contacted with more information as soon as the selected product or service becomes available at the customer's service address. At block , the lead generation form is pre-filled with information about the customer from a customer data profile maintained for the customer at the set-top box . The customer data profile includes data on the customer such as the customer's name, address, age, social security number, presently provisioned services, and the like. Other information contained in the customer data profile may include credit information and demographic information. For a detailed discussion of customer data profiles maintained on the cable services customer, see United States patent application, entitled Preparation and Utilization of Customer Profile Data in a Cable Services Network, Ser. No. 10\/885,292, filed Jul. 2, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set out herein.","At block , the pre-filled lead generation form may be presented to the customer at the customer's television set , and the customer may be requested to provide additional information not entered into the lead generation form at block . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the lead generation form presented to the customer may contain a number of fields with selectable information which may be selected by the customer using the remote control device . For example, if the customer is interested in ordering high speed Internet services, a selectable field may be presented in the lead generation form asking the customer to identify a desired speed of high speed Internet services for use by the customer at the customer's service address. Using the customer's remote control device , the customer may select from available high speed Internet services speeds for completing the lead generation form.","At block , the completed lead generation form is passed by the set-top box  to the data services system  via the HFC network , the application server  and the web services system , as described above. Once the lead generation form is completed by the customer and is passed to data services, as described, the routine may proceed back to block  where the customer may utilize the upgrade center user interface  for additional product\/services selection or information.","Referring back to block , if the selected product or service is available for provisioning at the customer's service address, the routine proceeds to block , and an order form for the selected product or service is pre-filled at the set-top box  with customer data from the customer data profile maintained for the requesting customer as described above. If additional information for the order form is required, the order form may be passed to the requesting customer at the customer's television set  so that the customer may provide information for required data fields in the order form.","At block , an order qualification process for the selected product or service is performed to determine whether the selected product or service may be provisioned for the customer's service address or to determine whether any data regarding the selected product or service is already present for the customer's service address and for the identified set-top box. First, a determination is made as to whether service codes for the selected product or service are already provisioned for the identified set-top box  for the requesting customer. That is, a determination is made as to whether the selected product or service has already been previously ordered and has already been previously provisioned for the requesting customer. It may be that the requesting customer already has the selected service or product provisioned on his\/her set-top box , but the customer is not aware of his access to the selected service or product. For example, another member of the customer's family or organization may have previously ordered the product but may not have notified the requesting customer. Alternatively, the selected product or service may have been provisioned on the requesting customer's set-top box , but for some reason the product or service provisioned for the customer is not accessible by the customer due to some malfunction or other problem.","If the service codes for the selected product or service are already provisioned on the customer's set-top box , an error message may be presented to the customer notifying the customer of the previously provisioned product or service. Alternatively, if the product or service is one in which multiple provisionings may be accomplished, the customer may be offered the opportunity to continue with the ordering of the product or service. For example, the customer may be interested in ordering a piece of hardware for use with a different television set in the customer's residence or place of business.","Next, a determination is made as to whether a work order is already open for the selected product or service. That is, a determination is made as to whether the provisioning of the selected product or service is already in progress to the customer's set-top box  or to the customer's service address. As with previously provisioned service codes for the selected product or service, it may be that another member of the customer's home or business has previously ordered the product or service and has failed to notify the requesting customer. On the other hand, the requesting customer may be ordering an additional product or service for which multiple items may be provisioned for the customer. In either case, an error message may be presented to the requesting customer to alert the requesting customer of the presently pending work order so that the customer may decide to cancel the presently selected product or service or to continue so as to have an additional selected product or service provisioned for the requesting customer.","Next, a determination may be made as to whether other prerequisites are satisfied for proceeding with provisioning the selected product or service for the requesting customer. For example, a determination may be made as to whether the requesting customer has all required services that are necessary for provisioning the selected service. For example, if the requesting customer has requested electronic mail services via his set-top box , a determination may be made as to whether the customer has high speed Internet services provisioned at his service address which is a prerequisite service for obtaining electronic mail services. Other prerequisite information may be reviewed such as required credit history and the like. According to embodiments of the present invention, some or all of the order qualification information may be maintained and periodically updated at the set-top box  associated with the requesting customer.","Alternatively, information required for the order qualification process may be maintained at the data services system . In the latter case, the order qualification process requires a data call from the set-top box  to the application server  via the HFC network . The application server  in turn passes a data call to the web services system . The web services system  calls the necessary information store at the data services system  to obtain the required order qualification information. If the order may not be qualified, information passed back to the application server  is formatted into an appropriate error message which is then passed to the set-top box  for presentation to the customer at the customer's television set .","After order qualification is performed for the selected product or service, the routine proceeds to block , and any required options necessary for completing the ordering process are requested from the customer. For example, if the customer is requesting high speed Internet services, a request may be passed to the customer asking the customer to select between one or more available data transmission speeds. Other options include equipment styles and types, whether a customer requires professional installation of an ordered product or service, whether the customer will self-install an ordered product or service, what times are best for the customer for a professional installation of an ordered product, if requested, and the like.","At block , a determination is made as to whether the customer has selected professional installation for a selected product or service. If a customer has requested professional installation, the routine proceeds to block , and a determination is made as to available installation times. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a determination of available installation times is performed by passing a data request from the set-top box  to the application server  via the HFC network . The application server  requests available installation times from the data services system  via the web services system . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, a database may be maintained in the data services system  which includes available installation times for installing the requested product or service at the service address of the requesting customer.","At block , data is requested from the data services system  regarding pricing for the selected product or service. For example, based on the product or service selected by the customer and the options requested for the selected product or service, a database may be maintained and the data services system  for providing pricing associated with the combination of options requested by the customer for the selected product or service. Referring back to block , if the customer does not request professional installation, the routine proceeds directly to block  to obtain pricing information associated with the selected product or service based on self-installation of the selected product or service.","At block , the available installation times, if necessary, and the associated pricing for the selected product or service are passed to the application server , and the application server  formats the installation times and pricing data into an appropriate message for presentation to the customer. The formatted information is passed from the application server  to the set-top box , and the set-top box  presents the order information to the customer at the customer's television set . If the customer is not satisfied with the information contained in the order information, for example if the customer is not available at the offered installation time, the customer may reject the order information, and the customer may be provided the opportunity to select a different installation time. Or, the customer may be able to change certain requested options for the selected product or service if the customer is not satisfied with the pricing associated with the selected product or service. Once product\/service information presented to the customer is acceptable, an order confirmation may be presented to the customer at block  to confirm that the product or service selected by the customer will be provisioned at the customer's service address as requested. The routine ends at block .","As described herein, methods and systems are provided for allowing a cable services customer to efficiently order desired products and services through an automated self-provisioning process provided through an interactive television session between the customer and the customer's cable services provider. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications or variations may be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 6 and 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
