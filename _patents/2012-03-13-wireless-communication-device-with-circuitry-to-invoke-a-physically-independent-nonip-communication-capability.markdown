title: Wireless communication device with circuitry to invoke a physically independent non-IP communication capability
abstract: In a wireless communication device, first micro-processing circuitry drives a user interface and drives a wireless transceiver to exchange IP communications. A detection system detects a malicious condition related to the IP communications and responsively generates a circuit transfer signal. Switching circuitry de-couples the first micro-processing circuitry from the user interface and from the wireless transceiver responsive to the circuit transfer signal. Second micro-processing circuitry then drives the user interface and drives the wireless transceiver to exchange non-IP communications.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL BACKGROUND","TECHNICAL OVERVIEW","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Wireless devices communicate with wireless networks using various wireless communication protocols, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). Examples of these wireless devices include smart-phones, media players, computers, and the like. In many cases, the wireless devices use the wireless networks to exchange Internet Protocol (IP) communications with Internet servers or other IP systems. The wireless devices and wireless networks exchange these IP communications using underlying wireless protocols, like WiFi or LTE.","Unfortunately, wireless devices and wireless networks are under constant threat of malicious attack. For example, a denial-of-service attack may be directed at the control servers in the wireless communication network. This attack may consume (waste) enough network resources to render IP communications across the network effectively useless. In other examples, software viruses may be directed at particular applications, operating systems, or user devices. The viruses may infect the wireless communication devices to render their IP communications with the network effectively useless.","In a wireless communication device, first micro-processing circuitry drives a user interface and drives a wireless transceiver to exchange IP communications. A detection system detects a malicious condition related to the IP communications and responsively generates a circuit transfer signal. Switching circuitry de-couples the first micro-processing circuitry from the user interface and from the wireless transceiver responsive to the circuit transfer signal. Second micro-processing circuitry then drives the user interface and drives the wireless transceiver to exchange non-IP communications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","140","150","110","111","113","114","115","116","110","110"]},"Wireless communication network  comprises at least one wireless access node having network connectivity to other devices, servers, and the like. Wireless transceiver  and the wireless access node(s) in network  communicate over a wireless protocol, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), or some other wireless format. Wireless communication network  could be a small WiFi network, a large LTE network, or some other type of network that provides wireless access to networks, devices, servers, and the like.","In wireless communication device , micro-processing circuitry  processes operating software  to drive user interface  to present information  to user . Micro-processing circuitry  also processes operating software  to drive wireless transceiver  to exchange wireless signals transporting Internet Protocol (IP) communications  with wireless communication network . Note that IP communications  are transported by an underlying wireless protocol, such as LTE or WiFi. These user and network interactions might support emailing, on-line gaming, voice communications, data transfers, or some other communication-based service.","Electronic detection system  detects a malicious condition related to IP communications . The malicious condition could be a large-scale denial-of-service attack on various IP-based networks and systems. The malicious condition could be viral software operating on device  (and possibly other like devices) to inhibit communication service at the IP layer. The malicious condition could be some other condition that restricts IP communications.","The detection of the malicious condition could take various forms. The detection could be based on the receipt and processing of an IP alarm from wireless communication network . The detection could be based on the processing of various data (such as IP failures, errors, and malicious activities) that is either available within device  or that is obtained over wireless communication network . For example, the detection could be the determination that the amount of IP communication failures during a given time period exceeds a threshold\u2014and this determination and\/or this threshold could be initiated and controlled by instructions from wireless communication network . Electronic detection system  comprises software and circuitry that is typically distributed across circuitry - and software -, although electronic detection system  may be primarily hosted by circuitry  and software .","In response to detecting the malicious condition, electronic detection system  generates and transfers a circuit transfer signal to switching circuitry . In response to the circuit transfer signal, switching circuitry  de-couples micro-processing circuitry  from user interface  and from wireless transceiver . In some examples the de-coupling is physical. In other examples, the de-coupling is logical, although any logical decoupling should be resistant to any viral control of micro-processing circuitry .","In response to the malicious condition (or the circuit transfer signal), micro-processing circuitry  processes operating software  to drive user interface  to present information  to user . Micro-processing circuitry  also processes operating software  to drive wireless transceiver  to exchange wireless signals transporting non-IP communications  with wireless communication network . Note that non-IP communications  are transported by an underlying wireless protocol, such as LTE or WiFi.","Note that wireless communication network  performs reciprocal communication signal processing to handle the non-IP communications\u2014possibly by using physically separate circuitry and software as described herein for wireless communication device . These user and network interactions might also support emailing, on-line gaming, voice communications, data transfers, or some other communication-based service.","In some examples, micro-processing circuitry  processes operating software  to drive wireless transceiver  to exchange wireless signals that indicate the use of non-IP communications  to wireless communication network . For example, transceiver  might insert a flag or code in an LTE or WiFi overhead location to indicate the transfer of the non-IP communications Likewise, wireless communication network  may direct the use of the non-IP communications by inserting a corresponding code or instruction in an overhead location of the wireless protocol. For example, transceiver  might receive a special \u201cuse non-IP communications\u201d code in the overhead portion of the LTE or WiFi signals. The reception of this special code from network  might represent the detection of a malicious condition as described herein.","Operating software  includes a non-IP communications module that operates at layer three of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model. The non-IP communications module may utilize protocols such as Message Transfer Part (MTP), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay (FR), X.25, or some other OSI layer 3 communication software.","Micro-processing circuitry  may be pre-coupled to user interface  and wireless transceiver , or switching circuitry  could couple micro-processing circuitry  to user interface  and wireless transceiver  in response to the circuit transfer signal. In some examples the coupling is physical. In other examples, the coupling is logical, although any logical coupling should be resistant to viral control of circuitry .","Micro-processing circuitry  is physically separated from micro-processing circuitry . In some examples, micro-processing circuitry  is on the motherboard, but micro-processing circuitry  is not on the motherboard. In some examples, micro-processing circuitry  and micro-processing circuitry  comprise separate and mutually exclusive micro-processor chipsets, chips, and\/or processing cores.","In wireless communication device , micro-processing circuitry  processes operating software  to provide Application Programming Interface (API)  to operating software  in micro-processing circuitry . Likewise, micro-processing circuitry  processes operating software  to communicate over API  with operating software . Typically, operating software  provides API  to various other applications executing on wireless communication device .","In some examples, electronic detection system  is hosted by micro-processing circuitry  and operating software . In these examples, electronic detection system  may communicate over API  to detect the malicious condition or initiate the circuit transfer signal.
