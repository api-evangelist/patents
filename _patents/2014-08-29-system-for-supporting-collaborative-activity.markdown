title: System for supporting collaborative activity
abstract: A system includes a processor which has access to a representation of model of activity, which includes workspaces. Each workspace includes domain hierarchies for representing an organizational structure of the collaborating users using the system, and initiatives hierarchies representing process structures for accomplishing goals. An interface permits users to view and modify the workspaces for which the user has access. Each user can have different access permissions in different workspaces. The domain and initiative hierarchies provide two views of the workspace objects without duplicating resources. A resource is a collection of shared elements defined by the users that give users associated with the workspace access to information sources. Users can define knowledge boards for creating reports based on information fields of the resources. The knowledge board is associated with a resource template from which the resource is created.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to systems for improving communication among people who are collaborating in the performance of a task.","2. Description of Related Art","Computers coupled to networks have made collaborative work easier than ever before. At the most fundamental level, file sharing and email have eliminated the requirement that collaborators be in physical proximity to each other. The change tracking arrangements that are provided by most document processing systems further support collaborative work, as do computer-implemented scheduling and tracking systems. Integrated systems for collaborative work provide features such as file sharing, email, change tracking, scheduling, and tracking in a single package. A problem with these tools and integrated systems for collaborative work is that they are very general. It is up to the user to adapt them to his or her needs. To be sure, a skilled user of a tool such as a spreadsheet can adapt the tool to almost any purpose, but to do this, extensive programming is required. Such programming requires a specialist, and the result of the programming is often opaque to those who are not masters of the tool and of what is being represented. Indeed, a general problem with tools that require extensive programming to adapt them to a user's needs is that the programming is usually done by a specialist who understand the tools or the system, but not the nature of the collaboration, and as is usual in such situations, communication between the programming specialist and the users is usually difficult and sometimes impossible.","Another approach to collaborative work has been systems that are specialized for collaborative work in a particular special area, such as bookkeeping. For example, the Quickbooks small business accounting software provides a model of a small business as seen from the point of view of an accountant that the user of Quickbooks can customize for his or her own purposes. While the model of the small business that Quickbooks provides is very useful for accounting, it has no relevance whatever to other aspects of the business.","Another approach is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/765,424 ('424 application).  shows a diagram of a model  as described in the '424 application. A number of collaborators  (1 . . . n) are organized into one or more collaborator groups  (1 . . . m). A collaborator  may belong to more than one group . The context in which the collaborators  work is represented by a domain hierarchies  (1 . . . k), goal-project hierarchies  (1 . . . m), and initiative hierarchies  (1 . . . o).","Each goal-project hierarchy  has at its head a project or a goal. A goal may have other goals and projects  as its children. A project  may have other projects as its children, but may not have a goal as a child. Any goal, project, domain, or initiative may have one or more items of information  associated with it, as indicated by arrows . The information may include documents, messages, discussions, reminders, Web links, and alerts. The ability to relate information  directly to any kind of hierarchy entity is particularly useful when the information is global to the entire domain or initiative.","An initiative  is not a member of any domain hierarchy  or goal-project hierarchy , but is rather the root of an initiative hierarchy  which may include sub-initiatives and a single level of goals and\/or projects from any of the goal-project hierarchies. A goal or project may belong to any number of initiatives. Information may be related to an initiative in the same way that it may be related to any hierarchy entity.","Access to domains, goals, and projects is by collaborator groups . A given collaborator group () may have access to any combination of domains, goals, projects, and initiatives in model . The kinds of access which a collaborator belonging to a particular group has to a particular domain, goal, project, or initiative depend on the group's group type and the permissions which the group has for the particular domain, goal, project, or initiative.","Collaborators with the proper permissions may modify not only the information  associated with a goal, project, domain, or initiative, but may also modify the form of the respective hierarchy.","A limitation of the model  is that it provides only one view of the hierarchies' structure. This limits the usefulness of the model to more complex processes or organizations, where multiple views of the hierarchies would be helpful.","It is thus an object of the present invention to overcome these limitations and to provide an improved system for collaborative work.","The invention provides a system for supporting arbitrary activities involving collaborating users. In one aspect, the system includes a processor which has access to a representation of model of activity, the model including a plurality of workspaces. Each workspace includes a plurality of workspace objects for representing an organizational structure of the collaborating users using the system and representing one or more process structures for accomplishing goals. The system further includes an interface to the system for the users, the interface being provided by the processor and the interface permitting the users to view and modify the workspaces. Each user has access to one or more of the workspaces, and each user can have different access permissions in different workspaces.","The workspace objects include a domain hierarchy representing the organizational structure of the users using the system and an initiatives hierarchy representing the process structures for accomplishing the goals. The domain hierarchy and the initiatives hierarchy provide the users two views of the workspace objects without a need to duplicate the workspace objects in the initiatives hierarchy.","The workspace objects include a plurality of resources associated with the domain hierarchy and the initiatives hierarchy. Each resource is a collection of shared elements defined by the users that give the users associated with the workspace access to information sources. The information sources can include a document local to a user to be uploaded into the system, a text file created by the user using a text editor of the system, links to access information or tools internally or externally to the system, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, and discussion topics.","In another aspect, the system includes a processor which has access to a representation of model of activity, the model includes a plurality of resources, each resource including a collection of shared elements defined by the user that give the other users access to information sources, and a knowledge board for creating reports based on data fields of the resources. The system further includes an interface to the system for the users, the interface being provided by the processor and the interface permitting a user to view and modify the knowledge board.","In another aspect, a processor which has access to a representation of model of activity, the model includes a plurality of resource templates, each resource template defining data fields to be created for a resource. The system further includes an interface to the system for the collaborators, the interface being provided by the processor and the interface permitting a user to view one or more resource templates and to create the resource from the resource template, the resource including a collection of shared elements defined by the user that give other users access to information sources.","Other objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the arts to which the invention pertains upon perusal of the following Detailed Description and drawing, wherein:","Reference numbers in the drawing have three or more digits: the two right-hand digits are reference numbers in the drawing indicated by the remaining digits. Thus, an item with the reference number  first appears as item  in .","A system for supporting collaborative activity includes a processor and an interface that is provided to collaborators by the processor. The processor has access to a representation of a model of the activity. The form of the model is defined by the collaborators and the representation of the model provides access to information related to the activity. The interface permits a collaborator to perceive and modify the model's form and to perceive and modify the information to which the representation of the model provides access. The model is implemented using workspaces from which the user may access information and perform activities having to do with the collaboration. The workspaces are provided to users as part of a shared online collaboration software platform that connects people, strategies, technology, and resources in a rapidly developed and deployable on-line workspace.","a. Overview of the System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","117","127","121","123"]},"Collaborating users can organize domains  and initiatives  into hierarchies  and . A user can associate a resource  with a domain, a sub-domain, or another resource associated with a domain. Resources can be presented as many times as required within the initiative, and therefore could be used in multiple scenarios, without the need to be duplicated. The domain and initiatives hierarchies thus provide users with ability to view objects of information (such as resources and\/or knowledge boards (described below)) within an organization structure or an operational structure without need to duplicate the objects.","Domains, initiatives, and resources can be renamed by administrators to reflect the terminology used by their organization. For example, a domain can be renamed as an organization or an agency; an initiative can be renamed as an operation or a process; and a resource can be renamed as a record.","Resources may be organized into resource hierarchies, as shown by arrow , and the resource hierarchies belong to domains , which themselves may be hierarchically organized (). A resource may have a domain as a parent, but a domain cannot have a resource as a parent. A given resource  may belong to only one domain . Generally, though not necessarily, the domain hierarchy reflects the organization chart of the collaboration. For example, if the collaboration is a business, there may be domains for manufacturing, engineering, sales, accounting, human resources, and corporate management, with sub-domains within the domains, for example, a sub-domain for hourly employees in human resources.","In addition to being related to a domain, a resource may also be related to an initiative . Initiatives may form hierarchies . The navigation GUI for system  permits the user to navigate to a resource either by means of the domain hierarchy or by means of the initiative hierarchy. Generally, though not necessarily, initiatives are created to deal with specific problems where the resources required to deal with the problem cut across domain lines. For example, if the domains are set up as described in the foregoing example and the business has a quality control problem, an initiative may be set up to deal with the quality control problem and may include resources from the manufacturing, engineering, and corporate management domains. Domains and initiatives thus give participants different perspectives on the resources needed for the collaboration.","Resource templates  are global objects that define classes of resources, as defined by a system administrator. They specify what types of information are associated with resources belong to the class defined by the resource template by defining the number and types of data fields associated with them. When a user creates a resource, the user begins with a resource template. The fields of the resource template are filled in by the user when the resource is created or modified, according to the domain or initiative the resource relates to.","In addition to viewing resources within a domain or initiative, the resource template can be used to locate resources belonging to the class that the template defines. This location of resources is defined by users in knowledge boards or dashboards . When a user creates a knowledge board, the user uses the resource template to associate resources belonging to the resource template's class with the knowledge board and to select what information from resources of the class will be displayed in the knowledge board. The relationship between the resource template and the resources created from the template are maintained in the system for the knowledge boards. A knowledge board is defined for a workspace but does not belong to any of the hierarchies. The navigation GUI lists the workspace's knowledge boards along with both the initiative and domain hierarchies. The users select the columns (data fields) in the resource template to display and filter by parameters, such as specific text, dates, etc. These data fields are used to locate resources to which the template belongs and are then displayed in the knowledge board report in a table form.","The domains, initiatives, and resources are organized into a plurality of workspaces, each of which provides a managed environment. The system gives each collaborator\/user access to one or more workspaces where a user may have different roles in different workspaces. The workspaces may be configured by non-technical people. The components of a workspace include domains , resources , initiatives , information sources , and dashboards or knowledge boards . These are termed in the following as the workspace's objects. Preferably, the system is implemented in a client-server architecture. The system server stores the workspace and its objects, as well as global objects, such as users and resource templates. The client comprises a processor which ahs access to the system elements. Users access the system's elements through a GUI at the client. Users may have different kinds of access to the objects in a workspace. The workspace includes a navigation GUI as part of the online collaborative software platform that presents the content of its objects. A system administrator can create a unique workspace for a group of people, assign local administration responsibilities, and assign global resources from a global pool of resources. Users can be part of multiple workspaces and carry different access permissions. For example, a specific user can be a user only in one workspace and have administrator rights in another. User access permissions are described further below.","In an exemplary embodiment, information sources that can be related with a resource include documents, text files, links, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, and discussions. For documents already created and stored locally, a user can select from his workstation or from any shared drive a document to add to a resource. The document is then physically copied and loaded into the system server and will reside on its file directory system. All documents loaded on the system are maintained for the life of the system. This enables users to upload and store documents relevant to the resource. To modify the document after its association with the resource, a user \u201cchecks out\u201d the document and downloads it from the server to the client for editing. When the editing's done, the user uploads the modified document from the client to the server.","The system also provides a simple text editor at a client of the system with which a user can create and upload a text file of the .txt type to the system server. This enables users to create a free format text file that can be created, uploaded, and opened by users without the need for a word processing application.","The system provides users the ability to relate links to the resource. Links provide quick access to information or tools. The link can be an external link or an internal link. External links provide access to an outside source, utilizing an address like an URL, or a link to a network source, utilizing a link to a shared device. This enables users to link to a shared document or other file types without the need to upload the files to the system. Other users on the network could access the same file without being part of the system. Internal links provide access to other resources within the system. When users want to use a resource that resides in a different structure of the system, they can provide a link that will launch that resource whenever it is called. This provides the flexibility to reuse resources without the need to create special initiatives for aggregation.","The system provides users the ability to relate an RSS feed to the resource RSS feeds are web feeds in XML format that enable users to receive updated news or information articles through a special reader screen. The ability to provide these connections allow users to create a link that provides new, updated article every time the link is selected and articles are presented.","The system provides users the ability to relate discussions to the resource. Discussions are on-line, asynchronous, threaded chat boards that provide users a place to exchange questions, opinions, and remarks in relation to the resource topic. Users can initiate a discussion in-context to the resource's objective and either receives answers to the discussed topic or reply to a discussion topic started by another user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","113"]},"Actual access to a given object may be limited by the given user's role in the workspace. The workspace roles in an exemplary embodiment are: viewer; user; manager; and administrator. For example, a user who has a viewer role may read but not create, update, or delete objects in the workspace. Consequently, such a user will see only those objects to which the user has some kind of access by virtue either of the user's individual permissions or by virtue of the group permissions of a group to which the user belongs. Because the user has the viewer role, the user will be able to do nothing with the objects to which he or she has access but read them.","Returning to , database tables  contain the information used to represent a workspace () and its components. In an exemplary embodiment, database tables  are implemented using a standard commercial database system such as those manufactured by Oracle Corporation\u2122. The tables are shown in  in logical terms. A table of users  contains an entry for each user who has access to workspace in system . The users who have access to a given workspace are organized into groups in the workspace by a group table  and are assigned roles in the workspace by a role table .","A workspace table  has an entry for each workspace. Associated with the entry for the workspace are the groups that have access to the workspace, the roles these groups have, the resource templates used in the workspace (table ), and the domains, initiatives, resources, and knowledge boards belonging to the workspace (table ).","The system provides an internal messaging center to allow quick communication between users or whole groups of users. The message center does not rely on an email server so it can be used even when access to other systems in limited. The message center displays alerts generated by the system  and messages to specific users. Users can proactively select important resources within the system and let the system alert them whenever a new resource is added, changed, document are uploaded, links created, and others. This allows users to be selective as for what is important to them to be alerted of and reduce the need for users to send email messages alerting users of updates or changes to information. An email option is available for users who wish to receive the messages and\/or the alerts on their email system as well. In this way, users who are away from the system can still be alerted to important information.","The system allows administrators to perform global setup of the navigation GUI. This includes the GUI for the application and the definitions of companies for which the workspaces are created. The system administrator can customize the application's logo, licensing keys, and application level administrative roles and names. The system administrator can define the companies that are sharing the GUI, including names and information of the companies, divisions, and departments.","B.

Permissions are assigned per object and will be automatically transferred to all sub-objects that are created later. The system does not adjust permissions when objects are repositioned to\/from other parent objects. After re-positioning an object, users must view and update the permissions and attributes for the moved object(s). Available permissions include read, create, update, and delete. Read permission allows a user to view object elements, including agencies, resources, operations, and knowledge boards (data fields, documents, links, or discussions in resources) only but does not allow the user to make changes. Create permission allows a user to create domains, resources, initiatives, and knowledge boards. The user cannot change details documents or links details.
