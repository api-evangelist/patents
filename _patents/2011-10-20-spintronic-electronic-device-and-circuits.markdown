As described below in connection with , the apparatus  may be implemented as a spintronic microwave detector where external microwave signals generally excite magnetic precession with a large angle when the external microwave signals exceed a predetermined threshold amount and the external microwave signals have a frequency that is lower than a predetermined level. As described below in connection with , the device  may be advantageously implemented in connection with electronic circuits that may perform microwave energy harvesting, selective microwave frequency detection, frequency band identification, etc.","The substrate  generally comprises silicon dioxide (SiO) or any other appropriate electronic circuit substrate material that are well known to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art.","In one example, the undercoat  comprises a multilayer structure. The bottom interface layer  generally includes a plurality of bottom sub-layers that are disposed (i.e., positioned, layered, etc.) in succession away from the substrate  comprising a Ta first bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 3 nm, a CuN second bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 40 nm, a Ta third bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 3 nm, a CuN fourth bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 40 nm, a Ta fifth bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 3 nm, a Ru sixth bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 10 nm, and a Ta seventh bottom sub-layer  having a thickness of about 5 nm. The bottom layer  generally provides a very smooth (i.e., small crystallographic grain size) conductive surface for deposition of a pinhole-free, magnetic tunnel junction  on top.","The SAF (fixed, pinned) layer  comprises a multilayer structure. The fixed layer  generally includes a plurality of sub-layers that are disposed (i.e., positioned, layered, etc.) in succession comprising a PtMnfirst fixed sub-layer  having a thickness of about 15 nm, a CoFesecond fixed sub-layer  having a thickness of about 2.3 nm, a Ru third fixed sub-layer  having a thickness of about 0.85 nm, and a CoFeBfourth fixed sub-layer  having a thickness of about 2.4 nm.","The tunneling barrier  comprises MgO.","The free layer  comprises CoFeBand may have a thickness of about 2.4 nm.","The top layer  comprises a multilayer structure.

The top  generally provides a reliable, pinhole-free contact to the top lead of the tunnel junction device .","In contrast to conventional approaches, the device  may operate as a spin-torque microwave detector (STMD) in a different (alternate) mode (regime) of operation, wherein the different regime (mode) of operation is based on excitation of large-angle out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization precession. The performance of the STMD  in the OOP regime may be superior when compared to conventional (e.g., in plane\u2014IP regime) approaches.","The detector  generally operates as a non-resonant, broadband, threshold microwave detector in a wide range of low frequencies. The OOP regime of operation of the STMD  is non-resonant in frequency (i.e., exists for all frequencies that are below certain critical frequency determined by the bias magnetic field). A very high V\/W sensitivity of the STMD  is expected in the OOP regime when the power of the external signal is close to the threshold power of the device .","The OOP mode of operation for the STMD  generally exists (occurs, results) for resonant frequency (RF) currents with amplitudes I>I(\u03c9), and is generally stable for the frequencies of RF signal \u03c9<\u03c9(i.e., so-called critical frequency). The output DC voltage Uof such a STMD  generally has a step-like behavior, that is, the voltage Uis generally near zero for I<I(\u03c9) and may weakly depend on Iwhen I>I(\u03c9). The OOP regime of operation of the STMD  may be used to produce (i.e., in connection with) threshold microwave detectors with large differential sensitivity near the critical frequency (threshold frequency).","Referring to , an isometric view illustrating the operation of the device  in the OOP mode is shown. The system , as illustrated in , comprises a circular nano-pillar having a radius, r, and further comprises the free magnetic layer (FL)  having a thickness, d, the TMR barrier , and the pinned magnetic layer (PL) . In response to a radio frequency (RF) current I=Isin(\u03c9 t), magnetization M precesses along a large-angle out-of-plane (OOP) trajectory about the direction of a weak DC magnetic field B={circumflex over (z)}B(B<\u03bcMs), where \u03bcis the vacuum permeability, Ms is the saturation magnetization of the FL , and p is the unit vector in the direction of the magnetization of the PL .","The mode of operation of the STMD  is generally based on excitation of large-angle out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization precession in response to the action of the microwave current I.  illustrates that such regime of operation of STMD  may be substantially different than the conventional regime (i.e., the IP regime) of operation of a conventional STMD. In particular, the regime (mode) with OOP magnetization precession (i.e., OOP-regime) is generally characterized by the following features:\n\n","Herein, the OOP-regime of operation of the STMD  is modeled and described with the following considerations:\n\n","The dynamics of the magnetization M\u2261M(t) of the FL  in response to the microwave current I(t)=Isin(\u03c9) may be described by the Landau-Lifshits-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation:\n\n+(\u03b1)[]+(\u03c3)sin(\u03c9)\u2003\u2003(Eq. 2)\n\nwhere Bis the effective magnetic field, which has contributions from an external DC magnetic field B={circumflex over (z)}Band the demagnetization field, \u03b1 is the Gilbert damping constant, \u03c3=\u03c3\u22a5\/(1+Pcos \u03b2) is the current-torque proportionality coefficient, \u03c3\u22a5=(\u03b3\u210f\/2e)P\/(MsV), \u210f is the reduced Planck constant, e is the modulus of the electron charge, P is the spin-polarization of current, \u03b2 is the angle between the directions of magnetization in the FL  and PL , V=\u03c0rd is the volume of the FL  (r is the radius and d is thickness of the FL ), and p={circumflex over (x)} is the unit vector in the direction of the magnetization of the PL .\n","The magnetization M may be represented in the form M=Ms ({circumflex over (x)}sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6+{circumflex over (\u03b3)} sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6+{circumflex over (z)} cos \u03b8) and find the equations for \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8\u2261\u03b8() is the out-of-plane (OOP) angle between the magnetization and {circumflex over (z)} axis, \u03c6\u2261\u03c6() is the in-plane angle between the magnetization projection on the {circumflex over (x)}\u2212\u0177 plane and the {circumflex over (x)} axis. Note, that in response to the RF current, the magnetization vector generally precesses with the angular frequency \u03c9 of the RF current; however, the significant influence of RF current on the motion of magnetization is observed only if the average value of this action is non-zero. Therefore \u03c6 may be represented in the form \u03c6=\u03c9t+\u03c6, the equations for \u03b8 and \u03c6 may be averaged over the period 2 \u03c0\/\u03c9 of RF current oscillations, and, after neglecting small terms (\u02dc\u03b1) the following equations may be obtained:\n\n\u03b1\u03c9(\u03b8)sin \u03b8\u2212(\u03c3\u22a5\/2)\u00d7(\u03b1\u03bc cos \u03c6\u2212\u03bd cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6),\u2003\u2003(Eq. 3a) and\n\n=\u03c9(\u03b8)\u2212\u03c9+(\u03c3\u22a5\/2)\u00d7(\u03bc csc \u03b8 cos \u03c6+\u03b1 \u03bd cot \u03b8 sin \u03c6),\u2003\u2003(Eq. 3b)\n\nwhere \u03c9 (\u0398)=\u03c9\u2212\u03c9cos \u03b8 is the frequency of OOP precession, \u03c9=\u03b3 B, \u03c9=\u03b3 \u03bcMs, \u03bc=(1\u2212P)[1\u2212P(\u221a(1\u2212P)\u22121)], \u03bd=(1\u2212P)[1+P(\u221a(1\u2212P)\u22121)], \u03bc, \u03bd\u02dc1 for P\u22660.7.\n","The stationary solution is \u03b8=\u03b8s, \u03c6s=\u03c9t+\u03c6s. In the case assuming \u03b8 s\u2248\u03c0\/2, the OOP precession mode generally occurs for microwave currents Ilarger than the critical value\n\n(\u03c9)\u2248(2\u03b1\/\u03bd)(\u03a9\/\u03c3\u22a5)((\u03c9\/(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9)).\u2003\u2003(Eq. 4)\n","Also, the OOP precession is generally stable for low frequencies \u03c9<\u03c9=\u03c9. Thus, the STMD  generally operates as a broadband threshold microwave detector in the OOP-regime for input RF signals having frequencies \u03c9<\u03c9and currents I>I(\u03c9).","When the angular dependence of MTJ resistance is R(\u03b2)=R\u22a5\/(1+Pcos \u03b2), the output DC voltage of the STMD  operating in the P mode may be calculated as:\n\nsin \u03c6(\u03c9)\u2003\u2003(Eq. 5)\n\nwhere w=(1\u2212P)P(\u221a(1\u2212P)\u22121)<0.\n","Per Eq. (5), the output DC voltage Uin the OOP mode of operation of the device  generally weakly depends on input microwave power P\u2248IR\/2, where R=R\u22a5w, w, =(1\u2212P).","Accordingly, the sensitivity of the detector\n\n\u03b5\u2248\u22122(1)((\u03c9)\/)()\n\nhas a maximum value \u03b5=\u22122wwI(\u03c9) at the threshold input current (i.e., I=I(\u03c9)), and is rapidly decreased for input microwave signals having greater power.\n","For typical parameters of an experiment (e.g., r=50 nm, d=1 nm, P=0.7, R\u22a5=500 \u03a9, \u03b1=0.01, \u03bcMs=800 mT, B=200 mT (giving \u03c9\/2 \u03c0\u22485.6 GHz), \u03c9\/2 \u03c0=2 GHz), the maximum sensitivity in the passive OOP regime \u03b5\u22483000 V\/W, which is comparable to or better than the sensitivity of the conventional STMD operating in the IP-regime.","Referring to , a plot illustrating the dependence of the output DC voltage U(solid line and points), U(dashed line) of a STMD versus (in response to, with respect to) frequency of the input RF signal \u03c9\/2\u03c0 in the OOP- and IP-regimes, respectively, is shown. The solid lines depict the analytical dependencies (see, Eqs. (5) and (1), respectively), and the points are the results of numerical simulations. I=0.2 mA, all other parameters are the same as previously indicated in connection with Eq. (6) except that B=6.3 mT (\u03c9\u22482 GHz), R=R(\u03b2), \u03b2=\u03c0\/4 for the conventional IP-regime.","Referring to , a plot depicting the dependence of the output DC voltage U(solid line and points), U(dashed line) of a STMD versus input microwave current Iin the OOP and IP regimes, respectively, is shown. The solid lines are the analytical dependencies (see, Eqs. (5) and (1), respectively), the points are the results of numerical simulations, where, \u03c9\/2\u03c9\u03c0=2 GHz, and all other parameters are the same as previously indicated in connection with Eq. (6) except as noted above in connection with . The Inset on  depicts the calculated dependence of differential volt-watt sensitivity of the STMD \u03b7 (in 10V\/W) versus frequency \u03c9\/2\u03c0 of the input microwave (RF) signal in the OOP-regime at the threshold I=I(\u03c9).","Referring to both  together, the dependence of the output DC voltage with respect to the frequency of the input RF signal \u03c9\/2\u03c0 it is shown on  for the case of the OOP-regime (solid line and dots), and the conventional IP-regime (dashed line) modes of operation of a STMD. The STMD  generally performs as broadband low frequency non-resonant microwave detector in the OOP regime in contrast to the resonance STMD of the conventional, IP mode of operation.","The response of the STMD versus input microwave signals with different magnitude, I, is also substantially different in the case of OOP- and IP-regimes of operation of the STMD (see, ). In the conventional IP-regime of operation the output DC voltage Uof the diode is proportional to the input power P\u02dcI(dashed line on , see also Eq. (1)).","In contrast, the output DC voltage Uof the diode  in the OOP-regime of operation has a step-like dependence (solid line and points on ); that is, U\u22480 for I<I(\u03c9), and U\u2248\u03b5I(\u03c9) for I>I(\u03c9).","Thus, in the OOP-regime of operation the STMD  generally operates as a non-resonant broadband threshold microwave detector of low frequency RF signals. Although the theory presented above predicts the sharp step-like behavior of U(I) near the threshold, the numerical simulation shows that voltage sharply changes for input signals with magnitude I\u2248I(\u03c9); however, the differential volt-watt sensitivity","\u03b7=\u0394U\/\u0394Pat the threshold remains finite (see, Inset on ).","The results presented above correspond to the case of no DC bias current applied to the MTJ  (i.e., I=0). When I\u22600, a supplied DC bias current may partially or completely compensate damping in the MTJ . The damping may lead to the decrease of critical current I(\u03c9). However, in-plane anisotropy and\/or in-plane bias field may create an energy barrier between regions of small-angle IP-, and large-angle OOP trajectories, which may be overcome by thermal fluctuations or by supplying a DC bias current. Thus, a large-angle OOP-regime of operation of a STMD  in a real anisotropic system may be thermally activated or DC bias current activated. The STMD  operating in the OOP-regime can be implemented as a threshold microwave detector with sufficient differential sensitivity near the threshold, and also for energy harvesting applications. The OOP-regime of operation of a STMD  may provide extremely large diode volt-watt sensitivity. For example, \u03b5\u02dc10V\/W has been observed in connection with thermally-activated, non-adiabatic stochastic resonance.","Referring to , an electrical schematic drawing of an electronic device (e.g., apparatus, system, circuit, etc.)  is shown. The apparatus  comprises at least one of the device  (e.g., devices , , , , . . . , and ), an antenna  having two legs, and a load  having two ends. The devices  are generally electronically coupled in parallel to each other and to the two legs of the antenna , and to the two ends of the load .","When a radio frequency wave (e.g., a beam of microwave energy), RF, impinges on the antenna , the AC current I(t) may be generated. The device  may operate in the OOP mode and perform as a diode, as described above in connection with . A DC voltage (e.g., the output DC voltage U) may be generated by the device , and presented to the load . As such, the circuit  may be advantageously implemented as an energy harvesting device.","In another example, the device  may perform as a diode (e.g., detector), and may be advantageously implemented in connection with a spintronic selective microwave frequency detection circuit (see, for example, circuit  on ). The circuit  includes the diode , a microwave generator , a lock-in amplifier , a DC current source , and a filter (\u201cbias tee\u201d) .","The microwave generator  may present a reference signal.

The specific features of the spin-torque diode  may include: Threshold character of excitation, I>I(\u03c9); Excitation is stable in a wide region of low frequencies; Large output voltage (e.g., >>1 mV), which generally weakly depends on the amplitude of the input AC current. The apparatus  may demonstrate that the out-of-plane (OOP) precession regime (mode of operation) can generate extremely large diode efficiencies with non-adiabatic stochastic resonance.","Conventional active devices may implement high current densities. Over time, the conventional devices can become unreliable due to breakdown. In contrast, the device  is a passive device, which may implement (receive) an incoming microwave radio frequency field as an input. The device  may generate an output that comprises a DC voltage. Therefore, the device  generally works in a large range of frequencies and may provide a large DC output signal that is nearly independent of the input power, as long as the input power exceeds a critical level, P.","The structure and material of the layers implemented in the device  generally provide pin-hole free, smooth, reliable, robust interfaces at the top and bottom.","Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention, and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 5-7","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
