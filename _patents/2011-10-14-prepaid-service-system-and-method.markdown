{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/393,130, filed on Oct. 14, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The systems and methods disclosed herein relate generally to service payment systems, and more particularly to service payment systems for communication and media services and products.","Cable Operators (\u201cOperators\u201d) that provide communication and media services and products to Subscribers using a subscription payment model generally enter into contracts with Subscribers in which the Subscribers agree to pay for the services in arrears every month. This subscription payment model requires the Operators to maintain a significant billing system infrastructure to handle Subscriber billing and accounting.","Potential revenue may be lost by Cable Operators due to shortcomings of the typical subscription payment arrangement. For example, many potential new Subscribers do not pass the Operator's credit checking process so the Operator may lose any potential revenue from these Subscribers. Additional revenue is lost when established Subscribers default on their payments for the service already provided. Operators also lose potential revenue when they are unable to make service agreements with potential Subscribers who are not permanent residents at a location, such as hotel rooms or vacation rental properties.","In an illustrative embodiment, the systems and methods disclosed herein provide a pre-paid service (PPS) payment and activation system and method. In an illustrative embodiment, the PPS system (PPSS) allows a Subscriber, such as an end-user of a communication and media service and\/or product, to pay for a service in advance through an on-line transaction using an on-line payment transaction system. The PPS system and method overcomes the drawbacks of the subscription payment model, described above, since the service is only provided after it has been paid for.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS includes a PPSS sub-system and an Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) collector or controller. The PPSS sub-system is configured to provide administrator and subscriber interfaces to the PPSS. In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS sub-system includes a subscriber user interface (UI) component and an administrator (Admin.) or operator UI component. The Admin. UI component is configured to provide an operator management interface or administrator interface configured to control the PPSS, and the subscriber UI component is configured to provide a subscriber interface which provides a control interface for the Subscribers. For example, the subscriber UI component allows the Subscriber to choose a service level, enter payment information, make on-line payment transactions, and perform other similar functions. The subscriber UI component also interacts with the IPDR controller to activate and\/or deactivate service. The PPSS sub-system may also include a payment component configured to interact with on-line payment processing systems such as, but not limited to, credit and\/or debit card processing systems to effect a payment for the service.","In an illustrative embodiment, the IPDR controller includes a control component, a policy component, a Packet Cable Multi-Media (PCMM) component, a statistics component, and\/or an IPDR component. In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component provides a subscriber interface, which allows the Subscriber to select a service level or service type. In response to the Subscriber selecting the service level, the subscriber UI component requests the payment component to process a payment. If the payment is authorized, the subscriber UI component requests to the control component in the IPDR controller to provide service to the Subscriber's modem. Upon receiving the request to activate the service level for the Subscriber's modem, the control component requests the policy component to make the activation. Upon receiving the request, the policy component in turn may request the PCMM component to set one or more gates, for example, at least one for each direction, which activates the service. If the service activation has succeeded the subscriber UI component requests the payment component to commit the transaction for the payment. However, if the service activation fails the subscriber UI component requests the payment component to cancel the previously authorized payment transaction.","In an illustrative embodiment, a purchased service level may define a time limit and\/or a capacity limit for one or both of downstream and upstream directions. Generally, the IPDR component receives IPDR data from one or more routers, for example Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS). Upon receiving the IPDR data, the IPDR component passes the IPDR data to the statistics component, which calculates accumulated usage data for each modem.","The policy component communicates with the statistics component and checks the accumulated statistics calculated by the statistics component to determine whether a Subscriber or the Subscriber's modem has met or exceeded the capacity limit for the service activation in one or both of the downstream and upstream directions. It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this check may only be performed if the activated service level specified a capacity limit. If the activated service level specified a capacity limit and the policy component determines that a Subscriber or the Subscriber's modem has met or exceeded the service level capacity limit for an activated service, the policy component requests the PCMM component to deactivate that service.","If the activated service level specified at least a time limit, the policy component determines when the Subscriber or the Subscriber's modem has met or exceeded the service level time limit. When the policy component determines that a Subscriber or the Subscriber's modem has met or exceeded the service level time limit for an activated service, the policy component requests the PCMM component to deactivate the service for the Subscriber's modem.","Detailed embodiments of service payment and activation systems, methods, and apparatuses are disclosed herein, however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the systems, methods, and apparatuses, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the systems, methods, and apparatuses disclosed herein.","Generally, the systems, methods, and apparatuses disclosed herein include and may be implemented within a computer, computer system, and\/or network of computer systems having one or more databases and other storage apparatuses, servers, and additional components, such as processors or microprocessors, modems, routers, terminals and displays, non-transitory computer-readable media, algorithms, software, modules, platforms, and other computer-related components. The computer systems are especially configured and adapted to perform the functions and processes of the systems, methods, and apparatuses as disclosed herein. The functions and processes of the systems, methods, and apparatuses as disclosed herein may include one or more applications, web-based applications or platforms such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or other types of applications or platforms, and may include one or more user interfaces (UIs) accessible over a network such as the World Wide Web (W3) and\/or the Internet and other types of networks including communications networks, cable or content delivery networks, Local area networks (LANs), Metropolitan area networks (MANs), Campus area networks (CANs), Wide area networks (WANs), wireless networks, and other networks of the type.","Communications between various components in the systems, methods, and apparatuses disclosed herein may be unidirectional and\/or bidirectional electronic communication through a wired or wireless network. For example, one component may be networked directly, indirectly, through a third party intermediary, wirelessly, or otherwise with other components to enable communication between the components.","A system architecture for implementing the service payment and activation systems, methods, and apparatuses according to an illustrative embodiment is described with reference to . As illustrated, the system includes a pre-paid service system (PPSS) . In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS  is a computer, computer system, and\/or network of computer systems having one or more databases and other storage apparatuses, servers, and additional components, such as processors or microprocessors, modems, routers, terminals and displays, non-transitory computer-readable media, algorithms, software, modules, platforms, and\/or other computer-related components.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS  provides a pre-paid service (PPS). In general, the PPSS  provides a solution to providing PPS in an Operator's network, such as a communication or media network. The PPSS  may provide an administrator interface configured to allow an administrator to control the PPSS , and\/or a subscriber interface which provides a control interface for Subscribers. For example, the PPSS  allows a Subscriber to choose a service level, enter payment information, make on-line payment transactions, and perform other similar functions. The PPSS  may collect Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) data, which may include information about a Subscriber's usage on the network, and measure the service usage of a Subscriber. The PPSS  may also activate or deactivate a Subscriber's service based on the Subscriber's payment and service level, for example a time limit and\/or amount of usage.","In the illustrative embodiment, the PPSS  may be deployed in and\/or integrated with communication and media services and\/or products, such as a cable Operator's network. In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS  may be designed for use in a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) cable network, or other network of the type. The DOCSIS generally includes a set of standards that define transfer of data over an existing cable television system. One example of such standards are defined and maintained by Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. of Louisville, Colo.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS  may be in communication with other systems in the network including, but not limited to, one or more Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs) . The PPSS  may communicate with the systems in the network, including the CMTSs  using Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) or Internet Protocol Suite.","In an illustrative embodiment, the CMTS(s)  may be in communication with one or more Cable Modems (CMs) , which may be in communication with one or more Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) devices , such as, but not limited to, computers, televisions, smart phones, set top boxes, digital video recorders, routers including wireless routers, and\/or other equipment of the type. The CMTS(s)  may include a router that provides a physical, data link and network layer connectivity to one or more of the CM(s)  in the network. For example, each CMTS  in a cable network may be configured to provide cable data service to one or more CM(s) . In an illustrative embodiment, the CM(s)  is a device at a Subscriber's premise that provides attachment to the cable network. Each CM  may be configured to provide cable data service to the Subscriber. In an illustrative embodiment, the one or more CPE devices  may be connected to or in communication with the CM(s) .","In an illustrative embodiment, each CMTS  may be configured to export IPDR data to the PPSS . The IPDR data may include information about a Subscriber's usage on the DOCSIS cable network. The CMTS(s)  typically exports IPDR data at a configured frequency, such as, but not limited to, every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and other frequencies. The IPDR data may consist of a flow record for each flow that exists on one or more of the CMs  attached to the CMTS(s) . In a DOCSIS network, a flow generally provides a provisioned Quality of Service (QoS) for all or a subset of data traffic. Each flow typically includes one direction of data flow, for example either downstream, such as for example, to the CM(s) , or upstream, such as for example, from the CM(s) . In an illustrative embodiment, each flow record may contain statistics (for example, counters) for the flow including the number of bytes transferred in one or more directions.","In an illustrative embodiment, an Operator may provision each CM  that is configured to use the pre-paid service method or PPSS  with a default configuration that forces all Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic to be routed to the PPSS . This default configuration may ensure that the Subscriber interacts with the subscriber interface when no service has been paid for. In an illustrative embodiment, this interaction uses standard HTTP and associated protocols. It should be appreciated that the Operator may use CM provisioning tools to effect this configuration.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS  may include a PPSS sub-system  and an IPDR collector or controller . The PPSS sub-system  may be configured to provide administrator and subscriber interfaces to the PPSS . In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS sub-system  is configured to provide an operator management interface or administrator interface configured to control the PPSS , and a subscriber interface which provides a control interface for the Subscribers. For example, the subscriber interface allows the Subscribers to choose a service level, enter payment information, make on-line payment transactions, and perform other similar functions. The subscriber interface may also interact with the IPDR controller  to activate and\/or deactivate service.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS sub-system  may include one or more components, such as, but not limited to an administrator (Admin.) or operator UI component , a subscriber user interface (UI) component , a payment component , a redundancy component , and one or more databases . The Admin. UI component  of the PPSS sub-system  may provide an interface for an Operator to configure the service levels that may be presented to the Subscriber. The configured service levels can be stored in the database(s) . The Admin. UI component  may also include, but is not limited to, other configuration, monitoring and maintenance interfaces that the Operator may use to maintain the PPSS  and\/or the components of the PPSS .","In an illustrative embodiment, the Admin. UI component  includes a designer or operator interface and provides one or more web pages to an Operator that allow the Operator to customize the PPSS . The Admin. UI component  allows the Operator to define a set of service level offerings and associated parameters. The set of service level offerings and associated parameters are typically stored in the database(s) . Each service level that is defined and therefore becomes available for the Subscriber to select may include a set of parameters that are visible to the Subscriber and a set that are for internal use in service activation. The Subscriber-visible parameter set may include, but is not limited to, a maximum bit rate for each of a downstream direction and an upstream direction, a maximum burst rate for each of the downstream and upstream directions, capacity limits for each of the downstream and upstream directions, a time limit for service, and\/or other similar service levels. The set of internal parameters may include, but is not limited to, traffic profile definitions (for example, parameters as defined in PKT-SP-MM-I05-091029), packet classification parameters (for example, parameters as defined in PKT-SP-MM-I05-091029), and\/or other parameters. The Admin. UI component  may also allow the Operator to define file pathnames for customized page elements such as, but not limited to, a company logo for customizing the subscriber interface to the Operator's environment.","The subscriber UI component  may provide a subscriber interface to a Subscriber that allows the Subscriber to choose or subscribe to a service level, such as, but not limited to a time limit for service and\/or a capacity limit (for example a maximum bit rate or burst rate), enter payment information, make on-line payment transactions, and perform other similar functions. The subscriber UI component  may also provide a monitoring interface that allows the Subscriber to view the current or historical status of the Subscriber's service. The subscriber UI component  communicates with one or more of the other components in the PPSS  when the PPSS  activates and deactivates the Subscriber's service.","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  may provide a subscriber interface, that provides one or more web pages, which may be customized by the Operator as described above. The web pages may provide features to the subscriber, such as but not limited to, service level selection from the set defined by the Operator, storage of Subscriber transaction details in the database(s) , payment entry and validation, and other similar features. The storage of Subscriber transaction details may include storing the service details, for example, the service level, and other parameters so that service can be restored if there is a failure. The database(s)  may include a subscriber table including the information for extracting a subscriber history and periodic statements for both Subscribers and Operators.","The payment component  may be configured to send requests to and receive requests from the subscriber UI component  to process a payment in response to the Subscriber choosing a service level. The payment component  may interact with on-line payment processing systems such as, but not limited to, credit and\/or debit card processing systems to effect a payment for the service. In an illustrative embodiment, the payment component  provides an Application Programming Interface (API) which may be invoked by the subscriber interface to make a payment transaction with an external payment processor. The payment component  may also record the state of the transaction in the subscriber table in the database(s) , including failed transactions.","The IPDR controller  may be a system configured to collect IPDR data from one or more CMTSs  and may include components configured to activate and\/or deactivate a service. In an illustrative embodiment, the IPDR controller  measures service usage of a Subscriber, for example an end-user of a cable network service, and may activate or deactivate that service through interaction with the CMTS(s)  in the Operator's network.","In an illustrative embodiment, the IPDR controller  may include one or more components, such as, but not limited to a control component , a policy component , a Packet Cable Multi-Media (PCMM) component , an IPDR component , a statistics component , a redundancy component , and one or more databases . The control component  may be configured to send requests to and receive requests from the subscriber UI component  and\/or the payment component  to activate a service level for a Subscriber's CM . The control component  may also send requests to and receive requests from the policy component  to make the activation. In an illustrative embodiment, the control component  includes a Web service API. The subscriber UI component  uses the Web service API to the control component  to allow a Subscriber to make service changes and to extract data about a service, via the subscriber interface. For example, the subscriber UI component  uses the Web service API to the control component  to allow a Subscriber, via the subscriber interface, to request a pre-paid service or start a new pre-paid service, extend a pre-paid service, cancel a pre-paid service, and\/or obtain a status of an existing pre-paid service.","The policy component  may be configured to send requests to and receive requests from the control component , the PCMM component , and\/or the statistics component  to activate or deactivate a service. In an illustrative embodiment, the policy component may include a database table that stores active service details, such as but not limited to, a cmmacaddress, a cpeipaddress, service level details, and other details of the type. In an illustrative embodiment, the cmmacaddress is the MAC Address of a CM  and may be used as the primary identifier of the CM . In an illustrative embodiment, the cpeipaddress is the Internet Protocol (IP) Address of a CPE . The cpeipaddress may be allocated through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) when a CM  registers with the cable network, and is generally the last known cpeipaddress in effect for a Subscriber. The service level details may include, but are not limited to downstream and upstream service byte limits, a time limit, a service start time, and\/or a service traffic profile.","The PCMM component  interoperates with and is configured to send requests to the CMTS(s)  to activate or deactivate a service. PCMM is generally a standard in the DOCSIS set of standards that defines dynamic creation and deletion of gates to control the Quality of Service (QoS) for service through a CM. A gate is generally a QoS level and packet classification combination which may be dynamically created to control the QoS for all or a subset of traffic to or from a CM. The state of the gates may be stored in the database(s)  and\/or in-memory.","The IPDR component  is configured to receive the IPDR data, for example from the CMTS(s) , and save the IPDR data in the database(s)  and\/or send the IPDR data to the statistics component .","The statistics component  is configured to receive the IPDR data from the IPDR component  and may calculate or compute accumulated usage data, for example, bytes transferred in downstream and\/or upstream directions, for each CM . In an illustrative embodiment, the statistics component  may compute and maintain the usage byte counts for the downstream and upstream directions. As each CMTS  export interval delivers updated service flow counters, the statistics component  updates the accumulated counters for each direction for each Subscriber device and\/or CM. This data can be maintained in-memory and\/or in the database(s) .","The statistics component  may also maintain an in-memory DOCSIS topology database, and store the IPDR data and changes to the IPDR data in the database(s) . The topology database may be derived from the data included in the IPDR records. In an illustrative embodiment, the topology database may contain the physical attachment details for which CM  a CPE  is attached to; and\/or which CMTS  and CMTS interface a CM  is attached to. For example, the topology database may contain details of which cmmacaddess a cpeipaddress is associated with. This data may support determining which CM  a cpeipaddress is attached to when the PPSS sub-system  invokes the control component  API, since the PPSS sub-system  knows the cpeipaddress from the source IP address of the HTTP connection being used by the Subscriber to access the subscriber UI component. The data may also support determining to which CMTS  to communicate gate actions for the Subscriber's CM .","A block flow diagram of a method for implementing the PPSS  according to an illustrative embodiment is described with reference to . In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  provides a Subscriber access to a subscriber interface, for example via a subscriber device, illustrated as block . The subscriber device may be a device such as but not limited to, a computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular or mobile phone, and other devices that can access, provide, transmit, receive, and modify information over wired or wireless networks such as the Internet. The subscriber interface allows the Subscriber to select a service level and enter payment information. In response to the Subscriber selecting the service level and entering the payment information, the subscriber UI component  may transmit a request to the payment component  to process a payment, illustrated as block . To process the payment the payment component  may interact with an on-line payment processing system, for example via an API, to effect the payment for the service, illustrated as block . If the payment request fails, the subscriber UI component  reports the failure to the Subscriber via the subscriber interface, illustrated as block .","If the payment is authorized, the subscriber UI component  may make a request to the control component  in the IPDR controller  to provide service to the CM  for the Subscriber, illustrated as block . In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  requests a Pre-Paid Service (PPS) service setup or activation by invoking the web service API to the control component  and sending a request to activate a service level for the Subscriber's CM . In an illustrative embodiment, the request to set-up a new Pre-Paid Service (PPS) may include the transmission of input parameters to the control component . The input parameters may include, but are not limited to, a cpeipaddress, and other service parameters, for example, downstream and upstream byte limits, a time limit, and\/or other similar parameters. The cpeipaddress may be derived from the source IP Address of the HTTP connection from a Subscriber device to the PPSS sub-system . For API calls where the Subscriber is identified by cpeipaddress, the control component  may also request the corresponding cmmacaddress for the cpeipaddress from the statistics component  which contains the topology database containing such information, as described above.","Upon receiving the request to activate the service level for the Subscriber's CM , the control component  requests the policy component  to make the activation, illustrated as block . Upon receiving the request, the policy component  in turn may request the PCMM component  to request the CMTS , to which the Subscriber's CM  is attached, to set one or more PCMM gates, for example, at least one for each direction, which activates the service, illustrated as block . The interaction between the PCMM component  and the CMTS  may use, for example a standard Common Open Policy Service (COPS) based protocol messaging defined in the DOCSIS standard (PKT-SP-MM-I05-091029). The one or more gate sets for service activation may be used by the CMTS  and CM  to classify traffic to and from the CPE , for example as defined by the DOCSIS standards, such that the traffic receives the service level defined QoS and may also permit all traffic to be routed generally between the CPE  and the Internet.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PCMM component  performs a Gate Set function on behalf of the Policy component to set the PCMM gate(s). The Gate Set function creates one or more new gates on the CMTS  for the specific Subscriber's CM , which specifies the service level and\/or the QoS to apply to traffic for the Subscriber's CM  corresponding to the service level of the pre-paid service that the Subscriber has paid for. The activation may also be invoked through Administrator action independent of Subscriber payment to allow for the Administrator to override the PPSS  for any reason.","In an illustrative embodiment, the control component  returns or outputs the status of the service activation attempt to the subscriber UI component , illustrated as block . The output may include, but is not limited to, success or failure. If the output is a failure, the control component  may also output details of the reason(s) of the failure. If the service activation has succeeded the subscriber UI component  requests the payment component  to make the transaction commitment for the payment previously authorized, illustrated as block . If the service activation fails then the subscriber UI component  requests the payment component  to cancel the previously authorized payment transaction, illustrated as block . In this way the Subscriber may only be charged if the service activation is successful and the service is only activated if the payment is authorized. The payment component  either cancels or commits the previously authorized transaction through the API to the external payment processing system.","The subscriber UI component  then updates the subscriber database table with the transaction and service status for the Subscriber and responds back to the subscriber interface with the status, illustrated as block . The subscriber interface allows the Subscriber to enter an address, such as an email address, for receipt of statements. The transaction status can be mailed and\/or sent to the Subscriber as a receipt.","A block flow diagram of a method for monitoring an activated service and deactivating the service according to an illustrative embodiment is described with reference to . In an illustrative embodiment, a purchased service level may define a capacity limit for one or both of downstream and upstream directions. The purchased service level may define a time limit for the service. Alternatively, the purchased service level may define both a capacity limit and a time limit such that service can be terminated when the capacity limits and\/or the time limits have been reached.","Each CMTS  may export IPDR data to the IPDR controller  periodically, for example in accordance with the DOCSIS standard (CM-SP-OSSIv2.0-I10-070803). The IPDR data includes statistics, for example counters, associated with each flow active on each CM . The IPDR component  may receive the IPDR data from the CMTS(s) , illustrated as block . Upon receiving the IPDR data, the IPDR component  may save the IPDR data in the database(s) , illustrated as block , and\/or pass the IPDR data to the statistics component , illustrated as block . Upon receiving the IPDR data, the statistics component  may calculate the accumulated usage data for each CM , illustrated as block . In an illustrative embodiment, the statistics component  may calculate the amount of bytes transferred in the downstream and\/or the upstream directions.","For Subscribers using the PPS, the accumulation or amount of bytes transferred to or from a Subscriber's CM  starts when the service is activated so that the accumulated counters for the CM  correspond to the actual capacity used in each of the downstream and\/or upstream directions for the duration of the service activation.","The policy component  may communicate with the statistics component  and check the accumulated statistics calculated by the statistics component  to determine whether a Subscriber or the Subscriber's CM  has met or exceeded the capacity limit for the service activation in one or both of the downstream and upstream directions, illustrated as block . It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this check may only be performed if the activated service level specified a capacity limit.","In the case where the activated service level specified at least a capacity limit, and the policy component  determines that a Subscriber or the Subscriber's CM  has met or exceeded the service level capacity limit for an activated service, illustrated as block , the policy component  may request the PCMM component  to deactivate the service for the Subscriber's CM , illustrated as block . The PCMM component  may perform the service deactivation using standard PCMM COPS messages to delete the one or more gates corresponding to the activated service, for example as defined by the DOCSIS standard (PKT-SP-MM-I05-091029).","In an illustrative embodiment, the PCMM component  performs a Gate Delete function on behalf of the Policy component to deactivate the service for the Subscriber's CM . The Gate Delete function deletes one or more existing gates on the CMTS  for a specific Subscriber's CM . The deactivation may also be invoked through Administrator action independent of Subscriber payment to allow for the Administrator to override the PPSS  for any reason.","In the case where the activated service level specified at least a time limit, the policy component  checks to determine whether the Subscriber or the Subscriber's CM  has met or exceeded the service level time limit, illustrated as block . If the Subscriber or the Subscriber's CM  has met or exceeded the service level time limit for an activated service, illustrated as block , the policy component  may request the PCMM component  to deactivate the service for the Subscriber's CM , as described above, illustrated as block .","In an illustrative embodiment, the PCMM component  may also perform a Gate Sync procedure with a CMTS  whenever a new connection, for example a COPS connection, is created to that CMTS . Once a connection has been created to a CMTS  the connection is maintained until there is a failure. When a new connection is created it is possible that the state of the gates on the CMTS  may differ from the desired states kept by the PPSS . For example, a connection loss may cause loss of one or more gate actions, and\/or the CMTS  may have restarted in which case all gates that were active may be lost. To avoid the possibility that a Subscriber has paid for service but the CMTS  has lost the gate states that would enable the service, the PCMM component  may use the Gate Sync to check which gates the CMTS  has active. The PCMM component  may then compare active gates with the expected gate states that the PCMM component  has stored in the database(s)  and\/or in-memory. If the CMTS  is missing gates that it should have, the PCMM component  may perform one or more Gate Set actions as described above for each missing gate. If, on the other hand, the CMTS  has gates that the PCMM component  does not expect the CMTS  to have, the PCMM component  may perform one or more Gate Delete actions to remove those gates, as described below. In this way the PCMM component  forces the CMTS  to conform to the same gate states as the PCMM component .","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  may provide payment validation though the payment component  API to an external payment system, and display back to the Subscriber the status of the payment. The subscriber UI component  may also store any failed transactions in the database(s)  or in-memory. In an example, if the Subscriber attempt fails the subscriber UI component  may store the failure details, including for example, payment failures, activation failures, and\/or other failures and parameters.","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  may also provide a subscriber interface that allows the Subscriber to extend an existing service activation and\/or change the service level or other parameters of the existing service activation by making a further payment transaction. This allows continuation of service without interruption. In this embodiment, the subscriber UI component  may request the appropriate change of the control component . In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  requests an extension of service and\/or change to the service level by invoking the web service API to the control component  and sending a request to the control component . In an illustrative embodiment, the request may include the transmission of input parameters to the control component . The input parameters may include, but are not limited to, a cpeipaddress, cmmacaddress, and other service parameters, for example, downstream and upstream byte limits, a time limit, and\/or other similar parameters. If there is no existing service, the control component  treats the request as a PPS service setup or activation request, described above.","If the service activation is to be extended the control component  may adjust the parameters, for example, quota\/capacity limits and\/or time limits, of the service activation in the database(s)  for the Subscriber. Generally, no additional interaction with the CMTS  is required. If the service level is being changed where the new service level has a different QoS compared to the existing service activation, the control component  may create one or more new gates, for example, one for each direction, for the new service level through the policy component  and PCMM component  which in turn may request the new gates to be set up by the CMTS . On receiving notification that the new Gates have been set, the control component  may request that the previous gates for the previous service level be deleted, again using the policy component  and PCMM component  and making that request to the CMTS . The control component  may also return or output the status of the extension of service and\/or change to the service level request to the subscriber UI component . The output may include, but is not limited to, success or failure. If the output is a failure, the control component  may also output details of the reason(s) of the failure.","In an illustrative embodiment, the Admin. UI component  may also include a reporting component which can create periodic reports of Subscriber service changes including the transaction payments. These reports may allow summarized accounts to be produced and where appropriate may allow splitting of the revenue between one or more vendors that together offer the Pre-Paid Service (PPS). These reports may use the data stored in the database(s)  as the source data for report generation.","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component  may provide a service status function. When performing the service status function, the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component  may request the PCMM component  to perform a Get Info function, for example via the control component . The Get Info function requests information from a CMTS  about a specific gate on a specific Subscriber's CM .","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component  requests the service status by invoking the web service API to the control component  and sending a request to the control component . In an illustrative embodiment, the request may include the transmission of input parameters to the control component . The input parameters may include, but are not limited to, a cpeipaddress, cmmacaddress, verifycmts, and other service parameters, for example, downstream and upstream byte limits, a time limit, and\/or other similar parameters. If the verifycmts, or CMTS is verified, the control component  may also verify the gate(s) on the CMTS. The control component  may also return or output the status of the service to the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component . The output may include, but is not limited to, success or failure. If the output is a failure, the control component  may also output details of the reason(s) of the failure. If the output is a success, the control component  may also output details of the subscriber state and\/or status of the service.","The service status function may be invoked through Administrator or Operator action, via the Admin. UI component , to check the state of a Subscriber's service, and\/or the service status function may be invoked by a Subscriber through the subscriber UI component  to support presentation of service state to the Subscriber. This allows the Subscriber or Operator to obtain the details of current service, for example, service level details, remaining time, capacity used\/remaining and\/or recent usage by time.","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component  may provide a cancellation function. When performing the service cancellation function, the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component  may request the PCMM component  to deactivate a Subscriber's service as described above, for example via the control component .","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component  requests service cancellation by invoking the web service API to the control component  and sending a request to the control component . In an illustrative embodiment, the request may include the transmission of input parameters to the control component . The input parameters may include, but are not limited to, a cpeipaddress, cmmacaddress, and other service parameters, for example, downstream and upstream byte limits, a time limit, and\/or other similar parameters. The control component  may also return or output the status of the service to the subscriber UI component  and\/or the Admin. UI component . The output may include, but is not limited to, success or failure. If the output is a failure, the control component  may also output details of the reason(s) of the failure. The service cancellation function may be invoked through Administrator or Operator action, via the Admin. UI component , and\/or a Subscriber through the subscriber UI component  to cancel a Subscriber's service. This allows the Subscriber or Operator to cancel service at any time.","In an illustrative embodiment, the subscriber UI component  may also provide a subscription service to a Subscriber. This variant of service automates the pre-payment for an Operator-defined service on a periodic or usage threshold basis. If the Subscriber chooses the subscription option, the PPSS sub-system  automatically attempts to extend the service at a configured threshold before the current service payment would expire. For a time-limit service, the threshold may be a time delta before the service expiry time. For a capacity limit the threshold may be a usage, for example, a byte count, delta before the service limit.","In an illustrative embodiment, two separate server or computer systems can be deployed to form a redundant cluster so that failure of one server does not cause loss of service. In this embodiment, each server may run an additional redundancy component, for example one or more of redundancy components  and , which is responsible for electing one of the servers to be a primary server with the other being a backup, and for controlling replication of data from the primary to the backup so that the backup has all the data to take over as the primary server. This component, for example one or more of redundancy components  and , may include a protocol exchanged between the servers which can detect when a server becomes unreachable. If the primary server becomes unreachable then the backup will be elected primary and will take over that role.","In an illustrative embodiment, the PPSS sub-system may be placed on the same server or computer system as the IPDR controller, or a separate server system from the IPDR controller. Further, a single PPSS sub-system can manage multiple IPDR controllers. In another illustrative embodiment, a plurality of PPSS sub-systems can be deployed in a large Operator's network to provide sufficient scaling to handle the expected transaction load from Subscriber interactions. In this embodiment, a separate master PPSS sub-system can be deployed as the single point of contact for Administrator and Subscriber interactions. The master PPSS sub-system may pass requests to the appropriate PPSS sub-system for processing based on topological knowledge learned from the IPDR controller systems. Further, a single master system may be deployed to oversee the plurality of PPSS sub-systems.","While the systems, methods, and apparatuses have been described and illustrated in connection with certain embodiments, many variations and modifications will be evident to those skilled in the art and may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
