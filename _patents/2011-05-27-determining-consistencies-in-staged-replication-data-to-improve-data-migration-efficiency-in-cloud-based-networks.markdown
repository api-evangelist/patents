title: Determining consistencies in staged replication data to improve data migration efficiency in cloud based networks
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for data migration among a plurality of cloud-based storage networks. In aspects, an administrator of a data payload may wish to migrate the data payload from a host cloud network to a target cloud provider to leverage cost, security, redundancy, consolidation, or other advantages. A data distribution service can identify data sets replicated from the data payload and located on the data distribution service or other staging sites. The data distribution service or other logic can examine consistencies and/or differences between the data payload in the host cloud network and the replicated data payloads. Depending on the consistencies and/or differences, the data distribution service can directly transport a replicated data payload from the respective staging site to a target cloud in lieu of migrating the data payload out of the host cloud network to the target cloud.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to systems and methods for data migration among a plurality of cloud-based storage networks, and more particularly, to platforms and techniques for determining consistencies in data in a source cloud network with data that is replicated on one or more cloud data distribution sites, to improve data migration efficiency among cloud based networks.","The advent of cloud-based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores, media outlets, social networking sites, and many other on-line sites or services. In general, a cloud-based architecture deploys a set of hosted resources such as processors, operating systems, software and other components that can be combined together to form virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of machines from those resources from a central server or cloud management system to perform intended tasks, services, or applications. For example, a user may wish to set up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis, for instance, to sell tickets to or merchandise for an upcoming sports or musical performance. The user can subscribe to the set of resources needed to build and run the set of instantiated virtual machines on a comparatively short-term basis, such as hours or days, for their intended application.","Typically, when a user utilizes a cloud, the user must track the software applications executed in the cloud and\/or processes instantiated in the cloud. For example, the user must track the cloud processes to ensure that the correct cloud processes have been instantiated, that the cloud processes are functioning properly and\/or efficiently, that the cloud is providing sufficient resources to the cloud processes, and so forth. Due in part to the user's requirements and overall usage of the cloud, the user may have many applications and\/or processes instantiated in a cloud at any given instant, and the user's deployment of virtual machines, software, and other resources can change dynamically over time. In cases, the user may also utilize multiple independent clouds to support the user's cloud deployment. That user may further instantiate and use multiple applications or other software or services inside or across multiple of those cloud boundaries, and those resources may be used or consumed by multiple or differing end-user groups in those different cloud networks.","For various reasons, an administrator or other user may wish to consider transporting or migrating a set of data in cloud-hosted storage of one cloud provider to cloud storage associated with another cloud provider. For example, the other cloud provider may offer more storage, better subscription rates, and\/or other benefits. In some cases, the administrator may have a large amount of data already in the cloud-hosted storage. For example, in the case of relatively large-scale arrangements, such as those maintained, merely for instance, by hospitals, government agencies, financial institutions, or other entities, the amount of data that needs to be transported or migrated may be in the range of terabytes, petabytes, or more. In the case of those comparatively large-scale data installations, an attempt to transport or migrate the data to another cloud provider over public Internet connections, such as packet-switched TCP\/IP (transfer control protocol\/Internet protocol) or FTP (file transfer protocol) connections, the delivery of the data payload could require days or weeks of time.","For many organizations, that type of migration delay may be impractical or impossible. In addition, the relatively narrow-bandwidth connections available over the public Internet may not be secure, and for sensitive data or applications, the use of such connections may also not be a valid or practical option. Moreover, narrow-bandwidth connections into host or target storage clouds may not allow for data management services such as error correction, in-flight encryption, or other security or management options. Further, an administrator or other entity associated with a data payload in a source cloud may migrate a data payload to a target cloud while inadvertently failing to realize that a replicated version of the data payload was already stored on a service associated with the target cloud. As such, the administrator may squander processing and transfer time that could have been saved by instead transferring the replicated version of the data payload to the target cloud.","Therefore, it may be desirable to provide systems and methods for identifying data that is consistent with data in the cloud-hosted storage and is already replicated on cloud data distribution sites. In particular, it may be desirable to provide systems and methods for locating consistent data on sites connected to a target cloud to bypass a full-scale migration of data from a source cloud to a target cloud.","Embodiments described herein can be implemented in or supported by a cloud network architecture. As used herein, a \u201ccloud\u201d can comprise a collection of hardware, software, services, and\/or resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource for a limited or defined duration. As shown for example in , the collection of resources supporting a cloud  can at a hardware level comprise a set of resource servers  configured to deliver computing components needed to instantiate a virtual machine, process, service, or other resource. For example, one group of resource servers in set of resource servers  can host and serve an operating system, and\/or components, utilities, or interfaces related to that operating system, to deliver to a virtual target, and instantiate that machine with an image of that operating system. Another group of servers in set of resource servers  can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time, memory allocations, communications ports or links, and\/or other resources to supply a defined level of processing power or throughput for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers in set of resource servers  can host and serve applications or other software to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine, such as an email client, a browser application, a messaging application, or other applications, software, or services. Other types of resource servers can be used to support one or more clouds .","In embodiments, the entire set of resource servers  and\/or other hardware or software resources used to support one or more clouds , along with the set of instantiated virtual machines, can be managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, services, and network tools that communicate via network , such as the Internet or other public or private network, with all servers in set of resource servers  to manage the cloud  and its operation. To instantiate a new or updated set of virtual machines, a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system  for the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud . The virtual machines can be instantiated as virtual client machines, virtual appliance machines consisting of special-purpose or dedicated-task machines as understood in the art, and\/or as other virtual machines or entities. The request to invoke and instantiate the desired complement of virtual machines can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, process, or other resource being requested in that platform's associated cloud. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of hardware, software, service, and\/or other resources necessary to instantiate that complement of virtual machines or other resources. In embodiments, the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can, for example, and as noted, comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, Web pages, and\/or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated collection of machines, services, or processes is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, a month, or other interval of time. In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount or interval of time. For instance, a user could request a set of virtual provisioning servers and other resources until a target software update is completed on a population of corporate or other machines. The user's instantiation request can in further regards specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example, the request can specify a specific minimum or maximum amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput that the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments, the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for their desired set of applications or services. Other parameters and settings can be used to instantiate and operate a set of virtual machines, software, and other resources in the host clouds. One skilled in the art will realize that the user's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters, and others. It may be noted that \u201cuser\u201d herein can include a network-level user or subscriber to cloud-based networks, such as a corporation, government entity, educational institution, and\/or other entity, including individual users and groups of users.","When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build those machines or resources have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more set of resource servers  to locate resources to supply the required components. Generally, the cloud management system  can select servers from the diverse set of resource servers  to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines, services, or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage, such as optical storage or hard disk arrays, may or may not be included or located within the set of resource servers  available to the cloud management system , since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware, software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in one or more clouds  can be accessed and leveraged as needed. For example, other software or services that are provided outside of one or more clouds  acting as hosts, and are instead hosted by third parties outside the boundaries of those clouds, can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines or users. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the one or more clouds  acting as hosts or native clouds, for instance, on an on-demand, subscribed, or event-triggered basis.","With the resource requirements identified for building a network of virtual machines, the cloud management system  can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic, on-demand basis. For example, one set of resource servers  may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour or day. A further set of resource servers  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis, for instance over a defined window of time. In other embodiments, the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis, or at a particular future time. For example, a set of resource servers  may respond to a request for instantiation of virtual machines at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours. Other timing and resource configurations are possible.","After interrogating and receiving resource commitments from the set of resource servers , the cloud management system  can select a group of servers in the set of resource servers  that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the user's requested virtual machine, service, or other resource. The cloud management system  for the one or more clouds  acting as the destination for the virtual machines can then coordinate the integration of the identified group of servers from the set of resource servers , to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system  can track the identified group of servers selected from the set of resource servers , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population, services, or other cloud-based resources.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can generate a resource aggregation table or other record that identifies the various selected sets of resource servers in set of resource servers  that will be used to supply the components of the set of instantiated virtual machines, services, or processes. The selected sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet protocol (IP) addresses or other addresses. In aspects, different sets of servers in set of resource servers  can be selected to deliver different resources to different users and\/or for different applications. The cloud management system  can register the finalized group of servers in the set resource servers  contributing to or otherwise supporting the set of instantiated machines, services, or processes.","The cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process to instantiate the virtual machines, processes, services, and\/or other resources to be hosted and delivered from the one or more clouds . The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in the set of resource servers . The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each registered server in set of resource servers  indicating a status or state regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various registered resource servers may confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, services, and\/or applications or other software prepared to be served and delivered.","As shown for example in , after coordination of the sources and configuration of resources including the hardware layer, selected software, and\/or other resources, the cloud management system  can then instantiate a set of virtual machines , and\/or other appliances, services, processes, and\/or entities, based on the resources supplied by servers within set of resource servers  registered to support the one or more clouds  in a multiple-cloud network . According to aspects, cloud management system  can access or interact with a virtualization module, platform, or service to instantiate and operate set of virtual machines , such as the kernel-based virtualization manager (KVM\u2122) available from Red Hat, Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., or others. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can instantiate a given number, for example, 10, 500, 1000, 20,000, or other numbers or instances of virtual machines to populate one or more clouds  and be made available to users of that cloud or clouds. In aspects, users may access the one or more clouds  via the Internet, or other public or private networks. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table, or other record or image of the instantiated virtual machine population. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store data related to the duration of the existence or operation of each operating virtual machine, as well as the collection of resources utilized by the overall set of instantiated virtual machines .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track and manage each user's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources. Each user that operates a virtual machine or service in the set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them, with associated access rights and security provisions. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that each user can perform, such as the ability to provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources, configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications, submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host, manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources, and\/or other privileges, entitlements, or actions. The cloud management system  associated with the virtual machine(s) of each user can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the resources and services consumed by the user or set of users. In aspects of the present teachings, the tracking of usage activity for one or more users (including network level users and\/or end-users) can be abstracted from any one cloud to which that user is registered, and made available from an external or independent usage tracking service capable of tracking software and other usage across an arbitrary collection of clouds, as described herein. In embodiments, the cloud management system  of an associated cloud can for example meter the usage and\/or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines , to generate subscription and\/or billing records for a user that has launched those machines. In aspects, tracking records can in addition or instead be generated by an internal service operating within a given cloud. Other subscription, billing, entitlement and\/or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine in set of instantiated virtual machines  to be made available to users via one or more networks , such as the Internet or other public or private networks. Those users can for instance access set of instantiated virtual machines  via a browser interface, via an application server such as a Java\u2122 server, via an application programming interface (API), and\/or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine in the set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with its associated cloud management system  and the registered servers in set of resource servers  via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls, protocols, and\/or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud in one or more clouds , or between those or other clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines  from a client or terminal, the processing, memory, communications, storage, and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the one or more clouds . In embodiments, the set of virtual machines  or other services, machines, or resources may not depend in any degree on or require the user's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront, messaging site, and\/or any other application. Likewise, one or more clouds  can also be formed in whole or part from resources hosted or maintained by the users of those clouds, themselves.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines  on a logical or virtual level, the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify, install, or configure any particular hardware. The user's set of instantiated virtual machines , processes, services, and\/or other resources can in one regard therefore be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the set of resource servers  that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support the set of instantiated virtual machines  or processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant, since instances are assembled from a collection of abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications. Conversely, the users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can also change or update the resource or operational specifications of those machines at any time. The cloud management system  and\/or other logic can then adapt the allocated resources for that population of virtual machines or other entities, on a dynamic basis.","In terms of network management of the set of instantiate virtual machines  that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the one or more cloud management systems  associated with those machines can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of one or more clouds  can, for example, install, initiate, suspend, or terminate instances of applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system  can similarly monitor one or more operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines, and for instance terminate an application identified as infected, or a virtual machine detected to have entered a fault state. The cloud management system  can likewise manage the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources on a network-wide or other collective basis, for instance, to push the delivery a software upgrade to all active virtual machines or subsets of machines. Other network management processes can be carried out by cloud management system  and\/or other associated logic.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same time, at overlapping times, and\/or at successive times or intervals. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines as part of the set of instantiated virtual machines  based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers , with populations of different virtual machines such as may be requested by the same or different users. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in one or more clouds  hosting one or more sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets or subsets of virtual machines in the set of instantiated virtual machines  can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the main cloud . The cloud management system  of one or more clouds  can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual workloads\/processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud or other sub-domain or partition of the one or more clouds  acting as host. The subdivision of one or more clouds  into distinct transient sub-clouds, sub-components, or other subsets which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple-user scenario, each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the same one or more clouds . In further embodiments, sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, and as also shown in , the set of instantiated virtual machines  generated in a first cloud in one or more clouds  can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines, services, and\/or processes generated in a second, third or further cloud in one or more clouds , comprising a multiple-cloud network . The cloud management system  of a first cloud of one or more clouds  can interface with the cloud management system  of a second, third, or further cloud of one or more clouds  to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or virtual machines, services, and\/or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system  of a given cloud on one or more clouds  can in aspects track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud, as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person, customer, subscriber, administrator, corporation, organization, government, and\/or other entity. In embodiments, the user can be or include another virtual machine, application, service and\/or process. In further embodiments, multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.","In aspects, the cloud management system  and\/or other logic or service that manages, configures, and tracks cloud activity can be configured to interact with other sites, platforms, engines, servers, and\/or associated services that are configured to organize and manage the transport and delivery of existing data stores from on-premise databases or other sources, and stage that data to data storage resources at, near, co-hosted, or otherwise in geographic proximity to a set of host storage clouds in which that data payload will be placed and stored. In aspects, the cloud distribution data service (which may be referred to as \u201cCDD\u201d, \u201cCDD service,\u201d \u201cdata delivery service,\u201d or other references herein) can be located at the network edge to either or both of the premise data sources, and\/or the set of host storage clouds. In aspects, this staging or staggering of potentially large-scale or very large-scale data stores can permit the connection between the data source(s), intermediate or staged data stores, and\/or the host cloud data stores using dedicated and\/or high-bandwidth lines, channels, or connections to permit the efficient and timely porting of that data to a host storage cloud or clouds of the user's choice. In aspects, the data payload or portions thereof can be located, extracted and transmitted as an image or copy of the subject data, with the original cloud-hosted being preserved in the set of host storage clouds. In aspects, the data payload and\/or portions thereof can be located, extracted, and transmitted without leaving the original data stored in the set of host storage clouds, such as by deleting that data upon reading-out, or using other techniques.","In those regards,  illustrates a network implementation in which, in various cases, an administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user of a premise network  may wish to consider identifying, collecting, and migrating or transporting their databases, data files, and\/or other data assets to a set of host storage clouds . In aspects and merely illustratively, the premise network  can contain or include on-premise, bare-metal, and\/or other virtual or physical assets including a set of premise servers , a set of premise clients , one or more local area networks (LANs)  such as an Ethernet\u2122 or Wifi\u2122 network, a virtual private network (VPN), and\/or other networks or connection topologies. The premise network  can include or interface to one or more networks , such as the public Internet and\/or other public or private networks.","The premise network  can likewise include a set of premise data stores , such as one or more databases, data stores, servers, redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) installations, optical or solid-state storage or devices, and\/or other data storage repositories, resources, or assets. In aspects, the set of premise data stores  can store different types of data, including, for example, technical, medical, financial, customer, inventory, scientific, and\/or other data. The data hosted or stored in the set of premise data stores  can comprise significantly or substantially large-scale data, for example data or files comprising terabytes or other amounts of data. For instance, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user of a corporation, hospital, educational institution, government body, and\/or other entity may collect and maintain a set of data in a set of premise data stores  such as local databases, data centers, database files and\/or engines, repositories, and\/or other data assets, services, and\/or other storage sites of resources. In cases, the set of premise data stores  can host and store a significant or substantial amount of data, such as terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, yottabytes, and\/or other amounts of data. In aspects, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user responsible for hosting and\/or maintaining that data in the set of premise data stores  may, for various reasons, wish to migrate some or all of that data to one or more local cloud data stores  in the set of host storage clouds , such as to leverage cost, maintenance, capacity, security, and\/or other advantages or factors available in the set of host storage clouds .","In aspects, it can be the case that if the owner, administrator, and\/or other user of the user premise network  attempted to transport a significant amount of the data stored in the set of premise data stores  via one or more networks  such as the Internet in an unmanaged fashion, the comparatively low bandwidth or lack of reliability in the packet-switched public Internet could render the data transfer difficult, impractical, unfeasible, or impossible due to the limitations of those types of channels or connections. The upload of terabytes or other amounts of data over public Internet or similar connections could require days of time or more, and data integrity or reliability issues could also affect the effectiveness of data migration attempted in that manner.","According to aspects, systems and methods for staged data migration between data sources and cloud-based storage networks according to the present teachings can be deployed to assist in reducing, avoiding, or eliminating those and other types of performance degradations and other factors having a potential negative impact on the transport of data from on-premise and\/or other sources to the set of host storage clouds  and\/or other cloud-based storage assets, services, or resources. In implementations of the present teachings, a data distribution service  can accordingly be established or deployed as an independent service or access point, available publicly or privately to potential subscribers to the set of host storage clouds , to condition, prepare, receive, and stage incoming data payloads or data sets for delivery to an eventual cloud storage host, using enhanced, dedicated, and\/or otherwise managed connections to reduce data transport time, to improve transfer reliability and\/or security, and\/or to provide other factors or benefits. In aspects, the data distribution service  can establish or maintain physical points of presence (PoPs) and\/or other connections to one or more networks , such as the Internet and\/or other public or private networks, through which users or potential users can connect to the data distribution service  and its associated resources, logic, and services. According to aspects, the data distribution service  can host or execute a staging engine  that can contain software application, operating system, and\/or other logic or resources to manage the transport and delivery of a data payload  from the set of premise data stores  and\/or other sources to a set of host storage clouds . In aspects, the data distribution service  can be configured to communicate directly or indirectly with the cloud management system  of each of the set of host storage clouds , for instance via the Internet and\/or other public or private networks or connections. In aspects, the data distribution service  can also maintain a set of staged data stores , such as databases, data stores, servers, and\/or other data assets or resources with which to store and stage the data payload  for migration into one or more local cloud data stores  hosted in the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, each cloud in the set of host storage clouds  can host one or multiple local cloud data stores .","According to implementations of the present teachings, the data distribution service  can operate to manage, organize, and\/or enhance or optimize the transfer of the data payload  from the set of premise data stores  and\/or other sources by staggering, staging, pre-staging, conditioning, and\/or otherwise manipulating and administering the transfer of the data payload  to the set of staged data stores  via sets of selectable and\/or configurable channels or connections. In aspects, those channels or connections can be or include a set of dedicated staging connections  that connect the user premise network  to the data distribution service  and the set of staged data stores . In aspects, the set of dedicated staging connections  can be or include any one or more of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks or connections, wide area networks (WANs) or connections, metropolitan area networks (MANs) or connections, fiber optical connections such as synchronous optical networking (SONET) or synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) connections, wireless connections, cable or wireline connections, virtual private networks (VPNs) or connections, and\/or other channels or connections. In aspects, the connections in the set of dedicated staging connections  can be or include channels or connections can having a relatively high-capacity bandwidth or service level, such as for instance tens of megabytes per second, hundreds of megabytes per second, gigabytes per second, tens of gigabytes per second, hundreds of gigabytes per second, terabytes per second, and\/or other data transfer rates or bandwidth ratings or capacities. In aspects, any one or more of the connections or channels in the set of dedicated staging connections  can comprise connections which are leased by a user on a temporary, demand-triggered, long-term, and\/or other basis. And one or more of the connections or channels in the set of dedicated staging connections  can be or include permanent or dedicated channels, line, and\/or connections, dynamically routed or configured channels or connections, and\/or other channels or connections.","In aspects, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user of the user premise network  can specify a set of conditions, criteria, and\/or other parameters to govern the transport of the data payload  during delivery to the data distribution service  and\/or to the eventual set of host storage clouds , which information can be stored or encoded in a set of transport parameters , which can be stored in the staging engine  and\/or other locations or stores. The set of transport parameters  can, for instance, specify a total amount of data to be include in the data payload  for delivery to the data distribution service , as well as a schedule over which or time by which the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user wishes to conduct and complete the migration of the data payload  to the data distribution service . The set of transport parameters  can likewise include cost specifications, for instance, in cases where the cost of leasing or using any of the set of dedicated staging connections  is selectable or variable. The set of transport parameters  can also include further configuration parameters, such as any security or redundancy protocols or standards that the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user wishes to apply to the transport of the data payload to the data distribution service , user access controls to the data payload  before or after transport has been initiated or completed. Other parameters, configuration settings, commands, scripts, and\/or other criteria, variables, or conditions can be specified or indicated in the set of transport parameters .","As a merely illustrative example, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user can enter or encode the set of transport parameters  to indicate that a data transport event is desired to migrate the data payload  from the user premise network  under criteria that 1,000 terabytes of data is to be transported by an ending time of 12:00 midnight on a specified data, at an average cost of not more than $0.25 per megabyte and with the data payload  encrypted using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and\/or other encryption or security protocol, and with the data payload  to be stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  in XML (extensible markup language) or other format. The set of transport parameters  can be selected, entered, and\/or otherwise transmitted from the user premise network  or other site to the data distribution service , for instance via a selector tool, Web browser, and\/or other application or interface. The set of transport parameters  can, in aspects, in whole or part specify the set of dedicated staging connections  to be used for delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the data distribution service , for instance via manual selection or input received from the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user.","In aspects, the data payload  and\/or associated information can be migrated or transported partly or entirely via the set of dedicated staging connections . For instance, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user may transmit some of the data payload  and\/or associated information via the one or more networks, in addition to the set of dedicated staging connections . For example, configuration commands, the set of transport parameters  or portions of or updates to the set of transport parameters , can be transmitted via the one or more networks , for instance via the public Internet, since in aspects comparatively higher-bandwidth connections may not be necessary to transmit relatively small amounts of commands and\/or data or elements of the data. In cases, the one or more networks  can in addition or instead transport at least a portion of the data payload , for instance, to transmit supplemental data or attributes whose delivery target time is not immediate or a high priority. Other combinations of the one or more networks , the set of dedicated staging connections , other networks or connections, and\/or combinations thereof can be used.","In aspects, after transport of the data payload  to the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  has been completed, the data distribution service  can finalize the installation, storage, and\/or hosting of the data payload  and\/or associated information in the one or more local cloud data stores  before initiating activities related to further transport of the data payload  to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the set of local host storage clouds . The data distribution service  can store, host, and maintain the data payload  in the set of staged data stores  for temporary, short-term, and\/or longer or other periods, depending on the set of transfer parameters  and\/or other factors. For instance, the staging engine  of the data distribution service  can determine that the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user has specified or requested that the transfer of the data payload  into the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the set of local host storage clouds  be initiated by 9:00 p.m. on a certain date. To satisfy that scheduling criterion, the staging engine  can identify the size and\/or type of data in the data payload , analyze or estimate the bandwidth available in the set of dedicated staging connections , and set a target delivery completion time of 11:00 p.m. on the specified delivery date, taking into account the interval of time that will be necessary to transport the data payload  over the available bandwidth of the selected channels in the set of dedicated staging connections  to complete transfer of the data payload  by 11:00 p.m. on that scheduled date. If the transport process proceeds to complete by the calculated completion time of 11:00 p.m. on that date, the data of the data payload  and\/or any associated information can accordingly reside in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  for one hour before the staging engine  initiates the further or next-stage migration or transport of the data payload  to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the set of local host storage clouds . The set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  can host the data payload  and\/or associated information for lesser or greater amounts of times, for instance, for periods of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and\/or other period or intervals, depending on the set of transfer parameters  and\/or other factors. For instance, in an illustrative implementation involving payload data  including enterprise resource planning (ERP) data related to a chemical or automotive factory, the manufacturing data, materials deliveries and costs, factory repair or maintenance events or schedules, and\/or other data may be tracked, stored, and updated on a monthly cycle. In those or other implementations, the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user may specify that the data payload  encapsulating that ERP and\/or other data can or should be migrated over a period of 30 days and\/or before the next regular update cycle, in which case the data distribution service  may determine that the data payload  can be extracted to the data distribution service  over a period of 30 days, for instance so as to use a comparatively lower amount of bandwidth in the set of dedicated staging connections  and thereby incur less connection leasing costs. In cases where the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service  stores, hosts, and\/or maintains the data payload  over significant intervals of time, such as days or weeks of time, and\/or other intervals or periods, the data distribution service  can also apply or enforce data conditioning or maintenance standards or procedures on the data payload  or other information. For example, in cases where the data payload  includes medical information, the data distribution service  can apply user access controls such as username\/password authentication and\/or data encryption, for instance to satisfy the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), or other regulatory or compliance stipulations or requirements. Other compliance, management, and\/or security protocols can be applied to the data payload  and\/or other information stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service , regardless of the duration of time that information is staged in the data distribution service . For instance, during the period that the data payload  resides or is hosted in the data distribution service , the data distribution service  can also communicate with the user premise network  to interrogate that source network for any incremental or other updates to the data payload , and incorporate those updates into the data payload  stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service . Other data conditioning or processing can be performed on the data payload  while hosted or stored in the set of staged data stores  of the data distribution service .","In aspects, the data distribution service  can be installed, configured, and\/or located in geographic proximity to the set of host storage clouds , the one or more local cloud data stores , and\/or other network elements or sites. As used or described in this application, in aspects, locations within geographic proximity to each other can be or include locations or sites located within the same city or metropolitan area, and\/or within the same general region, such as within a state in the U.S. and\/or a multi-state region generally recognized as constituting a cohesive geographic region, such as, merely for example, the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut tri-state area, and\/or others. In aspects, locations within geographic proximity to each other can also or instead be or include areas or regions within which direct, continuous, connectable, configurable, leasable, primary, and\/or otherwise uninterrupted or unmediated physical or wireless connections are available to establish communications links between two or more network points, sites, and\/or entities within a geographic region, section, and\/or area. In aspects, network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements can be considered to be within geographic proximity to each other is those sites or points can be connected directly or essentially directly via comparatively high-bandwidth channels or connections, and\/or without resorting to connections via the public Internet. For example, network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements can be considered to be within geographic proximity to each other if those sites, points, and\/or other elements can be connected directly or essentially directly via one or more wide area networks (WANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), optical connections such as synchronous optical network (SONET) connections, and\/or other comparatively high-bandwidth channels or connections, as will be understood by persons skilled in the art. While in aspects network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements can be considered as being within geographic proximity based on various physical, functional, and\/or logical factors, in aspects, and purely illustratively, network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements that can be classified or considered as being within geographic proximity can be located within distances of miles, tens of miles, hundreds of miles, and\/or lesser or greater distances of each other. Other factors, parameters, criteria, and\/or considerations can be used to determine geographic proximity between network sites, points including physical points of presence (PoPs), and\/or other elements as described herein.","Upon meeting, reaching, and\/or otherwise satisfying the scheduled time, criteria, and\/or conditions to initiate the further transfer of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds , the data distribution service  and\/or other logic or service can begin the processing to migrate that data or information to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more clouds in the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, the delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds  can be initiated at a scheduled time, such as a time specified in the set of transport parameters  and\/or other commands or configuration data. In aspects, the delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds  can be initiated on an event-triggered basis, such as one hour or one day after completion of the transport of the data payload  to the data distribution service . In aspects, the delivery of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds  can also or instead be initiated by manual selection or command, for instance, by a selection or command inputted by the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user. Other conditions, commands, schedules, events, and\/or criteria can be used to identify a time at which to begin, pause, continue, and\/or otherwise deliver the data payload  and\/or associated information from the data distribution service  to the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more clouds in the set of host storage clouds .","In aspects, the data payload  and\/or other information can be transported or transmitted from the data distribution service  to the set of host storage clouds  via a set of dedicated transport connections . In aspects, the set of dedicated transport connections  can connect the set of staged data stores  directly or indirectly to the one or more local cloud data stores  to migrate and install the data payload  and\/or associated information in the one or more local cloud data stores . In aspects, the set of dedicated transport connections  can be or include connections or channels of the same general type or types as the set of dedicated staging connections , and\/or can include additional, separate, and\/or different channels or connections. In aspects, the set of staged data stores  can be located within geographic proximity or near-geographic proximity, in the senses noted herein, to one or more of the clouds in the set of host storage clouds  and\/or the constituent elements of those clouds, including the cloud management system(s)  and\/or one or more local cloud data stores . In aspects, the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can initiate and manage the transfer of the data payload  and\/or image thereof stored or hosted in the set of staged data stores  to the one or more local cloud data stores  via the set of dedicated transport connections  on a scheduled, event-triggered, manually-specified, and\/or other basis. The migration or transport of the data payload  and\/or associated data can for instance be programmed to begin at a specified time on a specified date, and\/or to begin upon the detection of specified events, such as validation of the data payload  and\/or associated data using error correction, decryption, and\/or other processing or protocols. In aspects, the migration or transport of the data payload  and\/or associated data can be initiated by receipt of a command, input, and\/or other signal from the administrator, owner, operator, and\/or other user, for instance, received via a tool, interface, or browser operated by the admin in the user premise network  and\/or other location or site.","After the transfer of the data payload  and\/or other associated data has been initiated, the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can monitor the transport of that data while in-flight, for instance, to perform data validation of migrated data using for instance check-sum or other processing, encryption\/decryption of the data while traversing the set of dedicated transport connections , and\/or to perform other supervisory or monitoring tasks to ensure the integrity of the data being moved and the migration process. After the successful completion of all data transport, validation, security, and\/or other processing required for migration of the data payload  and\/or related information, the staging engine  can detect, confirm, and\/or declare the completion of the transfer of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, the staging engine , one or more cloud management system(s) , and\/or other logic can store and\/or encode the data payload  and\/or associated information in the one or more local cloud data stores  in various formats or configurations, such as, for example, any one or more of a database including relational databases, an object-oriented data object such as an extensible markup language (XML)-based object, a table, tree, linked list, and\/or other data object, format, file, and\/or configuration. In aspects, the staging engine  can also perform any post-transfer activities that may be selected or required to complete the installation and storage of the data payload  and\/or related information in the set of host storage clouds . In aspects, for instance, the the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can communicate with the user premise network  to indicate that the data payload  and\/or associated information has been safely and\/or completely migrated to the data distribution service , upon which notification the user premise network  can perform other actions, such as to delete and\/or archive the data of the data. payload  from the set of premise data stores . Other actions can be taken by or in the user premise network .","For instance, upon completion of the data transport process, the staging engine  and\/or other logic or service can likewise communicate with the cloud management system(s)  of one or more of the set of host storage clouds  to notify the one or more cloud management system(s)  of the installation and presence of the data payload  and\/or associated data in the one or more local cloud data stores  of one or more of the clouds in the set of host storage clouds .","In aspects, after the successful or completed transport of the data payload  and\/or associated information to the set of host storage clouds , the staging engine , cloud management system(s) , and\/or other logic or service can for instance register the data payload  and\/or associated data in the file storage system or systems used by the one or more cloud management system(s)  and\/or set of host storage clouds . In aspects, registration of the data payload  and\/or associated data in corresponding file storage system or systems maintained or operated by the one or more cloud management system(s)  and\/or set of host storage clouds  can permit, for instance, virtual machines, operating systems, applications, and\/or other software, services, and\/or users of the set of host storage clouds  and\/or other clouds or networks to access, read, retrieve, write, modify, and\/or otherwise process the data payload  and\/or associated information directly from or via the set of host storage clouds .

For example, as shown in , the data distribution service  can be connected to cloud provider B  and cloud provider C . In aspects, the data distribution service  can be connected to the target cloud providers via multiple connections such as, for example, a network connection or a set of dedicated transport channels , . Further, the data distribution service  can interface with components of the target cloud providers. For example, as shown in , the data distribution service  can interface with a cloud management system  and a set of resources  of cloud provider B , and with a cloud management system  and a set of resources  of cloud provider C , and other resources such as the local cloud data  of the respective target cloud networks.","The data distribution service  can comprise a data transport tool  that can facilitate the transportation, migration, and otherwise movement of data among components of the network . For example, the data transport tool  can direct the, transport of the data payload  to cloud provider A  via, for example, the set of dedicated transport channels . In aspects, the data transport tool  can be a component of any of the resources of  such as, for example, the cloud management system  of cloud provider A , the set of resources , or other resources.","According to aspects, the data transport tool  can replicate data on resources within the data distribution service  such as, for example, the staged data stores . For example, in addition to transporting the data payload  to cloud provider A , the data transport tool  can replicate a data payload  on the staged data stores , as shown in , such that the data payload  can be stored in the data distribution service  concurrently with the data payload  in cloud provider A . In aspects, the data transport tool  can replicate some or all of the data in the data payload  to form the data payload .","In aspects, the data transport tool  can further replicate data on storage devices associated with additional data distribution services, staging areas, or the like. For example, as shown in , the data transport tool  can transport the data payload  to an additional data distribution service  via a network  or other connection. The additional data distribution service  can comprise a data transport tool  that can perform similar or identical functionalities as the data transport tool . For example, the data transport tool  can replicate an additional data payload  on staged data stores  of the additional data distribution service . This way, once the data payload  is transported to cloud provider A , the data transport tools ,  can replicate the respective data payloads ,  on respective resources of the data distribution service  and the additional data distribution service . It should be appreciated that the data transport tools ,  or other logic can replicate the data payload  on other resources not shown in , and can replicate the data payload  at any time before, during, or after the transport of the data payload  to cloud provider A , or to other cloud networks.","According to aspects, the data transport tool  can receive a request, a set of instructions, or any type of indication from the administrator of the data payload , and\/or other administrators, to identify candidate target cloud providers to which to migrate the data payload . For example, as shown in , the data transport tool  can determine that cloud provider B  and\/or cloud provider C  comprise resources, such as the set of resources  and the set of resources , respectively, to which to migrate the data payload  resident on resources associated with cloud provider A . In aspects, the data transport tool  can automatically initiate functionality related to identifying the candidate target cloud providers. In aspects, the administrator can specify one or more target cloud providers to which to migrate the data payload . For example, the administrator can request that the data payload  of cloud provider A  be migrated to cloud provider C .","The data transport tool  can identify any replications of the data payload  on any resources associated with a data distribution service, staging area, or the like. For example, prior to migrating the data payload  from cloud provider A , the data transport tool  can identify the data payload  that was replicated in the staged data stores  of the data distribution service  and the data payload  that was replicated on the staged data stores  of the additional data distribution service . In aspects, the data transport tool  can perform the identification in response to receiving a request from an administrator. It should be appreciated that the data transport tools ,  or other logic can identify any replications of the data payload  on any resource of the network , or other components. In aspects, one or more replications of the data payload  can be stored on resources associated with target clouds, such as cloud provider B  and cloud provider C .","The data transport tool  can examine the data payloads ,  replicated on the data distribution service , the additional data distribution service , or other resources. In aspects, the data transport tool  can compare the data payload  in cloud provider A  with any of the replicated versions of the data payload ,  stored on either of the data distribution services , , to determine consistencies between or among the data payloads. For example, the data transport tool  can determine that the data payload  replicated in the staged data stores  is identical to the data payload  on cloud provider A . For further example, the data transport tool  can determine that the data payload  replicated in the staged data stores  is similar to the data payload  on cloud provider A . In aspects, the data transport tool  can identify any differences between data payloads and replicated versions of the data payloads. Further, in aspects, the data transport tool  can use any algorithm or technique to identify consistencies and\/or differences such as, for example, SQL data compare, checksumming or hash summing of data, checksumming or hash summing of indexes of data, using a RedGate tool, and other techniques. It should be appreciated that the data transport tool  can examine and identify any consistencies and\/or differences among any of the data payloads located in any cloud provider or replicated on any data distribution service.","In aspects, the data transport tool  can determine whether the data payload  in cloud provider A  needs to be or should be migrated to a target cloud, based on any consistencies with the replicated data payloads , . For example, the data transport tool  can determine that the data payload  stored on the staged data stores  meets or exceeds a consistency threshold, criteria, or other targets, with the data payload  in cloud provider A , and therefore that the data payload  in cloud provider A  need not be migrated to a target cloud. Instead, the data transport tool  can directly transport the data payload  stored in the staged data stores  to the specified target cloud.","In aspects, the data transport tool  can identify data payloads replicated or otherwise stored on any of the target clouds, such as cloud provider B  and cloud provider C . In response to determining that the data payload  on cloud provider A  is consistent with any of the replicated data payloads , , the data transport tool  can determine any consistencies between the replicated data payloads ,  and data payloads stored on the target clouds. It should be appreciated that the data transport tool  can employ any consistency determination algorithm or technique as described herein. If the data transport tool  determines that any of the data payloads stored on the target clouds is consistent with any of the replicated data payloads , , then the data transport tool  can determine that the replicated data payload ,  consistent with the target cloud data payload need not be transported to the target cloud because the target cloud already has a consistent data payload. Therefore, not only does the data payload  in cloud provider A  need not be transported to the data distribution services , , but the replicated data payloads ,  on the data distribution services ,  need not be transported to the target clouds, such as cloud provider B  and cloud provider C . As such, no transportation or migration of data is needed.","As an example, suppose an administrator of a financial institution desires to migrate a data payload in a source cloud to a target cloud, wherein the data payload comprises financial records of customers associated with the financial institution for the past five (5) years. The data transport tool  or other logic can located a replicated data payload on a data distribution service associated with the target cloud. Merely for example, the replicated data payload could have been replicated a few months prior to the administrator desiring to migrate the data payload. The data transport tool  can perform a consistency analysis on the data payload and the replicated data payload to determine that the two payloads are 90% consistent. If the administrator or another entity has set the consistency threshold at 95%, then the data transport tool  will not transport the replicated data payload to the target cloud, but will instead migrate the data payload from the source cloud to the target cloud. Alternatively, if the administrator or another entity has set the consistency threshold at 85%, then the data transport tool  can directly transport the replicated data payload stored on the data distribution service to the target cloud via, for example, a set of dedicated transport channels. This way, processing power, transport time, and other metrics and resources associated with retrieving the data payload from the source cloud can be eliminated. Further, a data distribution service provider can provide incentive to prospective customers by only charging the prospective customers once to move or replicate a data payload into the data distribution service, but then having the replicated data payload available for immediate transport to a target cloud.","It should be appreciated that any of the data transport tools ,  can determine to transport none, some, or all of any replicated data payloads based on any amount of consistencies between the data payload in the host cloud and the replicated data payloads. Further, it should be appreciated that any of the data transport tools ,  can migrate the data payload in the host cloud to the target cloud, via the respective data distribution services , , if the replicated data payloads do not meet a consistency threshold, or based on other factors. In aspects, the data transport tools ,  can encrypt and\/or decrypt the data payload during any transport or migration, and\/or establish secure communication channels among any entities associated with the data distribution services , . Further, in aspects, the data transport tools ,  can maintain a record of any consistency analysis performed on data payloads. This way, if data in the data payload  or the replicated data payloads ,  is updated subsequent to a consistency analysis, then the data transport tools ,  can only analyze the updated data, and incorporate the updated analysis with the recorded analysis.","In aspects, the data transport tool ,  or other logic can present, to an administrator or other entities, a result of the consistency analysis, between the data payload  in cloud provider A  with any of the replicated data payloads , , or data payloads in any of the target clouds. For example, the result of the consistency analysis can detail which part(s) of the data payloads is consistent and which part(s) of the data payloads is different. The administrator or other entity can analyze the result of the consistency analysis to determine if some or all of the replicated data payloads ,  can be transported to a target cloud in lieu of migrating the data payload  from cloud provider A  to the target cloud. In aspects, the analysis can be based on which parts of the data payloads are identical, similar, or different, or other factors. Further, in aspects, the result of the consistency analysis can be provided to an administrator via a graphical user interface of a client, or via other outlets.","In aspects, there can be multiple segments of a replicated data payload stored on multiple resources associated with a data distribution service. For example, the data payload  as illustrated in  can be replicated, divided, and stored as separate data blocks on both the staged data stores , . It should be appreciated that the data payload  can be replicated and\/or divided in any way, and stored on any combination of resources. Further, either of the data transport tools ,  can access and interface with any resources on which any segments of the replicated data payloads are stored, and can perform a consistency analysis on one or all of the segments, according to aspects as discussed herein.
