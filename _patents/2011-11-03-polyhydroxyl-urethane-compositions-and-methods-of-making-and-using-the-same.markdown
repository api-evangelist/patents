A polyurethane compound is any polymer composed of a chain of organic units joined by carbamate (\u2014NCOO\u2014) links. Polyurethanes are conventionally formed in the reaction of a diisocyanate and polyfunctional compounds typically containing numerous hydroxyl groups, such as a diol, in the presence of a catalyst. However, a disadvantage to this synthetic route is the use of monomers having numerous toxic isocyanate groups.","Recently, some attention has been focused on the synthesis of polyurethanes without the use of isocyanate groups through the reaction of a diamine and a molecule having one or more cyclic carbonate functional groups in the presence of a solvent and catalyst. This reaction results in compounds often referred to as polyhydroxy urethanes (PHUs) due to the presence of primary and\/or secondary hydroxyl functional groups.","One or more embodiments consistent with the present disclosure generally relate to a composition comprising a reaction product of: (1) one or more compounds having at least one cyclic carbonate group having one or more functional groups containing one or more carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; (2) one or more compounds having two or more thiol groups; and, (3) one or more compounds having two or more amine functional groups, in which a cross-linked poly(hydroxyl urethane) is produced.","Additional embodiments consistent with the present disclosure relate to processes to prepare a cross-linked poly(hydroxyl urethane) composition including the steps of: contacting (1) one or more compounds having at least one cyclic carbonate group having one or more functional groups containing one or more carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; (2) one or more compounds having two or more thiol groups; and, (3) one or more compounds having two or more amine functional groups.","Additional embodiments consistent with the present disclosure relate to methods of adhesively bonding two or more substrates to each other in which a cross-linked poly(hydroxyl urethane) composition as described above is applied to one or more substrates, which are subsequently contacted via the applied poly (hydroxyl urethane) composition.","One or more advantages consistent with the present disclosure are related to cross-linked PHUs that are easily accessible and tunable from carbonates and amines. The cross-linked PHUs are accessed via a single step reaction that is a modular and facile reaction between amines and multi-functional cyclic carbonates that are prepared from -thiol and -ene derivatives. Both reactions are atomically efficient and produce solid in high yields without the use of a solvent or catalyst. The synthetic routes presented herein are facile and represent a less toxic, non-isocyanate pathway to obtain polyurethane compositions. In addition, the synthetic approach allows for various properties to be tuned, including but not limited to glass transition temperature, modulus and content of hydroxyl compounds.","One or more embodiments consistent with the present disclosure provide a cross-linked poly(hydroxyl urethane) composition comprising a reaction product of: (1) one or more compounds having at least one cyclic carbonate group, wherein the cyclic carbonate comprises one or more functional groups having one or more carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; (2) one or more compounds having two or more thiol groups; and, (3) one or more compounds having two or more amine functional groups.","Another embodiment relates to a composition comprising a reaction product of: (1) one or more compounds having at least one cyclic carbonate group, wherein the cyclic carbonate comprises one or more functional groups having one or more carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; (2) one or more compounds having three or more thiol groups; and, (3) one or more compounds having two or more amine functional groups.","Another embodiment relates to a composition comprising a reaction product of: (1) one or more compounds having at least one cyclic carbonate group, wherein the cyclic carbonate comprises one or more functional groups having one or more carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; (2) one or more compounds having two or more thiol groups; and, (3) one or more compounds having three or more amine functional groups.","Another embodiment relates to a composition comprising a reaction product of: (1) one or more compounds having at least one cyclic carbonate group, wherein the cyclic carbonate comprises one or more functional groups having one or more carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; (2) one or more compounds having two or more thiol groups; and, (3) two or more compounds having two or more amine functional groups.

From the DSC analysis, PHU-1s have Tbetween 3 and 12\u00b0 C. The Tof PHUs produced with and without a catalyst (polymerization time=72 hours) are similar.

This trend indicates that the thermal stability of these crosslinked PHUs decreases due to increasing density of C\u2014S bond and qualitatively lower conversion is observed with increasing functionality.
