title: Amphibious antennas for providing near vertical incidence skywave communication
abstract: An amphibious antenna for providing Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication when grounded to a conductive fluid. The amphibious antenna has a support member for supporting a helix. The helix includes a first helical arm that is not insulated and grounded, when in use, through a conductive fluid into which the antenna is placed, and a second helical arm that is insulated from the conductive fluid.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to antennas and more particularly, to amphibious antennas for providing Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Tactical communications in the frequency range of 2\u201330 MHz take advantage of ionospheric propagation effects to gather or disseminate intelligence over large distances. In the 2\u201312 MHz range, one mode of ionospheric propagation (i.e., Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)) is used for distances shorter than long haul ionospheric skip (less than 800 km), but longer than the \u201cradio horizon\u201d distance at these frequencies (greater than 40 km).","Antennas used for NVIS communications are typically large resonant wire structures of various forms that include inverted Vees or horizontal dipole arrays. Depending on the frequency of operation, the beam patterns of these antennas are distinguished by a lobe that points directly over head (zenith) in order to affect NVIS mode communications.","There is a need for NVIS communication capabilities over sea as well as over land. Moreover, there is a need for an antenna structure that is collapsible, compact, and portable.","The present invention is a novel amphibious antenna for use in or over sea or on land. The antenna having a first helical arm that is insulated and a second helical arm that is un-insulated. The un-insulated helical arm providing a ground to a conductive fluid. The antenna provides Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication as well as some line-of-sight capability over land or sea when connected to a suitable manpack transceiver. Further, when the second helical arm of the antenna is placed in or near a conducting interface, such as sea water, the electromagnetic boundary conditions are such that cancellation of the radiation fields at low angles, relative to the horizon, is minimized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","18","13","10","11","12","11","12","14","11","12","11","12","14"]},"The support member  of the antenna  is preferably constructed from a lightweight insulating material, such as plastic. In a preferred embodiment, the support member is approximately 12 inches in diameter and 10 to 12 feet in length. In the preferred embodiment, the helical arms ,  are comprised of wide straps or ribbon shaped conductors instead of thin wire to allow enough surface for a good electrical connection to sea water, while simultaneously allowing for wide impedance bandwidth.","In use, a user places the antenna  in sea water. When the antenna  is deployed in sea water, the first helical arm  that is exposed and in contact with sea water provides the ground for the second helical arm or insulated portion  of the antenna .","When the antenna  is deployed over sea water, the first helical arm  that is exposed behaves as a grounding electrode for the second helical arm or insulated portion  of the antenna, allowing the antenna  to behave as a slow-wave transmission line antenna. The antenna is a slow-wave structure because the phase velocity along the axial direction of the antenna is smaller than the velocity in the direction occupied by the helical conductor; a function of a helical pitch angle. When the second helical arm  is placed in, on or near a conducting interface, such as sea water, the electromagnetic boundary conditions are such that cancellation of the radiation fields at low angles, relative to the horizon, is minimized. The second helical arm  formed by the connection to sea water has a broad beam pattern that extends over a considerable portion of the hemisphere, including zenith, permitting NVIS capability. The transmission lines for the antenna  (not shown) may be preferably attached to the first and second helical arms ,  by running the lines through the support member  and drilling a hole through the support member  wherein the lines may be attached directly to the first and second helical arms , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","11","12"]},"Referring to  an alternative embodiment of the antenna , comprises the antenna  being collapsible in length. The support member  is made up of a series of non-conducting cylindrical shells  of varying size for mechanical support with mechanical stops (not shown) that keep the shells from coming apart. The helical arms ,  are wound in the appropriate manner for its function (i.e., over the smaller diameter shells for support or within the larger shell assembly for insulation). When not in use, the antenna  is collapsible by pushing ends ,  of the antenna  toward each other or by compressing the antenna  flat, like an accordion. When the antenna  is required for operation, the ends ,  are moved away from each other or the antenna  is stretched open and manually deployed. In a preferred embodiment, the antenna  would comprise a length of about 15 feet when deployed and a length of approximately one-quarter to one-third of the deployed length when collapsed.","In summary, the antenna  according to the present invention is collapsible (in one embodiment), compact, lightweight, and manually deployed. The antenna  has dual mode (grounded and ungrounded).","The antenna  in the collapsible embodiment allows a user to carry the collapsed antenna  on his\/her back. When the antenna  is needed for use, the user moves the ends ,  of the antenna  away from each other, thereby manually deploying the antenna . In one embodiment, the antenna  is placed in seawater and powered up for use.","When the antenna  is needed but sea water is not available or when the antenna  cannot be submerged in sea water, the user moves the ends ,  of the collapsed antenna  away from each other, thereby manually deploying the antenna . The antenna  is then used over land or sea water. The antenna  uses a slow-wave structure to enable performance over land and the sea. The antenna  is unique in that it uses exposed and insulated conducting arms or helical arms ,  to affect a hybrid radiator for use over land or the sea.","After the antenna  is used in or over sea water, or over land, the antenna  is collapsible by pushing the ends ,  of the antenna  toward each other or by compressing the antenna  flat. The antenna  is compacted into a flat package, which a user can easily carry.","In an alternative embodiment wherein portability is not required, the antenna  may be integrated directly into a sea-craft, such as a raft or Zodiac. The antenna  may be made part of a floatation collar. Further, the antenna  can be placed into sea water during use and retracted when not in use. Alternatively, the antenna  can be used over sea water. Modifications and substitutions by one of ordinary skill in the art are considered to be within the scope of the present invention, which is not to be limited except by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood in view of the following description of the invention taken together with the drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
