{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention pertains to the technical field of telecommunications, and more particularly, to presence notifications intended for users of means of instant communications.","Internet development has brought about a great number of means of communication and collaboration which continue to develop: mailing lists, instant messaging, wikis, weblogs, e-mail, forums, etc.","In particular, instant messaging (IM) services have experienced explosive popularity. They have the particular feature that interactions between users are online and in real-time, thereby enabling an active dialogue, unlike other means of communication whose interactions are carried out off-line and with a delay. It should be noted that instant messaging services are sometimes designated by the terms chat and chatting.","Instant messaging is a computer system that enables the instant exchange of data (text, voice, visual, emoticons) between multiple remote terminals (computers. PDAs, and mobile telephones, for example) connected to the same network, most commonly the Internet.","As it has evolved, instant messaging has increasingly integrated features such as voice, video, and all sorts of collaborative applications (shared whiteboards, text editing, and gaming, for example.) To achieve this, instant messaging requires the use of a software application or web interface that connects to an instant messaging server. Instant messaging users therefore, in general, have an account associated with an instant messaging program or web interface such as Windows Live Messenger, Microsoft Office Communicator, or Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ\u2122, My Teamwork (published by Alcatel-Lucent), and MSN Web messenger.","Most instant messaging services offer a system for announcing presence and availability notifications in real time, which indicates the members who are online to interact with, as well as their availabilities, and sometimes even their mood. The announced presence status may also be explained, in order to indicate, for example, the cause of an unavailability: \u201cbusy (writing the report)\u201d, \u201cabsence (out to eat)\u201d, \u201cback in 10 minutes\u201d, \u201cdo not disturb\u201d, \u201con the phone\u201d, \u201cin a meeting,\u201d \u201cat the office\u201d.","By way of example, Windows Live Messenger offers a plurality of presence statuses symbolizing the availability of each of the contacts in a user's list. Each user may display his or her status, meaning his or her current activity: logged out, logged in, away, unavailable, invisible. Invisible status can be used to view the list of people logged in without becoming visible to one's contacts.","Presence management has proven particularly useful for users who can verify the status of their contacts before any attempt to contact them through instant messaging. In doing so, it makes it possible to simplify and encourage the establishment of communication.","By way of example, a user who has all members of his or her remote collaborative work team in his or her list, can tell the availability of his or her collaborators in real time and synchronize their interactions as a result.","Citable examples of presence management systems used by instant messaging services include DynamicSoft, Indigo Software, and Hotsip.","Other means of communication, offering the presence service, have been as successful as instant messaging services. This is particularly true of the latest generations of means of mobile communication and of social networking and microblogging tools (Twitter, Jaiku, Co-op, Yammer, and SocialCast).","Most social networking and microblogging tools enable a user to display indicators of his or her presence to his or her network. By way of example, a user can use short messages to inform his or her network of \u201cwhat he\/she is now doing.\u201d These messages are updated manually by the user, retrieved from an instant messaging service, or retrieved from other sources using an RSS feed.","Below, the term \u201cinstant means of communication\u201d shall designate all means of real-time communication, such as instant messaging services, means of mobile communication, and social networking and microblogging tools.","Presence management is deployed throughout the means of instant communications in a transparent manner, so that the status is displayed to the list of contacts in response to each change. In other words, if a user's presence status changes, for example, from logged out to logged in, from busy to available, or from invisible to absent, a notification indicating the new status is distributed to all or to some (selective distribution) of the contacts in the list. Thus, a user:\n\n","Consequently, presence notification management relates to:\n\n","In practice, presence management involves multiple problems, both for the generator and for the observer. This is because a user who has a plurality of contacts in his or her list may:\n\n","Furthermore, in general, a user's presence information in a social networking or microblogging tool are unchanged as long as the user does not edit them manually. Thus, a user registered for more than one means of instant communications is constrained to indicate his or her presence information as many times as there are means of communication for which he or she is registered.","The document WO 2008\/041830 describes one method enabling an observer to define rules dealing with the manner (grouped notifications) and time of reception (when the number of them is at least\/at most\/exactly equal to a predetermined number) of the presence notifications related to a set of contacts in his or her list. The observer receives a constructed notification once the rule is satisfied.","The presence notification management solution recently introduced by Wind Mobile is devoted to mobile telephones. It enables the user of a mobile telephone to assign him\/herself a presence status for some duration, and to net that period of time. A caller who unsuccessfully attempted to reach a called party with the status \u201cbusy\u201d will receive a notification once the called party's status is changed to \u201cavailable.\u201d","Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 allows an observer to label a contact from his or her list in order to be automatically informed of that person's availability.","The FriendFeed, aggregator, published by FriendFeed Inc, makes it possible to group together updates from several social network and microblogging tools (such as Twitter) and from several instant messaging services (such as Google Talk) for the purpose of separately displaying the most up-to-date presence information of users in Google Talk and Twitter, for example. However, this solution only relates to:\n\n","Thus, few methods and systems are known to ensure multi-criteria management of the presence notifications supported by the means of instant communications. Furthermore, these systems are very specific. They mainly relate to:\n\n","Consequently, known systems and methods are imperfect, particularly due to the absence of any management that would enable service that:\n\n","One object of the present invention is to remedy the aforementioned drawbacks. In particular, the invention aims to propose a method, system, and computer program product enabling unified, multi-criteria management of the presence notifications supported by the means of instant communications that propose the presence service.","To that end, according to a first aspect, the invention proposes a multicriteria method for managing presence notifications proposed by a means of instant communications comprising a non-empty list of contacts and connected to a presence server, which method comprises the following steps:\n\n","According to a second aspect, the invention proposes a multicriteria system for managing presence notifications proposed by a means of instant communications comprising a non-empty list of contacts and connected to a presence server, which system comprises the following means:\n\n","According to a third aspect, the invention pertains to a computer program product implemented on a memory medium, which may be implemented within a computer processing unit, and comprises instructions for implementing the method summarized above.","The invention enables multicriteria management of presence notifications to be sent or received by a means of instant communications incorporating the presence server, independently of the means of instant communications itself.","It particularly makes it possible to filter out the presence notifications to be broadcast or received with the help of rules defined by the user of the means of instant communications.","By way of nonlimiting examples, the rules may deal with: time, the new status, the change in status, the previous status, and the number of notifications coming from one or more contacts. These rules may concern one or more contacts simultaneously.","The invention is particularly applicable in the event that the user has a plurality of contacts in his or her contact list in a means of instant communications, and is heavily requested through it.","In the present description of the method and system for multi-criteria management of presence notifications supported by the means of instant communications, the assumption is made that a user has an account in a means  of instant communications, and has a non-empty contact list.","With reference to , the user connects by means  of instant communications via a user interface associated with it. By way of non-limiting examples, this user interface is:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","6"]},"The means  of instant communications makes it possible to establish a communication between two users via a communications network . The communications network  may be a heterogeneous communications networking operating multiple interconnected communications networks such as the Internet and the public land mobile network (PLMN). Generally speaking, the connection to the means  of instant communications is preceded by a step of authentication, with the assistance of a user name and password, or more generally speaking, an identifier.","The presence information offered by the means  of instant communications is generally retrieved\/transmitted from a presence server . The presence server  may be:\n\n","The present invention enables a user to define presence notification rules concerning one or more contacts. Whenever the rule is satisfied, a notification window appears to that user. The management of the notification's display is generally handled by the user interface of the means  of instant communications. It may take the form, for example:\n\n","In order to enable a user to define a rule for filtering presence notifications, at least the means  of instant communication is associated with a graphical interface for configuring rules, as shown in . This interface displays default rules, such as\n\n","In other words, the rules to be configured comprise rules that deal with:\n\n","It is clear that some rules assume that the contact(s) in question are already connected.","According to another rule configuration mode, it is also possible to pair the rule with a certain frequency of displaying presence notifications. By way of examples, one may:\n\n","The use may also associate a rule with a plurality of contacts, such as:\n\n","This type of rule may particularly apply in the context of remote collaborative work requiring the presence of a plurality of contacts.","In one variant, it is possible to pair of rule with the time. By way of example, a rule is to be applied only:\n\n","According to another mode of configuring the filtering rules, the user may define his or her own role, thereby making it possible to define more selective and more complex rules. For example, define a rule dealing with.\n\n","A notification is displayed to the observer once a rule is satisfied.","According to another variant, a notification is displayed to the user whenever there is a failure in establishing a communication with the contact. In other terms, whenever a user attempts to interact (requesting to turn on a webcam, to pick up, or to agree to receive data, for example) with a contact when the contact is not available, a notification appears, offering one or more appropriate dictated rules (in accordance with the current status of the contact and the user's request).","By way of example, whenever a user A requests a voice communication with a user B who appears in his or her list of contacts, while that user is already in a phone call and his or her current status is \u201cin a call\u201d (or \u201con the phone\u201d), a notification:\n\n","In particular, this notification does not appear when user A's request is satisfied, even if user B's status at the time of the request did not necessarily involve the satisfaction of that request. This may, for example, occur when:\n\n","Based on another variant illustrated in , a notification may display different actions to be activated by the user A, within the limits of the capacities and current configuration of the means of instant communication available to user A and to the contact. This notification displays the contact's new presence status as well as other actions such as: \u201ccall this contact\u201d, \u201cchange my status\u201d and \u201csend a message to this contact\u201d.","A user logged in to an instant messaging application that only allows text-based and voice-based communication does not display a visual communication option with a contact who has just logged in, for example, even if his or her means of instant communication which is compatible with that of user A supports visual communication.","According to another mode for associating actions with a rule, an action is automatically triggered once this rule is met. By way of example, the action of beginning a voice-based communication with a contact who currently has the status \u201cin a call\u201d once he or she has changed his or status, or the action of automatically changing my status to \u201cinvisible\u201d once a certain contact's status is \u201clogged in\u201d.","Furthermore, the notification generator (who was the originator of a notification reviewed by an observer) may manage the notifications to be transmitted to the presence server  and broadcast afterwards to his or her list of contacts or to social networking and microblogging tools.","Referring again to , the user of the means  of instant communications, as a generator, may configure personal presence messages, which will be broadcast, based, for example, on:\n\n","The presence information (personal message and\/or presence status) of a user is broadcast (information push) to social networking and microblogging tools (such as Twitter or Yammer) by means of application programming interfaces (APIs) such as the API offered by Twitter. This is because the means of instant communications automatically forwards the presence information to the social networking and microblogging tools, without these tools needing to search for them, via the corresponding application programming interfaces. This operation is commonly designated \u201cinformation push.\u201d This operation enables an automatic configuration of presence information.","A means of instant communication that supports a certain communication format (voice or visual, for example) and that has the tool appropriate to that format (headset\/microphone\/telephone, or webcam\/camera), can detect the state of that tool (available\/busy) and change the user's status accordingly. By way of example, once the user picks up a telephone associated with at least one means of instant communications, the user's status becomes \u201con the phone\u201d. Once the user hangs up the telephone, his or her status becomes \u201cphone call over\u201d or returns to the presence information that preceded that call.","A user may define different profiles for managing presence notifications. A profile comprises at least one configuration rule of received or sent notifications. This profile is saved so that it can be imported\/exported from one means  of instant communications to another -, as well as from one account to another within a single means  of instant communications offering the presence service.","Preferably, the rules for filtering the notifications and\/or the configuration of the presence statuses concerning a profile are stored in a file in a format compatible with most of the means - of instant communications.","In order to simplify the ability to access the functions offered by this multi-criteria management of presence notifications, it is preferable to add a \u201cNotify Me\u201d function to the appropriate menus of this service: by way of example, getting this function from among the functions accessible via right-clicking on a contact, or in a configuration menu.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The rules configured by the user act in the following manner:\n\n","The presence notifications, accompanied by the details relating to them, are, at least for a moment, recorded in a database. The details comprise the date of receipt and the contact.","It should be noted that the invention is not limited to the configuration described by . The implementation of the features proposed by the present invention shall be adapted to the capacities of the means  of instant communications (a mobile terminal, a web interface, an instant messaging application).","The management of presence notifications just described exhibits a certain number of advantages. In particular, it makes it possible to:\n\n","It should be noted that the presence information comprises the presence status and\/or a personal message. The personal message may comprise, by way of example, the explanation for an unavailability, the mood of the user, or more generally speaking, a comment.","At this point, it is important to note that the present invention is independent of the programming language used to implement these features.","It should be noted that the expression \u201cmeans of instant communications\u201d here designates any means of communications enabling an instant remote communication via a communication network, regardless of the form of the communication; text-based, voice-based, visual, or any combination of same."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"p":["Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become more clearly and completely apparent upon reading the description below of preferred embodiments, which is done with reference to the attached drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
