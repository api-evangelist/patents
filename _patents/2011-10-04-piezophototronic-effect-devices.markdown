The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to semiconducting devices and, more specifically, to a piezoelectric semiconductor device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Semiconductor devices are used in many different applications, including diodes, transistors, light emitting devices and sensing devices. While such semiconducting devices can be considerably more efficient than their macro-scale electrical counterparts, they still use a considerable amount of energy. Such energy usage can result in several disadvantageous phenomena, such as increased heat output and shortened battery life.","Therefore, there is a need for semiconducting structures with greater efficiency.","The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention which, in one aspect, is a semiconducting device that includes a piezoelectric structure that has a first end and an opposite second end.

No. 12\/945,077 filed Nov. 12, 2010 by Wang et al. discloses methods of making piezo-phototronic devices and is incorporated herein by reference.","As shown in , one embodiment of a piezoelectric semiconductor includes a light emitting device . This embodiment includes a piezoelectric structure  that can include, for example, ZnO, GaN, or a wurtzite structured material. In one embodiment, the piezoelectric structure  includes a ZnO nanowire. An ITO film  is deposited on an AlOsubstrate  and a conductor  is placed in electrical communication with both the ITO film  and the piezoelectric structure . Another AlOsubstrate  has an Mg-doped GaN film  deposited thereon. The piezoelectric structure  is affixed to the Mg-doped GaN film  by an attaching substance  and a conductor  is placed in electrical communication with the Mg-doped GaN film . A gap  is defined between the two AlOsubstrates  and  and it is bridged by the piezoelectric structure . The two AlOsubstrates  and  are affixed to a polyimide film  (such as Kapton). A clear rigid plate  (such as a sapphire plate) has a resilient pad  (such as a piece of polystyrene) affixed thereto. The transparent resilient layer  is placed against the piezoelectric structure . A force is applied to the polyimide film  by means of a metal rod , which causes differential bending of the piezoelectric structure , thereby maintaining a strain therein. When a voltage source  applies a potential between the electrical contacts  and , the device emits light.","In one experimental embodiment, the piezo-phototronic effect has been effectively utilized to enhance the external efficiency of an LED  fabricated using a single ZnO micro-\/nano-wire  on a GaN substrate . The emission light intensity and injection current at a fixed applied voltage has been enhanced by a factor of 17 and 4 after applying a 0.093% compressive strain, respectively, and the corresponding conversion efficiency was improved by a factor of 4.25. This is suggested arising from an effective increase in the local \u201cbiased voltage\u201d as a result of the band modification caused by piezopotential and the trapping of free carriers at the interface region in a channel created by the piezopotential near the interface. Furthermore, the piezoresistance and piezooptic (photoelastic) effects have been utilized to tune the light emitting intensity, spectra and polarization simultaneously. The piezo-phototronic effect can be effectively used for enhancing the efficiency of energy conversion in today's safe, green and renewable energy technologies.","A single ZnO micro-\/nanowire LED  was fabricated by manipulating a ZnO wire  on a trenched substrate. A Mg doped p-type GaN film  was epitaxially grown on a sapphire substrate  by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and was used to form a p-n junction with n-type ZnO wire . An ITO coated  sapphire substrate  was used as the cathode that was placed side-by-side with the GaN substrate  with a well-controlled gap . The ZnO wire  was placed across the gap  with a close contact with the GaN film . A transparent polystyrene (PS) tape  was used to cover the ZnO nanowire . A normal force was applied on the PS film  by an alumina rod  connected to a piezo nano-positioning stage (not shown). In this case, a compressive stress was applied uniformly normal to the interface between the side surface of the ZnO wire  and the GaN substrate surface . Such a compressive force along the a-axis of the ZnO wire  resulted in a tensile strain along the c-axis, the growth direction of the wire . In this embodiment, there was no transverse bending or twist on the wire  to ensure the stability of the p-n junction interface between the ZnO wire  and GaN substrate .","The external efficiency of an as-fabricated single wire LED was measured conservatively to be about 1.84% before applying a strain, which is as high as that for a single p-n junction based UV LED. To test the strain effect on a single ZnO wire LED, the experiment systematically investigated its output light intensity, electroluminescence spectra and polarization as the strain being applied. At a fixed applied bias above the turn-on voltage (3 V), the current and light emission intensity increased obviously with increase of the compressive strain. The significantly enhanced light intensity was also directly observed in optical images recorded by a CCD. The injection current and output light intensity were largely enhanced by a factor of 4 and 17, respectively, after applying a 0.093% a-axis compressive strain, indicating that the conversion efficiency was improved by a factor of 4.25 in reference to that without applying strain. This means that the external true efficiency of the LED can reach about 7.82% after applying a strain.","To confirm the validity of the observed data, the stability of the contact between ZnO wire and GaN was carefully examined by repeating the applied strain. Once the strain was retracted, the light emission intensity dropped back to the value observed at strain free case. A linear relationship observed in the enhancement factor with strain proved that a possible change in contact area between n- and p-side of the device was not responsible to the observed increase in efficiency.","As shown in , when the n-ZnO wire\/p-GaN substrate LED is under axial straining, two typical effects influence the output light intensity and spectra. One is the piezoresistance effect, which is caused by the change in bandgap and possibly density of states in the conduction band. This effect acts as adding a serial resistance to the LED. The second effect is the piezo-phototronic effect, which is about the tuning of the optoelectronic process at the interface using the piezopotential created along the ZnO wire. ZnO has a non-central symmetric crystal structure, in which the cations and anions are tetrahedrally coordinated. A straining on the basic unit results in a polarization of the cations and anions, which is the cause of the piezopotential inside the crystal. As for the ZnO (n-type)\u2014GaN (p-type) LED, a schematic diagram of its band structure is presented in . Since the size of the GaN substrate is much larger than that of the ZnO microwire, the strain in GaN is much smaller than that in ZnO, thus the focus is on the piezoelectric effect from ZnO. Under an assumption of no-doping or low-doping in ZnO for simplicity, numerically calculated piezopotential distribution in the ZnO microwire, as shown in , shows that a negative potential drop is created along its length when the ZnO microwire is under a-axis compressive strain. The finite doping in the wire may partially screen the piezoelectric charges, but it cannot totally eliminate the piezoelectric potential if the doping level is low, thus a dip in the band is possible. The low-doping in ZnO wire here is consistent with our experiment results because the ZnO wire is fabricated by a high-temperature thermal evaporation process using pure ZnO powders as the source. If the c-axis of the ZnO wire is pointing from the ITO side to the GaN side, as shown in , the effect of the local negative piezopotential at the ITO side is equivalent to applying an extra forward biased voltage on the device. Thus, the depletion width and internal field are reduced under this additional component of forward biased voltage. Subsequently, the injection current and emitting light intensity under the same externally applied forward voltage increase when the device is strained. Alternatively, if the c-axis of the ZnO wire is reversed and pointing away from the GaN side, the GaN side has a lower piezopotential, which is equivalent to applying an extra reversely biased voltage on the device. The depletion width and internal field are thus increased, resulting in a reduction of the injection current and emitting light intensity with the increase of the applied strain.","The light output of LED is proportional to the external efficiency and injection current. Meanwhile, the injection current across the p-n junction increases exponentially with the increase of the forward bias voltage (for V>>kT\/q) according to the Shockley equation. Therefore, the change in light emission intensity under strain can be described by):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","out"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u025b"}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u03a6","out"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"0"}}]}}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u025b"}},{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"0"}}]}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b7","ex"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u025b"}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b7","ex"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"0"}}]}}],"mo":"+"},{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","\u03c8"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"kT"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u025b"}}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":["ex","ex"]},"The enhancement factor for light emission was larger than that for the injection current, which means that the quantum efficiency was enhanced with the increase of strain according to the above equation. By solving Poisson equation with coupling piezoelectric effect, the enhancement of external efficiency may be caused by the localized positive piezopotential near GaN\/ZnO interface, which produces carrier trapping channels (as shown in ). Electrons and holes can be temporarily trapped and accumulated in the channels in the conduction and valance band, respectively. Since abundant electrons are available in ZnO, for instance, the efficiency of the LED is largely dominated by the local concentration of holes because of the high activation energy of the most commonly used acceptor dopants (Mg) in GaN (\u02dc200 meV). The trapped holes may increase the hole injection from p-GaN into n-ZnO, which increases the recombination efficiency of electrons and holes near the junction, resulting in a large increase in emission intensity. It is pointed out that, though the absolute values of the band offset varies in different reports, and is dependent on the fabrication process of the heterojunction, the band offset values do not affect the tendency of the band modification and the profile of the carrier trapping channel by piezopotential.","The peak positions of the four emission bands did not exhibit any appreciable shift under straining, but they did have obvious blue shift as the applied bias voltage was increased. The bandgap of ZnO decreases under compressive a-axis strain, while the bandgap of GaN also decreases under compressive c-axis strain. In this case, the peak position should have a red shift under compressive strain. On the other hand, the emission centers of the n-ZnO\/p-GaN LED have blue shift with the increase of injection current due to the band renormalization, band filling at high current and\/or the increased kinetic energies of electrons and holes. When these two complementary effects co-exist, one may balance the other, resulting in negligible shift in emission peaks. The change in refraction index of ZnO is also possible under strain, which is the photoelastic effect.","The performance of an LED is dictated by the structure of the p-n junction and the characteristics of the semiconductor materials. Once an LED is made, its efficiency is determined largely by the local charge carrier densities and the time at which the charges can remain at the vicinity of the junction. The latter is traditionally controlled by growing a quantum well or using a built-in electronic polarization for \u201ctrapping\u201d electrons and holes in the conduction and valance bands, respectively. Instead of using this pre-fabricated structure, the piezopotential is created in ZnO by strain to control the charge transport process at the ZnO\u2014GaN interface, demonstrating the first LED whose performance is controlled by piezoelectric effect. The emission intensity and injection current at a fixed applied voltage have been enhanced by a factor of 17 and 4 after applying a 0.093% compressive strain, respectively, and the corresponding conversion efficiency has been improved by a factor of 4.25 in reference to that without applying strain! And an external efficiency of 7.82% has been achieved. This significantly improved performance is not only attributed to the increase of injection current by the modification of the band profile, but also to the effect of the creation of a trapping channel for holes near the heterojunction interface, which greatly enhances the external efficiency. An increase in UV-to-visible ratio and stabilization of the peak position show that the spectrum quality is improved by external straining. In addition, the polarization of the output light has been modulated by the piezooptic effect. This discovery is important not only for exploring the piezo-phototronic effect through a three-way coupling among mechanical, electronic and optical properties, but also can largely improve the efficiency and performance of LEDs and the design of a large range of optoelectronic devices based on ZnO and GaN with the use of their piezoelectric property.","In another embodiment, as shown in , the device may be configured as a photo detector . An experimental version of this embodiment includes a metal-semiconductor-metal structure (MSM). The contacts  and  at the two ends of the semiconductor wire  are two back-to-back Schottky contacts. The device was fabricated by bonding a ZnO micro\/nanowire  laterally on a polystyrene (PS) substrate , which has a thickness much larger than the diameter of the ZnO micro\/nanowire . The mechanical behavior of the device was dominated by the substrate by considering the relative size of the wire  and the substrate . Strain was induced in the nanowire  by two strain-inducing structures  that were coupled to opposite ends of the PS substrate . A bias voltage from a voltage source  was applied to the contacts  and . The strain in the wire  was mainly axial compressive or tensile strain depending on the bending direction of the PS substrate , and it was quantified by the maximum deflection of the free end of the substrate. Monochromatic UV, blue and green light  from a light source  illuminated the ZnO wire  to test the performance of the device. The photocurrent flowing through the nanowire  was a function of the intensity of the light  and the strain induced in the nanowire .","The ZnO micro\/nanowires used in one experimental embodiment were synthesized by a high-temperature thermal evaporation process. A single ZnO wire  was bonded on a PS substrate  (typical length of about 7 cm, a width of about 15 mm and thickness of 0.5 mm) with silver paste. A very thin layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (not shown) was used to package the device, which kept the device mechanically robust under repeated manipulation and prevented the semiconductor wire from contamination or corrosion. A 3D stage  with movement resolution of 1 \u03bcm was used to bend the free end of the device to produce a compressive and tensile strain. Another 3D stage  was used to fix the sample under microscope and to keep the device in focus during the substrate bending process.","A Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope system was used to monitor the sample and excite the photodetector. A Nikon Intensilight C-HGFIE lamp with a remote controller was used as the excitation source . Monochromatic UV (centered at 372 nm), blue (centered at 486 nm) or green light (centered at 548 nm) was illuminated on the ZnO wire to test the performance of the device, which was focused by a 10\u00d7 microscope objective with a 17.5 mm work distance. Monochromatic light was obtained by a filter block between the source and microscope objective. There were three sets of filter blocks which used to obtain monochromatic UV, blue and green light. The optical power density impinging on the nanowire photodetector was varied by means of neutral density filters. The illumination density was determined by a thermopile power meter (Newport 818P-001-12). I-V measurement was obtained by applying an external bias to the wire and recorded using a Keithley 487 picoammeter\/voltage source in conjunction with a GPIB controller (National Instruments GPIB-USB-HS, NI 488.2). In order to compare and analyze the results, time dependent photocurrent, light intensity dependent photocurrent and photocurrent used for analyzing responsivity and strain effects were measured at a fixed applied bias of \u22125 V from the voltage source .","As shown in , the photocurrent increased linearly with the optical power and showed no saturation at high power levels, offering a large dynamic range from sub-\u03bcW\/cmto mW\/cm.

This is the piezoresistance effect, which is symmetric and has equal effects regardless the polarity of the voltage. The asymmetric change of I-V curve at negative and positive bias in our case is dominated by piezoelectric effect rather than piezoresistance effect. The effect of piezopotential to the SBH can be qualitatively described as follows. For a constant strain of \u03b5along the length of the wire, an axial polarization P=\u03b5eoccurs, where eis the piezoelectric tensor. A potential drop of approximately V\u2212V=\u03b5Leis along the length of the wire, where L is the length of the wire. Therefore, the modulations to the SBH at the source and drain sides are of the same magnitude but opposite sign (V=\u2212V), which are denoted by \u0394\u03c6and \u0394\u03c6(\u0394\u03c6=\u2212\u0394\u03c6).","This embodiment includes a piezopotential tuned low dark-current ultrasensitive ZnO wire photodetector. The device remains low dark current characteristics while increasing the responsivity dramatically for pW level light detection by piezopotential. The derived change of barrier height with strain depends on excitation light intensity, the SBH changes faster at low light intensity than that at high light intensity. The physical mechanism is explained by considering both piezopotential effect and photon generated free charges screening effect. Three-way coupling of semiconducting, photonic and piezoelectric properties of semiconductor nanowires will allow tuning and controlling of electro-optical process by strain induced piezopotential, which is the piezo-phototronic effect, and it will also lead to further integration between piezoelectric devices with microelectronic and optomechanical systems.","Another embodiment, as shown in , includes a switching structure  that behaves like a transistor. The piezotronic transistor structure  includes a metal \u2014nanowire \u2014metal  structure that is biased by a voltage source . The metal portions  and  can include metals such as Au or Ag. In one embodiment, the nanowire  includes ZnO. The principle of the piezotronic transistor is to control the carrier transport at the M-S interface through a tuning at the local contact by creating a piezopotential at the interface region in the semiconductor by applying a strain. This structure is different from a typical MOS design, in that the externally applied gate voltage is replaced by an inner crystal potential generated by piezoelectric effect, thus, the \u201cgate\u201d electrode can be eliminated. This means that the piezotronic transistor needs only two leads: drain and source. Secondly, the control over channel width is replaced by a control at the interface. Since the current transported across an M-S interface is the exponential of the local barrier height at the reversely biased case, the ON and OFF ratio can be rather high due to the non-linear effect. Finally, a voltage controlled device is replaced by an external strain\/stress controlled device, which is likely to have complimentary applications to CMOS devices.","The device  under tensile strain is shown in  and the device  under compressive strain is shown in . When a ZnO nanowire device is under strain, there are two typical effects that may affect the carrier transport process. One is the piezoresistance effect because of the change in band gap, charge carrier density and possibly density of states in the conduction band of the semiconductor crystal under strain. This effect is a symmetric effect on the two end contact and has no polarity, which will not produce the function of a transistor. Piezoresistance is a common feature of any semiconductors such as Si and GaAs and is not limited to the wurtzite family. The other is the piezoelectric effect because of the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry, which has an asymmetric or non-symmetric effect on the local contacts at the source and drain owing to the polarity of the piezopotential. In general, the negative piezopotential side raises the barrier height at the local contact of metal n-type semiconductor, possibly changing a Ohmic contact to Schottky contact, a Schottky contact to \u201cinsulator\u201d contact; while the positive piezopotential side lowers the local barrier height, changing a Schottky contact to an Ohmic contact. But the degree of changes in the barrier heights depends on the doping type and doping density in the nanowire. The piezoelectric charges are located at the ends of the wire, thus they directly affect the local contacts. The piezotronic effect is likely limited to the wurtzite family such as ZnO, GaN, CdS and InN. The polarity of the piezopotential can be switched by changing tensile strain to compressive strain. Thus, the device can be changed from a control at source to a control at drain simply by reversing the sign of strain applied to the device.","The above described embodiments, while including the preferred embodiment and the best mode of the invention known to the inventor at the time of filing, are given as illustrative examples only.
