abstract: The invention provides microcavity plasma devices and arrays that are formed in layers that also seal the plasma medium, i.e., gas(es) and/or vapors. No separate packaging layers are required and additional packaging can be omitted if it is desirable to do so. A preferred microcavity plasma device includes first and second thin layers that are joined together. A half ellipsoid microcavity or plurality of half ellipsoid microcavities is defined in one or both of the first and second thin layers, and electrodes are arranged with respect to the microcavity to excite a plasma within said microcavities upon application of a predetermined voltage to the electrodes. A method for forming a microcavity plasma device having a plurality of half or full ellipsoid microcavities in one or both of first and second thin layers is also provided by a preferred embodiment. The method includes defining a pattern of protective polymer on the first thin layer. Powder blasting forms half ellipsoid microcavities in the first thin layer. The second thin layer is joined to the first layer. The patterning can be conducted lithographically or can be conduced with a simple screen.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention was made with Government assistance under U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant Nos. F49620-03-1-0391 and AF FA9550-07-1-0003. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention is in the field of microcavity plasma devices, also known as microdischarge devices or microplasma devices.","Microcavity plasma devices produce a nonequilibrium, low temperature plasma within, and essentially confined to, a cavity having a characteristic dimension d below approximately 500 \u03bcm. This new class of plasma devices exhibits several properties that differ substantially from those of conventional, macroscopic plasma sources. Because of their small physical dimensions, microcavity plasmas normally operate at gas (or vapor) pressures considerably higher than those accessible to macroscopic devices. For example, microplasma devices with a cylindrical microcavity having a diameter of 200-300 \u03bcm (or less) are capable of operation at rare gas (as well as Nand other gases tested to date) pressures up to and beyond one atmosphere.","Such high pressure operation is advantageous. An example advantage is that, at these higher pressures, plasma chemistry favors the formation of several families of electronically-excited molecules, including the rare gas dimers (Xe, Kr, Ar, . . . ) and the rare gas-halides (such as XeCl, ArF, and KrF) that are known to be efficient emitters of ultraviolet (UV), vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), and visible radiation. This characteristic, in combination with the ability of microplasma devices to operate in a wide range of gases or vapors (and combinations thereof), offers emission wavelengths extending over a broad spectral range. Furthermore, operation of the plasma in the vicinity of atmospheric pressure minimizes the pressure differential across the packaging material when a microplasma device or array is sealed.","Research by the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has resulted in news microcavity plasma device structures as well as applications. As an example, semiconductor fabrication processes have been adapted to produce large arrays of microplasma devices in silicon wafers with the microcavities having the form of an inverted pyramid. Arrays with 250,000 devices, each device having an emitting aperture of 50\u00d750 \u03bcm, have been demonstrated with a device packing density and array filling factor of 10cmand 25%, respectively. Other microplasma devices have been fabricated in ceramic multilayer structures, photodefinable glass, and Al\/AlOstructures.","Microcavity plasma devices developed over the past decade have a wide variety of applications. An exemplary application for a microcavity plasma device array is to a display. Since the diameter of single cylindrical microcavity plasma devices, for example, is typically less than 200-300 \u03bcm, devices or groups of devices offer a spatial resolution that is desirable for a pixel in a display. In addition, the efficiency of a microcavity plasma device can exceed that characteristic of conventional plasma display panels, such as those in high definition televisions.","Early microcavity plasma devices exhibited short lifetimes because of exposure of the electrodes to the plasma and the ensuing damage caused by sputtering. Polycrystalline silicon and tungsten electrodes extend lifetime but are more costly materials and difficult to fabricate.","Large-scale manufacturing of microcavity plasma device arrays benefits from structures and fabrication methods that reduce cost and increase reliability. Previous work conducted by some of the present inventors has resulted in thin, inexpensive metal\/metal oxide arrays of microcavity plasma devices. Metal\/metal oxide lamps are formed from thin sheets of oxidized electrodes, are simple to manufacture and can be conveniently fabricated by mass production techniques such as roll-to-roll processing. In some manufacturing techniques, the arrays are formed by oxidizing a metal screen, or other thin metal sheet having cavities formed in it, and then joining the screen to a common electrode. The metal\/metal oxide lamps are light, thin, and can be flexible.","The invention provides ellipsoidal microcavity plasma devices and arrays that are formed in layers that also seal the plasma medium, i.e., gas(es) and\/or vapors. No separate packaging layers are required and, therefore, additional packaging can be omitted if it is desirable to do so. A preferred microcavity plasma device includes first and second thin layers that are joined together. A half ellipsoid microcavity or plurality of half ellipsoid microcavities is present in one or both of the first and second thin layers and electrodes are arranged with respect to the microcavity to excite a plasma within the microcavities upon application of a predetermined voltage to the electrodes. In preferred embodiments, the ellipsoidal microcavities are formed in glass. In other embodiments, the ellipsoidal microcavities are formed in other materials that are transparent to a wavelength of interest, including many types of ceramics and polymers.","A method for forming a microcavity plasma device having a plurality of half or fill ellipsoid microcavities in one or both of the first and second thin layers is also provided by a preferred embodiment. The method includes defining a pattern of protective polymer on the first thin layer. Powder blasting forms half ellipsoid microcavities in the first and\/or second thin layers. The second thin layer is joined to the first layer. The patterning can be conducted lithographically or can be conduced with a simple screen.","The invention provides microcavity plasma devices and arrays having ellipsoidal microcavities fabricated in glass or other materials, such as ceramic or polymer materials, that are transparent at the wavelength(s) of interest. Devices and arrays of the invention are extremely robust and inexpensive to fabricate. Microcavities are formed in thin layers, which are transparent and can be flexible. As the microcavities are formed directly in transparent material and preferred arrays are completed upon a hard sealing of the two transparent sheets, no further packaging of the array is necessary. The packaging layer that seals vapor(s) and\/or gas(es) into the microcavities is realized by the same sheet that serves as the substrate in which the microcavities are formed.","The invention also provides powder blasting methods of manufacturing microcavity plasma devices and arrays of microcavity plasma devices. Microcavities having an ellipsoidal (\u201cegg shell\u201d or \u201chalf egg shell\u201d) geometry are produced in thin sheets of glass, ceramics or polymers by an inexpensive nanopowder blasting technique that allows for considerable control over the cavity cross-section. Methods of the invention can produce large arrays of microplasma devices that substantially consist of a pair of thin glass, ceramic or polymer sheets.","A preferred microcavity plasma device includes first and second thin layers that are joined together. A half ellipsoid or full ellipsoidal microcavity (or plurality of half ellipsoid or full ellipsoidal microcavities) is defined, and one or both of the first and second thin layers and electrodes are arranged with respect to the microcavity to excite a plasma within said microcavities upon application of a predetermined voltage to the electrodes.","A method for forming a microcavity plasma device having a plurality of half or full ellipsoid microcavities in one or both of first and second thin layers is also provided by a preferred embodiment. The method includes defining a pattern of protective polymer on the first thin layer. Powder blasting forms half ellipsoid microcavities in the first and, if desired, second thin layers. The second thin layer is joined to the first layer. The patterning can be conducted lithographically or can be conduced with a simple screen.","Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale, which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments, artisans will recognize broader aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B"],"b":["10","12","14","14","12","14","14","12","12","14","14","14","14","16","18","14","14","12","10","16","18","16","18","10","16","18","14","14","16","18","12"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b","a","b ","a","b ","a","b","a","b"]},"The sheets and can be very thin, the thickness being limited only by the ability to handle large sheets during manufacturing. In example prototype glass arrays produced in the laboratory, the thickness tof each glass sheet was nominally 600 \u03bcm to 1 mm. It is expected that glass sheets at least as thin as 300 \u03bcm will also be acceptable. Typical major diameters (height or vertical dimension) (2\u00d7t) of the egg-shaped microcavities  were 100 \u03bcm to 1 mm in the laboratory experiments. Typical minor diameters t(width or horizontal dimension) of the central region of the microcavities , which is the characteristic dimension of the microcavities, were in the range of 10-500 \u03bcm. The dimensions labeled d, d, and drepresent, respectively, the transverse width of an ellipsoidal cavity , and the horizontal and vertical spacing between adjacent rows and columns of cavities  in the array .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C"],"b":["20","12","14","20","20","22","22","20","20","12","20","22","2","12"],"sub":["2","3","2"]},"The steps discussed above are repeated to produce an identical microcavity array pattern in another glass substrate, and the two glass substrates are joined as the cavities are filled with the desired gas or vapor and sealed to produce the array . In another variation, the second glass sheet does not have any microcavities, but is a plain glass sheet with the electrode . The microcavities in such a case possess a \u201chalf-egg\u201d shape, but can also support plasma generation. Indeed, experiments with \u201chalf-ellipsoidal\u201d microcavity plasma devices show them to produce an intense glow that is more spatially localized (around the axis transverse to the glass sheets) than is the case with full ellipsoids.","Higher resolution and more precise spacing are offered by a preferred embodiment fabrication process that is illustrated in . The process begins as in , with a glass sheet  having an electrode  on one side. As mentioned above, the electrodes can also be formed at any other time in the fabrication process, including after the joining of the two glass sheets together. In , photoresist  has been patterned onto the glass sheet  by conventional deposition, development, and chemical etching steps. The photoresist pattern is defined such that the photoresist represents the areas in which powder blasting will occur and openings  between the photoresist are areas which will be protected during the powder blasting process. In , the openings  are filled with a UV curable protective polymer  that is strongly resistant to the nanopowder blasting process. It is advantageous to use UV curable polymers that are soft (having high tension). In , the polymer  and photoresist  are planarized, and in  the polymer  is first UV cured. Powder blasting then removes the photoresist easily and proceeds to etch the microcavities  in the glass sheet . The photoresist  is easily removed by the micro blasting process so that, when the blasting step begins, etching of the glass surface takes place only at those locations where the photoresist exists. In , the polymer is removed, leaving an array of microcavities in the glass sheet . The process of  permits the pattern of the array and the dimensions of individual microcavities to be specified photolithographically.","Fabrication methods of the invention enable reproducible tailoring of the microcavity cross-sectional geometry for the purpose of achieving a desired electric field profile within the cavity. As an example, prolonging the powder blasting produces a pronounced tapering of the half-cavity being formed. This has been demonstrated experimentally, and such tapering has the effect of accentuating the electric field in this region when the two half-cavities are bonded together and a voltage is applied to the electrodes. In an experimental example, cavities with a pronounced taper were produced with an electric field that is much weaker along the vertical axis (major diameter) of the cavity than near the walls of the microcavity at its central region near the minor diameter (walls intersected by the minor diameter. If the powder blasting step is intentionally shortened in time, the cavity sidewalls will be nearly vertical at the mid-plane of the cavity, resulting in an electric field profile that is much more spatially uniform.","The aspect ratio of blasted microcavities is also dependent on the pressure of the blasting process, the type of powder material used in the blasting, and the type of masking materials used in the fabrication. Typical values of the aspect ratio (depth to width) of the microcavity can be range between 1:1 and 3:1. Such aspect ratios can be achieved with a pressure of about 30 psi to 120 psi.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 3F-3J","FIG. 3F","FIG. 3G","FIG. 3F","FIG. 3H","FIG. 3G","FIG. 3I","FIG. 3J","FIG. 2C","FIG. 3D"],"b":["31","31","31","14","22","31","31","22","31"],"i":["a","b ","a ","a ","a","b "]},"Additional embodiment microcavity plasma device arrays are realized with alternative electrode placements and patterns and other variations.

While not shown in , the electrode  could also be formed in a similar recess. The recess  serves to reduce the electrode-microcavity gap.  shows a similar arrangement, but in  the recess is shaped to have a contour that mimics the shape of the microcavities . The  arrangement also reduces the electrode-microcavity gap, and the contour of the electrode  near the microcavities  changes the electric field applied by the electrode  so as to be more uniform within the lower portion of the ellipsoidal microcavity than is the case with the electrode structure of . The reason for the difference is that, in  the thickness of the glass separating the electrode  at the base of the ellipsoid from the microcavity  is approximately constant. In contrast, in  the glass thickness between the electrode and the microcavity wall changes along the base of the microcavity, thereby adversely impacting discharge uniformity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 5 and 6"],"b":["16","18","36","14","14","16","18","36"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The embodiments illustrated in  can be made to be addressable by patterning one or both of the electrodes , .

Experimental devices in accordance with the  half ellipsoid shaped cavity produce intense plasmas that are strongly localized near the vertical axis of the cavity. In the  half ellipsoid embodiment, the top glass layer can be particularly thin since the top glass layer acts only as a packaging layer and does not have any portion of the microcavities existing within the layer. With the half ellipsoid arrangement, the overall thickness of a glass microcavity plasma device array can be very small, e.g., 100-200 \u03bcm or less. Generally, the central electrode devices that have a central electrode disposed in a plane intersecting the microcavities  have lower ignition voltages than devices and arrays only having electrodes disposed in planes that are adjacent to the microcavities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIGS. 12A and 12B","FIG. 3"],"b":["14","14","12","12","42","12","12","42","14","14"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b","a ","b "]},"In a variation of the  device (or of other devices of the invention), the electrode  is deposited on the internal wall of the half-egg microcavity , and protected and isolated from plasma by an additional dielectric layer , as shown in . The dielectric layer  can be omitted to permit DC operation, but use of a dielectric layer  is strongly preferred to isolate the electrodes from plasma generated in the microcavities. As seen in , phosphor  can be deposited into shallow depressions  registered above the microcavities . The quasi-spherical depressions  can also be etched chemically or powder blasted. These depressions can serve as a lens to collimate the radiation emerging from the microcavity  and simultaneously keep the phosphor below the plane of the surface for protective purposes.
