{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Continuation-in-Part of application Ser. No. 12\/213,892, filed Jun. 26, 2008.","The present invention relates to embodiments of a syringe-attached topical anesthetic dispenser. Syringes are employed millions of times daily all over the world to inject medicines into people as well as animals. Many times, injections are made in areas of the body that are somewhat less sensitive to pain. Other locations of the body where injections are contemplated are significantly more sensitive to pain and the patient feels a pinching sensation that may be quite painful as the syringe needle is inserted beneath the skin. Such areas include, for example, areas of the face such as the forehead as well as the lips.","Use of cosmetic injections into the face of a patient has become more and more common. Thus, for example, a chemical known by the Trademark BOTOX\u00ae is often injected into the face, particularly into a patient's forehead, to paralyze the subcutaneous muscles and temporarily eliminate visible wrinkles in the forehead. Such injections typically last several months at most and must be repeated over and over again, periodically, to maintain the non-wrinkled appearance.","Similarly, filler materials are often used, for example, within a patient's lips, to expand their size in keeping with the desires of the patient. Such dermal fillers include those sold under the Trademarks JUVEDERM\u00ae, RESTYLANE\u00ae and RADIESSE\u00ae.","When such chemicals are injected, typically to reduce pain associated with such injections, two options are employed. A first option is the use of a topical numbing cream applied to the area where the injection will take place. Typically, topical numbing creams require 40 minutes to 1 hour with occlusion to successfully numb the skin to a sufficient degree to render the subsequent injections painless. The second technique involves the use of numbing medicines such as LIDOCAINE\u00ae. However, the use of numbing medicines such as LIDOCAINE\u00ae is less preferred because it also requires needle injection through the skin which is not only painful, but can also distort the surrounding area, thereby making determination of the amount of filler to be subsequently placed more difficult. Additionally, injection of LIDOCAINE\u00ae may dilute the particles of subsequently injected BOTOX\u00ae making it easier for the BOTOX\u00ae substance to travel to distant locations and paralyze muscles the patient did not want to have paralyzed.","Additional methods of pre-injection cooling of the skin and associated tissues are also employed. For example, plain ice or ice-packed devices may be placed onto the skin and held there for a short period of time to numb the skin. Use of ice or ice-packed devices is inefficient and initially painful for the patient. Such devices must be placed onto the skin and held there for a short time and then must be removed with one hand and moved away from the patient by passing to an assistant or using some other technique. When these techniques are employed, often the physician is holding the ice pack which causes the physician's hand to be cooled and reduces effectiveness of the use of that hand. When the physician is injecting cosmetic medicines, one hand is used to work the syringe and the other is used to tense the skin, that is, to move the skin away from the muscle or palpate a bony landmark to aid in locating the proper place to inject the medicine. Use of ice can be messy and cold water resulting from melting of the ice can drip over the area to be injected. Use of ice, whether exposed or packed, limits the effectiveness of the physician who needs to have both hands available for the injection as explained above.","Another way to cool the area of the injection is to use a device consisting of a hose attached to an air cooling machine that blows cold air at the face. One such device is known by the Trademark SMARTCOOL\u00ae. Such devices are expensive and often the patient complains that, as the cold air is blown at the face, it takes their breath away as quickly moving air rushes by their nose. Additionally, the surface area cooled by a SMARTCOOL\u00ae device is often significantly greater than necessary to numb an anticipated injection.","Each of these prior art techniques used preliminary to an injection in a sensitive area of a patient such as on the face has its problems as explained above. The present invention was developed, keeping these problems in mind, and in an effort to provide a new technique to prepare a sensitive area of the human body to receive a cosmetic injection while avoiding messiness, pain, inconvenience, and expense. It is with these thoughts in mind that the present invention was developed.","Applicant is aware of the following prior art references:","U.S. Pat. No. 3,605,742 to Tibbs teaches a painless injection device which includes means for spraying a cooling fluid onto an injection site to numb the area prior to injection. The Tibbs device is extremely cumbersome including a large housing enclosing a syringe as well as the numbing device. An additional problem with Tibbs is that the needle path is not visible until the mechanism latch is released to expose the syringe bottom and attached needle. The actual depth of penetration of the needle appears to be set by the action of a spring which is not a sufficiently precise enough structure to allow placement of substances such as BOTOX\u00ae medicament or subcutaneous fillers. Additionally, the Tibbs device is clumsy since it has one depressor mechanism to express the syringe from the housing using a spring device and then a further attachment to the plunger end to deliver the medicament into the tissues. This may lead to imprecise placement of either the needle tip location or the desired depth of medicament dispersal, or both.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,725,265 to Sairenji discloses a syringe having an attached cooling gas injection nozzle for injecting a cooling gas onto skin where an injection is to take place. The gas is a vapo-coolant and the device includes a retractable rigid nozzle that is spring activated and serves as a conduit for spraying the vapo-coolant. The spring activation of the Sairenji device requires a second hand to disengage the downward position of the nozzle. Furthermore, Sairenji discloses a chamber into which the desired medicament is filled for injection into the patient, rather than a pre-filled disposable syringe. The Sairenji device is not practical for use where multiple sequential injections in spaced locations are contemplated. This is because all of the actions necessary to cause dispensing of the vapo-coolant then the injection make the Sairenji device extremely cumbersome and complicated.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,419 to Seney discloses a syringe including a distal portion containing a freezable chemical designed to engage the surface of the skin where an injection is to take place to cool that portion of the skin. Seney also discloses that it is known in the prior art to spray ethyl chloride onto a location of the skin as a topical anesthetic. However, Seney fails to teach or suggest dispensing a topical anesthetic by a device attached to a disposable syringe in the manner contemplated by the present invention.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,412 to Saied et al. discloses an apparatus and method for painless intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. In the Saied et al. device, a numbing agent is injected subcutaneously using a needle. The present invention improves upon the Saied et al. device by providing a topical dispensing of a numbing agent so that the pain inflicted on the patient by injecting the numbing agent is completely eliminated.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,936,028 to Hommann et al. discloses a cooling device for an injection apparatus. The Hommann et al. device is somewhat similar to that of Seney as including a cooling element surrounding the location where the syringe will be inserted, which cooling element is placed on the skin to cool it and numb it prior to the injection.","The present invention improves upon the teachings of the prior art described above by providing a simple spraying mechanism for spraying a topical anesthetic onto the skin where an injection is to take place using a disposable and sometimes pre-filled syringe.","The present invention relates to embodiments of a syringe-attached topical anesthetic dispenser. The present invention includes the following interrelated objects, aspects and features:","(1) In a first aspect, the present invention in its preferred intended use is intended to be releasably attachable to a pre-filled disposable syringe. Of course, if desired, the syringe may be initially empty and require filling prior to injection.","(2) In a first embodiment, a clip is provided that includes a first opening sized to receive the barrel of the syringe. That opening may be formed in a clip portion that is resilient and includes a longitudinally open slot allowing the syringe barrel to be inserted laterally into the opening. Alternatively, the syringe barrel may also be inserted into the opening of the clip portion longitudinally. In either case, it is preferred that the longitudinally extending opening in the clip portion has a width less than the diameter of the barrel of the syringe so that if the syringe is being attached to the clip portion through lateral movement, the flexibility of the clip portion allows the longitudinal opening to be temporarily enlarged until the largest diameter portion of the syringe barrel passes the opening, whereupon the resiliency of the clip portion causes it to spring back and retain the syringe barrel within its opening.","(3) In the first embodiment of the present invention, the clip includes a receptacle portion sized to closely receive a pre-filled canister of a topical numbing agent such as, for example, ethyl chloride. Typically, the pre-filled canister includes a generally cylindrical chamber portion receivable within the receptacle portion of the clip and a distal neck portion having an outlet that may be opened by piercing a disc-like closure, thereby allowing the contents of the canister to be dispensed.","(4) A dispenser is attached to the distal neck portion of the canister. In the first embodiment, the dispenser includes an elongated flexible tube attached to the distal neck portion of the canister and surrounded by a rigid tube for at least a portion of its length. A pivotable lever carries a tube compressor including a pinching member extending through an opening in the rigid tube and spring biased to a position at which it pinches closed the elongated passageway through the flexible tube. The elongated actuating lever is spring biased to a position at which the flexible tube is pinched closed.","(5) Preferably, the flexible tube protrudes distally of the rigid tube and is made of a suitable material allowing the distal end of the flexible tube to be bent and configured to aim the topical anesthetic at a desired location on the skin of the user. If desired, a nozzle may be provided at the distal end of the flexible tube designed to cause the topical anesthetic to be sprayed in a desired spray pattern.","(6) In a second embodiment of the present invention, a pair of clips releasably receive the barrel of a hypodermic syringe. The clips are attached to an elongated housing including a chamber sized to receive a canister of a topical anesthetic.","(7) The housing is preferably formed by two halves defining a longitudinal split therebetween so that they are assembled together along the split to create the chamber receiving the canister. The canister preferably is of the aerosol type and includes an actuator for actuating an internal valve and consisting of an elongated tube having an axis of elongation along which an outlet passageway is formed. When the actuator is pushed into the canister, the valve is opened allowing release of the topical anesthetic within the canister.","(8) In the second embodiment, a nozzle is fluidly connected to the actuator of the canister in such a way that the nozzle has a bore therethrough aligned with the passageway through the canister valve actuator so that when the canister valve is opened, topical anesthetic may flow through the outlet passageway in the actuator, and thence through the passageway in the nozzle to a reduced diameter outlet nozzle.","(9) At the end of the housing remote from the nozzle, an actuator button is provided that includes a stem engaging the closed end of the canister. When the button is depressed, the canister is caused to move in the same direction as the actuator stem. With the nozzle fixed in the housing, this movement causes the canister to move with respect to its actuator, thereby opening the valve and causing dispensing of the topical anesthetic from within the canister through the nozzle and its outlet bore. When the button is released, the restoring force of a spring incorporated in the canister valve closes the valve and restores the actuator button to its previous un-actuated position. If desired, a cam device may be associated with the actuator button so that a prescribed metered dose of topical anesthetic is dispensed each time the button is pushed, regardless of how long it is held in the depressed position.","(10) The clip closest to the proximal end of the syringe has incorporated therewith a pair of opposed wing-like appendages sized and configured to be engaged by fingers of the user, with the user's thumb being employed to depress the actuator button.","(11) The second embodiment of the present invention is intended, in one variation, to be used until the canister is depleted of topical anesthetic and then discarded. For this purpose, in assembly of the second embodiment, the two longitudinally split halves of the housing are assembled about the nozzle, the canister, and the actuator button with its actuator stem. Adjoining edges of the housing halves are adhered together by a suitable adhesive and are preferably sealed using an ultraviolet activated sealant. Prior to adhering the housing halves together, the nozzle is fitted over the tubular actuator for the canister in an interference fit. In another variation, a fill port is provided on the device to facilitate refilling the canister.","(12) The present invention in each of its embodiments is easily attached to a disposable syringe and may be easily removed therefrom when the disposable syringe is to be discarded. Since the inventive topical anesthetic dispenser never comes in contact with the patient and its design precludes contamination of the flexible tube in the first embodiment, the housing in the second embodiment, and the canister containing the topical anesthetic, the inventive device may be used multiple times with multiple syringes and, even, multiple patients. Of course, the device may be used solely with a single patient and discarded after such use.","As such, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a syringe-attached topical anesthetic dispenser.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a device in which a disposable syringe may have the dispenser attached thereto and easily removed therefrom when the syringe is to be discarded.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a device in which in a first embodiment, a flexible tube dispenses a topical anesthetic and the flexible tube may be bent to aim the anesthetic at a desired location on the skin of a patient.","It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a device in which in a first embodiment, a tube compressor is employed to control dispensing of the topical anesthetic.","It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a device in which in the first embodiment, the tube compressor is biased to a position stopping flow of topical anesthetic and includes an actuating lever that may be pivoted to control flow of topical anesthetic.","It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a device in a second embodiment thereof in which an aerosol canister is provided having an actuator consisting of an elongated tube incorporated into an aerosol valve.","It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide such a device in a second embodiment thereof in which the nozzle consists of an elongated passageway in a hard molded member, and the canister is actuated by depressing an actuator button that moves the canister with respect to the nozzle and the canister actuator.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such a device in a second embodiment thereof in which wing-like appendages are provided to allow engagement by the fingers of the user while the thumb is used to depress the actuator button.","These and other objects, aspects and features of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment when read in conjunction with the appended drawing figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","2","1","4","3","6","2"]},"The plunger  includes a piston  that pushes liquid in the chamber  through the outlet  in the chamber . A needle  is inserted into the opening  formed downstream of the outlet  in a tapered port . As is well known, the needle is thin and hollow permitting the medicament within the chamber  to be dispensed therethrough. The needle can be of any length so long as its distal end extends beyond the end of the tube  described below.","With reference to , the first embodiment of the present invention is generally designated by the reference numeral . The inventive dispenser  includes attachment means comprising a clip  having a clip portion  of arcuate construction and having a longitudinally elongated slot  having a width slightly smaller than the diameter of the barrel  of the syringe . The clip portion  is made of a flexible resilient material so that the width of the slot  may be temporarily enlarged by flexing it open, whereupon the barrel  of the syringe  may be inserted within the clip portion  and the flexing may be reversed causing the clip portion  to resiliently engage the outer periphery of the barrel  to retain the clip portion  assembled thereon.","The clip portion  also includes a receptacle or receptacle portion  including an internal chamber  defined by a closed end wall and a distal opening and is sized to receive a canister  pre-filled with a topical anesthetic. The internal walls of the chamber  are sized and configured to snugly receive the canister  while it being easy to remove the canister  when it is desired to replace or replenish it. If desired, the internal walls of the chamber  may be roughened or provided with a lining such as of rubber or other sticky material to enhance the holding power of the chamber  for the canister .","As best seen in , the canister  includes a distal neck portion  having an outlet  that is initially closed, for example, by a piercable disc (not shown) that may suitably be pierced to allow the topical anesthetic contained within the canister  to be dispensed.","With more particular reference to , the dispenser  also includes a housing  including a threaded recess . Preferably, the neck portion  of the canister  has external threads and meshing with the threads  within the opening  to allow the canister  to be releasably suitably fastened to the housing . The housing  includes a stepped cylindrical bore  with the step occurring at a shoulder . The distal portion of the bore  has an enlarged diameter and is sized to receive a rigid tube  which engages the shoulder  in assembled relation. The tube  may be secured to the housing  in any suitable manner such as through the use of an interference fit or adhesive. A flexible tube  is inserted into the rigid tube  and extends into the smaller diameter portion of the bore  as best seen in , surrounding the distal outlet  of the canister .","The tube  has a distal end  having an opening  that may, if desired, be defined by a nozzle insert  inserted into the opening  and having a particularly configured passageway  to cause topical anesthetic sprayed therefrom to spray in a desired pattern. The distal end of the tube  is flexible and may be bent by a physician into a desired angulation so that the topical anesthetic is sprayed in a desired location with respect to the location where the syringe needle will be inserted beneath the skin of the patient. The needle  extends beyond the distal termination of the tube  so that the tube  doesn't interfere with insertion of the needle subcutaneously. The tube  has a proximal end  () receiving the outlet  of the canister .","The rigid tube  has an opening  (reference numeral shown in ) through which a tube compressor  protrudes. As best seen in , the tube compressor  has an arcuate distal portion engaging the outer surface of the flexible tube  and is able to compress the tube  at that location to completely occlude the passageway  extending within the tube .","Valve means comprising a tube compressor  is integrally formed with a lever  pivotably mounted on the dispenser , the tube compressor  including an integrally formed arcuate shoulder (). In this regard, reference is made to  which shows the depending portion  of the lever  receiving a pin  extending through openings in the lever  (not shown) and an opening (not shown) through a portion  of the dispenser  so that the lever  pivots about the pin .","With reference to , the housing  includes a recess  that receives biasing means comprising a spring . The spring  has a proximal end engaging a proximal shoulder of the recess or blind bore  and a distal end engaging a shoulder  of the lever  so that the action of the compression spring  causes a force to be imposed in the left-hand direction in the view of  to cause the lever  to tend to pivot in a counterclockwise direction in the view of  about the pin  (). In this way, the tube compressor  is biased to the position shown in  at which it completely compresses the flexible tube  and completely occludes the passageway  to preclude any topical anesthetic from the canister  from passing through the nozzle .","If desired, the proximal end of the flexible tube  may be provided with a hollow piercing element (not shown) designed to pierce a disc (not shown) on the distal outlet  of the canister  when the canister  neck  is being screwed into the threaded opening  of the dispenser  to open access to the canister contents. In this way, once the canister  is so installed, with the lever  biased to the position shown in , the anesthetic is ready to be dispensed, but will not be dispensed until the lever  is pivoted in the clockwise direction in the view of  to permit the tube compressor  to relieve pressure on the outer periphery of the flexible tube  and facilitate flow of anesthetic through the passageway  and out the nozzle  via the nozzle passageway .","With the first embodiment of the present invention having been described in great detail hereinabove, its method of operation will now be explained. First, a syringe  is chosen and a desired needle  is installed into the port  thereof so that its distal end is distal of the nozzle  of the tube . The inventive dispenser  is attached to the barrel  of the syringe by expanding the longitudinal slot  in the clip portion , inserting the barrel  therewithin, and releasing the clip portion  to cause its inner surfaces to squeeze against the barrel  to retain it in appropriate position. In that position, the clip portion  may be slid along the barrel  to assume any desired location along the barrel length.","The location on the skin of the patient where an injection is to take place is determined and the syringe  with the dispenser  attached thereto is positioned at a desired location and angle of skin penetration approximately 1 to 2 centimeters above the skin. The lever  is depressed to pivot it about the pivot pin  to release the tube compressor  from the outer periphery of the flexible tube  to permit flow of the topical anesthetic such as ethyl chloride for a period of time, such as 1 to 3 seconds.","Either while the topical anesthetic is flowing or just after the flow of the topical anesthetic is stopped, the skin is then penetrated by the needle of the syringe  to a desired depth and, once the intramuscular location has been verified, the medicament is injected to the desired depth and amount. Injections may be subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal.","If desired, the needle may be retracted a desired distance with additional injection occurring or may be removed so that the next location can be chosen. During the process of injection including multiple injections at the same site of needle penetration, additional topical anesthetic may be dispensed as desired to maintain the numbness of the skin at that location.","If during the process of injection, the canister  runs out of topical anesthetic, it may be removed from the receptacle  and replaced with a replacement canister. The canister  may also be refillable.","When the injection process is completed, the syringe  may be removed from the clip portion  and suitably discarded and the dispenser  may be re-used with other syringes.","As such, in this way, the present invention provides an effective way of dispensing a topical anesthetic such as ethyl chloride onto the skin of a patient where an injection is to take place so that the injection is painless. The present invention is not limited for use in association with injections in the face for aesthetic enhancement. Rather, it may be used as attached to any syringe or other injection device used to inject any medication for any purpose. For example, the inventive device may be used with injection devices associated with diabetes glucose monitors and multiple needle allergy introducers.","In the first embodiment of the present invention, the clip  is made of any suitable material such as molded plastic or light metal, although molded plastic is preferred. The housing  may be made of a molded plastic as may the lever  with its integral tube compressor . The tube  is made of any suitable rigid plastic while the tube  is made of any suitable flexible material allowing the distal end thereof to be bent to a desired angulation and to retain its bent orientation.","With reference, now, to , a second embodiment of the present invention is generally designated by the reference numeral  and is seen to be made up of an elongated housing  including two housing halves  and  interconnected together at the location of two splits of which one of the splits  is seen in ,  and , in particular, and of which the other split is diametrically opposite.","As seen in , the housing  includes a first clip  at the proximal end of the housing and a second clip  at the distal end of the housing. The barrel  of a syringe is seen releasably received within the clips  and . As understood from the details of the syringe  described in conjunction with the first embodiment of the present invention, the end  of the syringe includes an opening  to which is installed a desired needle and the proximal end of the barrel  includes an opening  () leading to a passageway  that receives a plunger such as the plunger  illustrated in . The typical syringe barrel  includes a series of gradations on its outer surface that allow one to determine the volume of fluid contained within the chamber . In order to view these gradations, the clip  includes opposed trapezoidal windows  best seen in ,  and .","With particular reference to , the housing  includes an internal chamber  that receives a canister  of a topical anesthetic. The canister  includes an internal chamber  that receives the topical anesthetic and includes a valve  activated by moving the elongated actuator  to the right in the view of  (or the canister  to the left with respect to the fixed actuator ) in a manner well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The actuator  includes an elongated passageway  interconnected to the chamber  via the valve . A spring  is interposed between the actuator  and the wall  defining a part of the housing containing the valve . In this way, when the actuator  is moved to the right in the view of  with respect to the canister  (or vice versa), once the force moving the actuator  is relieved, the spring  moves the actuator  back to the configuration shown in . In one variation, the canister  is not refillable. As such, when it is depleted of topical anesthetic, the device  must be discarded. In another variation, with reference to , ,  and , a fill port  may be provided and connected to the chamber  by conduit  (). The canister may be refilled through the fill port  and conduit  in a manner well understood. The fill port  is sealed when not in use, for example, as is an inflation valve on an athletic ball.","With further reference to , it should be understood that actuation of the valve  is equally possible by fixing the position of the actuator  and moving the canister  to the left in the view of  with respect thereto. In fact, this is the preferred manner of opening of the valve  to cause release of the topical anesthetic from the chamber  of the canister .","For this purpose, with further reference to , a button  is provided at the right hand side of the housing  in the view of  and is coupled to an elongated stem  having a distal end  engaging the closed wall  of the canister . Thus, when the button  is pushed to the left in the view of , the integral stem  moves the canister  to the left in the view of . The housing  also has mounted thereon a nozzle  that includes an elongated passageway  aligned with the passageway  through the canister actuator . The bore  is connected to a nozzle bore  at the distal end  of the nozzle  and topical anesthetic dispensed from the chamber  exits the inventive device  via the nozzle bore .","The nozzle  is fixed into the housing  by virtue of an annular groove  that receives the inwardly directed edge or annular shoulder  of the distal end of the housing . This is possible since, as explained above, the housing  comprises two housing halves  and  that cause the housing to be longitudinally split. The two housing halves  and  combine together to provide an annular shoulder  that engages in the groove  to retain the nozzle  in fixed mount within the housing . The needle (not shown) of the associated syringe extends distally of the nozzle bore  in the same manner as shown in .","The fixed relationship between the nozzle  and the housing  means that when the button  is depressed to the left in the view of , the nozzle  is constrained from movement with respect to the housing . Thus, with the actuator  received within a bore  of the nozzle , the actuator  is also constrained from longitudinal movement. Thus, when the button  is depressed to the left in the view of , the cannister  moves with respect to the actuator  to open the valve  and cause dispensing of the topical anesthetic from the chamber  through the valve  through the bore  and thence through the bore  and the nozzle bore  onto the desired location on the patient. As is understood by those skilled in the art, the bore  is fluidly connected to the chamber of the valve  and to the chamber  in a manner well known. When the button  is released, the spring  moves the cannister  to the right along with the stem  and button , restoring them to the position shown in . If desired, a cam device (not shown) may be associated with the actuator button  so that a prescribed metered dose of topical anesthetic is dispensed each time the button  is pushed, regardless of how long it is held in the depressed position. Such cam devices are generally known.","With particular reference to , it is seen that two wing-like appendages  and  extend in opposite directions close to the proximal end of the housing . These appendages include respective distally facing arcuate surfaces  and . Additional arcuate surfaces  and  are located on opposed sides of the housing  (, in particular). The purpose for the appendages  and  with their arcuate surfaces  and , respectively, and the arcuate surfaces  and  on the housing  is to receive fingers of the user on either side of the housing  to facilitate secure gripping of the device , whereupon the thumb may be used to depress the button  to dispense the topical anesthetic.","In the assembly of the inventive device , with the housing halves  and  separated, the nozzle  is assembled to the canister  with the actuator  received within the bore  of the nozzle. As assembled, these devices are placed into one housing half in the manner shown in , and the button  with its actuator stem  is inserted laterally with the distal end  of the stem  engaging the wall  of the canister . Ribs ,  and , among others, align the canister  in the position shown in , while the interaction between the groove  and the wall  of the housing  aligns the nozzle  in the desired location. Similarly, ribs  and  suitably align the actuator stem  in the position shown in .","The housing halves are then assembled together using a suitable adhesive and perhaps an ultraviolet activated adhesive to seal the housing halves  and  together with the nozzle , canister , button , and stem  in assembled relation as shown in .","In the preferred manner of use of the second embodiment , it is completely disposable. That is, the canister  is not replaceable due to the hermetic sealing of the housing . Thus, when the canister  is empty, the entire device  is discarded. Alternatively, as explained above, the fill port  and conduit  permit replenishment of the canister .","Operation of the second embodiment in conjunction with use of a syringe is the same as explained with regard to the first embodiment.","The housing  is preferably made of plastic by any desired method including injection molding.","As such, an invention has been disclosed in terms of preferred embodiments thereof which fulfill each and every one of the objects of the invention as set forth hereinabove, and provide a new and useful syringe-attached topical anesthetic dispenser of great novelty and utility.","Of course, various changes, modifications and alterations in the teachings of the present invention may be contemplated by those skilled in the art without departing from the intended spirit and scope thereof.","As such, it is intended that the present invention only be limited by the terms of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
