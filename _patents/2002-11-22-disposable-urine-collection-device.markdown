{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to portable urinary devices. The present invention relates more specifically to a self-contained disposable urine collection device which allows comfortable and hygienic urination.","2. Description of the Related Art","In our highly mobile society, people sometimes face a unique dilemma regarding the issue of where to urinate, especially while traveling in a car. For example, individuals caught in traffic jams or snowstorms have limited options available for solving such a problem. Particularly in remote areas, public restrooms are often unavailable. Finding a secluded spot to urinate outdoors is often impossible. Even if such a place is located, the process is often uncomfortable, especially for women. For elderly or handicapped individuals, limited mobility may eliminate outdoor urination as an option.","Even if a restroom is available while traveling, people are often reluctant to use it because of concerns regarding sanitation. Growing fears of infection with the AIDS virus, Herpes, and many other microorganisms has made people more reluctant to expose themselves to unnecessary health risks. Many people are concerned about potential health hazards due to transmission of diseases from use of a public restroom. Although it is debatable as to whether these organisms remain infectious in such an environment, many individuals would prefer not to take this risk.","Moreover, when traveling in remote areas, using a public facility may involve a substantial safety risk for personal assault. This is particularly true for travel at night, especially for women and elderly individuals.","The alternative of holding the urine for extended periods of time while waiting to arrive at a suitable destination presents other undesirable problems. Apart from the obviously painful nature of such an option, the practice of delaying urination can result in medical problems for certain individuals who are at risk for bladder and kidney infections. For people who suffer from urinary urgency, loss of sphincter control, and various other conditions, waiting to urinate may not be possible.","Another important use of a portable disposable urinary device is in medical settings, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centers. Avoiding catheterization is preferable whenever possible. However, patients are often unable or reluctant to make a painful trip to the restroom or use a bedpan or urinal due to discomfort or weakness from a surgery or illness, or due to mobility constraints such as a wheelchair. Moreover, nursing home residents frequently do not want to wear disposable diaper products all day because of chaffing, odor, dignity, and discomfort.","Obviously, this problem is not new, and various attempts have been made to provide urination alternatives. None of these devices, however, have solved the problem of providing a portable, disposable, and hygienic urinary device that is easy to carry and use and inexpensive to manufacture.","Efforts to develop urinary devices have led to various designs as exemplified in the following patent disclosures.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,457,314 issued on Jul. 3, 1984 to Knowles claims a female urine collection device and method which includes a cup-shaped receiving chamber with a flexible lip which seals around the urethral orifice. A duct section leads to flexible tubing leading to a compressible collection reservoir. The chamber and reservoir are mounted in a housing of soft absorbent material.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,678,564 issued on Oct. 21, 1997 to Lawrence et al. describes a liquid removal system which utilizes a membranous interface device which maintains a vacuum on one side. The vacuum operates such that liquid passes through the membrane and is removed to a receptacle for disposal.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,756,029 issued on Jul. 12, 1988 to Zieve et al. describes a feminine urinary device which permits urinating in a standing position. The device has a hingedly attached flap with expandable walls which permit the side walls to expand downward in order to collect the urine. The pad is held in place against the body for the passage of urine into the expandable receptacle. Alternatively, the device can be designed to include an aperture which attaches to a spout which acts as a conduit for the urine.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,781,713 issued on Nov. 1, 1988 to Welch et al. describes a disposable incontinency pad for females which includes an absorbent pad encased in a moisture resistant layer to prevent leakage. The device includes an ovoid opening with a contoured rim portion which conforms to the urinary area of the wearer. The rim directs urine into the pad and away from the user.","None of the inventions described above provide an easy to use, comfortable, disposable urinary device. Most of these designs present contact surfaces which are uncomfortable and ill-fitting. Some of these devices are also unwieldy to maneuver, especially for discrete disposable use in those areas where the necessity to use such a device is most likely to occur.","Therefore, the primary object of the present invention, is a comfortable, hygienic urinary device which allows a person to urinate in a variety of positions without wetting clothing and body parts. Another object of the present invention is to provide a device which is convenient to carry, easy to use, and inexpensive to manufacture. Another object of the present invention is to provide a urinary device which is disposable and biodegradable. The present invention would provide a disposable urinary device which could be used in a variety of travel settings. Yet another object of this invention is a disposable urinary device for use in a medical or extended care setting, which could be administered by the patient or resident as well as by the attending nurse or caregiver.","The urinary device of the present invention is a self-contained disposable apparatus with an absorbent concave pad for the collection of urine. The design includes a glove which is attached to the absorbent pad which has a mitt for the user's hand to support the absorbent pad. The absorbent pad is composed of a waterproof liner, absorptive layers, and a protective moisture layer. This device can be used in a variety of positions, such as lying down on the side or back, sitting, or standing. The hand of the user is inserted into the mitt prior to urination and removed after urination by folding the sleeve of the glove over the top of the absorbent pad. The device may then be secured prior to disposal by a variety of methods, including a zipper top closure, twist tie, or drawstring feature, connected to the distal end of the sleeve.","The device includes an absorbent pad which contains several layers. The waterproof plastic liner on the bottom of the pad serves to contain the urine without leakage. The next layer is made of hydrophilic gel and absorbent materials. Next, there are panels of absorbent material to direct and absorb the liquid. The top protective layer is fluid pervious to permit the entrance of urine into the absorptive layers. The rim of the absorbent pad forms a lip which is not only absorbent, but which provides a supportive contour to the device and a soft body-conforming surface to prevent leakage. The absorbent material on the top surface of the device may also be used to wipe away residual urine. An alternative embodiment of the device may also have a separate wipe which is included to wipe away residual urine.","Reference is made first to  for an overview of the urinary device  of the present invention. As shown in , the device is an absorbent pad  attached to a waterproof glove . The hand  of the user is inserted into the sleeve  of the waterproof glove  such that the hand  is in the mitt  of the waterproof glove  supporting the absorbent pad . The absorbent pad  has a waterproof lining , a rim , panels of absorbent material , and a top protective layer . This top protective layer  is shown in a raised position in  to illustrate its attachment to the rim  of the absorbent pad  as a thin, permeable covering. As shown in , the absorbent pad  is preferably constructed such that the shape of the bottom of the pad  fits the contour of the hand of the user . The rim  of the absorbent pad  is configured to easily align with the contours of the body (i.e. in a shape that generally follows the curved surface of the groin area of the user as shown), both for comfort and to form a seal when in use.","Continuing,  illustrates the top view of the present invention, showing the panels , rim , and top protective layer  of the absorbent pad . As shown in , the absorbent pad  is composed of several layers. The bottom layer forms a shell of waterproof lining  composed of materials well known in the art such as impervious polyethylene or polypropylene film or thermoplastic polymer to hold the urine within the urinary device . The next layer is composed of layers of hydrophilic gel and absorbent materials . The hydrophilic gel is made of super-absorbent polymer particles which contain water-absorbing resins that are well known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 6A","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIGS. 8A and 8B"],"b":["70","90","30","70","70","70","6","7","7","8","8","9","9","72","70","30","74","70","30","76","70","30","78","70","30"]},"Returning to , the next layer in the absorbent pad  is the top protective layer , which is designed to allow fluids to enter the surface of the absorbent pad . This top protective layer is composed of a hydrophilic, fluid pervious, fibrous, non-woven web well known in the art. This layer provides suitable fluid handling capabilities and desirable tactile softness. Other suitable materials known in the art that would also be appropriate include a liquid-pervious cover layer against which individual hydrophobic fibers are arranged. The cover layer contains fiber-free regions to promote liquid transfer through the cover layer. Such an external cover layer is user-friendly as it is both soft and exhibits a dry surface after wetting.","Reference is now made to the rim of the absorbent pad which is illustrated in FIG. . The rim forms the lip of the absorbent pad, functioning to shape the pad, prevent leakage, and absorb residual moisture during use. The rim is composed of a soft, absorbent cord constructed from woven fibers.","Continuing in , the urinary device of the present invention is shown after removal from the hand of the user.  illustrates the manner in which the sleeve of the waterproof glove of the urinary device is turned back upon itself as the initial step in covering and disposing of the used article.  shows the urinary device with the absorbent pad almost entirely covered by the inverted sleeve. Finally, in , the urinary device is illustrated with the absorbent pad completely hidden inside the inverted sleeve. The embodiment of  has a zipper closure feature (also depicted in ) at the distal end of the sleeve for sealing the absorbent pad within the waterproof glove of the urinary device in preparation for disposal.","Alternative closure methods are illustrated in .  shows a twist tie feature located at the distal end of the sleeve of the urinary device.  reveals a drawstring closure design at the distal end of the sleeve of the urinary device.","Actual use of the urinary device  requires inserting the user's hand  into the sleeve  and mitt  of the waterproof glove  to cradle the bottom  of the absorbent pad  (see FIG. A). Next, as shown in , the absorbent pad  of the urinary device  is positioned against the urinary area in such a manner that the user is able to direct the flow of urine into the panels  of the absorbent pad . After voiding, the user can slide the urinary device  forward such that the rim  of the absorbent pad  absorbs any residual urine present on the body of the user. Alternatively, a disposable wipe may be provided with the device for removal of residual urine.","The user then inverts the sleeve  of the waterproof glove  such that the sleeve  completely envelopes the absorbent pad  (see FIG. D). The user can then seal the closure at the distal end  of the sleeve  and dispose of the urinary device . Alternative embodiments of the urinary device  include the absorbent pad  without the attached glove , either with or without a disposal means, such as a pouch or bag. In an alternative embodiment, the urinary device of the present invention may be manufactured with a deodorizing substance contained within the absorbent pad in order to reduce or eliminate odors. In a medical setting, when fluid intake and output measurement is important, the device may be weighed to determine the quantity of urine excreted, similar to the weighing of diapers in a hospital nursery. The urinary device of the present invention may be designed to accommodate persons of varying size and age. For example, a small device may be most useful for children, providing a better fit and adequate urinary capacity.","Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with certain preferred embodiments and certain specific applications, it is anticipated that those skilled in the art will discern further embodiments and applications that fall within the scope of the invention and the following appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 10C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
