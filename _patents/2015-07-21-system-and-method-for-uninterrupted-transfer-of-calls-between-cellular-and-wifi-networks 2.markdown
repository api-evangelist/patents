{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION INFORMATION","COPYRIGHT NOTICE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority benefit from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 62\/028,292, filed on Jul. 23, 2014.","Portions of this disclosure contain material in which copyright is claimed by the applicant. The applicant has no objection to the copying of this material in the course of making copies of the application file or any patents that may issue on the application, but all other rights whatsoever in the copyrighted material are reserved.","Cellular phones have been in widespread use for many years. A variety of carriers offer cellular services over networks in the United States and similar services are offered by cellular companies in most other countries around the world. The coverage of the networks of the different carriers varies widely depending on the geographic location of the user. Coverage depends on the proximity to a cellular tower delivering a cell signal to a user's mobile device. If a user is in a location that is too far away from a tower or that is blocked in some way from receiving the signal from a tower, the call quality may be reduced to an unacceptable level or drop off completely.","Cell phone users are typically charged a monthly service fee for the use of a phone on the cellular network. Those charges depend on the amount of use and are usually measured in the number of minutes during each monthly cycle. To avoid running up charges and\/or to improve signal reception, a number of products and services have been offered to transfer a cellular call on a cell phone from the cellular network to another network such as a hardwired telephone network or a WiFi network that allows the call to be transmitted over the internet or another network.","While different products and services offering these transfer capabilities are available, none of them offers a seamless transfer which is accomplished without the user manually initiating such action. As a result, it is desirable to have such a system and method that automatically transfers calls from a cellular network upon a user coming into range of a WiFi network.","The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art by offering a software package that may run on any number of different operating systems including but not limited to Android, OS, Windows, Windows Mobile, Linux or Blackberry. The application provides voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone services designed to supplement and\/or replace the existing cellular PCS or packet communication system.","The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Throughout the Figures, like elements of the invention are referred to by the same reference numerals for consistency purposes.","Shown in  is a system and method for transferring calls without interruption between a cellular network and a WiFi network.  shows the basic system components which include one or more mobile devices  such as a smartphone or other portable computing device (e.g. tablet computers, laptops, PDAs, etc.) connected to a network and running an application (\u201capp\u201d) installed on the mobile device  to perform the functions for the uninterrupted transfer of calls between a cellular network and a WiFi network or vice versa. One or more servers  control call sessions and a firewall and load balancing system  authenticates a user's mobile device prior to making a transfer.","A specific application (\u201capp\u201d\u2014see ) is installed on mobile device  that operates in conjunction with software installed on servers  and load balancing system  to enable calls to be transferred. The app provides voice communications and simple messaging service (SMS) functions via WiFi conforming to IEEE 802.11 standards, functioning with all subversions of the standard in production or in prototype. The IEEE definition of sub OSI\u2014(Open Systems Interconnection model\u2014a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partition it into layers) for 802.11 includes A, B, G, N, AB and AC. Because the application is adherent to full 802.11, any additional sub OTI will be supported.","The communication level of the app may be defined by the equipment manufacturer, which for example, may be based on the open systems interconnection (\u201cOSI\u201d) model as defined by CISCO\u00ae at:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["205","205","210","215"]},"On the server side, server software maintains session state; that is control of the call. A \u201cDecode and State Functions\u201d block  are outlined herein as part of the process formula. Switching and physical control functions are maintained at a data center server cluster . This process may be replicated at multiple data centers or single center capacity may be increased to increase overall system capacity.","App  refers to OSI layers 3 and 4, commonly TCP and IP, although UDP is also supported at layer 3 of OSI. This is the application itself that is installed to mobile device . IP communication  is the physical network component that connects mobile device  to cloud . This is commonly a WiFi network although any packet based standard network that conforms to OSI referenced above is usable. WiFi networks may include the public network at a restaurant or other commercial place as well as an office, home or tethered configuration. In addition to WiFi, Satellite, WAN, MAN and any other packet infrastructure is or can be supported.","Cloud  is the public Internet while decode and state functions  are determined at the front end of server  at data center . State control is handled at decode and state functions block  which allows signal detection, also referred to by trademark \u201cSignal Seeker\u201d to monitor the call and switch (handoff between networks) as needed. This process must be completed at 2 ms or less to avoid drops. The decode (and encode) function  refers to a variance for the subscribers mobile network. Information being decoded includes the DID number, connection state (connected, connecting, etc.) as well as status such as roaming and signal strength.","Data center server cluster  is the physical data center configuration. This is illustrated in detail in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","310","105","105","105","105","105"],"i":["a","d ","a","b","c ","d"]},"Mobile devices  may run any number of different operating systems including but not limited to Android, iOS, Windows, Windows Mobile, Linux or Blackberry. App  running on mobile devices -functions to transfer an active call between cellular packet system  and WiFi system . App  is implemented in an active state format on mobile device  and monitors communications in an active\/inactive mode on packet system . When a WiFi signal is detected in range of mobile device  that is able to route calls over the internet or another platform including but not limited to a private packet switch, extranet, local area network, municipal area network, wide area network satellite network using any one or more frequency bands (e.g. L, C, Ku, Ka), cellular network (e.g. GSM, CDMA), App  initiates a connection on the cloud network  and drops the connection to cellular packet system . This system additionally maintains state functions for call completion allowing a transfer of originated point of termination by both cellular packet system  and WiFi system  communicating over cloud network .","App  employs several quality of service features (\u201cQOS\u201d) designed to address and minimize the issue of dropped calls. Included in this feature is a signal monitoring function which will obtain active\/inactive state of WiFi network , check the login status and once access is confirmed, monitor the signal level of cell network . Once a WiFi signal strength in a range of approximately 0.5 db to 0.8 db is obtained for a period of 5 seconds, app  is triggered to transfer to cloud .","In addition to the auto transfer, the user has a function via the interface on app  to enable the user to manually set the signal strength and time for switching.","Once a cellular network signal reaches the minimum level that is the default value or as set by the user, the active call is switched back to cellular packet system  until the process may be repeated. The entire switching process completes in under 2 ms.","The design of the signal detection process is set to control the call via server , and monitor for the status of mobile device . When a call is active on cellular network  and a known wireless connection is successfully engaged, server  will hand off (or switch) the active call from cell network  to WiFi network  and stop incurring further charges for cellular minutes. The call on cellular network  is placed in standby mode which allows the system the ability to switch it back to cellular network  quickly and easily. The state of the document type definition (\u201cDTD\u201d) (phone number) is kept in standby so the call session may continue without interruption.","Another quality of service (\u201cQOS\u201d) function involves monitoring of \u201chops\u201d and other latency issues on WiFi network  allowing for full support of satellite and other Internet communication technologies. This feature makes the app along with the Cloud infrastructure agnostic to the actual form of communication for the wide area network (i.e. as long as the device end conforms to IEEE 802.11, whatever technology completes the circuit is supported. This may include, but is not limited to, satellite packet radio, switched data such as T1 or T3, cable modems, DSL, Fiber Optic Connections, etc.).","Device support of the app and the cloud based infrastructure supports all current implementations that communicate with the internet protocol version X (\u201cIPvX\u201d) standards. This includes, but is not limited to, Android devices (all), iOS devices (all), Windows mobile devices (all), Blackberry devices (all) and WebOS devices. While the product app will focus on specific device operating systems based on market share, it is declared that the technology itself is compatible with all IP compliant device operating systems.","System  is unique and different from anything on the market today. Call transfer is performed without the device user being interrupted or having to interact in any way with mobile device . The app's internal algorithmic structure analyzes, identifies, determines and implements the best form of connection to adhere to the device users' needs and current activities. The system is also agnostic to branded carrier environments and will support cellular packet implementation on both the global system for mobile communications (\u201cGSM\u201d) and code division multiple access (\u201cCDMA\u201d) switching standards",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["110","300","110","310","405","405","110"]},"Cellular transceivers -are mounted to tower  for receiving and transmitting cellular signals to mobile devices  positioned within range.

When the call is flagged as active, the signal detection component will attempt to hand off the call from cell network  to WiFi network .","Providers network  is the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to each of the mobile providers systems. An initial version might include the largest four U.S. Providers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint), however, the system is compatible with all digital mobile providers. Providers network  is the portion of the installed application  that performs the switch between the cellular network  and WiFi network . When a call is initiated, the direct inward dialing (\u201cDID\u201d)\/phone number is stored in active phone memory. This number is submitted to cellular network  so as the call is passed between the two systems it can be maintained without having to reinitiate the call. When the call is handed off via the Signal Seeker, a mode is imitated as outlined with respect to the description of monitor status block  below. This function allows a call to be initiated via WiFi  and remain live when switching to cellular network .","Monitor status block  maintains the active and passive states of a current call. This is logged via the process as outlined below with respect to log status block . The information provided to the logging function originates here.","WiFi State  and Mobile Operator State  feed Monitor Status  which operates along with call active  to maintain the status of the active call.","Dialer  interfaces with the dial function of mobile device  (when present) or presents a substitute on devices that do not have mobile calling capability such as a personal computer. Connection  shows the established connection to either WiFi network  or cell network .","Init on Operator block  is the status that is logged with the database  shown in . More specifically, this is the active status of the mobile provider, the current call status, the session identifier, the DID of the device, the international mobile equipment identity (\u201cIMEI\u201d) (or equivalent serial number) of the device and the call duration.","POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) Completion block  references the ability for a WiFi initiated call to be compatible with the standard telephone network. Completion allows a call initiated via the application to connect, ring and be active to standard land line phones.","Log status block  maintains the active status of the session. For example, if a call is initiated via WiFi  to a land line phone, the WiFi status, the land line status and the telco information are maintained at log status  in real-time.","State Handoff  physically transfers the application call from WiFi to the mobile network operator and back, in any order.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"310","sup":"2 ","br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":"s=a"},"This equation shows the actual functions and conditions under which the Signal Seeker signal detection component operates.","As defined in the equation, the procedure is initiated when a user places a call on cellular network . Based on the criteria in the equation above, the call will be completed with cell network  when available and via WiFi  when it is not.","Based on the criteria below, when WiFi network  is active the call will be transferred to WiFi upon meeting the conditions of the equation above depending on the variables of signal strength and connection times. The range of the signal strength has H (high point) at approximately 1.5 db and L (low point) at approximately 1.8 db with a default of approximately 1.5 db. The connection time is in the approximate range between 3 seconds and 5 seconds with a default of approximately 5 seconds. Both options may be adjusted from the interface by the user in the application.","The system will also check for ports and other details per the equation above. In the event that the Layer 3 TCP cellular service  is not available, the call will complete and operate via the WiFi network . Wireless system uses a circular boundary with signal and deployment strengths outlined in this equation.","In practice, when a user enters the signal range of a WiFi network the device will connect automatically through existing means. The problem that is solved is that when a user is on the edge of a WiFi network the device will have a default behavior of connecting to the WiFi, and disconnecting from it becomes a problem that is currently present or that will be consistent in the current position. The problem can be stated as a simple equation: X as X=DT (where D is distance and T is threshold) to create a \u201cbuffer\u201d zone for the WiFi network to be in operation, but the call to still be on the mobile network. The \u201cbuffer\u201d zone is what is referred to as tolerance. When inside this zone, the call automatically switches.","The solution can be implemented using a single triangular range as shown in , or it can include multiple triangular ranges layered on top of each other where different WiFi bands are present. In that case, multiple \u201cX\u201d variables are determined based on different, layered distances \u201cD\u201d and thresholds \u201cT.\u201d So there would be an X, Dand Tdefined to be in a relationship as X=DTand X, Dand Tdefined to be in a relationship expressed as X=DT.","On the exit of a WiFi network, the signal is checked against \u201cH\u201d and \u201cL,\u201d and the measured level is added to the conditions and that is why this calculation is a function for a triangulation instead of a circle. The same logic as above is applied in reverse when the user is already on WiFi to give the user a tolerance (\u201cexit buffer\u201d zone) when leaving the WiFi coverage area. This ensures that the call is not dropped and quality of service is maintained.","As an example, where a=39.75 mand it is known that the sin 60\u00b0 is 0.866, s=45.9 meters. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the inter-access point spacing from 42.7 meters to 45.9 meters in order to move both the top and bottom rows of outermost access points to the actual building perimeter. As this represents a relatively minor increase in inter-access point spacing, it should be easily accommodated by a correspondingly minor increase in transmit power, if any at all. In the next step, the new cell size is determined that would be required to support the recommended levels of overlap, given the newly calculated inter-access point spacing.","Using this new value for Signal Seeker's inter-access point spacing, the \u221267 dBm cell signal boundary is first calculated with a 15% cell-to-cell overlap for 802.11a. The \u221267 dBm cell signal boundary with a 20% cell-to-cell overlap is the calculated for the legacy data and voice devices that will be using 802.11bg. With the assumption that the radii of any two adjacent access point cells are equal (that is R1=R2=R), the equation for the area of a circle-circle intersection can be used as the basis for this calculation. To determine the cell radius given that the inter-access point separation and the percentage of overlap are known, the following equation is used:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0064"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["O","\u03c0"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msup":{"mi":"R","mn":"2"}},{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mi":"R","mn":"2"},"mi":"arc","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mi":"d","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"R"}}}}},{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"d","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"R","mn":"2"}},"mo":"-","msup":{"mi":"d","mn":"2"}}}}],"mo":"-"}],"mo":"="}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":"where:\n        \n        "}}}},"Either 15 (for 802.11a) or 10 (for 802.11bg) is substituted as the percentage of overlap O, and 45.9 meters is substituted for the inter-access point distance d.

Since this is +1.93 dBm higher than the required transmit power to achieve a recommended 20% overlap goal at a cell signal boundary of \u221267 dBm, it is expected that the overlap will exceed the 20% target. This is acceptable, as the 20% overlap is a minimum target. Similarly, for 802.11a the access point transmit power level of +14 dBm is +1.42 dBm higher than what is required to achieve the recommended 15% overlap, once again resulting in more overlap between cells than expected.","In this particular case, the option to expand an inter-access point separation is an acceptable alternative. Due to the increase in the inter-access point separation (from 42.7 meters to 45.9 meters), a +3 dBm increase is required to both an 802.11a and 802.11bg access point transmit power settings in order to remain in strict compliance with calculated requirements. Despite the increase in access point transmit power level, additional transmit power is left in reserve on both bands to address potential coverage holes or other anomalies that could occur due to changes in the environment. If this had not been the case, it would have been necessary to proceed with a second option which entails contracting inter-access point spacing and introducing a sixth row of access points. The main differences in the calculations would be to divide the size of the floor by five (instead of four) rows of equilateral triangular formations. This would have resulted in a smaller formation height, a smaller inter-access point separation, and therefore, smaller cell-to-cell radii and lower transmit powers.","Signal Seeker will adhere to a formula to trigger handoff functions at a ratio of 1.6-1.8 db sustained for 5 seconds.","While the invention has been described with respect to the figures, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
