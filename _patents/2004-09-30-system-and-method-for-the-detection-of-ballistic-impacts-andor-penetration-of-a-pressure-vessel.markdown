Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to vessel and\/or tank inspection and monitoring, and more particularly to detections and characterizations of impacts and leaks in vessels and\/or tanks.","2. Description of the Related Art","Pressure vessels used in commercial and military applications are typically filled with fluids including oil, gasoline, and hazardous liquids and gases. Ideally, these pressure vessels are stored in tamper-proof environments. However, the pressure vessels must often be transported. Due to the portable nature of the pressure vessels, the pressure vessels themselves may be subjected to tampering causing leaks to occur and potentially hazardous situations to arise, especially if the enclosed fluid is flammable or toxic. The tampering may or may not be the result of sabotage or other dubious form of tampering. In fact, the tampering may be a result of chemical or mechanical failures of the pressure vessel due to fatigue, rupture, rusting, or other form of breakdown.","Furthermore, given certain military applications and recent threats to civilian infrastructure, the pressure vessels may be subjected to ballistic impacts from ammunition, projectiles, or missiles. In fact, in some situations friendly fire may result in unintended ballistic impacts on the pressure vessels and in some cases the normal operational environment results in impacts on the pressure vessel. However, some of these impacts may not result in penetration of the pressure vessel. Moreover, some of these impacts are mere noise associated with the transportation of the pressure vessels.","For example, if a pressure vessel were to be transported in or as an integral part of an open vehicle, train, or other form of transportation, stones may skip onto the pressure vessel causing an impact on the pressure vessel. However, these impacts are often minimal causing mere surface abrasions on the pressure vessel to appear, but may, nonetheless, alarm those in proximity to the pressure vessel (for example, the driver of the vehicle) that perhaps the pressure vessel has been penetrated or that the impact has potentially damaged the pressure vessel, which may cause failure at some time in the future.","Additionally, a pressure vessel, which contains a hypothermic fluid may cause condensation to form on the outside of the pressure vessel. When viewed, this condensation may cause alarm if it is not known whether the condensation is in fact condensation, or what the source of the condensation is, or whether the condensation is fluid which has leaked from the pressure vessel itself or from a nearby pressure vessel.","Therefore, there is a need for a system and method to monitor pressure vessels, which provide an accurate determination of any leaks or penetrations of the pressure vessel and which differentiate between significant impacts or leaks and mere noise (i.e., insignificant environmental effects on the pressure vessel, such as minimal impacts or condensation).","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment of the invention provides a method for monitoring a holding structure such as a pressure vessel or tank, wherein the method comprises connecting at least one sensor to the holding structure, wherein the sensor comprises any of an acoustic sensor and a vibration sensor; measuring a mechanical response of the holding structure using the sensor; processing the mechanical response using a digital signal processor system; categorizing the processed mechanical response into events of interest and events not of interest; and determining if any of a ballistic impact and penetration of the holding structure has occurred based on the processed mechanical response.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the mechanical response comprises any of an acoustic response and a vibration response. Also, the events comprise any of environmental events and ballistic events, wherein the categorizing comprises differentiating the environmental events from the ballistic events, and wherein the step of determining comprises assigning acoustic and vibration signatures to different types of penetration. Also, the events not of interest comprise noise and environmental events. Moreover, in the step of connecting, the acoustic sensor comprises any of a microphone and a hydrophone and the vibration sensor comprises any of an accelerometer and a vibrometer. Additionally, the digital signal processor system comprises a program storage device readable by computer, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer to perform the categorizing of the processed mechanical response into events of interest and events not of interest.","Another aspect of the invention provides a method for determining whether leaks exist in a pressure vessel, wherein the method comprises measuring a mechanical response of the pressure vessel using any of an acoustic sensor and a vibration sensor; processing the mechanical response using a digital signal processor system; categorizing the processed mechanical response into events of interest and events not of interest; and determining if any of a ballistic impact and penetration of the pressure vessel has occurred based on the processed mechanical response, wherein the mechanical response comprises any of an acoustic response and a vibration response, wherein the events of interest comprise any of environmental events and ballistic events, wherein the categorizing comprises differentiating the environmental events from the ballistic events, and wherein the events not of interest comprise noise.","Additionally, in the step of measuring, the acoustic sensor comprises any of a microphone and a hydrophone and the vibration sensor comprises any of an accelerometer and a vibrometer. Additionally, in the step of processing, the digital signal processor system comprises a program storage device readable by computer, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer to perform the categorizing of the processed mechanical response into events of interest and events not of interest.","Another embodiment of the invention comprises a system for monitoring a holding structure, such as a pressure vessel or tank, wherein the system comprises at least one sensor connected to the holding structure, wherein the sensor comprises any of an acoustic sensor and a vibration sensor, and wherein the sensor is operable for measuring a mechanical response of the holding structure; and a digital signal processor system connected to the sensor, wherein the digital signal processor system comprises means for processing the mechanical response, means for categorizing the processed mechanical response into events of interest and events not of interest, and means for determining if any of a ballistic impact and penetration of the holding structure has occurred based on the processed mechanical response, wherein the mechanical response comprises any of an acoustic response and a vibration response, wherein the events of interest comprise any of environmental events and ballistic events, and wherein the digital signal processor system further comprises means for differentiating the environmental events from the ballistic events.","The system further comprises a radio transmitter connected to the sensor and a radio receiver connected to the digital signal processor system. Additionally, the digital signal processor system further comprises means for assigning acoustic signatures to different types of penetration, wherein the events not of interest comprise noise, and wherein the acoustic sensor comprises any of a microphone and a hydrophone and the vibration sensor comprises any of an accelerometer and a vibrometer. Furthermore, the digital signal processor system comprises a radio transmitter operable for communicating the events of interest to a central dispatch location.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

Such detection is particularly useful for the identification and notification of imminent threats associated with a potentially exposed hazardous material.

A digital signal processor system  is used to implement a computer-readable methodology that differentiates noise and environmental events from events of interest (or events of significance) such as leaks and ballistic impacts.","As such, the digital signal processor system  uses the input from the sensor , which may be embodied as a single sensor format or a multi-sensor format, to separate the event of interest from noise. The system  does not rely on pressure changes to sense the impact or penetration. This non-reliance on pressure changes is advantageous because the system  monitors large pressure vessels  (e.g., on the order of 140,000 lbs water equiv.) that may contain hazardous materials. If even a small quantity (compared to the total cargo) of the hazardous material leaks, it potentially could result in a substantially hazardous and dangerous environment to people who may be near the pressure vessels , yet may result in a minimal pressure change inside the pressure vessel .","Rather, the system  uses mechanical responses (acoustic and vibration responses) of the pressure vessel  as measured by the sensor . Additionally, the embodiments of the invention are easily implementable with minimal modification to the pressure vessel  being monitored, as the system  is portable. The digital signal processor system  is configured to enable the system  to monitor a variety of characteristics of the pressure vessel  that manifest themselves in structural vibration. Specifically, the digital signal processor system  may include monitoring of evidences of tampering and surreptitious extraction of contents of the pressure vessel , as well as health monitoring of the pressure vessel . If the pressure vessel  is integral to a mobile platform (not shown), then the health monitoring and environmental monitoring of the mobile platform would also be included in the overall monitoring performed by the digital processor system . For example, if the mobile platform is a vehicle such as a truck, then the number of hitch\/unhitch occurrences for maintenance scheduling or other purposes could be monitored. If the mobile platform is a train, then the coupling force of the train could be monitored. If the mobile platform includes any type of rotating machinery, then the bearing noise could be monitored.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
