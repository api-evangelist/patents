title: Systems and methods of offline processing
abstract: Systems, methodologies, media, and other embodiments associated with offline processing are described. One exemplary system embodiment can include a link detection logic configured to determine a link status of the network connection where the link status includes an online state and an offline state. An offline logic can be configured to allow the application to continue operating when the network connection is in the offline state by redirecting network communications sent from the application and storing the network communications in a post data store. The offline logic can be configured to submit the network communications from the post data store to the remote device when the link status changes to the online state.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. patent application entitled, \u201cParameter Passing in Web Based Systems\u201d, Ser. No. 10\/977,741 filed Oct. 29, 2004, inventors: Rehman et al., which is also assigned to the present assignee.","Many computing devices, including mobile computing devices, are capable of communicating to remote devices over a network like the Internet. In one example, a client-side computing device can allow a user to receive data from and provide data to a web-based application provided by a server. If the web-based application includes XHTML\/XFORMS documents, data submissions are performed while an on-line connection is available. For example, posting of instance data using an XFORM from the computing device to the server requires the network connection and\/or the server to be available at the time when the post operation is requested. If any part of the network is not available at the time of the request, the post operation will fail and the data may be lost. Examples of the network being unavailable include if a wireless network has no signal, a local area network is disconnected, the server is either busy or temporarily down, and the like.","When the computing device loses it's communication with the server, the user can not continue working with the web-based application until the server and\/or the network resumes operation. Additionally, if the user selects an option such as a \u201cnext page\u201d button and the network connection is offline, the server will not be available to respond to the selected option and, thus, cannot identify the next page. An error may be issued and the user will not be able to navigate between web-pages until the system becomes online.","In one example, a system can be configured to provide off-line processing of network communications that allows a user operating a computing device to continue working when network connectivity between the computing device and a remote device is lost or is temporarily unavailable. One example environment where the network connection can be intermittent includes a wireless connection that can periodically change between being online and offline.","Suppose the user is interacting with an online web application and is inputting data through, for example, one or more forms provided by the web application. At various times, the user may submit the inputted data to the web application, which will be referred to a submit request. This may occur, for example, when a button is clicked on the screen that would initiate a network operation such as an HTTP \u201cpost\u201d operation, a \u201cget\u201d operation, or other network communication operation, if programmed as such. Various types of buttons can include a \u201csubmit\u201d button, a \u201cfinished\u201d button, or other type of selectable object that is programmed to submit data to the web application. It will also be appreciated that a submit request can occur programmatically without the user having to click a button.","However, if the network connection is offline at the time of the submit request, one example offline system described herein can allow the user to continue working as though the submit request was successful. If additional submit requests are made while the network connection is offline, the example system can be configured to preserve the submitted data until the network becomes available. Once the network is available, the preserved submitted data can then be posted to the web application in an appropriate sequence to create a synchronized state between the data on the web application and the data on the computing device. In one example, the offline system can operate as a background task that is transparent to the user.","It will be appreciated that the term \u201coffline\u201d or \u201coffline state\u201d will be used to refer to any of a variety of conditions that can result in a non-responsive network. For example, the conditions may include, but are not limited to: when a wireless communication link loses it's signal, when a physical connection is disconnected, when a server or other network component is busy, temporarily unavailable, and\/or disconnected from the network, and the like.","The following includes definitions of selected terms employed herein. The definitions include various examples and\/or forms of components that fall within the scope of a term and that may be used for implementation. The examples are not intended to be limiting. Both singular and plural forms of terms may be within the definitions even when only a singular term is used.","As used in this application, the term \u201ccomputer component\u201d refers to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, software, a combination thereof, or software in execution. For example, a computer component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be computer components. One or more computer components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a computer component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","\u201cComputer communication\u201d or \u201cnetwork communication\u201d, as used herein, refers to a communication between two or more computing devices (e.g., computer, personal digital assistant, cellular telephone) and can be, for example, a network transfer, a file transfer, an applet transfer, an email, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) transfer, and so on. A computer communication can occur across, for example, a wireless system (e.g., IEEE 802.11), an Ethernet system (e.g., IEEE 802.3), a token ring system (e.g., IEEE 802.5), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a point-to-point system, a circuit switching system, a packet switching system, and so on.","Computer-readable medium', as used herein, refers to a medium that participates in directly or indirectly providing signals, instructions and\/or data. A computer-readable medium may take forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, and volatile media. Non-volatile media may include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and so on. Volatile media may Include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, dynamic memory and the like. Common forms of a computer-readable medium include, but are not limited to, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, a magnetic tape, other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, other optical medium, other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a ROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, or other memory chip or card, a memory stick, and other media from which a computer, a processor or other electronic device can read.","\u201cData store\u201d, as used herein, refers to a physical and\/or logical entity that can store data. A data store may be, for example, a database, a table, a file, a list, a queue, a heap, a memory, a register, and so on. A data store may reside in one logical and\/or physical entity and\/or may be distributed between two or more logical and\/or physical entities.","\u201cLogic\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to hardware, firmware, software and\/or combinations of each to perform a function(s) or an action(s), and\/or to cause a function or action from another logic, method, and\/or system. For example, based on a desired application or needs, logic may include a software controlled microprocessor, discrete logic like an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmed logic device like a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a memory device containing instructions, combinations of logic devices, or the like. Logic may include one or more gates, combinations of gates, or other circuit components. Logic may also be fully embodied as software. Where multiple logical logics are described, it may be possible to incorporate the multiple logical logics into one physical logic. Similarly, where a single logical logic is described, it may be possible to distribute that single logical logic between multiple physical logics.","Network Communication Protocol examples include network communications between a client computer and a server that may take place using one of several network protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), file transfer protocol (FTP), Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, Gopher, other available protocol, or a custom protocol. For purposes of simplicity, the examples described herein will be generally described with respect to HTTP.","An \u201coperable connection\u201d, or a connection by which entities are \u201coperably connected\u201d, is one in which signals, physical communications, and\/or logical communications may be sent and\/or received. Typically, an operable connection includes a physical interface, an electrical interface, and\/or a data interface, but it is to be noted that an operable connection may include differing combinations of these or other types of connections sufficient to allow operable control. For example, two entities can be operably connected by being able to communicate signals to each other directly or through one or more intermediate entities like a processor, operating system, a logic, software, or other entity. In the context of a network connection, an operable connection may be created though one or more computing devices and network components. Logical and\/or physical communication channels can be used to create an operable connection.","\u201cSignal\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to one or more electrical or optical signals, analog or digital signals, a bit or bit stream, and\/or other means that can be received, transmitted and\/or detected. A signal can also take other forms such as data, one or more computer or processor instructions, messages, and the like.","\u201cSoftware\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, one or more computer or processor instructions that can be read, interpreted, compiled, and\/or executed and that cause a computer, processor, or other electronic device to perform functions, actions and\/or behave in a desired manner. The instructions may be embodied in various forms like routines, algorithms, modules, methods, threads, and\/or programs including separate applications or code from dynamically linked libraries. Software may also be implemented in a variety of executable and\/or loadable forms including, but not limited to, a stand-alone program, a function call (local and\/or remote), a servelet, an applet, instructions stored in a memory, part of an operating system or other types of executable instructions. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the form of software may be dependent on, for example, requirements of a desired application, the environment in which it runs, and\/or the desires of a designer\/programmer or the like. It will also be appreciated that computer-readable and\/or executable instructions can be located in one logic and\/or distributed between two or more communicating, co-operating, and\/or parallel processing logics and thus can be loaded and\/or executed in serial, parallel, massively parallel and other manners.","Suitable software for implementing the various components of the example systems and methods described herein include programming languages and tools like Java, Pascal, C#, C++, C, CGI, Perl, SQL, APIs, SDKs, assembly, firmware, microcode, and\/or other languages and tools. Software, whether an entire system or a component of a system, may be embodied as an article of manufacture and maintained or provided as part of a computer-readable medium as defined previously. Another form of the software may include signals that transmit program code of the software to a recipient over a network or other communication medium. Thus, in one example, a computer-readable medium has a form of signals that represent the software\/firmware as it is downloaded from a web server to a user. In another example, the computer-readable medium has a form of the software\/firmware as it is maintained on the web server. Other forms may also be used.","\u201cUser\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to one or more persons, software, computers or other devices, or combinations of these.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of methods, algorithms, and\/or symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the art to convey the substance of their work to others. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a sequence of operations that produce a result. The operations may include physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, the physical quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated in a logic and the like.","It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is appreciated that throughout the description, terms like processing, intercepting, storing, redirecting, detecting, determining, displaying, or the like, refer to actions and processes of a computer system, logic, processor, or similar electronic device that manipulates and\/or transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities.","Illustrated in  is one example of an offline processing system such as an offline logic  that is configured to operate within a computing device . The offline logic  can be applicable to operate with a variety of computing devices  such as a computer, a mobile computer, a hand-held computing device, a cellular device, and the like. The computing device  can include a software application  that is configured to communicate with a remote device  using a network connection over a network . The remote device  can include one or more servers that can provide one or more web applications  that can be accessed by a user operating the computing device . The network  can include one or more networks such as a local area network, wireless network, cellular network, intranet, Internet, and\/or combinations of networks.","To facilitate network connectivity, the computing device  can include a communication logic  that can be configured as a network interface to the network . The communication logic  can be configured to operate with a variety of network communication protocols. Examples of network interfaces that can be used are described with reference to .","The application  can be, for example, a browser that allows a user to interact with the web application  once a network connection is established. The browser can include, for example, Netscape communicator, Microsoft's Internet explorer, or any other software application that may be used to interpret and process a markup language, such as HTML, SGML, DHTML, XML, XHTML, XFORMS, or the like. The browser also may include software plug-in applications that allow the browser to interpret, process, and present different types of information. The browser may include any number of application tools, such as, for example, Java, Active X, JavaScript, and Flash. The application  can control the display of web pages that may be provided by the web application  as the user navigates through the web application  (e.g. through web pages and links).","In one example, the web application  may include one or more forms that include one or more input fields that allow a user to enter data and submit the data to the web application . Example forms may include a questionnaire, a purchase order, a user profile, modifiable account information, and the like. As the user enters data into the forms of the web application , input data  is created locally on the computing device .","At various points in time, the user may submit the input data  to the web application  as previously described (e.g. by selecting a submit button\/object). Transmission of the input data  and\/or other types of signals from the computing device  to the remote device  will be generally referred to as \u201cnetwork communications.\u201d Input data  that is successfully received by the web application  is represented by posted data . The posted data  may be used to create and\/or modify data in a database or other type of data store that is used by the web application . A successful transmission assumes that the network connection between the computing device  and the remote device  is in an online state.","If, however, the network connection is in an offline state when a submit request is made, the offline logic  is configured to process the submit request and allow the application  to continue operating. For example, the offline logic  can be configured to redirect network communications sent from the application  and store the network communications in a post data store  rather than prohibiting the submit request and returning an error message to the application . From the point of view of the application  and\/or the user, the network connection can appear as being online and the submit request can appear as being successfully processed. As long as the network connection is offline, network communications can be redirected to the post data store .","In response to the network connection becoming online, the offline logic  can then submit the network communications from the post data store  to the remote device . In one example, the offline logic  can be configured to submit the network communications from the post data store  in a first in, first out sequence. A submit logic  can be provided as part of the offline logic  to handle the submission of data from the post data store . For example, the submit logic  can be configured to execute as a background thread that retrieves each entry from the post data store  and initiates an HTTP Post, an HTTP Get, or other suitable operation to transmit the data from each entry to the remote device . In this manner, the application  can resume its state as though the submitted data was successfully transmitted in the first place.","To determine whether the network connection is in an online state or offline state (e.g. a link status), a link detection logic  can be provided. In one example, the link detection logic  can be configured to periodically and automatically determine the link status while the application  is functioning. In another example, the link detection logic  may also be programmed to be initiated in response to a user request. The link detection logic  can perform one or more tests to receive information about the network connection and\/or network interface. The tests can include, but are not limited to, querying an operating system of the computing device , determining whether an IP address is present, querying one or more network components, pinging a gateway server, getting a response from the remote device , and the like. Certain tests can be programmed to execute more frequently than others depending on how much time, cost, or resources they require.","In one example, the offline logic , and any of its components, can be configured as processor executable instructions provided by a computer-readable medium. The processor executable instructions can execute as one or more background tasks within the computing device . The one or more background tasks can included threads. In another example, the offline logic  can be configured as a browser or software configured to communicate with a browser, and may be part of the application  or software that communicates with the application . Other forms of software will be readily appreciated. Additionally, the offline logic  can be configured to process network communications that are compatible with one or more formats like XForms, XHTML, HTML, gif, MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) compatible communications.","The offline logic  can also allocate a source data store  configured to maintain source documents from the web application . For example, the web application  might include an online employment application that may include five displayable web pages. When a user of the computing device  accesses the web pages of the web application , the offline logic  can be configured to receive one or more documents that define the pages of the employment application in advance (e.g. preload the documents). The pages can be stored in the source data store . The preload can be performed to prepare the computing device  in case of a lost network connection.","In the event that the network connection changes to an offline state, the offline logic  can allow the application  and the user to continue navigating the pages of the employment application by retrieving them from the source data store . For example, suppose a user is currently entering data on page I of the employment application and the network connection is lost. If the user selects a \u201cnext page\u201d button or other type of page navigation function, a network communication will be generated for response by the remote device . However, the remote device  will not be available to identify what the next page is since the system is offline. In this situation, the offline logic  can be configured to redirect the network communications from the application  when the system is offline and process the navigation requests using the source data store . If page  is available in the source data store , it can be retrieved and displayed to the user and allow the user to continue working. In this manner, the offline logic  can simulate an online state. More detailed examples will be described with reference to the example system of .","Illustrated in  is an example offline processing system  that can operate with a client-side computing device. The offline processing system  can include an offline logic  that is configured to process network communications that may be generated by the client-side computing device and directed to a server . It will be appreciated that one or more network components can exist between a network interface of the client-side device (e.g. a network communication manager ) and the server , which are not shown in .","The example offline processing system  will be described as a system configured to process XForms. \u201cXForms\u201d refers to a specification of web forms that can be used with a wide variety of platforms. The XForms specification as well as other related information is described by the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium.) at www.w3.org. XForms is an XML application that represents the next generation of forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into three parts: an XForms model, instance data, and user interface, XForms separates presentation from content, allows reuse, gives strong typing, reduces the number of communication round-trips to a server, as well as offering device independence and a reduced need for scripting.","The offline logic  can be part of a run-time environment including an engine that can process XForms, process XPath (XML Path language), and render XHTML. The run-time environment can be configured for any desired platform such as a JAVA-based platform, a Microsoft-based platform, or the like. In one example, the processing system  can include the offline logic , the network communication manager , an XForms processor , an event routing processor , and a rendering processor\/browser controller . The processing system  can be configured as a client-side stack that plugs into a browser  and enables the browser  to process XForms and other application logic. The system  can be configured using any type of logic such as processor executable instructions provided by a computer-readable medium.","The components of the system  can be generally described as follows. The network communication manager  can be configured to process network communications between the system  and a remote device like the server  over a network communication link. Once the communication link is established, the network communication manager  can receive one or more documents from the server  that represent one or more web pages that display information and\/or allow information to be inputted based on XForms. In one example, the received documents may be in a serialized format that will be reformatted to it's original form.","The XForms processor  is a software application or program that implements and conforms to the XForms specification. The XForms processor  can be configured to perform the reformatting function by parsing the serialized document data, and generating a run-time DOM  (document object module). The document object module is a representation of the components, attributes, formats, and other properties of the document into objects. The DOM  becomes an application programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The DOM  defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. Using the document object module , programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.","A \u201ccontaining document\u201d, as referred to herein as a document, can be an XHTML document, in which one or more model elements are found. XForms processing places no limits on the number of individual forms that can be placed in a single containing document. When a single document contains multiple forms, each form will have a separate model element, each with an identification attribute so that they can be referenced from other portions in the containing document. An XForms Application Deployment file (.xad) is used to define a list of required resources for an application and can be searched to determine properties of a document.","One example of a document is illustrated in . The document  is shown with multiple forms such as three separate displayable pages represented by form , , and . The forms - can be programmatically defined with attributes and linked together so as to allow a user to navigate the pages through displayed page navigation options. For example, a \u201cnext page\u201d button  when selected can cause the next sequential page\/form to be displayed. Similarly, a \u201cback\u201d button  will cause the previous form to be displayed. Another type of page navigation option can include a \u201cGo to Page\u201d option that allows a user to jump to a selected page from an available set of pages. Each form may present information to a user such as table  and\/or one or more data input fields like inputs -.","When the user completes entering data in one or more of the input fields -, a submit button  may be selected that can initiate an operation to transfer the inputted data to the server . This may be performed, for example, using an HTTP post or get operation, or other type of transmission operation. In general, XForms is designed to gather instance data, serialize it into an external representation, and submit the data with a communication protocol to the server .","With reference again to  and the processing system , once a received document is parsed and is ready to display, the document is sent from the XForms processor  to the rendering processor . The rendering processor  is configured to translate the document from an internal representation (e.g. the DOM ) to a format that the browser  understands. The browser  then displays the document. In one example style sheets can be used to help render the document. At this point, one page from the document is displayed. The document may allow a user to enter information through one or more data entry fields. As described in previous examples, the documents received from the server  can be forms that can be completed by a user and submitted back to the server . Examples of forms may include a purchase order, a questionnaire, or other type of document that can include data entry fields.","Additionally, once the document is received by the network communication manager , the document can be processed by the offline logic  and stored in a source data store . The source data store  can be allocated and configured to maintain received documents. The stored documents (and their multiple forms) can then be used to allow a user to continue processing the documents if the network connection is lost (e.g., an offline state). This will be described in greater detail with reference to page navigation examples.","As previously explained, an offline status can be caused by a variety of conditions that include, but are not limited to, a lost communication signal, non-responsive network components, busy or non-responsive server , and the like. In one example, the offline logic  can also be configured to periodically determine the status of the communication link to detect whether the status is online or offline. To determine the status of the network connection, a link detection logic  can be provided. The link detection logic  can be configured to perform a sequence of status tests that can include checking local network interfaces, network components, the server , and\/or other components that may be part of the network communication channel.","Page Navigation Example","In response to the link status changing to an offline state, the offline logic  can be configured to intercept and redirect network communications from the system  to be processed locally by the system . For example, if the browser  is currently displaying \u201cform 1\u201d from document  shown in , and the user selects the next page button , the server  would not be available to identify what the next page is. Rather, the offline logic  can be configured to determine what the next page is by using the source data store . By reviewing attributes of the current page (e.g. form ) stored in the data store , the next page can be determined (e.g. form ). If the next page is available in the source data store , the offline logic  can process the \u201cnext page\u201d request locally by retrieving and providing \u201cform \u201d to the XForms processor  as though \u201cform \u201d was received from the server . The user can thus continue working in an offline state with no interruption. In another example, a minimal interruption may occur if the offline logic  is configured to provide a message to the user indicating that the system is now in an offline state. As long as the source data store  contains forms that are associated to a web application, the user of the system  can navigate the forms in an offline state as though the system were online.","The offline logic  can also be configured to maintain forms from multiple web applications since a user might access different web pages that may activate different web-based applications. Documents received from each different web application can be stored in the source data store  with appropriate attributes that identify it's corresponding web application. Other attributes can also be stored such as to identify navigation properties of each document. Example navigation properties for a selected page\/form can include identifiers for document name, next page, previous page, or other desired attribute. Thus, when the system  is in an offline state and the browser  is currently displaying a selected form, the offline logic  can provide the appropriate document navigation based on the attributes of each form stored in the source data store . In this manner, the offline logic  can provide a simulated online state that can be transparently performed to the user.","Data Submission Example","In the event that a submit request is initiated to submit instance data from a form to the server , the offline logic  can check the link status of the network connection and\/or the submit request can be attempted to determine the link status. If the link status is offline, the offline logic  can be configured to intercept the associated network communications (e.g. including the data to be submitted) to the web application on the server . The data can then be stored in a post data store  until the link status becomes online and the data can be posted to the server . In one example, the post data store  can be configured as a first in, first out queue. Each submitted data (e.g., data -, etc.) can be stored in separate entries in the post data store  along with desired state information. From the browser's point of view (and the user's), it will appear as though the data submitted by the user was successfully posted to the web-based application on the server . The system, thus, can allow the user to continue accessing and processing the one or more forms from the source data store  and continue working rather than having to stop processing due to a networking error.","In response to the link status changing to the online status, which can be detected by the link detection logic , the data stored in the post data store  can then be sequentially transmitted and posted to the server . A submit logic  can be configured to perform the submission process as a background task that is transparent to the user. The data from the post data store  can be posted to the server  in separate operations and in a predetermined sequence that preserves the state of the data. For example, the data can be submitted in a first in, first out sequence. Thus using the offline logic , a simulated online state can be provided during an actual offline state that allows a user to continue working and reduces or prevents data from being lost due to a failed network connection.","It will be appreciated that the offline logic , the link detection logic , and the submit logic  can be embodied as processor executable instructions provided by a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium can be configured as a plug-in for the browser , or can be configured as part of the browser . It will be appreciated that one or more, and any combination of the illustrated components of system  can be implemented together as software provided by a computer-readable medium.","Example methods may be better appreciated with reference to the flow diagrams of . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the illustrated methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks can occur in different orders, occur at different times, and\/or occur concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described. Moreover, less than all the illustrated blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Furthermore, additional and\/or alternative methodologies can employ additional, not illustrated blocks.","In the flow diagrams, blocks denote \u201cprocessing blocks\u201d that may be implemented with logic. In the case where the logic may be software, a flow diagram does not depict syntax for any particular programming language, methodology, or style (e.g., procedural, object-oriented). Rather, a flow diagram illustrates functional information one skilled in the art may employ to develop logic to perform the illustrated processing. It will be appreciated that in some examples, program elements like temporary variables, routine loops, and so on are not shown. It will be further appreciated that electronic and software logic may involve dynamic and flexible processes so that the illustrated blocks can be performed in other sequences that are different from those shown and\/or that blocks may be combined or separated into multiple components. It will be appreciated that the processes may be implemented using various programming approaches like machine language, procedural, object oriented and\/or artificial intelligence techniques.","Each methodology can be embodied by a computer-readable medium that provides processor-executable instructions that are operable with a computing device. The processor executable instructions can be configured to be operable to perform each respective methodology and it's equivalents. The foregoing applies to all methodologies herein.","Illustrated in  is an example methodology  that can be associated with processing a submit operation from a client-side computing device when network connectivity is in an offline state. The example methodology  can initiate by receiving one or more forms from a remote device over a communication link (Block ). The one or more forms can be part of documents that are transmitted from a web-based application that is accessed by the user operating a computing device. The one or more forms can allow data to be processed online by the user such as by inputting data within data entry fields. The one or more forms can then be stored locally to the computing device in preparation for an offline state (Block ). Block  can include pre-loading the forms from the remote device prior to the user accessing all of the forms through the web-based application. For example, if a user accesses page  from a group of forms having ten web pages, some or all of the ten pages can be pre-loaded prior to the user visiting each of the pages.","In response to the communication link changing from an online state to an offline state, a simulated online state can be provided by allowing the user to navigate the one or more forms that are stored (Block ). In response to one or more requests to post data from the one or more forms to the remote device while the communication link is in the offline state, the data to be posted is locally stored in a sequence (Block ). In one example, the sequence can be a first in, first out sequence by storing the data in a queue. The user can continue working with the forms stored locally while the network communication link is in an offline state.","It will be appreciated that the requests to post data or to navigate pages can trigger operations that initiate network communications to be transmitted from the computing device to the remote device, and thus to the web-based application. For example, when a user selects a \u201csubmit button\u201d that may be present on a displayed page, the \u201csubmit button\u201d may be programmed to trigger an event that causes a network communication to be transmitted to the web-based application. An example network communication can be an HTTP Post or Get operation.","To provide a simulated online state during an offline state, these and other network communications generated from the computing device can be intercepted and redirected for local processing on the computing device. In one example, this can be performed transparent to the user. In this manner, the \u201csubmit button\u201d and similar options do not have to be reprogrammed in the web-application in order to function in an offline state. Rather, the web application that provides the \u201csubmit button\u201d can function as normal by initiating a network communication in response to the \u201csubmit button\u201d, but the generated network communications will be redirected and processed locally unknown to the web application.","With further reference to , in response to the communication link changing from the offline state to an online state, the methodology  can retrieve the data to be posted based on the stored sequence and transmit the data to the remote device (Block ). In one example, Block  can be performed transparent to the user such as by executing a background thread or other process within the computing device. Likewise, Block  can also be performed as a background process while allowing the user to continue accessing the one or more forms.","With reference to Block , the methodology can include redirecting a network communication associated with a navigation request to the locally stored data. Similar to the \u201csubmit button\u201d example described above, a navigation request can be associated with a programmed option such as a \u201cnext page\u201d button, a \u201cprevious page\u201d button, and\/or other page navigation options. An example navigation request is one that is programmed to initiate a network communication to the web application where the web application will identify the next page to be transmitted to the user and displayed. It will be appreciated that this type of navigation request differs from the typical \u201cback\u201d or \u201cprevious\u201d functions provided by a browser. These browser functions allow a user to view previously visited web pages that are locally stored and thus, do not initiate or require a network communication to the web application in order to identify the next or previous page. The \u201cback\u201d and \u201cprevious\u201d functions are not active functions of a web application.","To provide offline page navigation, in another example, the methodology  can include determining a page structure of the one or more forms that are received from the remote device. The page structure can be determined by parsing and analyzing attributes of each form and storing each form with it's associated attributes. Examples of attributes can include, but are not limited to, an application name of the web application from which the form originated, a document name associated with the form, and\/or associations to other forms that are accessible from the current form. The user can then be allowed to navigate through the one or more forms while in the offline state using the page structure. In one example, processing for the one or more forms can be provided based on XHTML\/XForms documents.","To determine the status of the communication link, and thus to determine whether offline processing should be initiated, the status can be periodically determined. For example, the status can be automatically determined by a programmatic process and\/or can be triggered by a user.","Illustrated in  is one example of a methodology  that can be associated with providing offline processing. The following example will be described with reference to a client-side computing device that has established network connectivity to a web-based application during an online session.","The methodology  can include storing one or more forms that are from the web-based application as a user navigates the web-based application (Block ). The forms can be stored in a local data store. At any desired time throughout the methodology, the process can detect if the network connectivity is in an online state or in an offline state (Block ). If the network connectivity changes to the offline state, offline processing can be initiated. The offline processing can include intercepting data submitted by the user to the web-based application (Block ). As described in other examples, submitting data would trigger a network communication to the web-based application. Since the network connectivity is offline, the network communication cannot be successfully processed. Rather, the network communication is intercepted and the data to be submitted is stored in a post data store. The user can then be allowed to continue accessing the one or more forms from the local data store as though the data submitted was successfully posted to the web-based application. Data that is subsequently submitted by the user can be stored in a sequence like a first in, first out sequence. If the network connectivity changes to the online state, the data from the post data store can be retrieved and transmitted to the web-based application in a pre-determined sequence (Block ).","In another example, the methodology  can allow the user to navigate the one or more forms from the local data store to simulate network connectivity if the network connectivity changes to the offline state. For example, the methodology can locally process a selected page navigation operation that would result in a network communication if the network connectivity were in the online state. The page navigation operation can be initiated from selectable options such as \u201cnext page\u201d, \u201cprevious page\u201d, \u201cpage go to\u201d, and other types of page navigation functions that may be provided by the web-based application. The methodology  may also preload the one or more forms from the web-based application to the local data store so that the forms can be available should an offline state occur. The one or more forms can also be parsed to at least determine a page structure of each of the forms so that page navigation can be processed during the offline state.","In one example, the computer-readable medium can be configured to provide software that is a browser or a plug-in for a browser. The one or more forms can include one or more data types including XForms-based documents, XHTML documents, HTML documents, mark-up language documents, and MIME-type documents.","Illustrated in  is an example methodology  that can be associated with detecting a status of a network communication link and submitting data to a web application when the communication link changes from an offline state to an online state. In one example, the methodology  can be configured as one or more background processes such as executable threads that can function transparently to a user and\/or client-side application. The example method  can be viewed and\/or configured as multiple processes. For example, Blocks - can be associated with a link detection process and Blocks - can be associated with a data submission process.","The link detection process can be periodically initiated and executed from programmatic commands and\/or from a user command. The term \u201cperiodically\u201d is also intended to include a configuration where the process is continuously active. Detecting the link connection is represented at Block . One or more sequences of tests can be performed to determine whether the link connection is in an online state or an offline state as described in previous examples. If the link connection is offline at Block , a link status signal can be set to represent the offline state (Block ). The link status signal can be used, for example, to initiate offline processing of network communications as described in any one of the previous examples.","If the link connection is in an online state at Block , the link status signal is set to an online state (Block ). In a situation where a computing device was in an offline state and has changed to an online state, meaning that network communication has been re-established, offline processing of data may have occurred. For example, if one or more submit operations occurred during the offline state, data that was intended to be posted to the web application would have been redirected to a post data store as previously explained. At Block , a determination is made whether data exists in the post data store. If no data exists, then no further action is taken and the process can return to detecting the link connection periodically (Block ).","If data exists in the post data store, then a submit operation can be initiated (Block ). Data in the post data queue can then be retrieved according to a pre-determined sequence in which it was stored. The data can then be posted or otherwise transmitted to a network destination (e.g., a web application associated with the data) (Block ). Once the submission is successful, a check can be made to see if additional data exists in the data store (Block ). If there is more data to submit, the process returns to Block  where the next data in the sequence is retrieved and the process is repeated. Once the post data store is empty, the submit process can be terminated.","Illustrated in  is an example methodology  that can be associated with providing offline processing of page navigation functions. An example will be described that is operable with a client-side computing device capable of interacting with an online application using a network connection. The methodology can begin when one or more pages are received from an online application (e.g., a web-based application) (Block ). The one or more pages can include one or more page navigation functions that are selectable by a user. When a selected page navigation function is initiated, the function will generate network communications to be transmitted to the online application in order to respond to the page navigation function. As previously described, examples of page navigation functions include buttons, objects, and\/or links that allow a user to actively move between web pages of the online application. These may include a next page button, a previous page button, page number links from a list of pages, a \u201cpage go to\u201d command, and the like. As a general example, a page navigation function can include a function that requests the online application to change a currently displayed page to a different page.","The pages are then stored in a source data store along with page navigation relationships that are defined between the web pages (Block ). In one example, the one or more web pages are received in a format compatible with XForms and\/or other type of mark-up language. Each page can be analyzed such as by parsing it's attributes to determine the page navigation relationships. Blocks  and  can be performed repeatably as new pages are received from the online application.","When it is detected that the network connection changes to an offline state, network communications that may be generated that are associated with a selected page navigation function are intercepted (Block ). The selected page navigation function can then be processed locally using the source data store and the page navigation relationships to determine the next page (Block ). The next page can then be displayed on the client device. In this manner, a simulated online state can be provided rather than prohibiting the user from working on the online application.","In one example, the intercepting Block  can include redirecting the network communications so that the network communications are responded to locally by the client device. In another example, the intercepting can include prohibiting the network communications from being transmitted over the network connection, which is currently not responding.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["800","802","804","810","808","800","800","830","830","100","205","830"]},"Generally describing an example configuration of the computer , the processor  can be a variety of various processors including dual microprocessor and other multi-processor architectures.
