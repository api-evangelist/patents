For an intermediate transfer system, the toner image is electrostatically transferred via an intermediate transfer belt to a recording medium such as recording paper and is fixed to the recording medium.","Conductive rollers are developed and used in the art to apply a voltage for transferring the toner image from the image carrier to the surface of the intermediate transfer belt.","According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a transfer roller including a conductive support, a first conductive elastic layer disposed on the conductive support, and a second conductive elastic layer disposed on the first conductive elastic layer. A common logarithm of surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is higher than a common logarithm of volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer by about 1 or more.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.","Transfer Roller",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"As shown in , a transfer roller  according to this exemplary embodiment includes, for example, a hollow or solid cylindrical conductive support (shaft) , a first conductive elastic layer  disposed on the outer surface of the conductive support , and a second conductive elastic layer  disposed on the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer .","The common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer  is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer  by 1 or more or about 1 or more. It should be noted that the common logarithm (log \u03a9\/sq) of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer  and the common logarithm (log \u03a9\u00b7cm) of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer  are compared for their values by ignoring their units.","The transfer roller , thus constructed, according to this exemplary embodiment may scatter little toner during transfer.","While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is believed to be as follows.","A transfer roller for use with an image-forming apparatus is disposed opposite an image carrier or a support roller (hereinafter \u201cother roller\u201d). In use, the other roller applies a load to the transfer roller to form a nip (i.e., a region where the transfer roller is pressed by the other roller). As a voltage is applied across the nip, a current flows across the nip from the transfer roller to the other roller or from the other roller to the transfer roller. The transfer roller, however, might cause discharge or leak current in the region around the nip (i.e., a region where the transfer roller is not pressed by the other roller).","If the transfer roller is applied to an image-forming apparatus, the discharge or leak current might scatter toner during transfer, thus causing degradation (blurring) in the resulting image.","For the transfer roller  according to this exemplary embodiment, the common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer  is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer  by 1 or more or about 1 or more. That is, the second conductive elastic layer  is anisotropic in conductivity between the planar and radial directions. The second conductive elastic layer  may therefore allow less current to flow in the planar direction than in the radial direction.","If the transfer roller  forms a nip with another roller in an image-forming apparatus, the transfer roller  may allow a current to flow across the nip from the transfer roller to the other roller or from the other roller to the transfer roller without causing substantial discharge or leak current in the region around the nip.","If the transfer roller  is applied to an image-forming apparatus, therefore, the transfer roller  may scatter little toner during transfer, thus causing little degradation (blurring) in the resulting image.","As used herein, the term \u201cplanar direction\u201d refers to a direction parallel to a plane.","The illustrated structure is not intended to be limiting. For example, the transfer roller  according to this exemplary embodiment may include an intermediate layer between the first conductive elastic layer  and the conductive support . The transfer roller  may also include a resistance-adjusting layer or transfer-preventing layer between the first conductive elastic layer  and the second conductive elastic layer .","The components of the transfer roller  according to this exemplary embodiment will now be described in detail.","Conductive Support","The conductive support  functions both as an electrode and as a support for the transfer roller .","The conductive support  is made of, for example, a metal such as iron (e.g., free-cutting steel), copper, brass, stainless steel, aluminum, or nickel.","The conductive support  may also be, for example, a member (e.g., a resin or ceramic member) having the outer surface thereof plated or a member (e.g., a resin or ceramic member) having a conductor dispersed therein.","The conductive support  may be either a hollow member (tubular member) or a solid member.","First Conductive Elastic Layer","The first conductive elastic layer  contains, for example, a rubber (elastomer) and optionally a conductor and other additives.

If the second conductive elastic layer  is provided by stretching a tubular elastic member in the radial direction, as described later, an unfoamed conductive elastic layer may be used to ensure sufficient strength.","The second conductive elastic layer  is, for example, tensioned to come into close contact with the first conductive elastic layer . For example, the tubular elastic member that forms the second conductive elastic layer  is stretched in the radial direction, but not in the longitudinal direction, to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer .","The second conductive elastic layer  formed by the tubular elastic member stretched in the radial direction may be anisotropic in conductivity, i.e., may allow less current to flow in the planar direction than in the radial direction.","The second conductive elastic layer  may be more anisotropic as the elongation of the tubular elastic member in the radial direction is higher.

This may allow smooth charge transfer between the first conductive elastic layer  and the second conductive elastic layer , thus accumulating little charge therebetween. As a result, the transfer roller  may maintain its volume resistivity.

The transfer unit includes the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment.","The transfer unit employs, for example, a direct transfer system or an intermediate transfer system. The direct transfer system includes a transfer roller alone. The intermediate transfer system includes an intermediate transfer member having a surface to which a toner image is transferred from the surface of the image carrier, a first transfer roller that transfers the toner image from the surface of the image carrier to the surface of the intermediate transfer member, and a second transfer roller that transfers the toner image from the surface of the intermediate transfer member to the recording medium. The transfer unit includes the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment as at least one of the above rollers.","The image-forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment may be, for example, a monochrome image-forming apparatus including a developing device containing a monochrome toner, an image-forming apparatus that directly transfers a toner image from an image carrier to a recording medium, a color image-forming apparatus that sequentially transfers toner images from image carriers to an intermediate transfer member, or a tandem color image-forming apparatus in which image carriers provided with developing devices for different colors are arranged in tandem along an intermediate transfer member.","A process cartridge according to this exemplary embodiment is, for example, attachable to and detachable from the above image-forming apparatus. The process cartridge according to this exemplary embodiment includes at least the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment. Specifically, the process cartridge according to this exemplary embodiment includes at least one unit selected from the group consisting of an image carrier, a charging unit that charges a surface of the image carrier, a latent-image forming unit that forms a latent image on the charged surface of the image carrier, and a developing unit that develops the latent image formed on the surface of the image carrier with a toner to form a toner image; and a transfer unit that transfers the toner image from the surface of the image carrier to a recording medium. The transfer unit includes the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment.","The image-forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment will now be described with reference to the drawings.  is a schematic view of the image-forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment.","The image-forming apparatus illustrated in  includes first to fourth electrophotographic image-forming units Y, M, C, and K that produce yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K) images, respectively, based on color separation image data. The image-forming units (hereinafter \u201cunits\u201d) Y, M, C, and K are arranged in parallel at a particular spacing in the horizontal direction. The units Y, M, C, and K may also be process cartridges attachable to and detachable from the image-forming apparatus.","An intermediate transfer belt , provided as an intermediate transfer member, extends over the units Y, M, C, and K in . The intermediate transfer belt  is entrained about a drive roller  and a support roller  spaced apart from each other in the direction from the left to the right in  and disposed in contact with the inner surface of the intermediate transfer belt . The transfer unit of the image-forming apparatus is configured such that the intermediate transfer belt  travels in the direction from the first unit Y toward the fourth unit K.","A spring (not shown), for example, biases the support roller  in the direction away from the drive roller  to apply a particular tension to the intermediate transfer belt  entrained about the two rollers  and . An intermediate-transfer-member cleaning device  is disposed opposite the drive roller  on the image carrier side of the intermediate transfer belt .","The units Y, M, C, and K include developing devices (developing units) Y, M, C, and K, respectively, to which yellow, magenta, cyan, and black toners can be supplied from toner cartridges Y, M, C, and K, respectively.","The first to fourth units Y, M, C, and K have the same structure. The description herein will concentrate on the first unit Y, which is located upstream in the travel direction of the intermediate transfer belt  and which forms a yellow image. The elements of the second to fourth units M, C, and K corresponding to those of the first unit Y are designated by like numerals followed by \u201cM\u201d (magenta), \u201cC\u201d (cyan), and \u201cK\u201d (black), respectively, rather than \u201cY\u201d (yellow), and are not further described herein.","The first unit Y includes a photoreceptor Y that functions as an image carrier. The photoreceptor Y is surrounded by, in sequence, a charging roller Y that charges the surface of the photoreceptor Y to a particular potential, an exposure device  that exposes the charged surface to a laser beam Y based on a color separation image signal to form an electrostatic image, a developing device (developing unit) Y that supplies a charged toner to the electrostatic image to develop the electrostatic image, a first transfer roller (first transfer unit) Y that transfers the developed image to the intermediate transfer belt , and a photoreceptor-cleaning device (cleaning unit) Y that removes residual toner from the surface of the photoreceptor Y with a cleaning blade after the first transfer.","The first transfer roller Y is disposed opposite the photoreceptor Y inside the intermediate transfer belt . The first transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K have connected thereto bias power supplies (not shown) that apply a first transfer bias thereto. A controller (not shown) controls the bias power supplies to change the transfer bias applied to the first transfer rollers Y, M, C, and K.","The image-forming operation of the first unit Y will now be described. Before the operation, the charging roller Y charges the surface of the photoreceptor Y to a potential of about \u2212600 to about \u2212800 V.","The photoreceptor Y includes a conductive substrate (having a volume resistivity at 20\u00b0 C. of 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm or less) and a photosensitive layer disposed on the substrate. The photosensitive layer, which normally has high resistivity (comparable to the resistivity of common resins), has the property of changing its resistivity in a region irradiated with the laser beam Y. The exposure device  directs the laser beam Y onto the charged surface of the photoreceptor Y based on yellow image data received from the controller (not shown). The laser beam Y irradiates the photosensitive layer of the photoreceptor Y to form an electrostatic image with a yellow print pattern on the surface of the photoreceptor Y.","The electrostatic image is an image formed by the charge on the surface of the photoreceptor Y. Specifically, the electrostatic image is a negative latent image formed on the surface of the photoreceptor Y after the charge dissipates from the region irradiated with the laser beam Y, where the resistivity drops, while remaining in the region not irradiated with the laser beam Y.","As the photoreceptor Y rotates, the electrostatic image formed on the photoreceptor Y is brought to a particular development position where the electrostatic image is visualized (developed) by the developing device Y.","The developing device Y contains, for example, a yellow toner. The yellow toner is charged to the same polarity (negative) as the photoreceptor Y by friction as it is stirred inside the developing device Y. The charged yellow toner is carried by a developer roller (developer carrier). As the surface of the photoreceptor Y passes through the developing device Y, the yellow toner is electrostatically attracted to the latent image, which is neutral, on the surface of the photoreceptor Y. The yellow toner thus develops the latent image. The photoreceptor Y carrying the yellow toner image rotates at a particular speed to transport the toner image developed on the photoreceptor Y to a particular first transfer position.","When the yellow toner image on the photoreceptor Y is transported to the first transfer position, a particular first transfer bias is applied to the first transfer roller Y. The toner image is transferred from the photoreceptor Y to the intermediate transfer belt  by electrostatic force acting from the photoreceptor Y toward the first transfer roller Y. The transfer bias applied has the opposite polarity (positive) to the toner (negative). The transfer bias is controlled to, for example, about +10 \u03bcA in the first unit Y by the controller (not shown).","The cleaning device Y removes and collects residual toner from the photoreceptor Y.","The controller similarly controls the first transfer biases applied to the first transfer rollers M, C, and K of the second to fourth units M, C, and K.","Thus, the intermediate transfer belt  having the yellow toner image transferred thereto by the first unit Y is sequentially transported through the second to fourth units M, C, and K, which superimpose toner images of the respective colors on top of each other.","The intermediate transfer belt , having the toner images of the four colors superimposed thereon through the first to fourth units Y, M, C, and K, reaches a second transfer section. The second transfer section includes the intermediate transfer belt , the support roller  disposed in contact with the inner surface of the intermediate transfer belt , and a second transfer roller (second transfer unit)  disposed on the image carrier side of the intermediate transfer belt . A recording medium P is fed into a nip between the second transfer roller  and the intermediate transfer belt  at a particular timing by a feed mechanism. A particular second transfer bias is applied to the support roller . The transfer bias applied has the same polarity (negative) as the toner (negative). The toner image is transferred from the intermediate transfer belt  to the recording medium P by electrostatic force acting from the intermediate transfer belt  toward the recording medium P. The second transfer bias is determined depending on the resistance detected by a resistance detector (not shown) that detects the resistance of the second transfer section, and the voltage is controlled accordingly.","The recording medium P is transported to a fixing device (fixing unit) . The fixing device  fixes the toner images to the recording medium P by fusing together the superimposed toner images with heat.
