{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to software testing technology and, more particularly, relate to an apparatus, computer program product and method for providing an interactive network simulator.","Paper served as the basic medium for handling information for the health care industry for many years. From the scholarly work reporting on medical studies, to health records and prescriptions, nearly every aspect of health care related information and processes was formerly managed using paper. However, as the amazing potential of network computing has been applied to the health care industry, many of the old ways are rapidly changing.","By implementing computers and network computing into the health care industry, information management and the actual provision of medical care has rapidly improved. As evidenced by the development of electronic medical records, the ability to handle prescriptions and order entries electronically, and the development of numerous software and hardware electronic devices that improve capabilities in all areas of providing medical services, the health care industry is in a period of rapid change.","As indicated above, part of the rapid change being experienced in the health care industry is occurring in relation to the development of new software for improving various aspects of information management by developing new services and applications associated with network computing environments. The services and applications that are developed, and continue to be developed are typically supported by a combination of hardware platforms and corresponding software. For example, a new software release may be planned for integration on a computer system that interacts with other existing and perhaps external systems. Accordingly, it is important that, when developing a new software release, compatibility and interoperability be accounted for with respect to the external systems. However, new software is often produced with some level of urgency to get to market and significant risk of damage to marketability if potential problems are not identified prior to release. Thus, it may be important that software testing be enabled to start as early as possible from a business perspective, in order to ensure that overall time in getting a quality product to market can be minimized.","To accomplish the task of enabling testing for interoperability, developers typically need to \u201cfake\u201d the corresponding external systems. Currently, there are static, preconfigured simulators that are typically employed to conduct testing with third party live test networks. The simulators are typically required to be configured to give a certain kind of response before activity is started. Then, orders may be processed to generate the configured response. Accordingly, for different responses, activity must be stopped in order to reconfigure the simulator to provide the corresponding different response.","For interaction with a relatively simple external system, the above described mechanism for testing may be adequate, although a bit in flexible. However, with some new and complex systems that are currently being developed, complicated and asynchronous responses may be provided by the external networks. This makes simulators like those described above fall significantly short because, for example, the number of different kinds of messages and values of parameters in the messages can be so large and various that conventional simulators may not be able to effectively handle simulating such new and complex systems.","Accordingly, it may be desirable to provide a network simulator that may address some of the issues mentioned above.","A method, computer program product and apparatus are therefore provided that may enable the provision of an interactive network simulator. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may provide a mechanism by which storage may be provided for communications exchanged between a system under test and a testing platform designed to simulate network devices with which the system under test may be operable. Stored information may be made accessible by one or more users conducting testing of compatibility of the system under test with the simulated network devices. In some cases, the access may be provided via a web browser type interface provided by the testing platform. Thus, for example, compatibility testing may be accomplished by multiple individuals in a flexible and user friendly environment.","In one exemplary embodiment, a method of providing an interactive network simulator is provided. The method may include receiving an indication of messages or responses exchanged between a testing platform simulating one or more external systems and a system under test, storing data corresponding to the indications received, and providing for a visual display of information related to the indications received to a user interacting with the testing platform.","In another exemplary embodiment, a computer program product for providing an interactive network simulator is provided. The computer program product may include at least one computer-readable storage medium having computer-executable program code instructions stored therein. The computer-executable program code instructions may include program code instructions for receiving an indication of messages or responses exchanged between a testing platform simulating one or more external systems and a system under test, storing data corresponding to the indications received, and providing for a visual display of information related to the indications received to a user interacting with the testing platform.","In another exemplary embodiment, an apparatus for providing an interactive network simulator is provided. The apparatus may include processing circuitry configured to at least perform receiving an indication of messages or responses exchanged between a testing platform simulating one or more external systems and a system under test, storing data corresponding to the indications received, and providing for a visual display of information related to the indications received to a user interacting with the testing platform.","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, embodiments of the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. Additionally, the terms \u201cmodule\u201d and \u201csub-module\u201d may be used interchangeably herein to refer to a portion or part, but these terms do not necessarily suggest that the portions or parts associated therewith are isolated from each other or \u201cmodular\u201d in that they do not, or could not, share certain code segments or instructions.","As indicated above, embodiments of the present invention are aimed at providing a mechanism by which to provide network simulation capabilities. Moreover, embodiments of the present invention may provide an interactive network simulator. Thus, rather than requiring numerous uninterruptable start and stop cycles to provide configuration of a simulator to return an acceptable response for a given query or interaction that is being simulated with an external system, embodiments of the present invention may enable use of a web browser to control a network simulator for dynamic and interruptible network simulation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"30"},"Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment, the apparatus  may include or otherwise be in communication with processing circuitry  that is configured to perform data processing, application execution and other processing and management services according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, the processing circuitry  may include a processor , a storage device  that may be in communication with or otherwise control a user interface  and a device interface . As such, the processing circuitry  may be embodied as a circuit chip (e.g., an integrated circuit chip) configured (e.g., with hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software) to perform operations described herein. However, in some embodiments, the processing circuitry  may be embodied as a portion of a server, computer, laptop, workstation or even one of various mobile computing devices. In situations where the processing circuitry  is embodied as a server or at a remotely located computing device, the user interface  may be disposed at another device (e.g., at a computer terminal or client device such as one of the clients ) that may be in communication with the processing circuitry  via the device interface  and\/or a network.","The user interface  may be in communication with the processing circuitry  to receive an indication of a user input at the user interface  and\/or to provide an audible, visual, mechanical or other output to the user. As such, the user interface  may include, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, a display, a touch screen, a microphone, a speaker, a cell phone, or other input\/output mechanisms.","The device interface  may include one or more interface mechanisms for enabling communication with other devices and\/or networks. In some cases, the device interface  may be any means such as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software that is configured to receive and\/or transmit data from\/to a network and\/or any other device or module in communication with the processing circuitry . In this regard, the device interface  may include, for example, an antenna (or multiple antennas) and supporting hardware and\/or software for enabling communications with a wireless communication network and\/or a communication modem or other hardware\/software for supporting communication via cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), universal serial bus (USB), Ethernet or other methods. In situations where the device interface  communicates with a network, the network may be any of various examples of wireless or wired communication networks such as, for example, data networks like a Local Area Network (LAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), and\/or a Wide Area Network (WAN), such as the Internet.","In an exemplary embodiment, the storage device  may include one or more memory devices such as, for example, volatile and\/or non-volatile memory that may be either fixed or removable. The storage device  may be configured to store information, data, applications, instructions or the like for enabling the apparatus to carry out various functions in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For example, the storage device  could be configured to buffer input data for processing by the processor . Additionally or alternatively, the storage device  could be configured to store instructions for execution by the processor . As yet another alternative, the storage device  may include one of a plurality of databases (e.g., of the database server ) that may store a variety of files, contents or data sets. Among the contents of the storage device , applications (e.g., the rational range transform manager ) may be stored for execution by the processor  in order to carry out the functionality associated with each respective application.","The processor  may be embodied in a number of different ways. For example, the processor  may be embodied as various processing means such as a microprocessor or other processing element, a coprocessor, a controller or various other computing or processing devices including integrated circuits such as, for example, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit), an FPGA (field programmable gate array), a hardware accelerator, or the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the processor  may be configured to execute instructions stored in the storage device  or otherwise accessible to the processor . As such, whether configured by hardware or software methods, or by a combination thereof, the processor  may represent an entity (e.g., physically embodied in circuitry) capable of performing operations according to embodiments of the present invention while configured accordingly. Thus, for example, when the processor  is embodied as an ASIC, FPGA or the like, the processor  may be specifically configured hardware for conducting the operations described herein. Alternatively, as another example, when the processor  is embodied as an executor of software instructions, the instructions may specifically configure the processor  to perform the operations described herein.","In an exemplary embodiment, the processor  (or the processing circuitry ) may be embodied as, include or otherwise control a simulator engine  and an interface manager . The simulator engine  and the interface manager  may each be any means such as a device or circuitry that may be operating in accordance with software or otherwise embodied in hardware or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., processor  operating under software control, the processor  embodied as an ASIC or FPGA specifically configured to perform the operations described herein, or a combination thereof) thereby configuring the device or circuitry to perform the corresponding functions of the simulator engine  and the interface manager , respectively, as described below.","In an exemplary embodiment, the simulator engine  may include simulator software code defining a process control entity for the simulated system. As such, for example, the simulator engine  may be software configured to emulate a controller or processor of the system being simulated. In some examples, the simulator engine  may further include code or instructions for management of various modules or sub-modules corresponding to different external systems to be simulated in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention as described herein. For example, one module (or sub-module) could relate to a credit processing system, another module could relate to a pill dispensing system and still another module could relate to a prescription processing system. As such, a model of the systems with which software being developed (e.g. system under test) may interact can be tested by including various sub-modules (e.g., modeled processing circuitry, memory, control registers, etc.) that describe corresponding model code that is associated with each respective system in terms of the characteristic, activity, functionality or capability of the system being simulated. Thus, for example, a first sub-module , a second sub-module , and a third sub-module  may each be modeled to correspond to a respective different systems and their corresponding functionalities.","In an exemplary embodiment, the sub-modules (or only one sub-module if testing is only done with respect to one external system) may be modeled based on information indicative of the possible responses that may be received from each respective sub-module for outputs from the software to be tested. As such, for example, the simulator engine  may include or otherwise reference an external database storing an ontology of possible responses for one or more external systems. In some cases, the sub-modules may be built based on specifications provided by the respective systems being modeled by each respective sub-module. In some cases, the specifications provided may be used to fill fields or blocks defining the ontology accessed by the simulator engine . However, in an alternative example embodiment, one or more of the sub-modules may actually represent an external system operating in a test mode. In such examples, the external system may provide access to systems such as the system under test to receive various test messages similar to the messages that may otherwise be provided by a model of the external system in other embodiments.","In an exemplary embodiment, the simulator engine  and the sub-modules (e.g., the first sub-module , the second sub-module  and the third sub-module ) may together define a virtual testing platform comprising a software implemented model of systems that may be used to test or execute software (e.g., a software application , operating system, driver, middleware, etc.) via a host platform (which in this example is the apparatus  or more specifically the processing circuitry ). Thus, according to an exemplary embodiment, execution of the software application  acting as a system under test, which may be, for example, a software package in development or testing stages, may be accomplished via the virtual testing platform. By enabling execution of the software application  via the virtual testing platform, performance criteria may be evaluated and responses to various interactions with respective sub-modules may be monitored.","In an example embodiment, the simulator engine  may store a record of each messages sent to an external system (or model thereof) and the corresponding response received by the software application  in response to the message sent. In some cases, the records may be stored in a record repository . The record repository  may be a portion of the storage device  or some other memory location accessible to the simulator engine . The simulator engine  may then provide the records to the interface manager  for presentation to one or more users conducting testing of the software application . However, in some embodiments, the interface manager  may access the record repository  directly.","The interface manager  may be configured to present a graphic display of information relating to the testing conducted by the simulator engine  via the user interface . As such, for example, the interface manager  may be configured to manage presentation of content (e.g., content regarding messages sent and responses received between the system under test and external systems) to one or more users. In an example embodiment, contents of the record repository  may be presented by the interface manager  via a web page offered in a web browser interface. Thus, a user conducting testing of the software application  may be enabled to view a record of the messages sent from the software application  and responses received from sub-modules being modeled for testing of the software application  in a relatively easy to digest format that is familiar to many users.","As indicated above, the interface manager  may provide the display to multiple users. Thus, in an example embodiment, multiple different users may be enabled to conduct testing of the software application  (or system under test). In some cases, the interface manager  may be configured to provide only the messages and corresponding responses that are associated with the particular user conducting the corresponding testing. In other words, if multiple users are conducting testing, a particular user may only be provided with a graphic display of the messages and responses that correspond to the testing the particular user is conducting. Thus, the particular user will not be burdened with having to filter through messages and responses that do not relate to the particular user's testing. Instead, each user may be enabled to receive information specific to the user's own testing activities via the web browser of the user at the user's respective computer or access terminal that may remotely connect to the apparatus . In some cases, individual users may have specific user names or other identification mechanisms provided (e.g., derived from the IP address of each respective user) associated with each user so that messages and responses can be recorded in association with the user to which such messages and responses correlate. Each message or response may be stored with the corresponding identity of the originator of the message or response (e.g., the corresponding user or the identity of the system under test component or sub-module).","In an example embodiment, the interface manager  may provide a mechanism by which the user may guide the testing process and thereby manage interaction with the simulator engine . For example, the interface manager  may provide a plurality of message options from which a user may select. The user may also be enabled to select values to include in messages constructed. Thus, a user crafted message, with perhaps user crafted values, may then be provided to the software application . The user may also be enabled to select specific messages or responses to receive more detailed information regarding the corresponding messages or responses. As such, the interface manager  may display potential requests that may be received from any one of the sub-modules. Accordingly, the user can select a request to which the user would like to provide a response.","In some embodiments, the interface manager  may provide the interface via Java REST servlets to service an Internet browser on a computer of a user conducting testing (e.g., a tester) using AJAX technology, Javascript and\/or XML. Thus, for example, the tester may have a PC or other computer terminal that is used to remotely access (e.g., via a network) the apparatus .  shows an exemplary network  by which the user may be enabled to access the apparatus . In an exemplary embodiment, the network  may include the apparatus , to which various clients , computers, databases, servers or other like devices may be operably connected. As shown in , one or more clients  (e.g., PCs or other computing devices) may be enabled to access the apparatus  via the network . The network  may be a data network, such as a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), and\/or the like, which may couple clients  to devices such as processing elements (e.g., personal computers, server computers or the like) or databases. Communication between the network , the clients  and the devices or databases (e.g., servers) to which the clients  are coupled may be accomplished by either wireline or wireless communication mechanisms and corresponding protocols. The connection between the apparatus  and the clients  associated with various different testers (i.e., the network ) may be considered to be a back door network. Meanwhile, the connection between the apparatus  and the software application  comprising the system under test may be considered to be a front door network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may provide a mechanism by which messages and responses exchanged between a system under test and a testing platform may be stored. All stored information may be accessible by one or more users via a web browser type interface provided by the testing platform. The testing platform may also provide users with an ability to access specific messages and responses and even craft responses to certain request messages. Thus, users may be provided with relatively flexible access to testing systems or applications in a user friendly environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Accordingly, blocks of the flowchart support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of steps for performing the specified functions and program instruction means for performing the specified functions. It will also be understood that one or more blocks of the flowchart, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based computer systems which perform the specified functions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","In this regard, one embodiment of a method for providing an interactive network simulator, as shown in , includes receiving an indication of messages or responses exchanged between a testing platform simulating one or more external systems and a system under test at operation  and storing data corresponding to the indications received at operation . The method may further include providing for a visual display of information related to the indications received to a user interacting with the testing platform at operation .","In some embodiments, certain ones of the operations above may be modified or further amplified as described below.

In this regard, for example, the method may further include enabling a user to select a stored request to generate a response to the request with user selectable values at operation . In some embodiments, storing data corresponding to the indications received may include storing each message or response in association with an identity of an entity from which each respective message or response originated. In some cases, storing data may include storing corresponding messages or responses for a plurality of users. In an example embodiment, providing for the visual display may include providing a particular user of the plurality of users with a display only of messages or responses associated with the particular user. In some embodiments, providing for the visual display may include providing the visual display at a remote device of the user via a web browser.","In an exemplary embodiment, an apparatus for performing the method of  above may comprise a processor (e.g., the processor ) configured to perform some or each of the operations (-) described above. The processor may, for example, be configured to perform the operations (-) by performing hardware implemented logical functions, executing stored instructions, or executing algorithms for performing each of the operations.
