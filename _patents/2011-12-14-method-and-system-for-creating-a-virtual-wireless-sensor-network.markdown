The WSN is deployed to monitor either physical or environmental conditions. The monitoring may happen periodically without human intervention. The condition may include at least one of a temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion and pollutant. Based on the requirements, potential applications may be developed for deploying the WSN in industries for monitoring one or more such conditions.","The WSN application may also be used to actuate an electrical device. To actuate such an electrical device, a command may be sent wirelessly to a corresponding sensor node, where the electrical device is connected.","The process of developing such an application includes writing codes in the physical WSN based on components and wiring that are different from traditional coding techniques. However, the process of developing the application suffers from one or more of the following limitations: The sensor nodes of the physical WSN may contain a very low amount of memory. The low amount of memory available on the nodes may create difficulty for a developer to write the code in the sensor nodes for creating the application. Further, the developer may require knowledge of dealing with complex and low-level application programming interfaces (APIs) of various resources or niceties in the sensor node of the physical WSN.","Thus, in light of the foregoing discussion, there is a need for a system and a method to obtain resource details of the physical WSN and enable the developer to easily create the applications. Further, the system and method should not require the developer to have knowledge of complex and low-level APIs of resources in the sensor node of the physical WSN.","One objective of the present invention is to create a virtual WSN, which reflects the one or more sensor nodes of the physical WSN.","Another objective of the present invention includes providing means for accessing various resources or niceties in the sensor nodes in the physical WSN for the developer to build the application just by focusing on the application logic, rather than resource details of physical WSN.","A method and system of creating a virtual wireless sensor network (WSN) corresponding to a physical WSN are disclosed. Also, a method of building an application using such a virtual WSN is disclosed. Such a method may help a developer in building the application just by focusing on the application logic, rather than on resource details of the physical WSN.","In one embodiment of the present technique, a computer implemented method of creating a virtual wireless sensor network WSN includes the step of extracting one or more niceties of a physical WSN. The step of extracting the one or more niceties comprises determining a communication mode between a plurality of sensor nodes of the physical WSN and a base station, and segregating a plurality of packets exchanged by the plurality of sensor nodes of the physical WSN and the base station. Further, the step of extracting includes identifying a source sensor node and a traversed network path of the plurality of segregated packets and transforming at least one of sensor data and control data from the plurality of segregated packets into a predefined format.","Further, the step of creating the virtual sensor network includes the step of embedding at least one of the extracted niceties in a soft object to represent one or more sensor nodes of the physical WSN.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the step of extracting the niceties of the physical WSN masks the communication details, networking, and provides higher-level abstractions to virtual layer or the soft object to aid the developer in application development. Thus, in one embodiment of the present technique, the virtual layer may assist the developers in creating applications without knowing the low-level details of the physical system, which includes knowledge of specific programming languages or being bound to specific platform for developing a WSN application.","In another embodiment of the present technique, a computer implemented method of building an application using such a virtual WSN is disclosed.","The step of building an application using a virtual WSN includes the step of identifying a plurality of sensor nodes of a physical WSN embedded in the form of a soft object for creating the application. Further, the step includes obtaining access to one or more niceties of the plurality of identified sensor nodes embedded in the soft object through a graphical user interface (GUI) for updating the one or more niceties of the plurality of identified sensor nodes in the soft object to obtain a desired functionality of the application. Finally, the step includes deploying such changes on a corresponding sensor node in the physical WSN by transferring the update performed on the identified sensor nodes in the soft object to build the desired application.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the soft object, which represents one or more sensor nodes of the physical WSN, is in at least one of an XML format, a comma separated value (csv) format, and a Java object format.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the soft object or a virtual layer consisting of virtual sensor nodes is provided as an interface to relieve the developer from dealing with complex and low-level application programming interfaces (APIs) of various resources in the sensor nodes of the physical WSN.","The following description is full and informative description of the best method and system presently contemplated for carrying out the present invention, which is known to the inventors at the time of filing the patent application.

As such, the present description should be considered as merely illustrative of the principles of the present technique and not in limitation thereof, since the present technique is defined solely by the claims.","The present invention relates to a method and system for creating a virtual WSN corresponding to a physical WSN. The method also discusses an approach for building an application using the virtual WSN. The inventive technique to be detailed in the subsequent sections also explains numerous variations that may be used to implement the inventive steps of the present technique in terms of one or more embodiments.","The following description is presented to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of the requirement for obtaining a patent.

The soft object may mask the communication & networking details and may provide high level abstractions in the upper layer to the developer to alleviate building WSN application.","Referring to the figures,  is a flow diagram depicting a method of creating the virtual WSN, according to one embodiment of the present technique.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the method comprises: 1) extracting one or more niceties of a physical WSN (block ), wherein extracting the one or more niceties comprises the sub steps of 1a) determining a communication mode between a plurality of sensor nodes of the physical WSN and a base station (block A), 1b) segregating a plurality of packets exchanged by the plurality of sensor nodes of the physical WSN and the base station (block D), 1c) identifying a source sensor nodes and a traversed network path of the plurality of segregated packets (block G), 1d) transforming at least one of sensor data and control data from the plurality of segregated packets into a predefined format (block J), 1e) decoding the response received from the one or more sensor nodes by the WSN server application (block M), and 2) embedding at least one of the extracted niceties in a soft object to represent one or more sensor nodes of the physical WSN (block ). Each of these steps is explained in detail in the subsequent sections.","The method of creating a virtual WSN begins with a step of extracting one or more niceties of a physical WSN as represented by block . In one embodiment of the present technique, the niceties include minutiae of one or more sensor nodes of a physical WSN.","The step of extracting the one or more niceties comprises one or more sub steps.

In one embodiment of the present technique, the communication mode includes at least one of serial communication, USB communication, Ethernet communication and wireless communication.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the determined communication modes are translated into details of a predetermined communication mode irrespective of the type of communication mode used between the sensor nodes and the base station to communicate.

In one embodiment of the present invention, the middleware application may determine the communication mode details automatically by sending one or more handshake data packets or messages to an hardware interface of a gateway through which the base station and the sensor nodes are connected for communication. The handshake data may be transmitted in a sequential format i.e. in Ethernet mode, USB mode, Serial port mode and Parallel port mode or the like. The sequence may vary depending on the underlying middleware and application requirement. The hardware interface may acknowledge such one or more handshake packets, which it may able to interpret. Based on the acknowledgement, the communication between the base station and the sensor nodes is established and the identified communication modes details are converted into a base format for virtual WSN network for further interpretation. The rest of the communication modes of the gateway between the sensor nodes and the base station are disabled. The disabled information is also recorded in the base format for virtual WSN network for further interpretation.","In another embodiment of the present technique, the middleware application may determine the communication mode details manually. The manual process may include providing a graphical user interface for the selection of the communication mode between the base station and the one or sensor nodes.","The step of extracting the niceties further comprises a process of segregating the plurality of packets into at least one of a data packet and a non-data packet, as represented by block D. The plurality of packets may be exchanged between the one or more sensor nodes and the base station.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the data packets may include at least one of a header section and a body section. The header section of the data packet includes at least one of the following: a source identity (source sensor nodes), a destination identity (destination sensor nodes), an importance level, a group identity, a parent sensor node identity, a last forwarded sensor node identity, a hop count number, a sequence number of the information data packet, or combinations thereof. Similarly, the body section of the data packet includes at least one of the following: monitored information gathered from the sensor nodes' reading, a reply message from the sensor nodes to a request message sent from the base station, a reply for a plurality of acknowledgement sent from the base station, or combinations thereof.","The body section of the data packet may help in determining the type of data or message being exchanged between the sensor nodes and the base station. The message may include at least one of a control message and a sensor message. The control messages are always sent from the base station, unlike the sensor messages, which are sent from the one or more sensor nodes of the physical WSN. The control message may include instruction information, from the base station, for at least one or more sensor nodes to perform certain actions based on receipt of the same. The sensor message may include any general information which the base station may want from the respective sensor nodes, to sense and send periodically, depending on the WSN application for which the sensor nodes are deployed.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the packets are available in a circular queue. The step of segregation (block D) may further include processing of the packets based on their type. The packet type may depend on a platform and an operating system that are used in the sensor nodes or the base station. The processing of the packet involves extracting each field (i.e. header or body) and interpreting it to determine what subsequent action needs to be performed.","The step of extracting the niceties additionally comprises a process of identifying the source sensor node and traversed network paths of the plurality of segregated packets, as represented by block G.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the identification of the source sensor node may include identifying information of the sensor node that is generating the data packet. The traversed network path may include the identity information of at least one of the source sensor node, an intermediate sensor node, a destination sensor node and one or more optimal paths followed by the data packet to reach the base station.","The intermediate sensor nodes may be one or more sensor nodes that are close to the source sensor nodes. Similarly, the destination sensor node is at least one of the sensor nodes or the base station itself, to which the data packets are destined. The destination sensor node identity may include the identity details of the intermediate sensor nodes, to which the data packet is intended to be shared from the source sensor node.","The optimal path may be the path traversed by the source sensor node to reach the base station or any other destined sensor node based on an advertisement message received from one or more adjacent sensor nodes for transmitting or hopping the information gathered by the source sensor node.","In another embodiment of the present technique, the traversed network path may include a direct communication from the source sensor node to the base station, without any intermediate or destination sensor nodes.","The step of extracting the niceties finally includes a process of transforming at least one of the sensor data and control data from the plurality of segregated packets into a predefined format, as represented by block J.","In one embodiment of the present technique, the process of transforming at least one of the sensor data or the control data may include transforming the data into a predefined format or platform independent format. The transformation of data (i.e. sensor or control) identifies the underlying coded information of the sensor messages and the control messages, as also the hardware, the embedded software platform details of the base station and the sensor nodes. The said identified information is processed based on a unique identity of the platform and is encoded into the packet to convert it into a platform-independent format. In another embodiment of the present technique, the method of transforming the sensor data or control data includes the step of applying engineering conversion formulas or calibrating and inserting the calibrated engineering units into a database.","The method of creating a virtual WSN may further include the step of embedding at least one of the extracted niceties in a soft object to represent one or more sensor nodes of the physical WSN, as represented by block .","In one embodiment of the present technique, the step of embedding the one or more niceties of the sensor nodes of the physical WSN includes recording the niceties in at least one of an XML format, a comma separated value (csv) format, and a Java object format.
