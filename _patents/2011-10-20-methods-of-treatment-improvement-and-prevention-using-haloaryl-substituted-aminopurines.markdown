Also provided herein are methods for measuring the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in skin using immunohistochemistry. Further provided herein is an assay based on UVB-irradiation and measurement of phospho c-Jun immunoreactivity useful for evaluating dose-response relationships of JNK inhibitors and identifying and selecting patient populations sensitive or insensitive to JNK inhibitors.","JNK is a ubiquitously expressed serine\/threonine kinase belonging, together with ERK (extracellular-regulated kinase) and p38, to the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). (Kyriakis J M, , Sci. STKE 2000 (48):pe1; Whitmarsh A J, Davis R J, -, Sci. STKE 1999 (1):pe1; Schramek H, , News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17:62-7; Ichijo H, -, Oncogene 1999, 18(45):6087-93). MAPKs are important mediators of signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus, using phosphorylation cascades to generate a coordinated response by a cell to an external stimulus by phosphorylation of selected intracellular proteins, including transcription factors. Additionally, JNK also phosphorylates non-nuclear proteins, for example, IRS-1, and Bcl-2 family members. (Davis R J, , Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 9(11):470-3; Seger R, Krebs E G, , FASEB J. 1995; 9(9):726-35; Fanger G R, Gerwins P, Widmann C, Jarpe M B, Johnson G L, --? Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7(1):67-74).","JNK was first identified in the early 1990s, and the term is derived from cJun N-terminal kinase; its best-known substrate is the transcription factor cJun. (Hibi M, Lin A, Smeal T, Minden A, Karin M, ---, Genes Dev. 1993; 7(11):2135-48; Dunn C, Wiltshire C, MacLaren A, Gillespie D A, ---, Cell Signal 2002; 14(7):585-93; Ip Y T, Davis R J, --()\u2014, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10(2):205-19). JNK is also known as SAPK\u03b1, stress-activated protein kinase \u03b1, since JNK is activated upon exposure of cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and environmental stress, such as UV-irradiation or heat shock. (Hibi M, Lin A, Smeal T, Minden A, Karin M, ---, Genes Dev. 1993; 7(11):2135-48; Ip Y T, Davis R J, --()\u2014, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10(2):205-19; Derijard B, Hibi M, Wu I H, Barrett T, Su B, Deng T, Karin M, Davies R J, 1: --, Cell 1994; 76(6):1025-37; Kyriakis J M, Banerjee P, Nikolakaki E, Dai T, Rubie E A, Ahmad M F, Avruch J, Woodgett J R, --, Nature 1994; 369(6476):156-60).","Because of the variety of stress responses in which JNK is involved, a single pathway for JNK activation does not appear to exist. Many stimulants cause JNK activation through more than one mechanism. Depending on the cell type and state, JNK can be involved in processes as divergent as apoptosis (Kyriakis J M, Avruch J, -, Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81(2):807-869; Xie X, Gu Y, Fox T, Coll J T, Fleming M A, Markland W, Caron P R, Wilson K P, Su M S, 3: , Structure 1998; 6(8):983-91), cell proliferation (Yang Y M, Bost F, Charbono W, Dean N, McKay R, Rhim J S, Depatie C, Mercola D, -(2)-, Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9(1):391-401; Schwabe R F, Bradham C A, Uehara T, Hatano E, Bennett B L, Schoonhoven R, Brenner D A, ---1 , Hepatology 2003; 37(4):824-32), and cell differentiation (Li B, Tournier C, Davis R J, Flavell R A, -4 , EMBO J. 1999; 18(2):420-32; Yang D D, Conze D, Whitmarsh A J, Barrett T, Davis R J, Ric\u00f3n M, Flavell R A, 4+ 1 2, Immunity 1998; 9(4):575-85); hence, JNK is an essential regulator of physiological and pathological processes.","Scleroderma","Scleroderma is a rare disease with a stable incidence of approximately 19 cases per 1 million persons. The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. Abnormalities involve autoimmunity and alteration of endothelial cell and fibroblast function. Systemic scleroderma usually begins with skin thickening, usually of the fingers, accompanied by Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's disease typically precedes further manifestations of systemic scleroderma. Early in the disease the affected skin may be puffy and soft. The usual location of greatest skin thickening and hardening is the face, hands and fingers. Sclerodactyly is frequently present. Tendon friction rubs are often palpable on exam and can be painful. With more advanced disease, digital ulcers and auto-amputation may occur. Gastrointestinal dismotility is a feature, often manifested by heartburn, or by diarrhea with malabsorption or pseudo-obstruction. New onset hypertension or renal insufficiency are manifestations of the associated vascular injury. Heart failure or arrhythmia are also possible due to cardiac fibrosis. (Hachulla E, Launay D, , Clin Rev Allergy Immunol 2010; 40(2):78-83).","The major manifestations of scleroderma and in particular of systemic sclerosis are inappropriate excessive collagen synthesis and deposition, endothelial dysfunction, spasm, collapse and obliteration by fibrosis. In terms of diagnosis, an important clinical parameter is skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints. Raynaud's phenomenon is a frequent, almost universal component of scleroderma. It is diagnosed by color changes of the skin upon cold exposure. Ischemia and skin thickening are symptoms of Raynaud's disease.","UV Injury and Sunburn","The skin is one of the largest body organs and functions as one of its major interfaces with the environment, including solar radiation. Exposure to solar radiation has the beneficial effects of stimulating the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D and providing radiant warmth. (McStay, C M Elahi E J, (last modified May 18, 2010) (online), (retrieved on 2010-08-30). Retrieved from the internet: <URL: http:\/\/emedicine.medscape.com\/article\/773203-overview>). Unfortunately, when the skin is subjected to excessive radiation in the ultraviolet range, deleterious effects, such as sunburn, occur. Sunburn is an acute cutaneous inflammatory reaction that follows excessive exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The inflammatory response occurs within 2-6 hours after exposure and peaks at 20-24 hours with symptoms such as erythema, warmth, tenderness, edema, and blistering (severe cases). Acute UVR injury will also lead to apoptosis of keratinocytes resulting in skin injury and skin remodeling. (Merryman, J. I., Neilsen, N. and Stanton, D. D., --53\u2212\/\u2212, Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13(4):781-9) Chronic UVR exposure to the skin may lead to melanoma and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. (Hildesheim J, Bulavin D V, Anver M R, et al., 45-53, Cancer Res. 2002; 62(24):7305-15).","Severity of sunburn is related to duration of exposure, skin type and amount of protection. Potts J F, , Postgrad. Med. 1990; 87:52-61. Factors influencing the cutaneous response to UVR depend on interactions among many other factors besides exposure time and dose. Wavelengths of the radiation source, skin characteristics such as pigmentation, hydration and skin thickness, and external factors such as wind, temperature and humidity all effect the response. Reflection off snow and sand may also lead to increased exposure. Some medications are known to be sensitizing to ultraviolet radiation. Tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, anti-infectives, antineoplastic agents, antipsychotic agents, diuretics, hypoglycemic agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and sunscreens all may decrease an individual's tolerance for sun exposure.","Current treatment for sunburn includes the systemic administration of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway and thereby reduce prostaglandin production. NSAIDs work best if administered within the first several hours after exposure. Systemic corticosteroids are often employed and probably shorten the course of the pain that accompanies severe sunburn. Corticosteroids should not be given to patients with severe, second-degree burns because they increase the risk of infection. Topical steroids show minimal, if any benefit.","Over-the-counter topical remedies include anesthetics such as lidocaine hydrochloride, benzocaine, and pramoxine hydrochloride. Skin soothing ingredients such as aloe vera, tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), menthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil, and calamine are also popular ingredients known in the art. Home topical remedies include taking a cool bath with oatmeal or baking soda; and spreading the juice of a cut potato, lavender essential oil, or chamomile on the burn.","While these topical remedies may help soothe the skin or temporarily relieve the pain associated with sunburn, they are not a treatment for the underlying inflammation that defines sunburn. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories must be given systemically soon after exposure to be effective. Moreover, patients with allergies to NSAIDs, sensitive stomachs, or potential negative drug interactions may not be able to tolerate this treatment.","Current sunburn prevention methods include wearing protective clothing and avoidance of the sun during midday. But these methods restrict the outdoor activities, such as swimming, of a person wanting to avoid sunburn. Topical products for the prevention of sunburn fall into two categories: physical barriers and chemical absorbers. Chemical sunscreens are generally aromatic compounds conjugated with a carbonyl group. After application, the chemical sunscreen components diffuse into the stratum corneum and adsorb or conjugate with various proteins. Product effectiveness is determined by the depth of penetration, binding affinity for different proteins, and duration of protection. These chemicals absorb radiation in the UV spectrum. Chemical sunscreens have the disadvantages of possibly staining clothing and causing contact dermatitis. Moreover, recently concerns have been raised regarding the mutagenic properties of the most popular chemical sunscreens p-amino-benzoic acid (PABA) and PABA esters. Physical blockers, such as zinc oxide, talc, and titanium dioxide, reflect or scatter UVR. Many consumers find these products messy to apply and cosmetically unappealing.","Thus, a method for treating or preventing UV injury or sunburn is needed.","Scar Formation","Wounds caused by trauma or surgery are accompanied by an initial inflammatory response which is a natural response of the body and a first step of the wound healing process. The initial inflammatory response is followed by the formation of fibrous tissue, more commonly referred to as scar tissue, by proliferation of fibroblasts, and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which produce collagen, mucopolysaccharides, and gylcosaminoglycans at the wound site. A certain amount of inflammation is required in the early healing stages in order to clear away the cellular and protein debris that accumulates at the wound to avoid infection and\/or chronic inflammation. The second stage of wound healing involves a repair process which entails the influx and proliferation of fibrous tissue, due in part by the production of collagen and other substances by the fibroblasts, resulting in the formation of dense fibrous connective tissue that is visually seen as a scar.","The process of wound healing broadly comprises a regeneration phase and a repair phase, the differentiation between the two based on the resultant tissue. In regeneration, specialized tissues are replaced by the proliferation of surrounding undamaged specialized cells. In repair, lost tissue is replaced by granulation tissue which matures to form scar tissue. The repair phase involves the generation of the repair material, which for the majority of musculoskeletal injuries, involves the production of scar (collagen) material. Generation of repair material occurs fairly soon after injury, typically within 24-48 hours, and continues for a period of several weeks after injury, the time period depending in part on the amount of vasculature in the injured tissue. During this period, the bulk of the scar material is formed, with scar formation being evident and ultimately complete with a functional scar is achieved.","As mentioned above, inflammation is a normal and necessary prerequisite to healing. The inflammatory events involve both a vascular cascade of events and a cellular cascade of events. These occur in parallel and are significantly interlinked. The inflammatory cascade involves production of chemical mediators that make an active contribution to the healing process. For example, the cellular cascade involves emigration of neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, to the wounded area and production of chemical mediators. The inflammatory response results in a vascular response, by production of a cellular and fluid exudate, with resulting edema. The course of the inflammatory response will depend upon the number of cells destroyed, the original causation of the process and the tissue condition at the time of insult.","Following the inflammation phase, the wound repair begins, with scar formation resulting. In some subjects, the scar tissue formation process results in what is referred to as hypertrophic or keloid scars. A keloid scar is a raised, firm, thickened red scar that exceeds the boundary of the injury and may grow for a prolonged period of time. A keloid scar occurs when the tissue response is out of proportion to the amount of scar tissue required for normal repair and healing. The increase in scar size is due to deposition of an increased amount of collagen into the tissue. Keloid development has been associated with different types of skin injury including surgery, ear piercing, laceration, burns, vaccination or inflammatory process. Common sites are earlobes and the upper trunk and extremities.","Scar formation is both a cosmetic problem and can in some cases be a medical problem. For example, scars on the face following an injury or surgery undesirable and can negatively impact a person. In some cases, keloid development occurs and a visible, undesirable scar results. Moreover, intra-abdominal adhesions results in a very significant morbidity and mortality in every surgery practice. Treatment of pelvic adhesions following surgery is often performed, and repeat surgery can greatly aggravate scarring.","There remains a need for a treatment to prevent scar formation, to reduce excessive scar formation and to prevent development of adhesions. Mechanical barriers are currently used to prevent adhesion formation, and these are only minimally effective clinically. Keloids have been treated with injection of corticosteroid into the scar, by laser therapy, and by administration of pharmacologic agents that interfere with collagen synthesis. Methods for improving the appearance of scars and for prevention excessive scarring and adhesions, without the inhibition of wound healing, are needed.","Measurement of Inhibition of c-Jun Terminal Kinase in Skin.","Previous studies have measured levels of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and NO in cells exposed to UVB irradiation either with or without specific inhibitors, demonstrating that UVB induced the production of those proinflammatory mediators, purportedly via activation of the p38 MAPK signalling pathway (Mutou Y, Tsukimoto M, Homma T, Kojima S, () 38 -, J. Health Science 2010; 56(6):675-83). Additionally, the induction of c-Jun protein and phosphorylation after UV irradiation of human skin has been reported (Fisher G, Talwar H, Lin J, Lin P, McPhillips F, Wang Z, Li X, Wan Y, Kang S, and Voorhees J, --, J. Clin Invest. 1998; 101(6):1432-40 and Einspahr J, Bowden T, Alberts D, McKenzie N, Saboda K, Warneke J, Salasche S, Ranger-Moore J, Lewandrowski C, Nagle R, Nickoloff B, Brooks, C, Dong Z, and Stratton S, -, Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84(2):463-76).","Clinical markers are needed to evaluate the biological effects of drug candidates.

The differences in physical properties exhibited by solid forms affect pharmaceutical parameters such as storage stability, compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rates (an important factor in determining bioavailability). Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one solid form than when comprised of another solid form) or mechanical changes (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored solid form converts to thermodynamically more stable solid form) or both (e.g., tablets of one solid form are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). As a result of solubility\/dissolution differences, in the extreme case, some solid form transitions may result in lack of potency or, at the other extreme, toxicity. In addition, the physical properties of the crystal may be important in processing, for example, one solid form might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities (i.e., particle shape and size distribution might be different between one solid form relative to the other).","As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201cclathrate\u201d means an Aminopurine Compound, or a salt thereof, in the form of a crystal lattice that contains spaces (e.g., channels) that have a guest molecule (e.g., a solvent or water) trapped within or a crystal lattice wherein an Aminopurine Compound is a guest molecule.","As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201chydrate\u201d means an Aminopurine Compound, or a salt thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces.","As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201csolvate\u201d means an Aminopurine Compound, or a salt thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of a solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces.","As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d means an Aminopurine Compound derivative that can hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise react under biological conditions (in vitro or in vivo) to provide an active compound, particularly an Aminopurine Compound.

In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition.","The compositions can be in the form of tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories and suspensions and the like. Compositions can be formulated to contain a daily dose, or a convenient fraction of a daily dose, in a dosage unit, which may be a single tablet or capsule or convenient volume of a liquid. In one embodiment, the solutions are prepared from water-soluble salts, such as the hydrochloride salt. In general, all of the compositions are prepared according to known methods in pharmaceutical chemistry. Capsules can be prepared by mixing an Aminopurine Compound with a suitable carrier or diluent and filling the proper amount of the mixture in capsules. The usual carriers and diluents include, but are not limited to, inert powdered substances such as starch of many different kinds, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders.","Tablets can be prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound. Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like. Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and the like. Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders.","A lubricant might be necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the dye. The lubricant can be chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Tablet disintegrators are substances that swell when wetted to break up the tablet and release the compound. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums. More particularly, corn and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation-exchange resins, alginic acid, guar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethyl cellulose, for example, can be used as well as sodium lauryl sulfate. Tablets can be coated with sugar as a flavor and sealant, or with film-forming protecting agents to modify the dissolution properties of the tablet. The compositions can also be formulated as chewable tablets, for example, by using substances such as mannitol in the formulation.","When it is desired to administer an Aminopurine Compound as a suppository, typical bases can be used. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which can be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water-miscible suppository bases comprising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use.","The effect of the Aminopurine Compound can be delayed or prolonged by proper formulation. For example, a slowly soluble pellet of the Aminopurine Compound can be prepared and incorporated in a tablet or capsule, or as a slow-release implantable device. The technique also includes making pellets of several different dissolution rates and filling capsules with a mixture of the pellets. Tablets or capsules can be coated with a film that resists dissolution for a predictable period of time. Even the parenteral preparations can be made long-acting, by dissolving or suspending the Aminopurine Compound in oily or emulsified vehicles that allow it to disperse slowly in the serum.","In certain embodiments, the Aminopurine Compound can be administered in a formulation or dosage for found in U.S. Provisional Pat.

App. No. 61\/481,378, filed May 2, 2011, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.","In certain embodiments, the Aminopurine Compound can be cyclically administered to a patient. Cycling therapy involves the administration of the Aminopurine Compound for a period of time, followed by a rest for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies and\/or improves the efficacy of the treatment.","Consequently, in one specific embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound is administered daily in a single or divided doses in a four to six week cycle with a rest period of about a week or two weeks. The methods provided herein further allow the frequency, number and length of dosing cycles to be increased. Thus, in another specific embodiment, the methods provided herein encompasses the administration of an Aminopurine Compound for more cycles than are typical when it is administered alone. In yet another specific embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound is administered for a greater number of cycles than would typically cause dose-limiting toxicity in a patient to whom a second active agent is not also being administered.","In one embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound is administered daily and continuously for three or four weeks at a dose of from about 10 to about 200 mg per day followed by a break of one or two weeks. In another embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound is administered daily and continuously for three or four weeks at a dose of from about 0.1 to 5 mg per day followed by a break of one or two weeks. In a particular embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound is administered in an amount of about 5, 10, 25 or 50 mg\/day, preferably in an amount of about 25 mg\/day for three to four weeks, followed by one or two weeks of rest in a four or six week cycle.","In another embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound and a second active agent are administered orally, with administration of the Aminopurine Compound occurring 30 to 60 minutes prior to a second active agent, during a cycle of four to six weeks. In another embodiment, the combination of the Aminopurine Compound and a second active agent is administered by intravenous infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle. In a specific embodiment, one cycle comprises the administration of from about 0.1 to about 200 mg\/day of an Aminopurine Compound and from about 50 to about 200 mg\/m\/day of a second active agent daily for three to four weeks and then one or two weeks of rest. In another specific embodiment, each cycle comprises the administration of from about 1 to about 25 mg\/day of an Aminopurine Compound and from about 50 to about 200 mg\/m\/day of a second active agent for 3 to 4 weeks followed by one or two weeks of rest. Typically, the number of cycles during which the combinatorial treatment is administered to a patient will be from about one to about 24 cycles, more typically from about two to about 16 cycles and even more typically from about four to about three cycles.","The frequency of administration is in the range of about an hourly dose to a monthly dose. In specific embodiments, administration is from 8 times per day to once every other day or from 1 to 3 times per day. In a specific embodiment, an Aminopurine Compound is administered chronically, e.g., daily.","Provided herein are methods for the use of UVB-irradiation of skin and measurement of phospho c-Jun and\/or c-Jun using immunohistochemistry as a model to determine the effect of Aminopurine Compounds in human and other patients. The methods can also be used to determine the effect in a patient of selective Aminopurine Compounds alone or in combination with inhibitors of MAP kinase; e.g., whether a compound or combination of compounds inhibits JNK in a patient. The methods herein can accelerate the clinical development of Aminopurine Compounds as the model shows whether the compound at issue hits the JNK target in a patient and also allows the evaluation of dose-response in a patient; which guides the dose selection in clinical development. The methods herein can also be used to identify patient populations who are sensitive to Aminopurine Compounds.","In certain embodiments, provided herein are methods comprising the administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s) to a patient and determining the resulting amount of JNK inhibition in said patient using a method provided herein.","Methods provided herein are based, in part, on the discovery that the presence and level of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in patient skin samples can be utilized as a biomarker to follow the inhibition of JNK. In particular, these biomarkers can be used to predict, assess, and track the effectiveness of Aminopurine Compound therapy in a patient, in particular oral therapy with Aminopurine Compounds, for example, with JNKi-1, or to monitor the patient's compliance to the prescribed regimen of Aminopurine Compound therapy.","The baseline phospho c-Jun immune-reactivity in healthy human skin is low without UVB exposure. UVB-irradiation reliably increases phospho c-Jun immuno-reactivity. The increase starts to plateau at approximately 8 hours post UVB exposure. Oral administration of Aminopurine Compounds, such as those described herein, including but not limited to JNKi-1, at doses of about 75 mg to about 200 mg, partially or completely inhibited the elevation of phospho c-Jun induced by the UVB irradiation, in a majority of patients. The inhibition of JNK is dose-related. UVB-irradiation and phospho c-Jun can be used as a model to evaluate Aminopurine Compounds, including the evaluation of dose-response, and to identify patient populations who are sensitive to Aminopurine Compounds.","Provided herein are methods relating to the use of phospho c-Jun expression induced by UVB-irradiation as a biomarker to evaluate the effectiveness of Aminopurine Compounds. Phospho c-Jun and c-Jun levels can be used to determine whether a treatment is likely to be successful in diseases or conditions associated with JNK.","Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the use of UVB exposure to the skin of a patient and measurement of the amount of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun in said patient's skin prior to and after administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound (s), can be used to evaluate the biological effect of said Aminopurine Compound(s) in said patient. In certain embodiments, the methods provided herein allow for the amount of in vivo inhibition of JNK resulting from administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s) to be determined. In certain embodiments, the assays provided herein comprise exposing a first portion of said patient's skin to UVB irradiation, obtaining a sample of said first portion of said patient's skin, measuring the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said first portion of said patient's skin immunohistochemically, administering an Aminopurine Compound to said patient, exposing a second portion of said patient's skin to UVB irradiation, obtaining a sample of said second portion of said patient's skin, measuring the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said patient's skin immunohistochemically, and comparing the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said first portion of said patient's skin and said second portion of said patient's skin, wherein a reduction of levels of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said patient's skin compared to said first portion of said patient's skin indicates inhibition of JNK. In certain embodiments, the assays provided herein comprise using human skin model tissues. In such embodiments, the assays comprise exposing a first sample of said tissue to UVB irradiation, obtaining a sample of said first portion of said tissue, measuring the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said first portion of said tissue immunohistochemically, administering an Aminopurine Compound to said tissue, exposing a second portion of said tissue to UVB irradiation, obtaining a sample of said second portion of said tissue, measuring the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said tissue immunohistochemically, and comparing the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said first portion of said tissue and said second portion of said tissue, wherein a reduction of levels of phosphorylated c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said tissue compared to said first portion of said tissue indicates inhibition of JNK.","In such embodiments, human skin model tissues such as EpiDermFT\u2122 may be used. EpiDermFT\u2122 is a reconstituted human skin equivalent, which exhibits morphological and growth characteristics similar to human skin, and has been used widely as a model tissue system in studies relevant to human skin (see, e.g., Zhao J F, Zhang Y J, Kubilus J, Jin X H, Santella R M, Athar M, Wang Z Y, Bickers D R. 3-, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Comms. 1999; 254:49-53; Mahns A, Wolber R, St\u00e4b F, Klotz L O, Sies H, --2 , Photochem.

EpiDermFT\u2122 samples may be obtained from MatTek Corporation (Ashland, Mass.).","In some embodiments, the immunohistochemistry evaluations of the skin biopsies provided by the methods herein to assess JNK activation comprise a two antibody IHC assay that employs a primary antibody, directed against the target phospho c-Jun or c-Jun, and a secondary antibody conjugated with a chromogenic enzyme. In such embodiments, the secondary antibody-reporter conjugate leaves a differentiating stain when incubated with the substrate reaction mixture, thus marking the location of the primary antibody target complex. This differentiating stain is then recorded with standard bright-field illumination using, e.g., a Nikon microscope. The microscope images are then photographed and electronic images may be scored (blinded) by independent and trained scorers using guidelines as illustrated in the Examples. In certain embodiments, exploratory quantitative IHC analysis may be carried out using a laser scanning cytometer. In such embodiments, the slides are further processed in order to define the nuclear compartment of the epithelial keratinocytes. In such embodiments, the same IHC slides are counterstained with Hematoxylin to tag the nuclear compartment, then scanned using two photodiode channels, 488 nm for the DAB stain (to mark the primary antibody directed against phospho c-Jun or c-Jun) and 633 nm for the Hematoxylin stain, then the nuclei are counted based upon the Hematoxylin signal and the DAB signals are integrated for each nucleus in the epithelium. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein allow for the measurement of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun levels, before and after administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s), which can be used as biomarkers for measuring the inhibition of JNK in a patient. In some embodiments of the methods provided herein, a decreased level of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said patient's skin relative to said first portion of said patient's skin indicates inhibition of JNK. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein allow for the measurement of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun levels before and after administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s), which can be used as biomarkers for determining the dose-response relationship for the administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s) in a patient. In some embodiments of the methods provided herein, a decreased level of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said patient's skin relative to said first portion of said patient's skin is proportional to the inhibition of JNK. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein allow for the measurement of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun levels before and after administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s), which can be used as biomarkers for determining whether a patient is sensitive to (an) Aminopurine Compound(s). In some embodiments of the methods provided herein, a decreased level of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said patient's skin relative to said first portion of said patient's skin indicates that said patient is sensitive to said Aminopurine Compound. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein allow for the measurement of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun levels before and after administration of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s), which can be used to determine the effective amount of (an) Aminopurine Compound(s) for the treatment or prevention of a disease or condition associated with JNK in a patient. In some embodiments of the methods provided herein, a decreased level of phospho c-Jun or c-Jun in said second portion of said patient's skin relative to said first portion of said patient's skin may be correlated to indicate the administration of an effective amount of said Aminopurine Compound.","The following Examples are presented by way of illustration, not limitation.","To analyze whether the JNK pathway was activated by TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF, Western Blot analysis for c-Jun in cultured dermal fibroblasts was performed.","After rinsing twice with PBS, the dermal fibroblasts were trypsinized and lysed with Laemmli Buffer. Five \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes according to standard protocols (Distler J H, Jungel A, Kowal-Bielecka O, Michel B A, Gay R E, Sprott H, et al. Expression of interleukin-21 receptor in epidermis from patients with systemic sclerosis. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52(3):856-64). Immunoblots were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against c-Jun and phospho-c-Jun (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) at a dilution of 1:200 overnight at 4\u00b0 C. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 hour at a dilution of 1:2000, signals were detected with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany). For confirmation of equal loading of proteins, the amount of \u03b2-actin was determined using mouse anti-human \u03b2-actin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany; dilution 1:10000).","Stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF potently increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun (). In contrast, pre-incubation with Compound JNKi-1 reduced the stimulatory effects of TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF on the phosphorylation of c-Jun. In particular, Compound JNKi-1 treatment completely prevented the stimulatory effect of PDGF on c-Jun phosphorylation in fibroblasts ().","The selective JNK inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 was tested in a bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis mouse model, which is considered to represent the early and inflammatory stages of systemic sclerosis (Akhmetshina A, Venalis P, Dees C, Busch N, Zwerina J, Schett G, Distler O, Distler J H, , Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60(1):219-24). Bleomycin is an outmoded anticancer therapeutic that has been demonstrated to cause fibrosis in the lung. In animal models it will similarly induce injury and fibrosis at the site of delivery.","Male and female DBA\/2J mice were used. Mice were fed a standard diet with water ad libitum. The room temperature was kept constant at 22\u00b0 C. with a humidity of 60%.","Compound JNKi-1 was dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)\/0.25% Tween 80 in water. Bleomycin was dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) at a concentration of 0.5 mg\/mL in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL. The positive control compound Imatinib mesylate was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl at a concentration of 50 mg\/kg\/day in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL.","Two different dose levels of the JNK-inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 (50 mg\/kg and 150 mg\/kg, administered twice daily) were used to analyze the anti-fibrotic activity in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis. For the positive control group, mice were treated intraperitoneally (IP) with imatinib mesylate, which has previously been shown to exert antifibrotic effects. DBA\/2J mice (n=5\/sex\/group) were assigned to one of five treatment groups:\n\n","Localized dermal fibrosis was induced by injection of bleomycin every other day for 3 weeks in defined areas of the upper back. Compound JNKi-1 or imatinib was administrated starting from the first dose of bleomycin.","The dermal thickness was determined by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). The activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) at the fibrotic lesions were quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Collagen concentration in lesional skin was analyzed by hydroxyproline assay. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). SPSS17.0 software and the Mann-Whitney-U-test were used for statistical analyses. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","In the mouse model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, dermal thickness decreased dose-dependently by 24%\u00b15% (p=0.012) following treatment with 50 mg\/kg Compound JNKi-1 and by 45%\u00b15% (p=0.001) following treatment with 150 mg\/kg Compound JNKi-1 (). The number of myofibroblasts was reduced by 80%\u00b110% (p=0.0005) following treatment with 50 mg\/kg and by 101%\u00b19% (p=0.001) following treatment with 150 mg\/kg of Compound JNKi-1 (). A reduction in dermal thickening by 46%\u00b15% (p=0.002) and decreased myofibroblast count by 51%\u00b110% (p=0.001) were also observed in mice treated with imatinib ( and ), a control compound in the study. Furthermore, the collagen content in lesional skin was reduced dose-dependently by 29%\u00b111% (p=0.007) following treatment with 50 mg\/kg and by 47%\u00b19% (p=0.001) following treatment with 150 mg\/kg of Compound JNKi-1 compared to bleomycin-treated animals ().","Dermal fibrosis with dense accumulation of collagen bundles, inflammatory infiltrates, and replacement of the subcutaneous fat tissue by connective tissue was observed in sham treated bleomycin-challenged mice. In mice treated with Compound JNKi-1, the development of fibrosis by bleomycin was significantly ameliorated (). Treatment with Compound JNKi-1 reduced dermal thickening in a dose-dependent manner by up to 45\u00b12% at doses of 150 mg\/kg (p=0.001). This reduction in dermal thickening was comparable to that observed with imatinib at doses of 50 mg\/kg ().","The JNK inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 dose-dependently inhibited dermal thickness and accumulation of collagens at the sites of fibrotic lesions in a bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis mouse model. The differentiation of resting fibroblasts into myofibroblasts was completely prevented by Compound JNKi-1 in this mouse model. Compound JNKi-1 has demonstrated in vivo antifibrotic activity.","To evaluate, whether inhibition of JNK might also be effective for the treatment of established fibrosis, a modified model of bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis was used. Prolonged injections of bleomycin for 6 weeks resulted in progressive fibrosis with increased dermal thickening to 226\u00b16% compared to a dermal thickening of 175\u00b18% after 3 weeks of bleomycin challenge (p=0.021 compared to NaCl injections for 6 weeks). The dermal thickness in mice treated with Compound JNKi-1 for the last 3 weeks was significantly reduced to 127\u00b14% at doses of 150 mg\/kg BID (p=0.008 compared to bleomycin for 6 weeks). Thus, Compound JNKi-1 decreased the level of dermal thickness under the pre-treatment level (127\u00b14% vs 175\u00b18% compared to NaCl injections for 6 weeks, p=0.008 and p=0.021) (). Besides dermal thickness, the number of myofibroblasts was strongly reduced upon treatment with 150 mg\/kg Compound JNKi-1 under the pre-treatment level (171\u00b131% vs. 443\u00b115% compared to NaCl injections for 6 weeks, p=0.012 and p=0.014) (). Additionally, the accumulation of collagen assessed by hydroxyproline assay was significantly reduced in mice treated with 150 mg\/kg Compound JNKi-1 for the last 3 weeks of continuous bleomycin challenge for 6 weeks (p=0.025) (). Thus, inhibition of JNK did not only prevent the development of fibrosis in different models, but also induced regression of pre-existing fibrosis.","The antifibrotic effects of the JNK inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 were tested in a murine tight skin-1 (Tsk-1) model of systemic sclerosis. In this model, a dominant mutation in the fibrillin 1 gene (Fbn1+\/\u2212) leads to a systemic sclerosis-like disease with inflammatory infiltrates and massive fibrosis of the skin (Akhmetshina A, Venalis P, Dees C, Busch N, Zwerina J, Schett G, et al., , Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60(1):219-24).","Male and female TSK-1 mice were used. Mice were fed a standard diet with water ad libitum. The room temperature was kept constant at 22\u00b0 C. with a humidity of 60%.","Compound JNKi-1 was dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)\/0.25% Tween 80 in water. As vehicle control a solution of 0.5% CMC\/0.25% Tween 80 in water was used. Imatinib mesylate was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl at a concentration of 50 mg\/kg\/day in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL.","Groups of Tsk-1 mice (n=4\/sex\/group) were assigned to one of five treatment groups:\n\n","Treatments with Compound JNKi-1 and control compound were started at Week 4. After 6 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed, and the antifibrotic effects from each treatment were analyzed.","Antifibrotic effects were determined by measuring the dermal thickness and quantifying the numbers of myofibroblasts in the lesional skin. Dermal thickness was determined by measuring the distance from the epidermal\/dermal border to the dermal\/subdermal border in H & E-stained sections at four different sites. The number of myofibroblasts was quantified by staining for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in paraffin-embedded sections. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM). SPSS17.0 software and the Mann-Whitney-U-test were used for statistical analyses. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","Tsk-1 mice showed dramatic hypodermal thickening, which was significantly reduced by 67%\u00b15% (p=0.0005) following treatment with 50 mg\/kg of Compound JNKi-1 and by 85%\u00b17% (p=0.0003) following treatment with 150 mg\/kg of Compound JNKi-1, compared to untreated mice (). The number of myofibroblasts was decreased by 68%\u00b128% (p=0.008) following treatment with 50 mg\/kg of Compound JNKi-1 and by 99%\u00b19% (p=0.004) following treatment with 150 mg\/kg of Compound JNKi-1, compared to untreated animals (). Mice treated with imatinib mesylate control compound showed decreased hypodermal thickness by 71%\u00b17% (p=0.003) and decreased number of myofibroblasts by 99%\u00b115% (p=0.004) compared to untreated mice ( and ). In addition, the reduction in hypodermal thickening at doses of 150 mg\/kg Compound JNKi-1 treatment was more pronounced than with treatment with 50 mg\/kg imatinib ().","Compound JNKi-1 was found to dose-dependently reduce hypodermal hypertrophy and myofibroblast counts in the Tsk-1 dermal fibrosis mouse model.","Using fibroblasts isolated from skin biopsies from human systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, an in vitro study was performed to evaluate whether the selective JNK inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 affects the expression of key extracellular matrix proteins.","Dermal fibroblasts from two SSc patients were treated for 24 hours (hr) with Compound JNKi-1 at concentrations from 0.1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM (0.5% DMSO\/99.5% cell culture media). To study the effect of Compound JNKi-1 on growth factor-induced collagen expression, recombinant transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) (final concentration of 10 ng\/mL) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) (final concentration of 40 ng\/mL) were added to cells 2 hr after the addition of JNK-inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 for 24 hr. The expression of collagen proteins was analyzed by SirCol assay. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of extracellular proteins were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The \u03b2-actin mRNA was used as internal control for the measurement of Collagen 1a1 mRNA using PCR. Fibroblast proliferation assay was performed in the presence or absence of 1 \u03bcM Compound JNKi-1 for 24 hr with the (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay.","The isolation of fibroblasts from human SSc patients and culture conditions used in this study have been previously described (Akhmetshina A, Dees C, Pileckyte M, Maurer B, Axmann R, J\u00fcngel A, et al., -, FASEB J. 2008; 22(7):2214-22). Fibroblast cultures were obtained from skin biopsies of SSc patients. All patients fulfilled the criteria for SSc as suggested by LeRoy and colleagues (LeRoy E C, Black C, Fleischmajer R, Jablonska S, Krieg T, Medsger T A Jr, et al., (): , J. Rheumatol. 1988; 15(2):202-5). Biopsies from SSc patients were taken from involved skin of the forearm. After enzymatic digestion of the skin biopsies with Dispase II, fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM\/F-12 containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U\/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg\/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 2.5 \u03bcg\/mL amphotericin B (all Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Fibroblasts from passages 4-8 were used for the experiments. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM).","Compound JNKi-1 dose-dependently reduced the expression of extracellular matrix proteins in SSc fibroblasts. Maximal effects were observed at concentrations of 1 \u03bcM. At this concentration, Compound JNKi-1 reduced the mRNA levels of col 1a1 and col 1a2 by 71\u00b111% and 61\u00b113%, respectively, and the levels of fibronectin-1 by 55\u00b114% (p<0.02 compared to mock-treated fibroblasts for all) (). Consistent with the decreased mRNA levels, incubation with 1 \u03bcM Compound JNKi-1 also reduced the amount of collagen protein in the supernatant by 21\u00b17% (p=0.001) compared to control ().","Fibroblasts from SSc patients were used to assess any direct effect of Compound JNKi-1 on cell viability. After a 24-hr incubation, no cytotoxic effect was observed with Compound JNKi-1 in an MTT assay as shown in .","Collagens are major extracellular matrix proteins that are overexpressed in fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF are the most well-characterized growth factors present in the fibrotic lesion and have been shown to enhance fibrotic pathology in vitro and in vivo. Compound JNKi-1 was tested for its effect on the secretion of total collagens induced by TGF-\u03b2 or PDGF from fibroblasts from SSc patients. As shown in , Compound JNKi-1 (1 \u03bcM) modestly inhibited both TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF-induced collagen secretion.","Ultraviolet B (UVB) light is known to induce breaks in DNA (nicks) that can trigger the process of apoptosis, and these nicks can be labeled and visualized with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). TUNEL technology identifies DNA breaks by labeling free 3\u2032-OH terminals with modified (fluorescing) nucleotides in an enzymatic reaction that makes the damaged apoptotic cells fluoresce. This study was one of a series of pharmacology studies designed to determine the effects of the JNK inhibitor, Compound JNKi-1, on UVB-induced apoptosis in the skin of mice.","Female SKH-1 mice (Charles River, n=17 total) were obtained at a body weight of 15 g to 20 g. Mice were housed in regular shoebox cages and allowed to become acclimated for a minimum of 1 week. Mice were fed Harlan Teklad (No. 7001) 4% mouse\/rat diet and water ad libitum and were maintained on a 12-hour light\/dark cycle.","Suspensions of Compound JNKi-1 were prepared in aqueous 0.5% CMC and 0.25% Tween-80. The formulations were homogenized using a TEFLON\u00ae pestle and mortar (Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder). Vehicle (aqueous solution of 0.5% CMC and 0.25% Tween-80, stored at 4\u00b0 C.) and test article compounds were dosed at a volume of 5 mL\/kg. Two groups of mice (n=5\/group) were dosed with vehicle or Compound JNKi-1 (75 mg\/kg) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 days (9 AM and 12 noon) and exposed to UVB 1 hour (hr) following the final dose.","For determination of compound exposure in plasma and skin, a separate cohort of mice (n=5) was dosed with Compound JNKi-1 (75 mg\/kg) for 5 days and samples were collected immediately following UV exposure (within 10 minutes of exposure).","Mice (n=5\/group) were anesthetized using ketamine\/xylazine (60 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/mL, respectively) prior to UVB exposure. An all-purpose paper label sticker was placed upon half of the dorsal mouse skin to block UVB stimulation within that area and then mice were subjected to UVB exposure (0.5 J\/cm; Biospectra machine, Vilber Lourmat).","Skin biopsy punches were harvested 24 hr following UVB exposure from both stimulated and nonstimulated skin for TUNEL processing or snap frozen for compound level determination. Blood was drawn via cardiac puncture, spun in plasma separator tubes, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until processed for compound level determination. An additional treatment cohort was used to collect skin and blood samples immediately after UV exposure and one hour after drug administration. Skin biopsies processed for TUNEL were placed upon a piece of paper (to prevent curling) and fixed for 2 hr in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Once fixed, samples were placed into 100% ethanol until they could be processed for paraffin embedding. Tissue sections (6 \u03bcm thick) were generated and mounted on poly-1-lysine coated slides. Sections were de-paraffinized and washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Sections were then incubated in Proteinase K (15 \u03bcg\/mL) in PBS for 15 minutes and washed in PBS. Sections were then incubated in a TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche 1684795) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0 C. The sections were washed once more in PBS and cover slipped with Prolong Gold mounting media with anti-fade.","A Leica microscope with a CoolSNAP digital camera was used to obtain 5 random 20\u00d7 magnification fluorescent images from five sections of skin epidermis and the number of TUNEL-positive green cells was counted to determine the average number of cells per animal and group (n=5).","Statistical one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (Graph Pad Prism). The data were expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM).","Twenty-four hours after UVB exposure, a significant induction in TUNEL-positive cells could be measured compared with naive samples (; p<0.001).

This sequence of healing is typical of acute injuries and terminates in mature scar formation. Efficient cutaneous wound repair implies carefully orchestrated molecular events allowing fibroblasts to migrate to the wound site, contract the wound, and synthesize extracellular matrix to restore skin integrity. Fibroblasts maintain a limited yet significant pool of phosphorylated c-jun protein that is critical for allowing migration and motility (Javelaud, D., Laboureau, J., Gabison, E., Verrecchia, F., Mauviel, A., , J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278:24624-24628). Therefore, it is relevant to investigate whether a JNK inhibitor might affect the healing process by impairing fibroblast function.","Male CD-IGS rats (Strain code 001; n=32-52 per experiment) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories at a body weight of 175-195 g. Rats were housed in regular shoebox cages and allowed to become acclimated for a minimum of 1 week.

Two points were marked 5.5 and 8.5 cm from the base of the skull along the midline. Four further points were marked 1 cm at either side of the midline, two at each of the marked points. These delineated the centers of four excisional wounds. The biopsy punch (6 mm diameter) was aligned vertically over the center of a mark and the epidermis, dermis and panniculus carnosus pierced by applying pressure and twisting at the same time. The skin plug was then removed. This was repeated for the remaining wounds (). The animal was then allowed to recover. All animals were housed singly during the experiment. Rats were monitored twice a day for the first 24 hours following the procedure and then daily until the end of the study. Body weights were recorded two or three times per week. Animals were sacrificed via COasphyxiation at various time-points (day 1, 5, 10 or 14) following wounding.","Each wound size was measured using an electronic digital caliper and the percent of wound remaining open was calculated relative to the initial wound size recorded on day 0 (day of wounding procedure). Four values were averaged for each animal (four wounds on each rat).

Wounds that completely healed had a score=4.","The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) was evaluated by IHC on tissue samples harvested on day 5 after the procedure to investigate the migration of myofibroblasts into the wound site. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated to deionized (DI) water. Sections were incubated in 0.6% HOfor 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase, washed and blocked in 5% goat serum for 10 min. Primary Ab (Sigma, A2547) was added for 60 min and biotinylated secondary Ab (Sigma, B9904) for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with ExtrAvidin-Peroxidase (Sigma, E2886) for an additional 20 min. AEC (Sigma, AEC101) was used as chromogen to localize peroxidase in tissue. A qualitative assessment of \u03b1-SMA positive staining was made.","The levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were evaluated by IHC on tissue samples harvested on day 1 after the procedure to investigate the neutrophil influx into the wound site. Staining was performed according to manufacture instruction. Briefly, deparafinized tissues were boiled for 10 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer (Lab Vision, AP-9003) for antigen retrieval. Primary Ab (Thermo Scientific Lab Vision, RB-373-A) was diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer and added for 60 min and the secondary Ab for 30 min at room temperature. Secondary Ab and ABC reagent were from Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Lab, Rabbit IgG, PK-6101). DAB was used as chromogen to localize peroxidase in tissue.

Dexamethasone treated rats lost about 10% of the initial body weight mass (, result is representative of three experiments).","Vehicle dosed groups completely healed by day 10 post-wounding. All animals in the positive control group that received Dexamethasone at 0.5 mg\/kg showed a significant (p<0.0001) delay in the healing process and approximately 70% of the wound gap remained open at day 10 post wounding. A less dramatic (only 27%, n=3 studies), but still significant (p<0.05-p<0.01) delay in wound healing was observed in rats dosed with Compound JNKi-1 at 60 mg\/kg b.i.d (). However, no difference was observed in rats dosed with Compound JNKi-1 at 30 or 10 mg\/kg (, panel C). Complete skin repair was achieved by day 14 post wounding in all Compound JNKi-1 treated groups (, panel B). No difference was observed in the once daily (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.) dosed vehicle groups (, panel A).","Healing score was evaluated based on re-epithelialization and collagen deposition\/remodeling as described in the Experimental Procedures sections. On day 10 after wounding almost all vehicle dosed rats (6 out of 8) had completed new epidermis and collagen fibers remodeled in a non-reticular pattern. As expected, none of the animals that received Dexamethasone showed complete re-epithelialization and collagen remodeling. In the Compound JNKi-1 treated group, only 5 out of 14 rats had completely healed by day 10: two rats showed incomplete new epidermis, 4 rats had only partial collagen remodeling and 3 rats displayed both incomplete re-epithelialization and collagen remodeling. By day 14 all animals receiving Compound JNKi-1 had fully healed (, panel A). In the dose-response study (Study C) both 60 and 30 mg\/kg doses showed a significant delay in healing compare to vehicle control group. None of the rats treated at 60 mg\/kg had completely healed by day 10 and 5 out of 8 rats treated at 30 mg\/kg displayed both incomplete re-epithelialization and collagen remodeling. No significant effect was observed in the group that received Compound JNKi-1 at 10 mg\/kg (, panel B).","Myofibroblast Migration into the Wound Gap:","Early during healing of an open wound, resident dermal fibroblasts proliferate from the wound margin and migrate into the provisional matrix composed of a fibrin clot. About 1 week after wounding, the provisional matrix is replaced by neo-formed connective tissue, known as granulation tissue, essentially composed of small vessels, extracellular matrix, and fibroblastic cells that become activated myofibroblasts (Kwon, A H., Qiu, Z., and Hirao, Y., -, Exp. Biol. Med. 2007; 232:935-941). The main marker of myofibroblasts is the neo-expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), the actin isoform typical of vascular smooth muscle cells (Skalli, O., Ropraz, P., Trzeciak, A., Benzonana, G., Gillessen, D., and Gabbiani, G A, -, J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103:2787-2796).","During model validation we demonstrated that myofibroblast migration into the wound gap peaks on day 5 after wounding. Therefore, we choose this time point to monitor \u03b1-SMA expression by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. All vehicle dosed rats showed intense myofibroblast infiltration at the wound site (, panel A). In contrast, animals from the 60 mg\/kg Compound JNKi-1 treated group displayed an earlier stage of the healing process with few myofibroblasts migrating at the wound edges and highly perfuse granulation tissue throughout the entire wound gap (, panel B). This suggests that JNK inhibitor Compound JNKi-1 might affect the healing process by reducing and\/or delaying myofibroblast migration into the wound site.","Neutrophil Migration into the Wound Gap:","Neutrophil influx is an early inflammatory response that is essential for the clearance of bacteria and cellular debris during cutaneous wounding (Kim, M H., Liu, Wei., Borjesson, D L., Curry, F R E., Miller, L S., Cheung, A L., Liu, F T., Isseroff, R., Simon, S I., , J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128:1812-20). We have previously evaluated neutrophil infiltration in the excisional wound model and determined that their numbers peak on day 1 after wounding. Neutrophil migration was monitored using an anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody on skin sections. The number of neutrophils recruited into the wounds was comparable between controls and Compound JNKi-1 dosed rats (). This result suggests that inflammatory cell infiltration during the response to tissue damage is not affected by Compound JNKi-1 treatment at 60 mg\/kg.","The study results demonstrate that by inhibiting JNK activity with Compound JNKi-1, the inflammatory response to tissue damage is not affected and complete skin repair can be achieved. However, the delay in the healing process observed with Compound JNKi-1 treatment suggests that basal JNK activity is critical for fibroblast migration and\/or motility into the wound site.","Study Design.","The inhibitory effect of JNKi-1 on JNK was evaluated by assessing the status of the downstream substrate c-Jun (\u201ccJun\u201d) and phospho-c-Jun (or \u201cp-cJun\u201d) following UV irradiation of human skin.","The study was designed as randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multiple dose, 3-way crossover study. Fifteen subjects were randomized to one of 3 sequences (5 subjects per sequence) as outlined below (see Table 3).

The DermaPal was adapted to position a 12 oz styrofoam coffee cup over the bulbs, which thus became a device establishing all exposure distances and preventing unwanted exposure. A separate device consisting of six graded neutral density filters was supplied to provide a graded series of UV doses to establish each patient's MED.","IHC Subjective Scoring Parameters:","Biopsies were analyzed following the procedures described below to evaluate phospho c-Jun and c-Jun expression using IHC assay. The method employed to assess JNK activation was a two antibody IHC assay that employed a primary antibody, directed against the target, and a secondary antibody conjugated with a chromogenic enzyme. Thus, the method was a two-step immunohistochemical assay designed to interrogate the target, c-Jun and phospho c-Jun. Any changes in JNK activity were measurable in the amounts of these target molecules, c-Jun and phospho c-Jun. The secondary antibody-reporter conjugate deposited a red color when incubated with the substrate reaction mix, thus marking the location of the primary antibody target complex. The red color was then recorded with standard bright-field illumination using a Nikon microscope. The microscope images were then photographed and electronic images were scored (blinded) by three independent and trained scorers using the following guidelines. A score of 0 indicated staining of 0-19% of the epithelial keratinocyte nuclei; a score of 1 indicated staining of 20-39% of the epithelial keratinocyte nuclei; a score of 2 indicated staining of 40-59% of the epithelial keratinocyte nuclei; a score of 3 indicated staining of 60-79% of the epithelial keratinocyte nuclei; and a score of 4 indicated staining of 80-100% of the epithelial keratinocyte nuclei.  depicts representative immunostaining for the respective scores.","Laser Scanning Cytometry Analysis:","For each tissue, a count of nuclei in the epithelial layer was obtained.

After 72 hr, the media was replaced with 2 mL of fresh media containing 0, 0.1, 3, and 10 \u03bcM of JNKi-1, respectively). Samples were allowed to soak at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COfor 6 hr, then removed from the media and placed into 2 mL of PBS and irradiated with 135 mJ\/cmof UVB. Controls were sham irradiated. Samples were placed back into 2 mL of media containing JNKi-1. Samples were harvested at 30 minutes and 3 hr post UV treatment. Each sample was cut in half; one half was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in lysis buffer, and lysates stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. The other half was placed in 10% neutral buffer formalin for 3 hr and transferred to 100% ethanol for processing","Study Design. In the nHEK Model,","cells were pre-incubated with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (, lanes 1, 2, and 12 to 15) or JNKi-1 at the indicated concentration (lanes 3 to 11) for 1 hr and then irradiated without (Control, lanes 1 and 2) or with UVB at 60 mJ\/cm(lanes 3 to 15). Cells were lysed 30 minutes after UV irradiation and cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) before Western blotting with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody. The lysates were also blotted for \u03b2-actin as loading control In the EpiDermFT\u2122 model, cells were pre-incubated with either DMSO (, lanes 1 to 3) or JNKi-1 at an indicated concentration (lanes 4 to 12) for 2 hr and then irradiated without (Control, lanes 1 and 2) or with UVB at 135 mJ\/cm(lanes 4 to 12). Cells were lysed 30 minutes after UV irradiation and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE before Western blotting with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody. The lysates were also blotted for \u03b2-actin as loading control","Western analysis: For Western blot analysis, 20 to 25 \u03bcg of total protein were applied to SDS-PAGE gels followed by electrophoresis and blotting. Immunodetection was performed with anti-phospho-cJun (S63), anti-phospho-JNK (T183\/Y185), and anti-phospho-Stat3 (S727) antibodies. Western blot imaging was performed on an Odyssey\u00ae Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebr.). The intensity of each band was quantified by the Odyssey 2.1 software and exported into Excel for further analysis. The raw intensities p-JNK, pc-Jun, and p-Stat3 were normalized against the loading control, \u03b2-actin.","Results.","Stimulation with UVB caused strong elevation of phospho-c-Jun at 30 minutes (, lanes 12 to 15; , lanes 2 and 3) and the levels of phospho-c-Jun were sustained for 3 hours (data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with JNKi-1 significantly blocked the activation of JNK in a dose-dependent manner in both systems as shown by decreased levels of phospho-c-Jun (, lanes 3 to 11; , lanes 4 to 12). UV stimulation produced a slight increase in phospho-Stat3 levels at 30 minutes, however, inhibition by JNKi-1 was minimal (data not shown). The effect of JNKi-1 on c-Jun phosphorylation in nHEKs is shown by Western blot analysis (A). Quantitation of Western blot is shown in panel B.","As shown in the Figures, pretreatment with JNKi-1 significantly blocks UVB-induced JNK activation in nHEK and EpiDermFT\u2122 skin models in a dose-dependent manner. The ICfor p-cJun in both systems is between 0.1 \u03bcM and 3 \u03bcM.","A number of references have been cited, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"5.2 Brief Description of the Drawings","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIG. 32"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
