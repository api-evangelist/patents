{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Pat. App. No. 61\/424,987, filed Dec. 20, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Electronic content often includes attributes that are stored as metadata in association with the electronic content. For instance, an audio file may include metadata that identifies a name of a song, an artist name, a track number, an album name, ratings, a genre, when the song was purchased, a number of times that the song has been played or skipped, or a playlist in which a song is included. When the same song is stored on multiple devices, the metadata may be synchronized when a user physically connects the devices and initiates a metadata synchronization operation.","According to one general implementation, when metadata is updated at one device, other devices are automatically informed of the update and may update their own metadata accordingly. By allowing devices to communicate with each other about metadata updates, synchronization of metadata for electronic content may be performed without requiring a user to physically connect their device to other devices, or to manually initiate a metadata synchronization operation.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining that metadata associated with an item of electronic content has been updated at a first device and automatically communicating a notification of the update between the first device and one or more servers. The actions also include selecting a second device that is associated with a user of the first device, automatically communicating the notification between the one or more servers and the selected second device, and automatically updating, by the second device, metadata that is stored on the second device and that is associated with the item of electronic content, based on the notification.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include the actions of determining that a user has updated metadata associated with an item of electronic content, and automatically forwarding a notification of the update to one or more servers.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, from a mobile device, a notification that a user has updated metadata associated with an item of electronic content, selecting other devices that are associated with the user, and automatically transmitting the notification to one or more of the other devices.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, from one or more servers, a notification that, using a different device, a user associated with the device has updated metadata associated with an item of electronic content, and automatically updating metadata that is stored on the device and that is associated with the item of electronic content, based on the notification.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an indication that metadata associated with electronic content stored on a mobile device has been updated, and identifying one or more other devices associated with a user of the mobile device that also store the electronic content. The actions also include causing metadata associated with the electronic content stored on the one or more other devices to be automatically updated.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in a system that includes first and second devices, and a server. The first device includes a storage medium configured to store metadata associated with an item of electronic content, one or more processors configured to determine that metadata stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content has been updated, and a network interface configured to automatically transmit a notification that the metadata stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content has been updated. The second device includes a storage medium configured to store metadata associated with the item of electronic content, a network interface configured to receive a notification that the metadata stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content is to be updated, and one or more processors configured to automatically update the metadata that is stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content, based on receiving the notification that the metadata stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content is to be updated. The server includes a network interface configured to receive, from the first device, the notification that the metadata stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content has been updated, and transmit, to the second device, the notification that the metadata stored on the storage medium in association with the item of electronic content is to be updated. The server also includes one or more processors configured to select the second device.","Other implementations of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.","These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance the first device and the second device are devices that are known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user at a time when the user has updated the metadata; the second device is a device that is known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user a time when the user has updated the metadata, and the first device is a device that is not known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user at the time when the user has updated the metadata; and\/or the first device automatically communicates the notification to the one or more servers through an Application Programming Interface (API).","In additional aspects, the item of electronic content includes an audio or video recording, a game, an application, a ringtone, or wallpaper; determining that the metadata associated with the item of electronic content has been updated further includes determining that the user has played, skipped, or applied a tag or rating to the item of electronic content; selecting a second device that is associated with the user further includes determining, at a first point in time, that the second device does not store the item of electronic content, and determining, at a later, second point in time, that the second device has begun storing the item of electronic content; and\/or automatically communicating a notification of the update between the first device and one or more servers further includes communicating the notification of the update between the first device and the one or more servers without requiring the user to physically connect the first device to the one or more servers or to the second device","In further aspects, automatically communicating a notification of the update between the first device and one or more servers further includes communicating the notification of the update between the first device and the one or more servers without requiring the user to manually initiate the communication; selecting a second device that is associated with the user further includes selecting a second device that is associated with the user and that is also associated with the item of electronic content; automatically updating metadata that is stored on the second device and that is associated with the item of electronic content further includes generating metadata for storage in association with the item of electronic content; and\/or when the metadata is generated, the item of electronic content is not yet stored by the second device.","The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers represent corresponding parts throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","102","104","106","102","108","110","104","108","112","106","108","114"]},"The networks  to  may include private networks, such as corporate intranets, or public networks, such as the Internet. The networks  to  may include the same network or different networks. In other implementations, one or more of the devices of the system  are connected to each other through a physical connection instead of a network connection.","In general, the various devices in the system  may each store one or more items of electronic content, such as audio or video recordings, games, applications, ringtones, wallpaper, electronic books, etc. Each device may also store metadata associated with an item of electronic content, such as a user rating and one or more user-entered tags for an audio recording, or a last-page-read for an electronic book. In general, metadata may be generated or updated each time a user interacts with an item of electronic content.","In one example, the media player device  may be able to play various types of electronic content. For example, the user may use the media player  to hear audio content, view video content, read an electronic book, or consume some other type of electronic content. In response to the user interacting with an item of electronic content, one or more items of metadata may be generated or updated. For example, metadata may be generated indicating that the user played, skipped or turned the volume up for a song, that the user has downloaded or has finished watching a movie, or that the user read up to a particular page in an electronic book.","In response to determining that metadata associated with an item of electronic content has been updated on a device, a notification may be automatically communicated from a device to the server . The server  may select one or more other devices to be notified of the update, and may automatically communicate the notification to each of the selected devices. In response to receiving the notification, each of the selected devices may automatically update metadata that is associated with the item of electronic content based on the notification, resulting in the synchronization of metadata across devices associated with the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"During state \u201cA\u201d, a user is listening to music on the media player device . The user may, for example, be listening to one or more songs included in media  stored in computer readable medium  included in the media player device . The user may, for example, be listening to music while exercising at a health club. As indicated by a message , a \u201cLove Song\u201d song has started to play on the media player device . Perhaps because the user does not want to hear the \u201cLove Song\u201d song while exercising (or, for some other reason), the user selects a control  to skip the \u201cLove Song\u201d song.","The media player device  may include metadata  that is included in the computer readable medium . The metadata  may include data that is stored, for example, in response to interactions related to items of electronic content. The metadata  may include, for example, among other metadata, metadata . The metadata  includes a set of song identifiers, and for each song identifier, a count of how many times the song has been skipped (e.g., how many times the song has been skipped in a particular time period (e.g., the current year), or how many total times the song has been skipped by the user). For example, the metadata  includes information indicating that an item of electronic content titled \u201cPop Song\u201d song has been skipped \u201c23\u201d times and that an item of electronic content titled \u201cMusic Video\u201d has never been skipped.","During state \u201cB\u201d, in response to the user pressing the control  on the media player device  to skip the \u201cLove Song\u201d song, an update application  increments a skip count for the \u201cLove Song\u201d song in the metadata , as indicated by a \u201c+1\u201d indicator . If the \u201cLove Song\u201d song has been skipped for the first time, the update application  may generate an initial entry in the metadata  for the \u201cLove Song\u201d song and may set the associated skip count to \u201c1\u201d. If there is an existing entry in the metadata  for the \u201cLove Song\u201d song, the update application  may increment the associated skip count by \u201c1\u201d.","During state \u201cC\u201d, in response to the updating of the metadata , a notification  of the update is automatically communicated from the media player device  to the server , over the network . The notification  may include, for example, an indication of the item of electronic content for which metadata was updated (e.g., \u201cLove Song\u201d), and an indication of the type of metadata update (e.g., an increment to a skip count). The notification  may also include information identifying the user and\/or the media player device . The notification  is communicated between the media player device  and the server  without requiring the user to physically connect the media player device  to the server  and without requiring the user to manually initiate the communication.","The server  includes metadata  included in computer readable medium . The metadata  includes, among other metadata, metadata . The metadata  includes, in association with the user, a set of identifiers of items of electronic content, and for each identifier, a list of devices which store the respective item of electronic content. For example, the metadata  indicates that the \u201cLove Song\u201d song is stored on the media player device  and on the work client computing device , that an item of electronic content titled \u201cPop Song\u201d is stored on the media player device  and on the home client computing device , that an item of electronic content titled \u201cMusic Video\u201d is stored on the media player device  and on a device included in the user's car, and that an item of electronic content titled \u201cHome Video\u201d is stored on the work client computing device .","During state \u201cD\u201d, an update application  included in the computer readable medium  may, in response to receiving the notification , identify an entry in the metadata  corresponding to the item of electronic content identified in the notification  (e.g., \u201cLove Song\u201d). For example, the update application  may identify an entry . The update application  may determine, based on the entry , whether one or more devices other than the device which sent the notification  also store the item of electronic content. For example, the update notification may identify, in the entry , a reference  to the work client computing device . The reference  may indicate that the an item of electronic content titled \u201cLove Song\u201d is stored in media  included in computer readable medium  of the work client computing device .","During state \u201cE\u201d, the server  automatically communicates a notification to each device identified as storing the item of electronic content. For example, the server  communicates a notification  to the work client computing device  over the network . Similar to the notification , the notification  may include, for example, an indication of the item of electronic content for which metadata was updated (e.g., \u201cLove Song\u201d), and an indication of the type of metadata update (e.g., an increment to a skip count).","As illustrated by reference , the server  does not communicate a notification to the home client computing device , since the home client computing device  is not identified as storing the \u201cLove Song\u201d item of electronic content. Communicating a notification about an update to metadata for an item of electronic content only to devices which store the item of electronic content may result in communication of less data than if a notification is sent to each of the user's devices regardless of whether a device stores the item of electronic content. In some implementations, however, a notification is sent to each of the user's devices, regardless of whether a device stores the item of electronic content.","During state \u201cF\u201d, an update application  updates metadata  included in metadata  included in the computer readable medium . Similar to the metadata , the metadata  includes a set of song identifiers, and for each song identifier, a count of how many times the song has been skipped. The update application  may identify an entry  in the metadata  corresponding to the item of electronic content identified in the notification , and may increment a skip count associated with the entry , as illustrated by a \u201c+1\u201d indicator . After the completion of state \u201cF\u201d, the metadata update initiated in state \u201cA\u201d is reflected in each of the user's devices which store the item of electronic content.","To further describe the system , each of the networks , , and  may be a private network, such as an intranet, a public network, such as the Internet, or some combination thereof. Two or more of the networks , , and  may be the same network. The media player device , the home client computing device , and the work client computing device  may each be, for example, a laptop computer, desktop computer, television, set top box, mobile phone, PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), smart phone, BlackBerry\u2122, portable music player, some other handheld or mobile device, or some other type of client device.","The media player device  includes a processor , the server  includes a processor , the work client computing device  includes a processor , and the home client computing device  includes a processor (not shown) and computer readable medium (not shown). The processors , , and  may each be a processor suitable for the execution of a computer program, such as a general or special purpose microprocessor. In some implementations, one or more of the client device , the server , the home client computing device , and the work client computing device  includes more than one processor. Each of the computer-readable mediums , , and  store and record information or data, and each may be an optical storage medium, magnetic storage medium, flash memory, or any other storage medium type.","In some implementations, the computer readable medium  included in the server  includes media . For example, the media  may include some or all of the media included in the media  and the media . In some implementations, the computer readable medium  includes a media index, such as the metadata , which indicates which items of electronic content are stored on which devices. In some implementations, the computer readable medium  includes both the media  and a media index.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"In more detail, when the process  begins (), it is determined that metadata associated with an item of electronic content has been updated on a first device (). The item of electronic content may be, for example, an audio or video recording, a game, an application, a ringtone, wallpaper, an electronic book, or some other type of electronic content. The updating of metadata may include the user playing, skipping, applying a tag or a rating, or performing some other interaction to the item of electronic content, to name a few examples. As another example, metadata may be updated in response to a user reading up to a particular page in an electronic book on the first device. In general, metadata may be updated in response to a user action or in response to a device-initiated action. For example, metadata may be updated in response to the first device automatically downloading an update to an application.","In response to the metadata update, a notification of the update is automatically communicated between the first device and one or more servers (). The first device may, for example, automatically communicate the notification to the one or more servers through an Application Programming Interface (API). The API may allow the first device to communicate, along with other data, a type of metadata update and an indication of the associated item of electronic content.","The update may be communicated without requiring any action by the user. For example, the notification of the update may be communicated between the first device and the one or more servers without requiring the user to physically connect the first device to the one or more servers or to the second device. As another example, the notification may be communicated without requiring the user to manually initiate the communication.","The first device may be known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user at a time when the user has updated the metadata. For example, one or more of the servers may store metadata which indicates that the first device is associated with the user. The metadata associating the first device with the user may, for example, have been first stored on a server in response to the first device being registered with the server.","As described in more detail below with respect to , the first device may be a device that is not known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user at the time when the user has updated the metadata. For example, the first device may be a device that is owned by or associated with a third party. In this example, the API may allow the first device to send an identity of the user, along with a type of metadata update and an indication of the associated item of electronic content.","Optionally, a second device that is associated with a user of the first device is selected (). The second device may be a device that is known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user a time when the user has updated the metadata. In some implementations, a third and possibly other devices are also selected, if two or more other devices other than the first device are known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user. In some implementations, all devices that are known by the one or more servers to be associated with the user are selected.","As another example, in some implementations, a second device (and possibly one or more other devices) that is associated with the user and that is also associated with the item of electronic content is selected. For example, in addition to the first device, there may be four other devices associated with the user, and that the item of electronic content is stored on two of the four devices. In this example, the two devices which store the item of electronic content may be selected. As another example, the second device may be a device that is capable of playing both audio and video content, and that the third device is capable of playing audio content but not video content. In this example, if the item of electronic content is a video recording, the second device but not the third device may be selected.","The notification is automatically communicated between the one or more servers and the selected second device (). If more than one device is selected, the notification may be communicated to each selected device. The notification may be automatically communicated through an API. The notification may be communicated without requiring the second device to be physically connected to a server.","Metadata that is stored on the second device and that is associated with the item of electronic content is automatically updated, by the second device, based on the notification (), thereby ending the process  (). For some notifications, an existing item of metadata may be updated (e.g., an existing item of metadata may be replaced with a new item of metadata, based on information included in the notification). For example, if the notification indicates a skip of a song and if the second device previously stored a skip count of five for the song, the stored value of five may be replaced with an updated value of six. As another example, for some notifications, metadata may be generated for storage in association with the item of electronic content. For example, if the notification indicates a rating for a video recording and if the second device currently does not store a rating for the video recording, metadata indicating the received rating may be generated and stored on the second device, in association with the video recording.","For some notifications, when the metadata is generated or updated on the first device, the item of electronic content is not yet stored by the second device. For example, as described above, in some implementations, the notification may be automatically communicated to each device that is associated with the user, regardless of whether a device currently stores the item of electronic content. In these implementations, it may be determined, at a later point in time, after the metadata is stored on the second device, that the second device has begun storing the item of electronic content, and in response to the determination the stored metadata may be associated with the item of electronic content.","As a particular example, a user may rate a song using a first device, where the song is stored on the first device but is not stored on the user's second device. A notification for the rating may be sent to the second device and metadata for the rating may be stored on the second device. When the user later downloads the song to the second device. The metadata for the rating previously stored on the second device may be associated with the song, in metadata stored on the second device.","As mentioned above, in some implementations, a notification is not sent to a second device if a server determines that the second device does not store the item of electronic content. However, the server may, at a later point in time, determine that the second device has begun storing the item of electronic content (e.g., the user may download the item of electronic content to the second device).

Aspects may be implemented as one or more computer program products, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The computer readable medium may be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a memory device, a composition of matter effecting a machine-readable propagated signal, or a combination of one or more of them. The term \u201cdata processing apparatus\u201d encompasses all apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus may include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them. A propagated signal is an artificially generated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus.","A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) may be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it may be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program may be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program may be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","The processes and logic flows described in this disclosure may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows may also be performed by, and apparatus may also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).","Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer may be embedded in another device, e.g., a tablet computer, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio player, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, to name just a few. Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory may be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, aspects may be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user may provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices may be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user may be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","Aspects may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user may interact with an apsect, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) and a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), e.g., the Internet.","The computing system may include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","While this disclosure contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosure or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular aspects. Certain features that are described in this disclosure in the context of separate implementations may also be implemented in combination in a single aspect. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single aspect may also be implemented in multiple aspects separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination may in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.","Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems may generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.","In each instance where an HTML file is mentioned, other file types or formats may be substituted. For instance, an HTML file may be replaced by an XML, JSON, plain text, or other types of files. Moreover, where a table or hash table is mentioned, other data structures (such as spreadsheets, relational databases, or structured files) may be used.","Thus, particular implementations of the invention have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims may be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
