{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/019,250, filed Jan. 5, 2008, titled: ENTERTAINMENT SEAT, in the name of Butt et al.; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/019,255, filed Jan. 5, 2008, titled: GAMING SEAT, in the name of Butt et al.; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/036,510, filed Mar. 14, 2008, titled: INTEGRAL ARMREST IN SEATBACK FOR ENTERTAINMENT SEATING, in the name of Butt et al. all of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The present disclosure relates generally to a seat for use in a variety of applications relating to entertainment or gaming seating. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an entertainment seat that provides three-dimensional motion simulation for an immersive entertainment and\/or sensory experience for a user.","A variety of entertainment seats are currently in use. The popularity of video games, home theaters, cinemas, movie theaters, amusement parks, gaming arcades, and the like has increased dramatically in recent years. Entertainment seats currently available are known to provide an enhanced experience for users. For example, reclining seats containing cup holders, storage trays, position controls, Integrated speakers, etc. are currently used in multiple entertainment facilities and private residences. Some entertainment chairs or seats simulate real-time gaming situations, such as a driver of a race car, a pilot of an airplane, a quarterback in a football game, etc. The known simulating real-time gaming seats are relatively very expensive and have resulted in very limited market development for such entertainment seats.","While the generally known chairs and seats are useful, the remains a need for an entertainment seat to better enhance a user's entertainment and gaming experiences. Video game companies are adding information to software, media and systems to further improve and enhance the realism of the gaming experience. Data are being added to software embedded in DVD's such as for movies that include information that may be processed to move a seat in conjunction with the action in a video used in a movie or game, for example. Entertainment and communication is becoming more immersive. The entertainment industry is seeking new and novel ways of interfacing with a user to provide a higher fidelity of immersive experience\u2014including the concept of feedback and\/or touch. Therefore, there remains a need for an entertainment seat that is capable of providing three-dimensional movement that can improve and enhance the entertainment experience while being more flexible, less obtrusive, more easily and compactly stored at a lower cost, and more easily manufactured at a lower cost.","An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure relates to an enhanced entertainment seat design and utility, the entertainment seat including a seat base and seat back having a seat architecture utilizing a seat construction providing structural support; armrests fixed to the base of the seat, providing relative movement of the seat to a fixed interface; eliminating the need for structure in the lower portion of the seat; seat motion actuators for seat movement; and a seat motion control system for operating the seat motion actuators. The entertainment seat may be further modified and adapted specifically for gaming.","According to an alternate embodiment, the entertainment seat may be further modified and adapted specifically for gaming. The gaming seat including a seat base and seat back having a seat architecture utilizing a seat construction providing structural support; armrests fixed to the base of the seat, providing relative movement of the seat to a fixed interface; eliminating the need for structure in the lower portion of the seat; seat motion actuators for seat movement; a seat motion control system for operating the seat motion actuators; and a gaming structure for enhancing the gaming experience. The gaming structure includes a first tubular structure and a second tubular structure pivotally coupled to the gaming seat. The first tubular structure provides foot support for the occupant and area to attach gaming interface devices, such as foot pedals. The second tubular structure provides area to attach additional gaming devices, such as joysticks, steering wheels, and the like.","Referring generally to the FIGURES, an entertainment or gaming seat ,  is shown. More particularly,  show a seat  that has particular use as an entertainment seat such as viewing a video or movie and  show a seat  that has particular use as a gaming seat for playing games according to exemplary embodiments. Generally, the seat ,  includes, inter alia, a frame structure (Seat Frame Assembly)  for providing support, mechanisms for providing adjustment such as for comfort and operational and\/or performance adjustments by a motion system  for moving the seat ,  interactively with a video or game. One such particularly advantageous motion system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,662,560; 6,659,773; 6,585,515; and 6,139324, which are incorporated herein by reference.","Referring now to , a seat  is shown that may be used as an entertainment seat such as for viewing a video. The seat  includes, inter alia, a seat back , a first and second seat back member , , a seat base , a first and second arm rest , , a first and second side member , , a first and second side bolster , , a rear seat back\/base member , a head restraint , leg rest  and a control interface . The lower portion of the seat back  is coupled to the rear portion of the seat base . The seat back  comprises a first and second seat back member ,  and is straddled by the first and second side bolster ,  to enhance comfort and support for the occupant. The seat base  is straddled by the first and second side members , . The head restraint  is coupled to the top portion of the seat back . The rear seat back\/base member  is coupled to the seat base  and seat back  to cover the rear lower portion of the entertainment seat . The leg rest  is coupled to the front portion of the seat base . The control interface  is coupled to the entertainment seat  so that the occupant\/user may adjust (e.g., seat motion, seat back position, leg rest position, speaker volume, massage, heaters, etc.) the entertainment seat  according to their needs and\/or desires.","Referring now to , a seat frame assembly  is shown. The seat frame assembly  generally includes, inter alfa, a seat back frame member , a seat base frame member , a first and second arm rest frame member , , a first and second side frame member , , a head restraint frame member , a leg rest frame member  and a recliner mechanism . The seat back frame member  and the seat base frame member  are coupled together via the recliner mechanism  and are straddled by the first and second side frame members , . The first and second arm rest frame member ,  are coupled to the first and second side frame members , , respectively. The first and second arm rest frame members ,  may be coupled to the side frame members ,  using any suitable structure (e.g., bolts, screws, wire connectors, etc.), technique (e.g., welds, adhesives, etc.), and\/or combination thereof. Each side frame member ,  supports each arm rest frame member ,  and extends from the seat base frame member . The seat base frame member  includes a front cross frame member  and a rear cross frame member  for forming the seat base (cushion)  for supporting an occupant. A plurality of seat base (cushion) support springs (e.g. sinusoidal, etc.)  extend between the front and rear cross frame member , , but any appropriate support structure (e.g., tension material, seat pans, panels, etc.) may be used for supporting the occupant and for attaching the additional structures and materials (e.g., foam, padding, trim cover, etc.).","Toward or on a front portion of the seat , a leg rest  may be pivotally coupled to the entertainment seat  (e.g., the front cross frame member , side members , , etc.) using an appropriate pivot  and coupling structure  (e.g., bracket, etc.). The leg rest pivot  is located proximal to the seat base (cushion)  to preferably be located under an occupant's knees\u2014in essence. The leg rest  extends substantially across the front of the seat  and is pivoted using link member  as described below. The leg rest  is operated to provide support for the legs of the occupant when the seat  is moved toward the recline position.","The seat back frame member  is pivotally coupled to the seat . The seat back frame member  is a generally a bent and formed tubular frame structure. The seat back frame member  includes a first, centrally located pair of vertically extending central cross frame members  for providing support to the torso portion of the occupant, preferably via a foam cushion located thereon (not shown). The seat back frame member  further includes a second, laterally located pair of vertically extending cross frame members  for providing support to the lateral or shoulder areas of the occupant via a foam cushion located thereon, as best shown in . At its lower end, the seat back frame member  is pivotally connected to first and second side frame members , . On the first side, the seat back frame member  is coupled to the first side frame member  using a simple pivot pin  connecting a pair of brackets  extending from the seat back frame member  and the first and second side frame members , , respectively. On the other side, the seat back frame member  is pivotally coupled to the second side frame member  preferably using a recliner mechanism  which is capable of locking the seat back frame member  at a plurality of incremental rotational locations such as by using a discontinuous recliner mechanism . Alternatively, the recliner mechanism  may be a free-pivoting device which provides a tensioned recline adjustment. In either embodiment, the rotation of the seat back frame member  via the recliner mechanism  is preferably, and alternatively, balanced using a biasing device  (e.g., clock-type spring, etc.), as best shown in .","On at least one side of the seat back frame member  is an extension bracket . The extension bracket  pivots about the pivot of the seat back frame member  and is coupled to the link member . The link member  extends laterally and distally from a location proximal the seat back frame member  to a location near the front of the seat . The link member  has one end coupled to the extension bracket  and another end coupled to the leg rest . The link member  moves when the extension bracket  rotates to pivot the leg rest  from a retracted position to a reclined position. The particular design provides for a leg rest  having a maximized length (or height depending upon its orientation) while avoiding the use of a scissor-type leg rest extender.","The seat back  and link member  further include a lost motion device  which allows the seat back  to pivot a predetermined amount (preferably about ten to twenty-five degrees of rotation from vertical) without the leg rest  being driven by the link member . Once the lost motion is depleted, the link member  begins to drive the leg rest  up. The link member  is designed to drive the leg rest  from its vertical, stowed position to its horizontal, deployed position (about ninety degrees of leg rest rotation) through about thirty degrees of seat back  rotation. A biasing mechanism  (e.g., spring, etc.) is used to apply a preferably continuous force to the leg rest  in the vertical, stowed position.","Referring now to , a seat base frame member  is shown. The seat base frame member  includes only three points of contact with a support surface (e.g., floor, etc.) where the seat  is used. Toward the front of the seat , first and second front-side motion actuators ,  each include a support surface engaging member , . Toward the rear of the seat , a preferably fixed and centrally located support surface engaging member  is provided and preferably extends vertically downward from the seat base frame member . In the un-activated position, as shown in , the three support surface engaging members , ,  are aligned in a substantially horizontal plane and an occupant of the seat  is substantially oriented in a traditional seating position.","The seat base frame member  further includes a cross support member  extending laterally across the seat  from one side frame member  to the other side frame member  angularly to the seat base frame member  to provide support and stiffness to the seat frame assembly  and for transferring and managing load forces of the occupant while the motion system  is operating.","The seat  also preferably includes a head rest frame member  for the occupant's use and head support. The head rest frame member  is preferably pivotally coupled to the seat back frame member  at an upper cross frame member  using any known or appropriate coupling (e.g., brackets, pivot pin, etc.). The head rest frame member  is preferably and alternatively adjustable by the occupant during operation of the entertainment seat  between a range of comfortable positions.","Each side frame member , , toward the front of the seat , includes a motion actuator ,  of the motion system . The motion actuators ,  are preferably fixedly coupled to a vertical portion of the side frame members , . Alternatively, the motion actuators ,  may be removably coupled to the side frame members ,  provided that the motion of the motion actuators ,  is transferred to the seat . The motion actuators ,  are preferably positioned within an internal area of the seat base frame , as best shown in .","By fixing an interface to a structure of the seat  (e.g., arm rest, etc.) and providing relative movement of the entertainment seat  to a fixed interface (not shown in ), an opportunity exists to virtually \u201ctouch\u201d and provide moving contact to a user.","It will be understood that as the motion actuators ,  operate, they push against the support surface (e.g., floor) to raise that portion of the seat . Since the motion actuators ,  are located toward the sides and toward the front of the seat , and there is only a single, central pivot in the rear of the seat , the seat  is designed to pivot about the third, rear, support surface engaging member . It has been discovered that this arrangement provides a lower cost motion seat  while still providing a substantial, and nearly equivalent, motion effect as compared to a four motion actuator system where there is an actuator at each corner of the motion seat.","Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that the spacing of the motion actuators ,  of the motion system  and the third support surface engaging member  are chosen to enhance the performance of the motion system . The spacing is optimized to maximize the entertainment experience of the motion system  while the geometry of the seat  and the spacing is further optimized to increase the stability of the system during intended operating conditions. The location of the motion actuators ,  for such a system is best in the front of the seat  to provide the occupant with increased sensation of pitch (front to back) motion of the seat . The lateral spacing of the motion actuators ,  was determined to be between approximately 530 and 700 mm while the spacing from a line through the front motion actuators ,  and the third support member  is between approximately 550 and 680 mm. More particularly, the lateral spacing of the motion actuators ,  was determined to be between approximately 570 and 615 mm while the spacing from a line through the front motion actuators ,  and the third support member  is between approximately 640 and 660 mm. Even more particularly, the lateral spacing of the motion actuators ,  was determined to be approximately 600 mm while the spacing from a line through the front motion actuators ,  and the third support member  is approximately 660 mm.","An operation or motion intensity control (switch) interface  for the occupant to control the operation and preferences of the motion system  is provided toward the front portion and on the internal side near or on one arm rest , . The interface  is preferably located on a vertical side frame member ,  of the one side frame ,  and is coupled thereto using any appropriate structure including fasteners or the like such that it is fixedly or removably coupled. The location provides the occupant with a better ability to more simply locate and control the motion actuators , .","The motion system  further includes a main control unit , preferably located in a box-like structure within the interior area of the seat . In particular, the main control unit  is connected to a pair of cross members  extending from one side frame member  to the other side frame member . Appropriate electrical connections extend from the main control unit  to the actuators ,  and an appropriate power supply connection is provided (such as a power cord\u2014not shown).","Referring now to , the foam cushions  and finished side members of the entertainment seat are shown. In particular, it should be noted that the side members ,  are formed from two pieces, an internal side finish member  and an external side finish member  to provide an integrated armrest  and closeout feature for side facings of the entertainment seat . In particular, a structural foam material is appropriately selected and utilized for the internal side finish member  and the external side finish member . The structural foam  and designs as shown provide for integrated attachment features for coupling the internal side finish member  and the external side finish member  to the side frame members , . The above provides an appropriate appearance, an appropriately functioning and comfortable arm rest  portion and a relatively low cost, easy to assemble arm and side structures , .","The seat back  of the entertainment seat  is preferably also constructed of a two piece seat back cushion . A first piece of the seat back cushion  is a seat back base member  that covers a central portion of the seat back  and includes cushioned side bolsters ,  for covering and cushioning the sides of the seat back frame member . The central portion of the seat back base member  is a relatively thin member having very little or no foam cushion material. A second piece of the seat back cushion  is central, top foam cushion member  designed to be located between the side bolsters ,  of the central seat back base member . The central, top foam cushion member  also preferably, but optionally, includes a foam cushion  and cover for the head restraint  of the seat back . Referring to , this construction results in a lay on insert and head rest cushion assembly  for the back cushion  which provides an appropriately functioning and improved comfort seat back  at an advantageously, relatively low cost that is easy to assemble. This assembly  results in the fasteners that are used to couple the seat back base member  to the seat back frame member  being easily covered by the central, top foam cushion member . The above construction makes it possible to ship the seat  with the back frame member  disassembled and for the a consumer to couple the seat back frame  to the seat  and to then easily install the seat back base member  on the seat back frame member  and then easily install the central, top foam cushion member . Separation of the seat back frame member  and the central, top foam cushion member  makes it possible to easily utilize a slab foam insert for the central, top foam cushion member  for providing improved comfort at a lower cost and for providing a seat back frame member  optionally made from a poured foam product.","Referring now to , a seat  having particular application as a gaming chair or seat such as for playing a first person shooter or driving game (for example) is shown according to one exemplary embodiment. The seat  includes a seat back , seat base , a first and second arm rests , , a first and second side bolster , , a head restraint , and a leg rest . The lower portion of the seat back  is coupled to the rear portion of the seat base . The seat base  is straddled by the first and second arm rest ,  and the head restraint  is coupled to the top portion of the seat back . The leg rest  is coupled to the front portion of the seat base . The gaming seat  is disclosed as a three legged gaming seat  having a front pair of legs , , laterally spaced across the front of the gaming seat  and a third centrally located rear leg  extending rearwardly and down from the seat area of the gaming seat .","Referring now to , a gaming seat frame assembly  is shown. The seat frame assembly  generally includes, inter alia, a seat back frame member , a seat base frame member , a first and second arm rest frame member , , a head restraint frame member , a leg rest frame member  and a recliner mechanism . The seat base (cushion) support frame member  includes a front cross frame member  which is aligned under the knees of an occupant and a rear cross frame member .","A plurality of support springs (e.g., sinusoidal)  extend between the front and rear cross frame members ,  but any appropriate structure may be used for supporting the occupant and for attaching and supporting the foam cushion and trim cover structures .","In the exemplary embodiment of three legged gaming seat , the motion actuators ,  of the motion system  are utilized as the front legs ,  and are connected directly to a base frame support member  which forms the sides frame members ,  of the central seat cushion support frame portion  and then extends rearwardly and downwardly to form the rear support member or third leg  of the gaming seat . The seat base frame member  is preferably, and optionally a single piece, bent tubular frame member which has a first end coupled to one motion actuator  and a second end coupled to the other motion actuator . Optionally, base frame member  may be a plurality of parts that are coupled and\/or assembled.","The seat back frame member , which is preferably, but optionally, pivotally coupled to the base frame member  proximal a location near the back of the central cushion support frame portion  where the side portions of the base frame member  bend rearwardly and downwardly. The seat back frame member  is a generally bent and formed, tubular member, preferably, but optionally, having a generally round cross-section. The seat back frame member  includes a centrally located pair of vertically extending cross frame members  for providing support to the central area of the occupant via the foam cushion  located thereon. The seat back frame member  further includes a second, laterally located pair of vertically and laterally, angularly extending wing cross frame members  for providing support to the lateral or shoulder areas of the occupant via the foam cushion  located thereon, as best shown in .","Each side of the seat back frame member  preferably, but optionally, includes an extension bracket  for pivotally coupling the seat back frame member  to preferably, but optionally, a respective pair of extension brackets  connected to the base frame member . Each side of the seat back frame member  preferably, but optionally, includes a simple pivot connection . The gaming seat  includes a foldable leg rest (support)  connected to align with and extend from a front edge of the seat cushion portion .","The seat back frame member  is pivotally coupled to pivot with respect to the base frame member  using the simple pivots and against the action of a recliner mechanism  located under the seat cushion area  and including a biasing member  (e.g., compression spring, etc.). This optimally eliminates the inclusion of a recliner mechanism  at an outboard portion of the pivot area of the seat back pivot . The recliner mechanism  is interposed in the seat base frame member  and a central cross frame support member  aligned with the arms ,  of the gaming seat , as best shown in ,  and . The recliner mechanism  includes an actuator  for releasing the recliner mechanisms  and allowing the seat back frame member  to pivot and lock the position of the seat back  when the actuator  is released.","Still referring to , the gaming seat  preferably, but optionally, includes on each side of the central seat portion , a fixed arm rest ,  that may be coupled to the frame structure . Each arm rest ,  may be coupled (removably or fixedly) using any appropriate structure including bolts, screws, welds, etc. or any combination thereof. The arm rest ,  may have any know or appropriate structure for supporting the arms of the occupant.","Toward or on the front portion of the seat , a leg rest frame member  may be pivotally coupled to the gaming seat  (e.g., front cross frame member , side members , , etc) using an appropriate pivot and coupling structure. This positions the leg rest pivot very close to the seat cushion  (i.e., under the occupant's knee). The leg rest member  extends substantially across the front of the seat  and is pivoted using a link member  as described below. The leg rest  is operated to provide support for the legs of the occupant when the seat  is moved toward the recline position.","On the back of the lower cross frame member  of the seat back frame , there is an extension bracket  for connection with the link member . The extension bracket  rotates with the seat back  and pivots about the pivot of the seat back frame member  and is connected to the link member . The link member  extends laterally and distally from a location proximal the seat back frame  to a location near the front of the seat . The link member  has one end coupled to the extension bracket  and seat back frame  and another end coupled to the leg rest . The link member  moves when the seat back frame  rotates to cause the leg rest  to pivot between a refracted position to an extended position as the seat back frame member  pivots from a seated position to a reclined position. The particular design provides for a leg rest  having a maximized length (or height depending upon its orientation) while avoiding the use of a scissor-type leg rest extender.","The gaming seat  further preferably, but optionally, includes a lost motion device  as part of the recliner mechanism  which allows the seat back  to pivot a predetermined amount (preferably about 10 to 25 degrees of rotation from vertical) without the leg rest  being driven by the link member . Once the lost motion is depleted, the link member  begins to drive the leg rest  up. The link member  is designed to drive the leg rest  from its vertical, stowed position to its horizontal, deployed position (about ninety degrees of leg rest rotation) through about thirty degrees of seat back rotation. A biasing mechanism  (e.g., spring, etc.) is used to apply a preferably continuous force to the leg rest  in the vertical, stowed position.","The seat base frame member  includes only three points of contact with a support surface (floor) where the seat  is used. Toward the front of the seat , first and second front-side motion actuators ,  each include a support surface engaging member , . Toward the rear of the seat , a preferably fixed and centrally located support surface engaging member  is provided and preferably extends from the seat base frame member  vertically downward. In the neutral position, as best shown in , the three support surface engaging members , ,  are aligned in a substantially horizontal plane and an occupant of the seat  is substantially oriented in a traditional seating position.","The seat  also preferably includes a head rest  for the occupant's use and support. The head rest frame member  is preferably pivotally coupled to the seat back frame  at an upper cross frame member  using any known or appropriate coupling. The head rest  is preferably and alternatively adjustable by the occupant during operation of the gaming seat  between a range of comfort positions using any known or appropriate adjuster.","It should be understood that as the motion actuators ,  operate, they push against the support surface to raise that portion of the seat . Since the actuators ,  are located at the sides and toward the front of the seat , and there is only a single central pivot in the rear of the seat , the gaming seat  is designed to pivot about the third, rear, support surface engaging member .

In particular, the main control unit  is connected to a cross member  extending from one motion actuator  to the other motion actuator  but may alternatively extend from one side frame member  to the other side frame member . Appropriate electrical connections extend from the main control unit  to the motion actuators ,  and an appropriate power supply connection is provided (such as a power cord\u2014not shown).","Referring now to , the gaming seat  of the present disclosure in one exemplary embodiment includes a gaming structure  which is connected to the gaming seat  proximal the arm rests ,  as best shown in . The gaming structure  is preferably, but optionally, a one piece tube (a first tubular structure)  bent in a substantially complex U-shape to provide a foot support  including for use in supporting a first gaming interface device  (e.g., foot pedals, etc.). A second tubular structure  is connected on one side of the gaming structure  for use in presenting a second gaming interface device  for hand use by the occupant (e.g., joystick, steering wheel, display, controls, etc.). The second tubular structure  is preferably pivotally coupled to allow it to be moved close to the occupant in the gaming seat  and to move away from the occupant to allow simple egress and ingress from and to the gaming seat .","The construction of the gaming seat  preferably, but optionally, makes it possible to ship the gaming seat  with the back frame member  disassembled and for the a consumer to install the seat back base member  on the seat back frame member  and then optionally install the seat back foam cushion member . The foam cushion members  preferably, but optionally utilize a slab foam insert for the foam cushion members  for providing improved comfort at a lower cost and may optionally be a poured foam product.","It should be understood that in an alternate exemplary embodiment the seats ,  may be modified to include different functionality and enhancing components such as speakers, cup holders, seat heaters, MP3 connections, seat massagers, etc. It should also be noted that alternatively, the seats ,  may include, inter alia, a directly connected viewing screen\/display and\/or a control support or bar.","The seats ,  may be constructed\/designed to have any size, dimension, shapes, etc. and be covered and\/or filled with any suitable material (e.g., leather, vinyl, woven or non-woven fabric, pleather (faux leather), foam, etc.) to further enhance aesthetics and comfort. The exterior and\/or trim of the seats ,  may be modified to accommodate any variety of decorative trim components including color schemes, sports themes and movie themes etc. that may be desired for decorative and\/or functional purposes. Accordingly, the seats ,  may alternately be decorated to be used in a movie theater, an amusement park, a private residence, a game arcade, an airplane, a space ship, a seat in an automobile or truck, etc.","Referring now to , an entertainment seat assembly  according to one exemplary embodiment is shown. The seat assembly  includes a seat portion (seat base)  supported by a frame-like undercarriage. The frame includes legs . An integral footrest (leg rest) assembly  is connected by a linkage mechanism (not shown) through the frame so as to move between retracted () and extended () conditions upon demand.","A back rest (seat back)  is supported by the frame at the rearward edge of the seat portion  and can be manipulated between generally erect () and reclined () positions to suit the comfort of an occupant. The back rest  has an intentionally designed contour to comfortably support the back portion of an occupant seated therein.","A head restraint  may be connected to the back rest  at its uppermost end. The head restraint  may either be rigidly fixed in position or adjustable to meet occupant preferences. Alternatively, the head restraint  (and indeed the footrest ) may be eliminated all together in lower cost or special use versions of the seat assembly .","The seat assembly  includes at least one, but preferably two integral arm rests . Each arm rest  is pivotally connected to the backrest  using appropriate hardware (not shown). In an alternative construction (not shown), the arm rest  may be connected to the seat portion , or alternatively to the frame structure and\/or rear legs . The arm rests  are individually moveable between a retracted position as shown on the right-handed side of , and an extended position as shown on the left-handed side of  and . A directional arrow in  illustrates the pivotal motion through which an armrest  is manipulated to return an extended arm rest  to its retracted, stowed or non-use position.","Each arm rest  includes an upper surface  which is appropriately shaped and padded so that, in the extended position, the forearm of an occupant can be comfortably rested thereon. In other words, an occupant's arm will lie in substantial surface-to-surface contact with the upper surface  of the arm rests  when the arm rests  are in the extended or deployed condition. The arm rests  also include a lower surface  which is specially contoured and configured so that, when the armrest  is stowed in a non-use position, a generally fair, continuous curvature is formed with the backrest . This is depicted in , showing that the lower surface  of the arm rest , when stowed, completes a fully contoured seat backrest , thereby providing added comfort and support to an occupant.","The backrest  is preferably designed with scalloped side edges  having a profile that conforms to an inner-surface curvature  of each arm rest . In other words, the inner-surface curvature  of the arm rest  fits much like a puzzle piece against the scalloped edges  of the backrest  when the arm rest  is in its stowed, non-use position.","Thus, according to this embodiment, the seat assembly  creates an arm rest  that is preferably, integral with the seat back . When the arm rest  is in an up, out of the way position, a wider seat back  is created. When the arm rest  is in a down position, it is convenient for the occupant to utilize the upper support surface  for resting arms and elbows. The retractable arm rests  are also conducive to placing two or more seat backs  side-by-side and, owing to the contoured lower surfaces , thereby providing an uninterrupted surface for multiple occupants.","In another alternative embodiment, two adjacent seats  may share a common arm rest , with its lower surface  providing a transitioning contour between the respective back rests . The seat assembly  may be utilized in applications other than home theater seating, including land vehicles, aircraft, nautical vehicles, and the like.","For purposes of this disclosure, the term \u201ccoupled\u201d means the joining of two components (electrical or mechanical) directly or indirectly to one another. Such joining may be stationary in nature or movable in nature. Such joining may be achieved with the two components (electrical or mechanical) and any additional intermediate members being integrally formed as a single unitary body with one another or with the two components or the two components and any additional member being attached to one another. Such joining may be permanent in nature or alternatively may be removable or releasable in nature.","The foregoing description of embodiments of the innovation has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
