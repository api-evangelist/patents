{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to sourcing processes and more particularly to Internet based market management.","Commercial sites on the Internet (in particular on the World Wide Web) are known. Typically, Web sites where merchandise or services can be purchased consist of a static description of the goods or services being offered, the price at which such goods or services are being offered, and some type of order form for a customer to enter personal and payment information. Similarly, Web sites soliciting merchandise and services consist of a static description of the goods or services sought, the price at which such goods or services will be purchased at, and some type of order form for a seller to enter personal information.","Such sites are not well suited for the purchase of goods or services that are negotiable, including unique, surplus, high-volume or discontinued items, or negotiable services. The known commercial Web sites are interactive only to the extent that a customer is able to choose a particular item for purchase and to enter payment and shipment information. Such Web sites include so-called \u201cauction\u201d sites such as NetMarket.RTM. (www.netmarket.com), in which users may consecutively enter prices they are willing to pay for specific products, until a set deadline, thus bidding up the price. The product is then sold to the customer with the highest bid. Such \u201cauction\u201d Web sites do not allow the user to negotiate with the vendor, or vice versa. Consequently, there is no manner by which negotiation can take place between the seller and the customer.","Thus, there exists a need in the art for a dynamic and interactive computer-implemented system which is capable of purchasing, through a distributed network such as the Internet, goods and\/or services that have negotiable prices.","The present disclosure provides for affording a market management framework. Category analysis is provided for a user specified project. Supplier analysis is performed for the user specified project. A strategy is then developed for determining the suppliers for the specified project based on the supplier analysis. Further, negotiations are managed between selected suppliers and the user.","In one aspect of the present invention, providing category analysis includes identifying a file including expenditure data relating to spent monies, extracting the expenditure data from the file, determining an independent and a dependent variable relating to the expenditure data, graphing the expenditure data based on the determined variables, and displaying conclusions based on the expenditure data.","In another aspect of the present invention, performing supplier analysis includes providing access to a database including supplier profile data, identifying supply chain relationships based on particular commodities and the supplier profile data, generating a report depicting the identified supply chain relationships, allowing users to create request for information for specified suppliers based on the generated report, and distributing the created request for information to the specified suppliers.","In yet another aspect of the present invention, developing a strategy for determining the suppliers includes allowing a user to dynamically create a request for quote document, grouping specific request for quote line items based on a request from the user, enabling the user to attach further data to the request for quote document, and distributing the request for quote document to specific suppliers.","In a further aspect of the present invention, managing negotiations includes allowing a user to post an electronic request for quote on a website, affording selected suppliers access to the request for quote on the website, supporting electronic negotiations between the user and a selected supplier, and facilitating post-negotiation analysis via a decision matrix.","A preferred embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention is preferably practiced in the context of a personal computer such as an IBM compatible personal computer, Apple Macintosh computer or UNIX based workstation. A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with a preferred embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device . The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MAC OS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on platforms and operating systems other than those mentioned.","A preferred embodiment is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, one's logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Bemers-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornnents, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","208"]},"Upon performance of the sourcing process, a cyclic order process  is performed.

In this way the supplier is not exposed to further decreases in the price of the purchase offer, and is removed from that particular auction process.","In another variation, the process of  includes registration of the supplier or potential suppliers which can take place as part of a pre-registration process. The registration process can occur on-line or can be carried out off-line.","According to a further variation of the invention, the process of  includes connecting the computer site directly to separate and distinct financial institutes for real time confirmation of acceptable financial transaction of the purchase price of goods under an accepted purchase offer. In this way, automated payment confirmation is carried out.","A computer site for reverse auctioning for purchase of goods on-line according to the present invention includes at least one web server computer designed for serving a host of computer browsers and providing said browsers with the capability to participate in various auctions, where each auction is of a single purchase offer, at a specified time, with a specified number of the goods under the purchase offer available for sale. The web server cooperates with a separate database computer, separated from the web server computer by a firewall. The database computer is accessible to the web computer server computer to allow selective retrieval of purchase offer information.","Assuming the supplier wishes to confirm the purchase of goods\/services under the purchase offer, the database server takes the financial information of the buyer and sends the pertinent information to the bank system for immediate authorization. Real time feedback is preferably provided directly to the supplier. If the transaction is turned down for any reason and the auction process remains in process, the quantity figure is appropriately adjusted higher. This quantity figure was decreased once the supplier indicated his desire to accept the purchase offer.","If the transaction is authorized, then E-mail confirmation is sent by the mail server to the supplier. If the transaction is not authorized, this can also be indicated to the supplier by E-mail. With the present system, it can be appreciated that although the supplier participates in the auction process, the actual commitment to accept the purchase offer is not made until full costs are known, including the freight costs and appropriate taxes. If the supplier decides not to accept the portion of the purchase offer, the portion of the purchase offer is returned to the auction if the auction is still in progress. It can also be appreciated from the above description that the supplier is removed from the auction process as soon as a commitment to purchase is made. In this way, the final, or lowest price of the product is not known to the supplier.","The database server cooperates with each of the web server computers to allow for the rapid feed of information to the web server computers necessary to allow the supplier to be exposed to the dynamic nature of the auction. This dynamic feedback includes the results of multiple suppliers with feedback occurring in seconds as opposed to minutes hours or days. It also allows the auction system to respond to a host of simultaneous triggers. Each web server is individually servicing many suppliers. Many different auctions can be occurring at the same time and therefore each web server provides the appropriate feed back to each supplier.","The supplier's identity is also used to confirm that he was qualified to participate within the auction. Once the identity is known, non-qualified participants can be so advised and the indication to accept cancelled.","Another feature of the auction system is the ability to track the price demand nature of the product described in the purchase offer. This provides valuable marketing information to the manufacturer. For example, in trying to determine the response at different prices, companies have to conduct various tests. In contrast with typical auction systems, a lot of information regarding price and demand is immediately known. The relationship between this type of supplier and the average supplier can then be applied to provide a conventional price demand curve for the particular product. It can readily be appreciated that the computer system provides the demand price curve. In order to provide good feedback to suppliers supporting the standard HTML 2.0 type browser, only a single auction screen is provided which has the number of units remaining to be purchased, the current price and the time remaining in the auction.

Large volumes of requests can be handled very quickly. Individual requests are serviced by the system within 70 milliseconds with loads up to about 90% capacity.

While in a preferred embodiment the network is the Internet, the invention is equally applicable to any distributed network, whether public or private.","A database contains information relating to the simulated merchants, goods being offered for sale, and user profiles. A management host processor communicates with the database and with a database engine. Management host processor performs administrative and management functions in maintaining the database, processing merchandise orders, and feeding real-time data to negotiating sessions.

The client may be implemented by a desktop computer, laptop computer, or any other type of computer, including web browser software enabling the client to communicate with and receive and process data from the server.","The database preferably is a Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS), as well known in the art.","The database engine is preferably implemented through the server. The database may communicate with the database engine and management host processor through conventional Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC) protocol, while the host processor may communicate with the database engine through TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) protocol.","The database stores a plurality of information relating to users, merchants and merchandise, which is processed by the database engine during live, interactive negotiating sessions with clients. The database includes user profiles and history data, business rules and logic data, merchandise brand interface data, upsell interface data, merchant character model behavior data, merchant character graphics data, a merchant dialogue generator, a product inventory interface, and a business reporting interface.","In a preferred embodiment, the system Web site contains hyperlink graphical portraits of the various merchants whose character information is stored in the database. A user may mouse-click on a selected portrait to link to hyperlinked text describing the items of merchandise being offered by that merchant. Clicking on the merchandise description will being the negotiating process.","The buyer begins the negotiating process by making an initial offer to purchase the selected merchandise at a particular price, accompanied by dialogue intended to get the supplier to a favorable emotional state to accept the buyer's offer. The supplier then would respond with a counteroffer.","In addition to making an offer to purchase, the buyer may ask the customer a yes\/no question. This is intended to build a demographic profile of the supplier which will be stored and used in later sessions with the same supplier. The supplier's response will also be used to calculate a new emotional state of the supplier which will determine the buyer's response to the supplier's counteroffer.","The buyer may further make additional offers to the supplier, such as \u201cthrow-in\u201d memberships to consumer buying clubs and the like, if the supplier would agree to the buyer's latest price. The identification of available \u201cthrow-ins\u201d are stored in \u201cupsell\u201d interface files.","The objective of the user or buyer is to interact with the supplier in a manner that would cause the supplier to agree to the buyer's monetary offer for the item at issue. In this regard, each supplier has a unique character profile as stored in the character model behavior files in the database. The supplier's mood or emotional state is conveyed to the buyer through three mechanisms. First, each time a buyer submits an offer, the character graphics are updated to a new facial expression indicative of the supplier's new emotional state. Second, textual dialogue matching the supplier's state is selected from the dialogue generator file and displayed to the buyer. Third, and perhaps more subtle, is the supplier's offer. As the supplier enters more negative emotional states, his or her offers will become less generous, and vice versa. The challenge for the buyer is to interpret the supplier's mood from the various indicators and respond with a counteroffer and associated mood that are appropriate for the perceived mood of the supplier.","The supplier's mood is calculated by the database engine in response to data retrieved from the database relating to the supplier profile and the buyer profile (if any). For example, a supplier whose state is \u201cSad\u201d receives a bid from a buyer with an \u201capologetic\u201d stance. However, the actual emotional state reached is derived from an algorithm taking into account additional input such as the value of the buyer's offer, the length of time that the supplier and buyer have been engaged, the number of offers and counteroffers already made, the results of the buyer's last negotiation, the results of the seller's previous negotiating sessions, etc.","At the beginning of a negotiating session, the database engine may determine an initial emotional state of the supplier from various retrieved data, including the supplier's emotional state from immediately preceding sessions (regardless of buyer); the supplier's state as it relates to the particular buyer based on past history of sessions with that buyer; and the buyer's historical negotiating results. These factors can be weighted in any desired manner to arrive at an initial state and a weighting factor that can be used to weight any state transition experienced by the supplier according to response matrix outputs.","Each time a supplier submits a new counteroffer, the database engine uses various data to compute a new supplier offer and emotional state, such as the reasonableness of the counteroffer, as determined by the divergence of the supplier's counteroffer from a predetermined expected value; the response time of the supplier; and the aggregate emotional state responses of the supplier throughout the negotiating process. Additionally, the engine may take into account the traffic volume on the site. High traffic volume indicating high levels of supplier interest could be used to cut short the present process.","The business rules and logic are structured based on gathered knowledge regarding the product at issue, the most reasonable price the product may be acquired at through other channels, and a targeted revenue distribution for each particular product. For example, 70% of the negotiations might be targeted to result in a sales price .+\u22120.2% of the suggested retail price, 14% at a price 2-10% above the retail price, 10% at a price 2-6% below the normal retail price, 5% at a price 6-8% below suggested retail, and 1% at a price 8-10% below suggested retail.","Ancillary features may be provided to the Web site to increase user interest and involvement. For example, hyperlinks may be provided to biographical sketches of each supplier where a user may learn important clues to the supplier's behavior. A user may hyperlink to an \u201ceavesdropping\u201d screen where the user may observe a negotiation being carried out by another user.
