title: Method and apparatus for providing context-based obfuscation of media
abstract: An approach for sharing and/or viewing one or more remixes of content based on the preferences of a user is described. A segmentation platform causes, at least in part, a segmentation of content into one or more segments, wherein the one or more segments are associated with one or more content labels. The segmentation platform also causes, at least in part, a rendering and/or sharing of one or more remixes of the content based, at least in part, on at least one subset of the one or more segments based, at least in part, on profile information, context information, or a combination thereof associated with one or more viewers of the content, one or more owners of the content, one or more sharers of the content.

User generated content includes text content such as blogs, video, audio and image data. Today's mobile devices allow users to easily capture, edit and even share content with others. For example, a user of a Smartphone with an embedded camera can record content at an event they are attending and subsequently post the content to a social networking site in order to be accessed by friends and family members. As a matter of privacy or preference, the user may create several different versions, or remixes, of the original content to accommodate different types of users who may access it. Unfortunately, the task of reviewing, manipulating and compiling the captured content to generate different remixes is a tedious task for the person sharing the content. Furthermore, the person wishing to view\/listen to the shared content has limited control over their ability to receive only those remixes compatible with their unique preferences and\/or their current surroundings.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for sharing and\/or viewing one or more remixes of content based on the preferences of a user.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises causing, at least in part, a segmentation of content into one or more segments, wherein the one or more segments are associated with one or more content labels. The method also comprises processing and\/or facilitating a processing of the one or more content labels to cause, at least in part, a selection of at least one subset of the one or more segments based, at least in part, on profile information, context information, or a combination thereof associated with one or more viewers of the content, one or more owners of the content, one or more sharers of the content, or a combination thereof.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for sharing and\/or viewing one or more remixes of content based on the preferences of a user are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","Although various embodiments are described with respect to video, audio and multimedia content, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other forms of content capable of being executed by a device. The exemplary embodiments may be utilized for the processing of any content capable of being rendered to and\/or shared with a user interface, device component interface (e.g., speaker system), or the like for visual and\/or auditory execution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","103"]},"Today's mobile devices allow users to easily capture, edit and even share content with others via a communication network. Consequently, it is commonplace for user's to capture content and post it to a social networking site, shared data repository or other service for enabling easy access to content by friends, family and associates. However, the user must take care to ensure the content as posted is appropriate for the particular viewing audience. For example, video footage featuring a gathering of adults at a party enjoying alcoholic beverages may not be deemed by the user (owner of the content) as appropriate for viewing by their young nieces and nephews who frequent their online profile page via the social networking site. As another example, segments of the content featuring one or more people using colorful language may be deemed too risqu\u00e9 for viewing by the user's co-workers. Consequently, most users who develop content generate one or more remixes, or versions, of the content to accommodate the different viewers. Typically, the remix is an edited version of the original content featuring differing segments and\/or sequences of the content; the remix being tailored to account for the specific relational context of the viewer(s) and the owner.","Unfortunately, the task of reviewing, manipulating and compiling content to generate one or more remixes is a tedious task. While the user may have software tools available for performing content editing and remixing, the user is still required to manually remove the unwanted segments of content. Furthermore, the person wishing to view\/listen to the shared content has limited control over their ability to receive content, or versions thereof, that is suitable to their unique preferences and\/or their current surroundings.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to associate specific remixes of content, as provided by a sharer or owner of the content, with one or more viewers based one or more content viewing and\/or content sharing policies. The policies for content viewing and\/or sharing are regulated by a segmentation platform , a network  accessible solution and\/or service for use in connection with one or more user devices -of an owner, sharer or viewer of content. The segmentation platform  executes one or more policies in response to a request for access to the content by a particular viewer in connection with their profile information. In addition, the segmentation platform  enables content to be automatically remixed at the discretion of the owner\/sharer responsive to a request to share content\u2014i.e., a request to post content at a site of a social networking service . Under this scenario, segments comprising a specific remix are associated with one or more labels for describing, defining or categorizing the content. Thus, the segmentation platform  supports both content sharing and content viewing based on the assignment of policies and\/or labels to specific segments of the content as shown in TABLE 1 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Assignment of policies and\/or labels for enabling content sharing"},{"entry":"Use intelligence embedded in a media stream, i.e., labels for various"},{"entry":"content segments and\/or specific content sharing policies"},{"entry":"corresponding to said labels.

The viewer may assign additional"},{"entry":"viewing policies to suit their unique viewing requirements."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The following paragraphs outline the various approaches presented in the table. Of note, the \u201cintelligence\u201d pertains to the ability of the system  to enable sharing of data without requiring manual intervention on the part of the owner or sharer of content or the viewer of content. For the purpose of illustration, the owner of content pertains to a user of a device, e.g., any one of user devices . . . (also referred to as a user device ), who is responsible for capturing an original version of the content while a sharer is a user of a device that uploads, stores, posts or otherwise shares content with one or more other users. The sharer may convey the content with other device users by way of a service , such as a social networking site, photo or video sharing site, or the like. Also, for example purposes, the viewer pertains to any device user capable of accessing the content as shared. It is noted that the owner and sharer are deemed to be synonymous for discussion purposes.","The segmentation platform  enables content to be shared by the owner\/sharer based on a determined affinity and\/or association between the content, one or more segments of said content, or a combination thereof with a target viewer. More specifically, the segmentation platform  determines which portions, or segments of content, are to be shared with one viewer versus another. In certain embodiments, the segments of content  are stored by the segmentation platform  temporarily, in association with one or more labels, for transference to a repository of a social networking service  or other service. Alternatively, the content  generated by an owner or shared by a sharer is maintained by the segmentation platform  for on demand execution in response to an access request by different viewers. Content to be shared with a particular viewer is based on one or more content viewing policies, one or more content sharing policies, or a combination thereof.","Content may include, for example, video, audio, multimedia data or a combination thereof. The segmentation platform  is configured to process content as captured and\/or shared by a user device  into various segments. For example, content that is originally of a size of X bytes may be divided into various segments of smaller size N, where each segment N represents a subset of the content. Under this scenario, a video file that is 4 megabytes in size can be broken into 4 distinct segments of 1 megabyte each. Alternatively, the 4 megabyte file can be broken into multiple segments of varying size (e.g., 2 segments of size 3 megabytes and 1 megabyte respectively). The number of segments into which the original content can be divided is based, at least in part, on one or more of the following: (a) a period of time\/interval for which the content is deemed to correspond to a preference, condition and\/or criteria as set by the viewer and\/or sharer of the content in question; (b) a period of time\/interval for which the content is deemed to violate a preference, condition and\/or criteria as set by the viewer and\/or sharer of the content in question. In either case, the number of instances of unwanted content may affect the extent of segmentation of the content.","In certain embodiments, the segmentation platform  maintains the policies in a database , where each policy  is linked to a specific user profile  or a group profile to which a user may belong. For example, a viewer's profile information may include a reference to the specific set of policies they require for customizing how content is rendered (i.e., conveyed and\/or shared) to their user device  upon request. An owner or sharer's profile information may also include a reference to the specific set of policies they require for affecting how content is shared with others. Policies  (specifically the content sharing policies) are executed by the segmentation platform  based on the processing of one or more labels assigned to various segments of the content. In certain embodiments, the content viewing policy defines one or more preferences of a user\/viewer for receiving\/accessing content. This may include one or more instructions, conditions or criteria for defining the types of content to be presented relative to the context of the viewer at the time of viewing. Likewise, the content sharing policies define one or more preferences of a user\/owner\/sharer for conveying content. Content sharing policies may include one or more instructions, conditions or criteria for defining the types of content to be shared with viewers via a service  (e.g., social network).","In certain embodiments, the content viewing policies are controlled by the client\/requesting device  and not the segmentation platform . For example, the segmentation platform  is only configured to provide labels for designated segments of the content as well as enable the users to access the segmented content in accordance with an established content sharing policy. The content viewing policies may nonetheless be shared with the segmentation platform  accordingly via the profile. Under this scenario, a content sharing and\/or viewing policy may include a restricting of access to content containing profanity or violence (e.g., a gun). The user may also specify a particular type or category of content to be shared and\/or viewed\u2014i.e., music, sports, etc. As such, only content determined to be of this type can be shared by the owner\/sharer or viewed by the viewer. Also, the policy  may define a particular device type in which the content is to be rendered for viewing. For example, one remix of the content may be optimized for rendering\/sharing via a television while another remix is intended for execution via a laptop. The policy may also include one or more conditions, such as a setting for defining a time interval for generation of a remix of the content.","In yet another example, a condition may include a specification of particular content to be rendered\/shared in response to a given context of the viewer. For example, when the viewer is at work, a particular remix of the content is presented whereas another remix is presented when the user is determined to be at home. Hence, conditional viewing constraints may selected for assignment to specific content such as \u201cNot to be watched with children present\u201d, \u201cNot appropriate in certain locations,\u201d etc. As will be discussed more fully with respect to , the segmentation platform  provides a configuration interface for enabling the customization and selection of various policy options and constraints.","The various policies are associated with profile information  related to a particular owner, sharer or viewer. In certain embodiments, the segmentation platform  maintains profile information  regarding the various users of devices -. Profile information  may be pulled (retrieved) from a contact list available to a user device , a social networking site available to a user, or a combination thereof. The profile information may include, for example, a contact number, email address, messaging handle, or other point of contact information for a given user to which content is to be made available. In addition, the profile information may specify a type of relationship, or profile type, between an owner\/sharer of content and a viewer of said content. For example, profile type (also referred to as a profile assignment) may be specified in accordance with a user profile at a social networking service  to define a contact as a friend, family, extended family, co-worker, acquaintance, teammate, etc. Multiple users may be further associated with a group profile or more than one profile at a time (e.g., both friend and co-worker). In one embodiment, user may define group profile for friends, family, extended family, co-worker, acquaintance, teammate, etc., and map users to one or more of these group profiles.","As noted, one or more labels may be embedded in the content (e.g., as metadata) during generation of the content. The segmentation platform  is configured to permit the labelling of specific segments of content for facilitating its sharing with others. Likewise, the segmentation platform  processes labels associated with segments of the content in order to link the segments with specific policies of a user for facilitating content viewing. In certain embodiments, the labels provide details, descriptors, or other contextual information regarding the content at various intervals or points of execution. Hence, the labels may be broadly associated with a full, original version of content or individually associated with segments of content. Under this scenario, one or more labels relating to the complete\/original video footage of a party the user attended in honour of their cousin may include \u201cParty,\u201d \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cCousin Bob,\u201d etc. Alternatively, the specific segment of the content depicting a dance competition between partygoers may be labelled \u201cDance Off,\u201d \u201cRock-n-Roll,\u201d \u201cDance floor,\u201d etc.","In addition, the labels are associated with different profile types to define the type of access or the group of users that a particular segment corresponds to based on profile type. For example, a label may be associated with the profile type \u201cFamily\u201d or \u201cAcquaintance\u201d for indicating that a particular segment of content bearing such a label is related to a viewer who is a friend or acquaintance of the owner\/sharer of the content. In certain embodiments, the segmentation platform  associates a label with default profile types. Also, some labels may be assigned to only one profile type while some may be assigned multiple profile-types. For example, a label for describing content depicting a child of the sharer generated as \u201cMy child\u201d may be assigned the profile type of Family while a label for describing content depicting the sharer's dog generated as \u201cMy Dog\u201d may be assigned to multiple profile types including Family, Friends and Extended Family. It is noted that the segmentation platform  enables the assigning of super-profiles\u2014i.e., a profile type that encompasses all of the different profile types. For example, a profile type \u201cPublic\u201d provides access to users falling under all the other profiles (ex. Friends, Office, Family, etc) even if the profile access was granted only to the Public profile.","In certain embodiments, the segmentation platform  is configured to generate labels to be associated with the content. Alternatively, the various user devices -may be equipped with a tag generation module -for enabling the generation of labels, such as in response to the capturing of content at a user device . Operating in connection with the tag generation module  is a context processing module , which is configured to capture various context information related to the user of the device or the device  itself. The context processing module  processes information coming from various sensors of the device for acquiring and inferring context information, including (but not limited to) global positioning sensors, network detection sensors, gyroscopes, motion detectors, time sensors, and other data acquisition devices. By way of these sensors, the context processing module  detects location information (e.g., longitude and latitude, geospatial coordinates, building coordinate data), device and\/or user position and\/or orientation information, time zone, time and date information, network connectivity information (e.g., IP Address, network connection status, location area identity), user and\/or device profile information (e.g., service-subscriber key, user identifier, serial number), or a combination thereof. In addition, the context processing module  may acquire sound, light and image data via the one or more integrated cameras, sound recorders, etc., of the device. In certain embodiments, the context information as collected is conveyed to the platform  for determining the current environment and\/or context of the user and\/or device . The context information may be also associated with content during the time of capture for generating contextually relevant labels (e.g., generate a label for specifying a restaurant by name rather than by broad categorical reference). Various known context processing, ontology processing, tag generation and other data processing schemes may be employed for generating the labels accordingly.","In certain embodiments, the segmentation platform  also processes context information related to the user to affect how content is rendered. For example, a policy for a particular viewer may be set to prevent the playback, presentment, sharing or other types of rendering of any movie featuring alcohol, smoking or sexual behaviour when the viewer is in the presence of children. Under this scenario, when a request for access to the movie content is initiated by the viewer, a contextual or environment analysis procedure is performed. Hence, in addition to determining those segments of content featuring labels associated with the profile type (or profile assignment) of the requesting viewer and that meet the policies of the viewer, the context processing module  also forwards context information regarding the current status and\/or surroundings of the device . The context information may include, for example, location information for detecting whether the user is at the home of their young nephew. Other context information may include sound data as collected by an audio recorder of a user device  for capturing data featuring the sound of children. Upon processing this context information, the segmentation platform  is able to determine that only certain segments of the movie content be shown at the present moment. It is noted that various other forms of context data can be acquired by the context processing module  and subsequently processed by the segmentation platform .","In certain embodiments, the segmentation platform  enables execution of a content rendering interface for supporting the viewing of content at a given device based on policy settings and\/or a determined context of the user. By way of example, the content rendering interface may be implemented as a standalone module, i.e., content rendering module , capable of operation at a user device . As another example, the content rendering interface may be provided by the segmentation platform  as a widget or other executable for use in connection with a browser or web portal application. The specific implementation may vary depending on user and\/or device requirements. Regardless of the approach, however, the content rendering interface serves as a interface for enabling the user to interact with content on the basis of their predetermined preferences (e.g., no violent content) or current environmental\/contextual circumstances (e.g., children are present at the time of viewing).","As shown in , the system  comprises user devices -having connectivity to the segmentation platform  and service  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network, a wireless network, a telephony network, or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , the segmentation platform  and service  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer ) header, a data-link (layer ) header, an internetwork (layer ) header and a transport (layer ) header, and various application (layer , layer  and layer ) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","203","205","207","209","211","213"]},"In addition, the segmentation platform  maintains content  as captured or shared by one or more user devices -as well as context information  associated with the content. Policy information  and profile information  is also maintained for association with one or more owners, sharers or viewers of content. It is noted that the modules - may access this data for performing various functions.","In one embodiment, an authentication module  authenticates users and user devices -for interaction with the segmentation platform . By way of example, the authentication module  receives a request to subscribe to the segmentation platform , such as according to a service agreement, for enabling segmentation of provided content, selective content sharing and viewing. The subscription process may include the establishment of user preferences, including designated contacts to enable for viewing, personal information sharing policies, etc. The authentication module  may also operate in connection with a user interface module  to enable receipt of policy configuration data from a user. As such, policies for affecting how content is shared and\/or rendered may be established.","The authentication process performed by the module  may also include receiving and validating a login name and\/or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user during a subscription or registration process with the service provider. The login name and\/or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user from the user device  or other device via a graphical user interface to the segmentation platform  (e.g., as enabled by user interface module ). Registration data (e.g., profile information ) for respective subscribers, which contains pertinent user or device profile data, may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively, the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings maintained as profile information  with an IP address, a carrier detection signal of a user device, mobile directory number (MDN), subscriber identity module (SIM) (e.g., of a SIM card), radio frequency identifier (RFID) tag or other identifier.","The authentication module  is also configured to receive and interpret requests from users of devices for execution of content sharing and\/or content viewing. By way of example, a request to share content with one or more contacts via a social networking site may be received, such as via the content rendering module  of a respective device. Based on this request, the authentication module may  triggers activation of the other modules. As another example, the authentication module  may receive and interpret a request to view content and trigger the other modules accordingly. In certain embodiments, the authentication module  may be integrated with a social networking site or other service  for detecting the requests of one or more subscribed\/registered owners, sharers or viewers of content.","In one embodiment, the context evaluation module  determines a particular policy to execute relative to a request for viewing or sharing of content. By way of example, the context information received from the context processing module  of a device requesting to view content is evaluated against the content viewing policies  of the user. When it is determined that the context information corresponds to a particular policy condition, the evaluation module  alerts the policy execution module , which in turn causes rendering and\/or sharing of only select segments of content corresponding to the policy. It is noted that the context evaluation module  may also operate in an equivalent manner to the context processing module  of a given device for processing contextual criteria. The criteria may include one or more temporal criteria, criteria regarding one or more viewers or devices, etc.","In one embodiment, a content processing module  is configured to process content based on instructions conveyed by the policy execution module  (e.g., a module configured to trigger execution of one or more policies corresponding to a particular profile of a owner, sharer and\/or viewer). This may include, for example, generating one or more segments of content according to specific policy constraints, temporal criteria, etc. The content evaluation module  may also be configured to evaluate one or more images, sounds, video or other data comprising the content against known pattern detection, heuristic analysis, inference or deductive processing, object matching, ontological schemes, and other analysis models. This execution is performed in connection with one or more models (not shown) which may include for example data, framework, schemas, mappings, characteristic sets, tables and other information for enabling the content to be recognized. When a segment of content matching a particular policy restriction and\/or criteria is identified, this particular segment is flagged for inclusion\/exclusion according to the policy, profile information associated with the viewer and\/or owner\/sharer of the information, or a combination thereof. As such, the combinations of content segments comprise a particular remix. Of note, the order of the media segments and also the duration of each media segment used to generate the remix is based on one or more of: the nature of the content being shared (e.g., sports related, music); a particular content execution preference of a user (e.g., fast motion remix, slow motion remix, animations); and\/or the type of content expected to be rendered (e.g., a documentary, trailer with music, trailer without music, etc). While generating a remix, multiple media segments are chosen for a single temporal segment. This enables generating a remix that satisfies multiple priorities.","The content processing module  is also configured to operate in connection with a tag processing module  for associating one or more labels embedded in the content with a particular profile type (or profile assignment) of one or more viewers, owners or sharers. In certain embodiments, the content processing module  parses the content to detect any applied labels, while the tag processing module  matches the profile type of the label with a profile type indicated in the profile information database . The match enables the specific segments of content to be gathered and compiled for generation of a remix. The content processing module  also receives feedback from the context evaluation module  in order to further restrict those segments of content that violate current contextual and\/or environmental conditions of the viewer.","In one embodiment, the tag processing module  is also configured to generate labels for being associated with one or more segments of content in response to a request for sharing of content. Labels are generated to provide a description of the content, a segment of content, or a combination thereof. By way of example, a video featuring an erupting volcano may feature various tags including, \u201cAsh,\u201d \u201cLava,\u201d \u201cVolcano.\u201d In addition, the labels specify one or more policy types, i.e., Friend, Family, Co-worker. Context information may be used during the time of content capture for generating contextually relevant labels. It is noted, in certain instances, that context information may also be based on historical information for informing the generation of tags. For example, in the case of an erupting volcano, additional tags may indicate the location of the occurrence, a name associated with the event, external or third-party news feed data related to the image, etc.","In one embodiment, a communication interface  enables formation of a session over a network  between the segmentation platform  and the various modules   and  at the user device. By way of example, the communication interface  executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative exchange between a subscribed owner, sharer or viewer's user device -(e.g., mobile devices, laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, desktop computers) and the platform . Of note, the communication interface  also support the conveyance of content in the form of one or more remixes relative to a given set of policies associated with a specific user profile.","In one embodiment the user interface module  enables presentment of a graphical user interface for rendering content. In addition, the user interface module  may enable the presentment of a user interface for facilitating the configuration of the one or more policies or user preferences. By way of example, the user interface module  generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces (APIs) or other function calls corresponding to the browser application or web portal application of the user devices -; thus enabling the display of graphics primitives. In this case, the browser session may support execution of content playback in response to labeled content. As another example, the user interface module  may be integrated for use in connection with a social networking application, a service provider , or for direct operation in connection with the content rendering module  of a device .","The above presented modules and components of the platform  can be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof.

As noted, a policy for one member of a group may differ from that of another as each individual viewer, sharer and\/or owner is able to customize their preferences and settings accordingly. In addition, the policies may specify one or more contextual criteria for determining the selection of a subset of content segments to be rendered in response to a request. The contextual criteria may include, for example, one or more location criteria, one or more temporal criteria, one or more criteria regarding presence of one or more other viewers, one or more device capability criteria, or a combination thereof.","Per step , the segmentation platform  causes an embedding of the one or more content sharing policies, the one or more content viewing policies, the one or more content labels, or a combination thereof in the one or more segments, the content, the one or more remixes, or a combination thereof. As such, the content is processed by the segmentation platform  or a content rendering module of a device based on the labels, policies, and contextual criteria required to render the content. For example, a content rendering module at a device may operate in connection with a social networking site (e.g., as a widget) for enabling playback of a video remix in response to a request for access to shared content. Based on the embedded policies, only those segments allowed by the user and requesting viewer are rendered. Still further, embedded labels may be processed by the content rendering module to further restrict execution of the video to only those users corresponding to the profile assignment in the label.","In step  of process  (), the platform  determines to create the one or more remixes based, at least in part, on one or more temporal criteria related, at least in part, to (a) a duration of the one or more remixes, the one or more segments, the content, or a combination thereof; (b) a transition interval between the one or more segments in the one or more remixes; or (c) a combination thereof. In another step, the platform  determines one or more temporal discontinuities in the one or more remixes based, at least in part, on the selection of the at least one subset. In certain embodiments, temporal discontinuities may represent segments of content to be filled. For example, the user may specify filler content to be placed into the content stream in place of areas where content was intentionally restricted per one or more policy settings or contextual criteria conditions being met. Hence, per step , the platform  causes an insertion of filler content into the one or more remixes based, at least in part, on the one or more temporal discontinuities.

In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, any other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU)  which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to share and\/or view one or more remixes of content based on the preferences of a user. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, magnetic disk storage, flash memory storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
