{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to chemical sensors. In particular, relates to chemical sensors that employ an annular photonic crystal fiber coupled to an illumination source at one end to transmit an emission pattern transverse to the fiber's outer surface for comparison against an established pattern to detect the presence of a signature material.","The United States faces various technical challenges to national security, including threats from chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents, as well as detection of toxic industrial chemical (TIC) materials. Depending on the technology used, conventional CBW detectors are capable of identifying and\/or detecting between eight and twenty different agents, with verification and validation of field results usually requiring approximately forty-eight hours. The most accurate identification of about twenty chemicals including most chemical warfare agents and some volatile organic compound (VOC) molecules is conventionally performed, in the field and in the laboratory, by gas-chronomatography-mass-spectrometry (GCMS).","Both commercial enterprises and military organizations desire a detector capable of identifying known and novel CBW and TIC agents to defend both war-fighters and civilians. Some CBW agents are very deadly to large numbers of people. For example in 1984, exposure to concentrations of forty metric tons of methyl-isocyanate over an area of several hundred square miles in Bhopal, India in 1984, killed about thirty-eight-hundred people with economic loss of several hundred million dollars.","Conventional detection techniques yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, particularly related to convenience and sensitivity. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide a detector that enhances the reliability and timeliness for detection of chemical and biological agents by modifying the confinement properties of the waveguide due to changes in the photonic band gap, thereby contrasting from more conventional sensing mechanism that uses optical absorption. This technique enables light to escape and form a pattern at the surface of the photonic crystal fiber to be compared to a pattern database as the main information discriminator.","These exemplary embodiments provide a detector for sampling and identifying a material, such as a medium in which the detector is disposed. The detector includes an annular photonic crystal fiber, first and second electrodes, an electrical power supply, an illumination source and an analyzer.","The fiber has opposite longitudinal ends, surrounds a center core tube and includes fused capillary tubes. The electrodes are disposed between the fiber's longitudinal ends. The electrical power supply connects between the electrodes. The illumination source emits light into the core tube from one of the opposite ends. The analyzer for compares an emission pattern from light transverse to the fiber against an established pattern, and indicates match in response to correspondence between the patterns.","In various exemplary embodiments, the annular structure has a two-dimensional optical photonic band-gap. In alternate embodiments, the analyzer monitors the emission pattern by optical frequency domain reflectometry or optical time domain reflectometry.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments employ the modification of the confinement properties of the waveguide due to changes in the photonic band gap, rather than optical absorption, as the primary sensing mechanism. This modification enables light to escape and form a pattern at the surface of the fiber. The pattern formed at the surface of the photonic crystal fiber is used as the main information discriminator. Effects caused by defects on light propagation can be evaluated through two-dimensional optical photonic band-gap (2DPB) structures in the presence or absence of chemical vapors and or chemical aerosols. Such information can be used to develop miniature sensors based on 2DPB capable of performing multiple measurements of several properties of a specimen in the same instance of observation using minimum space, energy, and consumables.","Various exemplary embodiments enhance the reliability and timeliness for detection of chemical and biological agents. This can be accomplished by implementation of photonic crystal fibers as a multifunctional chemical detector capable of concurrently measuring several properties of one sample during observation that minimize space, energy, and consumables. Further, sensors made from 2DPB technology can be used to supplement more conventional detection technologies to minimize false positive readings. Photonic crystal technology enables such evaluation, and various exemplary embodiments integrate the instrumentation into a robust system, such as on a single semiconductor chip.","Despite accurate and rapid analysis provided by GCMS, such conventional systems present portability constraints due to the weight of the portable detectors with a minimum of eighty pounds, and by their high-rate power consumption that limits batteries to only a few, hours of operation. Even with GCMS detectors, a single detector cannot identify most of the important TIC materials of military concern. The limitation is further complicated regarding detection of both novel chemical and\/or biological agents.","Most current detection technologies work by careful detection and characterization of one or two physical properties on each observation of a sample, thereby introducing the comparison of cost and risk. For example, in circumstances under which a high-risk situation must be avoided, more resources are necessary for detection and identification with sensors capable of detecting very small amounts of agents having very low rates of false positive readings.","Unfortunately, compromises between sensitivity, accuracy and detection time are needed with the conventionally available technologies. A system capable of measuring and characterizing many physical properties of a sample in a short observation period mitigates many of the compromises faced conventionally. For example, a multi-agent fast detector with higher probability of false positive readings might be better suited for operational requirements than a fast detector with low probability of false positive detections for a particular agent. Further, an array of several sensors, each optimized to a different agent, could be implemented as a super-sensitive multi-agent detection system. Advances in microelectronics, microfluidics and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), with their inherent ability for systems integration, may provide an efficient toolbox to overcome the current challenges.","Various exemplary embodiments provide an optical device known as photonic crystal fiber as a microscopic laboratory in which several optical, electrical and mechanical properties can be performed on the same sample in the same observation instance. Due to their small size and enhanced properties, these new fibers could be used in micro-mechanical, micro-fluidics and microelectronics environments. Photonic crystal fibers are composed from a center-core capillary tube surrounded by an ordered array of capillary tubes. The ordered array forms a two-dimensional cross-sectional lattice.","Thus, various exemplary embodiments provide a system to perform measurements of many physical properties of a sample in one observation time interval. This enables flexibility for integrating many specialized sensor systems in a small portable and low-maintenance package. Further, fiber waveguide components such as fiber gratings, laser fibers, polarization maintaining fibers and splitters enable optical and electro-optical package integration.","This special ordering brings a periodic fluctuation of optical refractive index between the optical index of the glass and the constructive or destructive interference pattern when photons at a particular wavelength attempt to penetrate the periodic structure. For optimal destructive interference conditions, an optical \u201cband gap\u201d develops in the lattice. The term optical band gap is borrowed from the solid-state terminology of electronic band gap that applies to the electrical properties of semiconductors.","A photonic band-gap structure (PBS) represents a periodic arrangement of elements with different dielectric constants. Such structures may include two-dimensional periodic arrays of glass rods in air, capillary tubes or three-dimensional arrangements of spheres in space.  shows an isometric view  of a periodic array of suspended glass rods , which are arranged along alignment lines ,  and . The elements of the array may consist of any two materials provided these have differing dielectric constants.","The physics that describes these systems is scale-invariant. This means that PBS can be constructed to interact with electromagnetic waves from all parts of the spectrum. Structures with dimensions of centimeters interact with microwaves; structures with dimensions of micrometers interact with light; and structures of dimensions of nanometers interact with x-rays. These photonic band-gap structures are special in their manner of interaction with the electromagnetic waves. These applications emphasize the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.","The periodic arrangement of the dielectric elements creates an environment where the reflections of light waves by the dielectric elements interfere either constructively or destructively. However, only light waves of particular wavelength can interfere with the structure. The proper wavelength is determined by the fundamental periodic distance between the elements.  shows an isometric view  of a periodic array of dielectrics as rods  interacting with light of two colors or wavelengths. The dark short-wavelength rays  represent light that interferes, and the lighter long-wavelength rays  represent light that is non-interfering.","The time independent electromagnetic equations (Maxwell's equations) of the periodic boundary conditions found in photonic band-gaps are analogous to the quantum mechanical wave equation (Schr\u00f6dinger's equation) that describes the trajectories of electrons traveling through a crystalline medium. The solutions of both equations are almost identical. In PBS, the periodic dielectric constant assumes the r\u00f4le of the quantum potential of the wave equation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","210"],"o":"k"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","410","420","430","440","440","430","440","430"]},"To become a photonic crystal, the honeycomb must have a particular periodic symmetry. The annular tubes  can be fused in a square, rectangular, or triangular array. A closer inspection of the SEM  reveals that the honeycomb walls are not without defects.  illustrates another SEM  of the identical photonic fiber in the SEM  under an alternate application of confining green light to the center core  of the fiber.","Some of the tubes  are not completely circular, and there are deviations of the periodic pattern. These types of defects affect the photonic properties of the fiber. Because these defects originate predominantly from the manufacturing process, they vary between fibers produced from different lots. The implementation of a sensor includes a procedure to \u201csubtract\u201d the defects analogous to a background subtraction or baseline definition to a signal.

The periodic nature of the solution for the PBS imposes limits on the types of solutions available. For example, only harmonic modes can propagate through the PBS. Also, in some particular directions and values of the propagation vector {right arrow over (k)}, the harmonic modes cannot propagate. This means there are mathematical solutions to the periodic dielectric that do not physically exist, i.e., there are frequency values of \u03c9 where the solution to the equation cannot exist. These values form a continuous exclusive region known as the band-gap.","Another consequence of the periodicity includes many redundancies in the solutions.

Instead, only select values of {right arrow over (k)} lead to all other solutions determinable by either a translation by the vector {right arrow over ({tilde over (K)} related to {right arrow over (G)}, or by a rotation and a translation by the vector {right arrow over ({tilde over (K)}.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","530","540","500","550"]},"Band-gaps  are displayed as the plot of the magnitude and direction of {right arrow over (k)} that form the Brillouin zone in the axial direction and the frequency of the allowed modes in the transverse direction.

The difference between the highest value of one mode with the lowest value of the next higher mode is the value of the band-gap. Light of a frequency in the band-gap does not travel through the PBS. Because the band-gap parameters are controlled by the PBS geometry, PBS can be designed to produce a particular band-gap of interest.","For an imperfect periodic structure however, some frequencies that are should be part of the band-gap may be able to propagate through the PBS. Imperfections of the periodic structure can be caused by the termination or truncation of the periodicity as in the surface (surface states) or by anomalies inside the periodic structure. In the case of PBS, a region with a dielectric constant different from another region creating the period can produce such states. The defects produced by an external chemical substance (gas or liquid) can be studied to determine their effects on the properties of PBS towards detection and identification of the presence of the substance.","Because the properties of light inside a PBS are analogous to the properties of an electron inside a crystal, much of the knowledge from theoretical solid-state physics in the last half-century applies to the study of photonic band-gap structures. Solid-state physics includes considerable study in the effects of imperfections or defects of the periodic structure to the transport properties of electrons traveling inside the crystal.

For a given periodic arrangement, the visual map of spots is very dependent on the ratio of the dielectric constants between the mediums of glass and air.

For example, the fiber can be tailored to display a sharp pattern  when exposed to a particular concentration of methanol or any other chemical substance of interest. Further, because the optical properties are associated with the periodicity of the array, a much larger sized periodic array can be constructed, thereby enabling the hosting of a biological agent. The larger structure could then be tuned to a higher harmonic to \u201cresonate\u201d with the fluorescence of a bio-agent exposed to ultraviolet light.","This technology can be used for the detection not only of chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals and for the detection of odors (to determine human presence), illicit narcotics, and unauthorized explosives. Furthermore, this technology may assist monitoring the state of munitions, missiles, and other critical military systems by detecting the presence of decay byproducts.","One of the many possible implementations of this technology includes producing reusable miniature detection module.  shows an isometric block diagram  of the concept. A multipurpose host card  provides a substrate platform for the components disposed thereon. Among these are at least one miniature module (micromodule) , power supply , microfluidic support , and transmitter  with antenna . To achieve this, 2DPB technology can be integrated with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.","Each micromodule  can be integrated in a battlefield configurable network supported by the host card  with dimensions of a few square inches that contain the necessary components to provide power, communications, microfluidic, and any other support to the micromodules . In addition, the host card  enables the micromodules  to be interconnected so the specimen (gas or liquid) travels through them. Modules measuring different properties of the specimen of interest could be connected in either serial or parallel configurations to maximize the number of attributes or properties observed.","Exemplary embodiments are intended to provide the warfighter the ability to configure the modules as needed in the theater of operations in a rapid and efficient manner.

For circumstances requiring reliable ultra-rapid detection, the micromodules could be connected in parallel combination. In addition, 2DPB modules could be integrated with more conventional detection techniques.","Implementing such revolutionary technology involves resolution of some technical issues. For example, in the micrograph  of , in addition to the drastic change of the bright and dark spots, there are distinction of regions, e.g.,  and , due to variations in the volume fraction of methanol between neighboring capillaries. These translate into a difference in net dielectric constant due to different fractional volumes between air and methanol.

The dielectric distribution inside the capillaries can be investigated using controlled mixtures prior to determining the effects of chemical substances regarding the optical properties of the 2DPB structure. This can be used to predict dielectric behavior and determine their change to the optical properties of 2DPB for developing techniques for detection, identification, and quantification of a foreign chemical substance of interest.","Upon characterizing the periodic optical properties, a wealth of information can be obtained by selective destruction of the photonic band-gap by introducing material inside the periodic capillaries. The intruding material can be the chemical\/biological agent to be detected by the system. The change in optical index of refraction due to the displacement of the interior air creates additional possible paths for the light to traverse the plane of the periodic array and exit the fiber for detection by various techniques. In addition, the photonic fiber can be monitored for \u201clossy\u201d behavior as the periodic capillaries are filled with the material to be analyzed. The intruding material can be liquid, gas, colloidal particles suspended in liquid or colloidal particulates suspended in gas. In addition to the optical probe, the intruding material can be analyzed electrically by performing measurements like dipole relaxation analysis and by spectroscopic measurements.","Photonic crystal fibers can be employed as a micro-laboratory in which to measure several physical properties of a sample concurrently. The sample can be liquid, gas, colloidal suspension in liquid, or colloidal suspension in gas. Upon introduction of the sample inside the periodic capillary array, several optical, spectroscopic and electrical properties of the sample are measured. Upon completion of the observation interval, information obtained from numerous nearly simultaneous measurements can be compared to perform a positive identification of the sample. For the injection of gas inside the periodic capillary array, various exemplary embodiments employ capillary electrophoresis.","Capillary electrophoresis (CE) provides an analytical technique to separate and identify molecules in liquids to identify biological threat agents. The principle behind CE involves an external electric field to separate the molecules of interest by charge. Positive and negatively charged molecules separate in opposite directions inside an electric field. The molecules of interest are dissolved in a buffer solution optimized to flow past the applied electric field by the mechanism known as electro-osmosis. Upon injection of the molecules of interest and the buffer solution inside a capillary tube, the charges move according to their relative charges inside the applied electric field. At the opposite end of the injection an optical absorption sensor monitors the changes in optical transmission due to the passing of the charge separated molecules.","The optical sensor information can be plotted as a function of the time elapsed for the moment the electric field is applied until the change in optical transmission. This plot may be used to calculate a quantity known as the number of theoretical plates or \u201cN\u201d, which is related to the molecule of interest. CE represents very popular technique for studying proteins, and pharmaceuticals. Several variations of CE complement the information obtained by CE. However, if the ability to do spectroscopy in situ with CE were available, a great deal more information can be made available in real-time that enhance the ability of CE to identify unknowns.","Before 2 DBP technology can be realized in such applications, several technical issues require resolution, such as the fundamental interactions between liquids and gases from pre-selected organic solvents introduced inside selected elements of a 2DPB structure evaluated in a controlled methodology. Initially, spectroscopic ellipsometry can be used to determine the dielectric properties of pre-selected liquids and gases in the immediate vicinity of glass surfaces inside extremely small confined structures. These results can be used to prepare special defects to the periodicity of 2DPB using the spectroscopic ellipsometry results from pre-selected liquids and gases to establish the net effect manifests in the optical modes of the 2DPB. Ellipsometry represents an optical technique for investigating dielectric properties (e.g., refractive index) of thin films using elliptical polarization.","Further, a computer model can be developed based on the results of this effort to predict the optical modes in response to a known 2DPB exposed to arbitrary liquid or gaseous chemical compounds. This technology could be used for the detection not only of chemical agents and TIC compounds but also for the detection of human presence (odor), illegal narcotics, and explosives from their VOC release. Moreover, sensors made from 2DPB technology can be used to supplement more conventional detection technologies to minimize false positive readings.","Dielectric properties of liquid and gases confined in small spaces can be measured by using spectroscopic ellipsometry.  shows an isometric diagram  of such a cell. Such a cell for the study can include a pair of parallel glass plates: right plate  and left plate  separated by a gap  using spacers . The gap  has a distance between one and ten microns (1\u03bc to 10\u03bc). Incident polarized light  passes through the first plate  and exits as refracted polarized light  from the second plate . A sample material  (gas or liquid) passes within the gap  between the plates ,  to alter the degree of refraction:","Several types of glass compositions from known compositions to the glass composition can be used to produce the capillary tubes for 2DPB. The cell can be mounted in a spectroscopic ellipsometer. The material specimen to be studied can include organic solvents (liquid and vapor) that feature minimal optical absorption as the liquid or gas to be confined between the glass plates. The gas can be guided through the cell, with the region illuminated with the ellipsometer light source to monitor the changes in the polarization vector of the light upon refraction by the specimen. The process can be repeated with the wavelength of the incident light being changed from the infrared region up to the ultraviolet region. The data obtained can be analyzed using several dielectric models and to obtain information about the dielectric profile of the specimen. Preferably a dielectric profile gradient of the specimen can be established in the vicinity (within few nanometers) of the glass.","Characterization of the dielectric behavior of pure solvents can be followed by evaluation of mixtures, such as dry air or water vapor, using an automated gas mass flow mixer. Separation of the gases can be expected to occur near the surface of the glass plates. Changing the proportions of the mixed solvents may reverse the order of the separation next to the glass, thereby influencing the optical properties of the 2DPB.

A solid brick can be made from a two-dimensional photonic crystal (2DPC) filled with either a liquid or gas. This can be accomplished by shining light at the proper wavelength and a similar pattern forms at the opposite surface as the light escapes the photonic crystal. Light escaping the photonic crystal fiber forms a dynamic \u201cbarcode\u201d pattern. The evolution of the barcode pattern can provide information to identify a potential CBW agent. Light escaping the photonic crystal fiber creates a type of dynamic barcode as further information to identify the CBW agent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1410","1510","1455","1410","1430","1440","1510","1480","1490"]},"The fraction of light leaving the fiber  can be monitored by techniques known as optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) and optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR). OFDR employs narrow pulses of optical radiation to probe the optical system under observation. The backscattered reflection is measured after each pule. The returned backscattered light can be used to determine scattering, reflection and absorption mechanisms in addition to other waveguide properties.","Some OFDR methods are capable of spatially resolving the places where the light escapes to within one millimeter. Another measurement method involves an optical effect using dispersion. Chromatic dispersion represents the complex relationship between the index or refraction and the wavelength of light. This relationship has an effect on the light-wave amplitude (due to the imaginary part of the index of refraction) and velocity (due to the real part of the index of refraction). Both amplitude and velocity change in relation to each other in accordance with the Kramer-Kronig relationship. Alight pulse that has a broad frequency component provides a change in pulse shape that can be quite pronounced and deterministic. Further, interferometry can be used as another method to characterize changes in light inside the photonic crystal fiber die to foreign matter inside the capillaries.","After the sample moves through the \u201coptical characterization\u201d zone, the sample moves to a sector surrounded by four electrodes forming a quadrupole configuration, which for its moment tensor represents a system of charges or masses. The quadrupole electrodes perform dipole relaxation time analysis (RTA), which uses alternating electric fields to rotate or \u201cflip\u201d molecules via interaction between the dipole field of the molecule and the external alternating field.","Each kind of molecule has a distinct dipole resonance due to the molecular mass and dipole moment. (Noble gases provide an exception to this as these that lack dipole and vary only in mass, but their inert chemical characteristics negate any potential hazard.) In addition, phase-selective, dipole-relaxation time analysis can be used to find information of the potential chiral properties of the sample.","Further, the sample can be moved to a sector where the physical dimension of the capillary tubes limits the dipole interaction to obtain a direct measurement of the molecular dimensions. Finally, the sample can be transferred to a sector where both absorption and emission spectroscopy are performed. At the end of one instance of observation, at least four physical properties of the sample can be issued, in which the information is used to identify the CBW agent. For additional information being needed, various exemplary embodiments can be implemented, as an array of several cascade systems such as described above, each optimized for a particular agent. Due to the small size of the device, as many as thousands of sensor systems can be implemented in an area of a few square inches.","The photonic band gap of photonic crystal fibers can be influenced by temperature changes and by morphological changes of the periodic array of capillary tubes. Consequently, alternative configurations of various embodiments could be used to develop microscopic thermometers and microscopic tension-compression gages. Torsional gages and balances represent another practical application. The inner surface of the fiber could be coated with molecules called \u201cbinders\u201d that specifically bind CBW, TIC and other chemical and\/or biological organisms or molecules. These binders are positioned (by electrophoresis or capillary motion) at specific coordinates along the long axis of the fiber. During the analysis, the sample mixture (e.g., chemical and\/or biological compounds) is separated by electrophores, as described above.","As the compounds migrate along the fiber, specific analytes react with their cognate specific binder and be immobilized in that specific location (binder coordinates). After the entire sample has traversed the entire length of the fiber, the laser light can be sent along the fiber, and areas (coordinates) where an analyte-binder joint has developed, enables the light to escape. Escaping light from specified coordinate can be used to detect the presence on a specific chemical and\/or biological compound. A variety of binders of plant, animal or synthetic origin are currently commercially available. Some binders that could be exploited are antibodies, lectins, short pieces of nucleic acids (commonly referred to as aptamers or oligomers), cavitands, carcerands, cage dextrin, zeolites, cryptophanes and memory polymers.","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
