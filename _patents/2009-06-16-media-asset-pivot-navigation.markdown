title: Media asset pivot navigation
abstract: Media asset pivot navigation is described. In various embodiments, collections of media assets are determined from relational metadata that corresponds to the media assets in a respective collection. Each collection of media assets are represented as a navigation axis along which the media assets in a respective collection can be located, and a media asset can be associated with multiple collections of media assets based on the relational metadata. A media asset navigation interface is generated for display from which the collections of media assets can be navigated to locate the media assets for selection. The media asset navigation interface includes a display of a collection of media assets represented as a navigation axis. A navigation input can be received to pivot from the navigation axis to an alternate navigation axis and initiate a display of an additional collection of media assets that are represented as the alternate navigation axis.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Portable devices are increasingly more common and mobile, such as laptop computers, tablet personal computers (PCs), mobile PCs, as well as other mobile data, messaging, and\/or communication devices. While portable devices have become more mobile and convenient, the size of device integrated displays has decreased to accommodate the mobility and convenience of the devices. Current visual browsers for videos, photos, and game content rely on the ability of a user to recognize particular media assets in order to select or make decisions based on those media assets. This limits the display size of the media assets because a user needs to see enough of an image to discern a media asset for selection. As the display screens become smaller, pictorial details can be lost.","Additionally, the current media interfaces that are utilized to discover, sort, locate, and sample media content are uniformly built on top-down information hierarchies that are known to break down for very large, disparate sets of media content. For example, the data set of Web pages has transitioned discovery from content category searching to generic Web searches that use heuristics to find arbitrary content or to refine subsets of discovered content and data. Typically, a Web search is initiated with text input which is not well-suited to initiate content discovery for non-text content and in keyboard-free contexts, such as in the navigation space for television and entertainment systems.","This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts of media asset pivot navigation. The simplified concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Media asset pivot navigation is described. In various embodiments, collections of media assets are determined from relational metadata that corresponds to the media assets in a respective collection. Each collection of media assets are represented as a navigation axis along which the media assets in a respective collection can be located, and the media assets can be associated with multiple collections of media assets based on the relational metadata. A media asset navigation interface is generated for display from which the collections of media assets can be navigated to locate the media assets for selection. The media asset navigation interface includes a display of a collection of media assets represented as a navigation axis. A navigation input can be received to pivot from the navigation axis to an alternate navigation axis and initiate a display of an additional collection of media assets that are represented as the alternate navigation axis.","Embodiments of media asset pivot navigation provide that a user can navigate the relationships of media assets in an abstract information space, rather than simply traversing lists of media assets when searching for viewing choices, song selections, photo viewing, and the like. A collection of media assets can be represented as a navigation axis along which the media assets in a respective collection can be located. Navigation axes that correlate to various collections of media assets are an organizational structure for a media asset navigation interface via which a user can navigate and locate media assets without a typed or text input. A user can pivot on the navigation axes that represent the collections of media assets to search and locate media assets. The navigation axes provide that a user can navigate from one media asset to a next according to the ordered collections, and the order in which media assets are encountered or discovered depends on the current navigation pivot.","Additionally, navigation input is not tied to any one particular device or input devices for navigation and axis pivot inputs. Input devices that facilitate user-selectable inputs and selections to navigate a media asset navigation interface can include a two-input controller, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional controller, a pointing device, a touch controller, and\/or a gestural controller that can all be utilized for various embodiments of media asset pivot navigation.","While features and concepts of the described systems and methods for media asset pivot navigation can be implemented in any number of different environments, systems, and\/or various configurations, embodiments of media asset pivot navigation are described in the context of the following example systems and environments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","104","110","102","102","112","110","104"]},"Media content (e.g., to include recorded media content) includes media assets and any type of audio, video, and\/or image data received from any media content and\/or data source. In various implementations, media assets include both global media assets  that are maintained at the content distributor  and available to any of the various client devices , and include local media assets  that are maintained local to a device, such as the local media assets  stored on device . As described herein, a media asset can include recorded video content, video-on-demand content, television content, television programs (or live programming), advertisements, commercials, music files, movies, video clips, digital photographs, documents and other types of media assets. Other media content can include interactive games, network-based applications, and any other content, assets, or data (e.g., to include user interface data, advertising content, closed captions data, content metadata, search results and\/or recommendations, etc.).","The communication networks  include any type of a data network, voice network, broadcast network, an IP-based network, and\/or a wireless network  that facilitates communication of data and media content in any format. The communication networks  can be implemented using any type of network topology and\/or communication protocol, and may be represented or otherwise implemented as a combination of two or more networks. In addition, any one or more of the arrowed communication links facilitate two-way data communication.","The various client devices  in system  can be implemented as any one or combination of a wired and\/or wireless device, as any form of television client device  (e.g., television set-top box, digital video recorder (DVR), etc.), gaming device , computer device , portable computer , consumer device, media device, communication and\/or messaging device, video processing and\/or rendering device, appliance device, electronic device, and\/or as any other type of device that is implemented to receive media content in any form of audio, video, and\/or image data. A client device  may also be implemented as any type of mobile phone  (e.g., cellular, VoIP, WiFi, etc.), a portable media device  (e.g., a personal media player, portable media player, handheld media player, etc.), or any other wired and\/or wireless device.","The various client devices  shown in system  can be implemented as components in client systems that include a respective display device , or as a client device that includes an integrated display . A display device  can be implemented as any type of a television, high definition television (HDTV), LCD, or similar display system. The various client devices  can also be associated with one or more input devices, such as a remote control device for user-selectable inputs and selections to the television client device , a gaming controller for user-selectable inputs to the gaming device , a keyboard and mouse input devices for user-selectable inputs to the computer device  and to portable computer , an alphanumeric keypad for user-selectable inputs to the mobile phone , and various user-selectable inputs to the portable media device . Other input devices for user-selectable inputs and selections to the various devices can include a two-input controller, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional controller, a pointing device, a touch controller, and\/or a gestural controller that can be utilized for the various embodiments of media asset pivot navigation as described herein.","Any of the devices described herein can be implemented with any number and combination of differing components as described with reference to the example device shown in , such as one or more processors, communication components, data inputs, memory components, processing and control circuits, and\/or a media content rendering system. The example device  is representative of the various client devices  that implement various embodiments of media asset pivot navigation.","In this example, device  includes media content inputs  to receive media assets  from content distributor . The media content inputs  can include any type of communication interfaces and\/or data inputs, such as Internet Protocol (IP) inputs over which streams of media content (e.g., IPTV content) are received via an IP-based network. An IPTV receiver can include a media content input  to receive television content as an IPTV multicast via an Ethernet input port from content distributor . In addition, the media content inputs  include any type of broadcast and\/or over-the-air inputs via which media content is received over the air.","Device  can also include one or more tuners to tune television channels and\/or data streams for display and viewing, such as when device  is implemented as a television client device. In various implementations, a tuner can be implemented as a hardware tuner, or alternatively, as a software tuner that is implemented to tune to a television channel and\/or data stream. Device  includes a rendering system  to receive and\/or render media content in any form of audio, video, and\/or image data received from any media content and\/or data source. In various embodiments, the rendering system  is implemented to render a media asset navigation interface  for display, such as shown on the display device  that is associated with the television client device .","In this example system , device  includes a media asset navigation application  that can be implemented as computer-executable instructions and executed by processors to implement embodiments and\/or features of media asset pivot navigation. In embodiments, any of the various devices  can include the media asset navigation application  to independently implement media asset pivot navigation. Alternatively or in addition, the content distributor  includes a media asset navigation service  that implements embodiments and\/or features of media asset pivot navigation, either independently, or in conjunction with a media asset navigation application at a client device .","In various embodiments, the media asset navigation application  at device  and\/or the media asset navigation service  at content distributor  is implemented to determine collections of media assets  and initiate a display of a media asset navigation interface from which the collections of media assets can be navigated to locate the media assets for selection. A collection of media assets can be determined based on any relatable factor, such as relational metadata , a genre that is common to the media assets, similarity of content or audience, content length, the content provider or creator, participating actors or entities, a content channel, a tone, a mood, a time within a media asset, and\/or any other relevant media asset associations.","The relational metadata  can include any type of identifying criteria, descriptive information, and\/or attributes associated with the global media assets  and the local media assets  that describes and\/or categorizes the media assets. For example, metadata can include a media asset identifier, title, subject description, a date of production, artistic information, music compilations, and any other possible descriptive information about a particular media asset. Further, metadata can characterize a genre that describes a media asset, such as video content, as being an advertisement, a movie, a comedy show, a sporting event, a news program, a sitcom, a talk show, an action\/adventure program, or as any number of other category descriptions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204"]},"A user can navigate the relationships of the media assets in an abstract information space, rather than simply traversing lists of media assets when searching for viewing choices, song selections, photo viewing, and the like. Each media asset in a navigation axis is likely related to other media assets in another navigation axis, which builds out a continuum for searching media assets. For example, a user can navigate from the current selection  to find movies (e.g., other media assets) that are popular based on a collection of popular media assets  along a navigation axis . The user may navigate the popular movies and pivot on a media asset  that is also associated with a collection of media assets  that include a particular actor. The collection of media assets  is represented by a navigation axis .","The example media asset navigation axes  are the organizational structure for a media asset navigation interface via which a user can navigate and locate media assets without a typed or text input. In addition, the user can locate the various media assets, such as live television programs, recorded video, movies, personal media such as photos and music, and other media content all from the collections of media assets represented in a media asset navigation interface. A user can pivot on the navigation axes that represent the collections of media assets to discover media content that is related to the current selection . For example, a user can search through a collection of movies by title , and then pivot on navigation axis  to search the same movies by popularity. The example media asset navigation axes  provide that a user can navigate from one media asset to a next according to the ordered collections, and the order in which media assets are encountered or discovered depends on the current navigation pivot.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","302","304","304","304","306","308","310","312","314"]},"The visual elements  each provide a coherent visual representation of the media assets in a collection on the media asset navigation interface . A visual element  for a collection of media assets can be selected, or otherwise determined as the visual element that is most likely discernable by a user to represent the media assets. For example, a collection of media assets may all be live television, such as represented by the picture-in-picture . The visual element corresponds to the television program that is likely the most popular viewing choice. A visual element for a collection of media assets can be a video, an image, a logo, or any other non-textual representation of the media assets. The visual element for a collection of media assets can correspond to one of the media assets in the collection, or can be a composite image or other non-textual representation that corresponds to more than one of the media assets.","A visual element can also be displayed to indicate what a user was last watching, viewing, or searching. For example, when the media asset navigation application  at device  receives a navigation pivot input, such as a user-initiated input to television client device  with the remote control device, the media asset navigation application  contextualizes the visual elements  to represent the collections of media assets based on previous user inputs to interact with one or more of the media assets of a collection. In various examples, the image  of the movie poster can be changed to a static image of a scene from the point in a movie where a viewer paused or stopped watching the movie. The photo  can represent the last collection of photos viewed by the user, may be displayed as the last photo selected for viewing, or may be displayed as the next photo for viewing. Similarly, the image  of the music cover can be displayed to represent the last music file that a user selected for playback.","As described above, input devices that facilitate user-selectable inputs and selections to navigate the media asset navigation interface  can include a two-input controller, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional controller, a pointing device, a touch controller, and\/or a gestural controller that can all be utilized for the various embodiments of media asset pivot navigation as described herein. For example, navigation can be implemented with a simple controller that includes only a pivot input button and one axis of continuous navigation, such as a knob controller that provides navigation right and left across the media asset navigation interface.","With a three-dimensional controller, such as a game joystick, a user can simultaneously navigate along multiple axes. For example, pushing up on the joystick might move among genres from an origin (e.g., a selected media asset), and moving right and left would navigate through genres. Adding a third dimension, such as pushing down on the game joystick can initiate a navigation pivot among axes. Arbitrary pointing devices, such as a mouse or a touch controller, can also be utilized for navigation of the media asset navigation interface to directly touch and select visual elements for depth-wise navigation into a collection of media assets. A gestural controller provides a user arbitrary position navigation control within three dimensions. The position information can be relative, such as the position over a duration of time that is represented as a vector from a start position to an end position, without reference to an overall frame. A gestural controller that implements absolute position, such as the location of a gesture from within a room, can also be utilized for navigation of the collections of media assets displayed in a media asset navigation interface.","Example method  is described with reference to  in accordance with one or more embodiments of media asset pivot navigation. Generally, any of the functions, methods, procedures, components, and modules described herein can be implemented using hardware, software, firmware, fixed logic circuitry, manual processing, or any combination thereof. A software implementation of a function, method, procedure, component, or module represents program code that performs specified tasks when executed on a computing-based processor. The example methods may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, which can include software, applications, routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, procedures, modules, functions, and the like.","The methods may also be practiced in a distributed computing environment where functions are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communication network. In a distributed computing environment, computer-executable instructions may be located in both local and remote computer storage media, including memory storage devices. Further, the features described herein are platform-independent such that the techniques may be implemented on a variety of computing platforms having a variety of processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"At block , collections of media assets are determined from relational metadata that corresponds to the media assets in a respective collection.

The media assets include live television programs, recorded videos, music files, photographs, and\/or documents, and multiple ones of the media assets can be associated with more than one of the collections of media assets based on the relational metadata. The collections of media assets  include the global media assets  maintained at the content distributor  and the local media assets  maintained at the device , and the relational metadata  corresponds to both the global media assets and the local media assets.","At block , each collection of media assets is represented as a navigation axis along which the media assets in a respective collection can be located.
