{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described here may be made, used and licensed by and for the United States for governmental purposes without paying me any royalty.","In one aspect, this invention relates to a system for replenishing engine lubricant. In a further aspect this invention relates to a replenishment system that has a lubricant level monitor and indicator.","Military vehicles operate under an unusually wide variety of conditions and may be called upon to operate for extended periods without the opportunity to perform routine maintenance. Since the problem times are likely to coincide with a time of combat, it is important that the vehicle continue to operate. One area where a vehicle can face premature failure is a loss of oil pressure caused by low oil levels in the sump. Most vehicles have a low pressure light which warns of a low sump oil level but without the means to replenish the oil, such a warning is of little value.","The present invention provides an oil fill system which can replace consumed oil from a reservoir as needed to maintain an adequate supply of lubricant in the motor sump. The system also has means to signal when the reservoir has been depleted to the extent that it requires replenishment and means to indicate when the reservoir level is properly replenished. This allows the vehicle to operate over a considerable period of time. The system is designed so the oil can be replenished rapidly if necessary even during a break in combat.","The problems of the prior art are solved by the present invention of an engine oil level monitoring and replenishing system. The system of this invention includes an engine sump which holds a quantity of oil to be used for normal engine lubrication by the engine such systems being known in the art. The sump has an associated sensor which continuously monitors the oil level in the sump and will activate a warning light near the vehicle driver when the oil level reaches a predetermined level. Such sensors normally are activated only when the oil level had reached a critical stage and the vehicle must be turned off in a very short time to avoid permanent damage. Because of the reservoir of this invention, it is believed this will seldom be necessary.","A reservoir is provided for holding a quantity of oil to be used in replenishing the oil level in the sump when it drops below a predetermined level. A valve between the reservoir and the sump will open in response to a low level of oil in the sump to renew the sump lubricant level. In addition, the system has a warning circuit interactive with the reservoir sensor to generate a signal warning the vehicle operator of the need to replenish the oil level in the reservoir. Replenishment of the reservoir when it runs low on oil will generally obviate the low oil level warning and allow the vehicle to continue on an extended tour of duty.","Referring to the accompanying drawing wherein like numerals refer to like parts, one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The invention is an engine oil level monitoring and replenishing system designed for use with an internal combustion engine, not shown, having an oil sump. The oil sump is designated generally  and is associated with the internal combustion engine in a manner common in the art. A further description of the sump-engine relationship is omitted in the interest of brevity.","A sump sensor  is associated with the sump  to continuously measure the oil level within the sump. The sump sensor  is located within the sump and has a float member  attached to an activating arm  mounted within a sleeve  which extends between the sump  and an oil reservoir . As the oil level in the sump  varies between H and L, float  will move vertically within the sump. When the oil level in sump  reaches level L, the sump  is considered to bellow in oil and replenishment is needed.","The reservoir  contains a pivot arm  attached to the activating arm  at a joint  the pivot arm being rotatably mounted on a pintle  at joint . The pivot arm  moves in response to vertical movement of the activating arm  to open and close a valve member . When the oil level in sump  reaches the lower-level, L, the pivot arm  will raise an arm  moving a piston . This opens a connecting channel  between an outlet  in the reservoir  allowing oil to flow through the connecting channel  to inlet  of sump . When the oil level in sump  reaches H, the valve  will close until additional lubricant is needed.","The reservoir  can be designed to hold sufficient oil to allow the vehicle to function over an expected mission cycle which may include several weeks without the opportunity for routine maintenance. The reservoir  will operate between an upper and lower level shown in the figure by dashed lines H and L. The range of motion of piston  can be controlled by means of an adjustment member . In the present case, the adjustment member comprises a threaded stem  with a knob  the threaded stem being mounted in a threaded sleeve . Turning the threaded stem  will change the range of motion of activating arm . The adjustment will control the intervals at which oil will be used to replenish the level in the sump  so that the levels will vary over the desired range. When the level of oil in the reservoir fells to L additional oil is added to the reservoir by removing a cap  and adding oil through an opening  provided for this purpose.","The oil reservoir  has a low level oil switch  and fill level switch  to monitoring the reservoir oil level. The switches are activated by use of a reservoir float  located within the reservoir, float  being attached to a push arm  mounted in sleeve  so as to move vertically with respect to the reservoir . The push arm  is attached to a vertically oriented S shaped member  so when the push arm moves it will move arm  of the S shaped member  vertically reflecting the oil level within the reservoir  between the high level, H, and the lower-level L.","When in use, as the oil level in reservoir  is depleted, S shaped member  will move vertically downward until arm  contacts the low level switch . Activation of switch  will close contacts ,  causing current to flow from battery  through a resistor  to a blinking LED . The blinking LED  is permanently connected to ground  so that when current flows it will immediately began operation to signal that the reservoir level has reached the point where it should be replenished. The blinking LED  is mounted in the passenger compartment as part of the vehicle driver's instrumentation. Thus, the driver will become aware that lubrication is needed while the sump is full providing a considerable operating margin of safety so that the engine sump does not go below the desired level before a warning is issued to the driver. It is expected, that even when the low level oil light associated with the reservoir is active, the vehicle could still be used. This provides a duel level of protection with a low lubricant warning issued first when the reservoir reaches the replenishment level and second when the sump reaches the replenishment level as indicated by the sump oil indicator normally associated with engines.","When the cap  is removed and oil is added through the opening , the float  and associated arm  will move the S shaped member  vertically until arm  contacts the full level switch . Activation of the switch will close the contacts ,  causing current to flow from battery  through LED . The LED  will be mounted near the opening  so that the person adding oil will know when the level in the reservoir  has reached the desired level and prevent over filling of the reservoir.","Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the accompanying drawing:","The FIGURE is a schematic view of one embodiment of the invention."]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
