title: Direct growth of metal nanoplates on semiconductor substrates
abstract: Metal nanoplates are grown on n-type and p-type semiconductor wafer substrates through galvanic reactions between substantially pure aqueous metal solutions and the substrates. The morphology of the resulting metal nanoplates that protrude from the substrate can be tuned by controlling the concentration of the metal solution and the reaction time of the solution with the semiconductor wafer. Nanoplate size gradually increases with prolonged growth time and the nanoplate thicknesses increases in a unique stepwise fashion due to polymerization and fusion of adjacent nanoplates. Further, the roughness of the nanoplates can also be controlled. In a particular embodiment, Ag nanoplates are grown on a GaAs substrate through reaction with a solution of AgNOwith the substrate.

More particularly, the invention relates to methods for growing metal nanostructures, such as Ag, Ag\/Au, Ag\/Pt, and Ag\/Pd from solutions of metal precursors on semiconductor substrates through galvanic reactions.","This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is, inter alia, recited in the claims. Unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Semiconducting materials, in particular, wafers made of Si and other III-V materials that are widely used in the semiconductor industry, can strongly interact with electromagnetic fields in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible-infrared (IR) regimes due to their unique band structures. Nanostructures made of noble metals, such as gold and silver, also exhibit strong responses to electromagnetic fields in specific spectral region because of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that is induced by the resonant oscillation of surface conduction electrons in the surfaces of the illuminated metal nanostructures. Therefore, metal nanostructure\/semiconductor composites generated through directly depositing metal nanostructures on semiconductor substrates represent a promising class of functional materials.","Such materials have unique optical, electronic, optoelectronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties. Accordingly, the materials have applications in energy related areas, for instance, photovoltaic cells, photoelectrochemical splitting of water, for generating hydrogen, photocatalysis, and others. For example, single-crystalline semiconductor wafers covered discontinuously with nanostructures of noble metals are applicable to serve as photoelectrodes of high-performance photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) that are efficient for solar energy conversion into electricity and to storing chemical fuels, such as hydrogen. PECs have a number of advantages in comparison with traditional solid-state photovoltaic devices; for instance, PECs do not require high purity and precisely controlled doping levels (in terms of dopant type, concentration, and junctions) of the semiconductor wafers, which mainly determine the fabrication cost of solid-state photovoltaic cells. In addition, PECs built with single-crystalline semiconductor wafers exhibit fast charge transportation, resulting in the elimination of electron-hole recombination and an enhancement in performance, due to high charge mobilities in single-crystalline semiconductors.","However, a long-term challenge in assembling high-performance, stable PECs with semiconductor wafers is to prevent corrosion of the semiconductor photoelectrodes caused by the holes generated in the photon-induced charge separation processes. For instance, n-type Si wafers modified with Pt nanoparticles have shown to increase the performance (e.g., increase of open circuit voltage and output current) of PECs cells fabricated with the Pt\/Si composite electrodes as well as enhance the stability of the photoelectrodes. Although greater coverage of the substrate with Pt nanoparticles enables higher stability, the light absorption efficiency decreases due to the blockage of light. Deposition of a submonolayer of well-separated nanoclusters made of noble metals on the surface of a semiconductor wafer could also significantly increase the stability of the PEC fabricated with the metal\/semiconductor hybrid photoelectrode. The ideal morphology of each metal nanocluster is a \u201cmushroom\u201d shape, which has a thin root with a diameter of less than about 10 nm bonding to the semiconductor substrate and a large cap with suitable geometry and size for exposing the semiconductor surface as much as possible in order to harvest sunlight.","Metal nanostructure\/semiconductor composites are also applicable in controlling quantum yields of semiconductor quantum dots. For example, quantum dots can be tuned in either quenching or enhancing mode by locating metal nanoparticles in the vicinity of the quantum dots with various spacings. Titanium dioxide (TiO) nanoparticles (a class of strong absorbers of UV irradiation) decorated with Au nanoparticles exhibit enhanced efficiency to convert solar energy into electricity because the SPR states of Au nanoparticles in the visible region can be strongly excited by solar irradiation and the excited electrons can be injected into the conduction band of TiO. The charge flow drives the hybrid system to behave as a photovoltaic device similar to a dye-sensitized solar cell.","Still further, controlling the hydrophobicity of solid surfaces has a wide range of applications, including anti-sticking, anti-contamination, self-cleaning, and oil\/water separation. In particular, it is desirable to create superhydrophobic surfaces that exhibit apparent contact angles larger than 150\u00b0. Various techniques are known to enhance the hydrophobicity of a surface by coating the surface with thin layers of low surface energy materials (for example long-chain alkyl thiol molecules for precious metals, or fluoroalkylsilane molecules for Si). However, achieving superhydrophobicity through this strategy can often be difficult. Various physical approaches including lithographic patterning and etching, molding, and imprinting have also been used to create roughness on surfaces to achieve superhydrophobicity. Still other approaches induce surface roughness by direct deposition of micro\/nanostructures of different materials (e.g., metals, polymers, polyelectrolytes, oxides, or carbon nanotubes) on substrates through chemical reactions and\/or assembly processes have been shown to lead to superhydrophobicity. Nevertheless, producing composite surfaces with a range of superhydrophobic behavior through relatively simple approaches remains difficult.","Properties and performance of metal nanostructure\/semiconductor hybrids are strongly dependent on the properties of the metal nanostructures, which are sensitive to their morphologies. A number of solution-phase synthetic approaches have been demonstrated to be capable of producing nanostructures with various well-defined shapes. These approaches have been developed to successfully synthesize metal nanostructures with a large number of well-defined shapes such as spheres, cubes, tetrahedra, octahedra, rings\/frames, rods\/wires\/beams, stars, plates, boxes, and cages. However, synthesis of these structures requires uses of surfactants. Some of these approaches have been extended to grow metal nanostructures with well-defined shapes on solid substrates. For example, seed mediated synthetic processes with assistance of surfactants can grow gold nanorods on silicon or glass substrates and gold nanoplates on conductive indium tin oxide substrates. The as-synthesized shaped metal nanostructures can be deposited on appropriate semiconductor surfaces by controlling surface chemistries and assembly strategies. In particular, the solution-phase chemical reactions have also achieved success in preparing metal nanoplates with the assistance of specific surfactant molecules, for instance, polymeric chains (e.g., poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) or PVP, polyamine), micellar assemblies (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or CTAB, di(2-ethyl-hexyl) sulfosuccinate or AOT), coordinating ligands, biological reagents, etc.","The various conventional methods typically use surfactant molecules that are usually employed in the solution-phase reactions to assist the anisotropic or isotropic growth of metal nanoparticles as well as prevent the nanoparticles from aggregation and sintering. However, the surfactants can deleteriously influence the metal\/semiconductor interfaces for applications. The use of surfactant molecules also complicates the reactions and contaminates the surfaces of the resultant metal nanostructures, leading to degradation of their performance in certain applications. For instance, a thick layer of organic surfactant molecules on the surfaces of metal nanoparticles can block charge transfer at metal\/semiconductor interfaces involved in applications such as photovoltaic cells, resulting in a significant decrease of the performance of devices fabricated with the surfactant coated metal nanoparticles. The surfactant molecules can also decrease the catalytic efficiency of the metal nanoparticles used for catalyzing chemical reactions because the surfactant coating can block the interaction between precursor molecules and the metal surfaces.","Other techniques such as the combination of templates on wafer substrates and physical deposition (e.g., thermal evaporation, electron-beam evaporation, sputtering, atomic-layer deposition) can avoid the use of surfactant molecules to produce metal nanostructures with various nonspherical shapes defined by the templates. For example, \u201cnanosphere lithography\u201d provides a versatile approach to fabricate metal nanoparticles with a number of morphologies (e.g., triangular plates, rings, overlaps of double triangles, and chains of triangles). However, the preparation of nanosphere templates and the use of vacuum deposition tools in their fabrication can be a complicated and inefficient and costly process.","Metal precursors, for example, metal ions and organometallic compounds, may be used to deposit metal atoms directly onto the surfaces of semiconductors without the involvement of surfactant molecules. This technique can produce metal\/semiconductor composite materials with clean metal\/semiconductor interfaces. Additionally, the process is a more straightforward and efficient method to directly grow metal nanostructures on semiconductor substrates through a relatively simple reduction reaction of aqueous solutions of substantially pure metal precursors, for example, AgNOfor Ag atoms and adding NaAuClto form Ag\/Au nanostructures, with a semiconductor substrate (serving as reducing agent). Further, the morphology of the deposited metal nanostructures can be finely tuned to desired parameters by controlling reaction parameters. By tuning the morphology of the nanostructures, a number of useful metal\/semiconductor materials may be fabricated having applications in, for example, photovoltaic cells, photocatalysis, chemical detection, chemical separation, and self-cleaning surfaces and heat management of electronics.","Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to an efficient surfactant-free approach to quickly grow pristine metal nanoplates with well-controlled thicknesses, edge lengths, and roughness as well as metal nanostructures with other morphologies (formed as hierarchical structures made of nanoplates) on semiconductor wafers through galvanic reactions between substantially pure aqueous solutions of metal salts and n-type and p-type semiconductor substrates. The length and thickness, as well as the roughness of the metal nanoplates, can be finely tuned by simultaneously varying the concentration of the metal solutions and the reaction time with the substrate. By further varying these parameters, metal nanoplates can also polymerize into oligomers and fuse into thicker nanoplates. In addition, light illumination can be used to modulate the growth process, leading to the variation of density of nanoplates. Metal nanostructures with other morphologies can be synthesized by tuning the dopant type and concentration of the semiconductor substrates and\/or power intensity of light illumination. Desired structures can be fabricated efficiently\u2014a typical synthesis can be completed within 0.5-10 minutes.","The growth of each metal nanoplate initiates with the formation of a very small metal crystal (i.e., nucleus) at a defect site on the semiconductor surface. Growth begins here because the defect site has higher surface energy, and thus higher reactivity, than adjacent flat areas of the substrate. Defects usually exist on the surfaces of semiconductor wafers after their native oxide layers are removed with acids (e.g., hydrofluoric acid) in an ambient environment. The existence of defects typically results from the surface roughness and crystalline defects of the semiconductor wafer substrate itself.","Once the metal nuclei are formed through fast reduction of metal ions with surface electrons of the semiconductor substrate, the subsequent growth process is dominated by a so-called \u201chole injection process\u201d because the reduction potential of the metal ion\/metal pair (M\/M) is higher than the valence band of the semiconductor wafer under the reaction conditions. The hole injection process induces reactions between the metal ions and the semiconductor substrate to directly grow the metal particles onto the surfaces of the semiconductor substrates without assistance of external electrical fields, which is different from electrochemical deposition of metals. Ohmic contacts (for electrochemical deposition), surfactant molecules, and additional reductants are not required. Therefore, this process is applicable to deposit nanostructures of noble metals, whose corresponding equilibrium potentials of M\/M are usually high enough to overlap with the valence bands of conventional semiconductor wafers (e.g., GaAs, Si, Ge, InP, and GaP), to form clean metal\/semiconductor interfaces that have beneficial applications. The present process is further capable of anisotropically growing metal nanoparticles with well-defined shapes, for example, nanoplates.","In situ generation of oxides on the surfaces of the semiconductor substrates and the slow interdiffusion between the metal and semiconductor is critical to well separate the nucleation, dominated by fast reduction of metal ions with surface electrons, and the growth steps, dominated by the hole injection process. The separation enables the anisotropic growth of metal nanostructures with well-defined shapes. Nanoplates of various metals, for example, Ag on GaAs and Si and Pd on GaAs, have been demonstrated using this approach.","The as-grown metal nanoplates can be conventionally converted into nanoplates made of other metals (or alloys) through reacting the metal nanoplates with precursors of other more noble metals. For example, Ag nanoplates can be transformed into Au\/Ag alloy nanoplates when the Ag nanoplates react with chloroauric acid (HAuCl).","In a particular embodiment, substantially pure Ag nanoplates are directly grown on n-type GaAs wafers at room temperature through galvanic reactions between aqueous solutions of AgNOand the GaAs substrates. Varying the concentration of the AgNOsolutions and the reaction time with the substrate provides the capability to tune the dimensions (thickness and length) and the surface morphologies (smooth versus rough) of the Ag nanoplates disposed on the semiconductor substrate. In general, rough nanoplates are generated when the AgNOconcentration is low (e.g., less than or equal to about 0.1 M). When the concentration of AgNObecomes higher (e.g., greater than about 0.3 M), the surfaces of the nanoplates become flat and their thicknesses increase with an increase in the concentration. In addition, the sizes of Ag nanoplates increase with growth time, while their thicknesses increase in a stepwise fashion through polymerization and fusion of adjacent nanoplates.","In another embodiment, substantially pure Pd nanoplates are directly grown on a semiconductor substrate by reacting a GaAs wafer with NaPdClsolution. The resulting reaction yields Pd nanoplates on the surface of the substrate.","In yet another embodiment, the semiconductor substrates can be decorated with metal nanoplates through direct galvanic reaction between aqueous metal ion solutions and semiconductor wafers. The hydrophobocity of the resulting metal nanoplate\/semiconductor composite surfaces can be varied after the metal nanoplates are coated with self-assembled monolayers of low surface energy organic molecules such as alkyl thiol. By controlling the reaction conditions, such as growth time and concentration of the AgNOsolution, the size, thickness, and surface roughness of the individual nanoplates can be tuned to produce different topographic structures and roughness of the composite surfaces, thereby modifying the hydrophobicity of the surfaces. The resulting composite surfaces exhibit various levels of hydrophobicity and different wetting states such as the Wenzel wetting state, Cassie impregnating wetting state, and Cassie nonwetting state.","In yet another embodiment, growth of metal nanoplates on p-type semiconductor substrates is performed with assistance of light illumination. Light illumination over partial reaction area(s) of the p-type semiconductor substrates selectively increases the concentration of surface electrons in these bright areas, thus leading to boost the nucleation process. This spatial selectivity allows patterning the surfaces of the semiconductor substrates with metal nanoplates in desired layouts.","In one embodiment, the techniques of the present invention further represent a \u201cgreen\u201d approach to fabricating complex functional materials because there are no surfactants, organic solvents, or catalysts involved in the synthesis. In a typical synthesis, the necessary materials only include metal precursor, semiconductor substrate, and water. The present technique eliminates the dissolution of oxide layers of semiconductors that provide confinement to assist the growth of highly anisotropic metal nanoplates. Additionally, the formation of \u201cmushroom\u201d morphologies of the metal nanoplates can be applicable to the fabrication of robust PECs with nanoplate\/semiconductor hybrid materials. Furthermore, the nanoplates have rough and clean surfaces and large facial areas that enable them to function as a new class of structures for plasmonic catalyzed chemical reactions, for the plasmonic-enhanced absorption of solar energy in photovoltaic applications, for surface-enhanced photoluminescence, and for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in detection of chemical and biological species.","These and other advantages and features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.","Metal nanoplates are grown on n-type and p-type semiconductor wafer substrates through simple galvanic reactions between substantially pure aqueous metal precursor solutions that can be carried out at room temperature.  illustrate the general process for a particular embodiment using AgNOto grow Ag nanoplates on a GaAs substrate. The morphology of the resulting metal nanoplates can be controlled by the concentration of the metal ion solution and the reaction time. The results show that the sizes of the nanoplates gradually increase with prolonged growth times and the thicknesses increase in a unique stepwise fashion because of polymerization of adjacent nanoplates into oligomers. The technique provides a simple approach to grow metal nanoplates with controlled sizes and thicknesses on semiconductor substrates. By choosing appropriate metal salt precursors and semiconductor wafers, this method can be easily extended to grow nanoplates made of other metals on desired semiconductor substrates.","The as-grown nanoplates protrude out of the surfaces of the semiconductor substrates with random orientations. Regardless of orientation, each nanoplate has one edge contacting the substrate surface, and this edge is defined as the \u201ccontact edge.\u201d Each nanoplate grows from a small nucleus initially formed at a defect site of the substrate and expands its dimension laterally into a substantially two-dimensional plate. Meanwhile, an oxide layer simultaneously grows between the nanoplate and the substrate. Thus, the nanoplates have a necked geometry with a small region of contact between the nanoplate and the semiconductor lattices as well as large planar basal surfaces. The direct contact between the metal nanoplates and the semiconductor lattices supports the hole injection process to grow the metal nanoplates into different sizes and, for example, to provide charge transfer pathways in PECs. Further, the morphology may beneficially prevent the corrosion of the substrate wafer when it is used as a photoelectrode in a PEC. Additionally, the coverage of a thin transparent layer of oxides on the substrate can further protect the substrate from corrosion but does not substantially affect the harvesting of sunlight.","A typical synthesis of high-quality metal nanoplates, for example, Ag nanoplates, starts with cleaning a semiconductor substrate. In an embodiment, a single crystal n-GaAs substrate is cleaned by dipping the substrate in a 2% hydrofluoric acid solution for about 5 minutes. The reaction with hydrofluoric acid removes the native oxide layer from the substrate and exposes fresh lattices to the reactants. The cleaned substrate is rinsed with deionized water and dried with a flow of Ngas. The cleaned substrate should generally be used within 1 hour to avoid regeneration of the native oxide layer on semiconductor surface. A droplet of aqueous metal ion solution is placed on the cleaned surface of the substrate. In a particular embodiment, the aqueous metal solution comprises AgNO. Contact of the substrate with the aqueous metal ion solution initiates the growth of metal nanoplates, nanostructures, and microstructures on the substrate surface through galvanic reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction. Where the reaction comprises, for example, a solution of AgNOand a substrate of n-GaAs, the reaction is characterized by:\n\n12AgNO+2GaAs+6HO\u219212Ag+GaO+AsO+12HNO\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The reaction of the particular embodiment, proceeds because the standard reduction potential of the Ag\/Ag pair (0.799 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) is higher than those of the GaO\/Ga pair (about 0.56 V versus NHE) and the AsO\/As pair (0.234 V versus NHE). A continuous reaction generates a substantially dense layer of metal structures on the surface of the substrate. The difference in standard reduction potentials between the redox pairs of Ag\/Ag and GaO\/Ga and AsO\/As indicates that the reaction shown in Equation (1) is thermodynamically spontaneous regardless of the dopant type in the GaAs wafers.","The reaction can be stopped by rinsing the sample with copious amounts of deionized water and drying with a gentle Nflow, completing the synthesis. Continuous growth results in the formation of nanoplates of varying sizes by controlling the growth time.  show low- and high-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, of a sample formed after a 2 minute reaction of 1 M AgNOon a GaAs substrate with a silicon dopant concentration of 1.5\u00d710cm. The images show the formation of substantially uniform nanoplates with a high density (wherein density is defined as the number of plates per unit of area) of 2.82\u00d710plates\/cmover the reaction area. The nanoplates have smooth surfaces and a thickness of about 28\u00b15 nm and edge lengths from about 400 to about 450 nm. The nanoplates protrude from the surface plane of the substrate and have random orientations.","The technique is also applicable to growing nanoplatess of other noble metals on semiconductors, including Pd nanoplates on n-type GaAs wafers because of a standard reduction potential of 0.623 V for a PdCl\/Pd couple. The technique can further be applied to grow metal nanoplates on other semiconductor substrates, such as n-type Si and p-type semiconductors.","Similarly,  show SEM images of a sample formed after a 10 minute reaction with 0.1 M AgNOsolution on an n-GaAs substrate. The reaction achieves substantially uniform and relatively dense (3.12\u00d710plates\/cm) coverage of the substrate with nanoplates. A high-magnification SEM image of an individual structure (inset, ) shows that the plate has half-moon (i.e., fan-shaped) morphology and rough surfaces. The surface roughness indicates that each structure is comprises an assembly of Ag grains. Each plate sticks to the GaAs substrate through a straight edge and stands out from the surface of the wafer to expose an arc edge. The interaction between the Ag plates and the GaAs wafer is strong enough to withstand rinsing and drying processes in the synthesis. The thicknesses of the nanoplates typically range from about 50 to about 70 nm and the lengths of the straight edges are about 1 \u03bcm. The as-grown Ag nanoplates can be easily released from the GaAs wafer through various techniques, such as either scratching the surface of the sample with a blade or immersing the sample in an aqueous etchant of GaAs. In the particular embodiment where the substrate comprises GaAs covered with Ag nanoplates, a solution of hydrogen peroxide (HO) and phosphoric acid (HPO) can be used followed by centrifuging and rinsing to isolate the plates from the substrate. After collection of the nanoplates, the wafer can be re-used to for a subsequent synthesis cycle. In this fashion, the fabrication cost can be significantly decreased.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3F","FIG. 3F"],"b":["110","100"],"sub":["2","3 ","2","3 ","2","3 ","2","3 "]},"Metal ions can be reduced through different reactions as depicted in  based on relative energy positions between the semiconductor and the metal ions. A hole injection process as shown in  occurs on the semiconductor surface with small metal clusters in contact with a solution of the corresponding metal ions when the equilibrium potential of the M\/M couple overlaps the valence band of the semiconductor. However, the hole injection process may be difficult to initiate on the surface of a bare semiconductor substrate because forming the new metal\/semiconductor interface and new metal phase requires extra free energies to overcome a high energy barrier. In general, formation of small metal clusters, i.e., the nuclei, is driven by reducing metal ions with reductants having very high free energies, such as free electrons, sodium boron hydride (NaBH), etc. In an n-type semiconductor wafer, its surface is occupied with surface electrons (more reactive than bulk electrons) with concentration, n, determined by n=nexp(e\u0394\u03c6\/kT), where nis the bulk electron concentration (n=n, i.e., the donor density for completely ionized donors), e is the charge of an electron, \u0394\u03c6represents the band bending, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (in Kelvin scale). If surface electrons of semiconductors are responsible for quickly reducing metal ions into small metal clusters (i.e., the nucleation step), the reaction between a given n-type semiconductor and a solution of metal ions at a constant temperature can generate a metal cluster with densities strongly dependent on the dopant concentrations. As a result of sequential hole injection process, more metal nanoparticles in a unit area can be grown on semiconductor substrates with higher dopant concentrations. The separation of growth step (dominated by hole injection process) from nucleation step (dominated by fast reduction with surface electrons) is beneficial for the formation of anisotropic metal structures.","For example, in the hole injection process, Ag ions rarely interact with the surface GaAs lattices. Instead, Ag ions mainly diffuse to the surfaces of the Ag nuclei to release holes. As a result, the resulting Ag nanostructures usually grow out of the surface of the GaAs substrate rather than spreading over the substrate surface. The separation between nucleation and growth steps enables the anisotropic growth of the metal nanostructures with well-defined shapes. This approach is different from the traditional Volmer-Webber growth mode, through which most metal nanoparticles grow into semi-spherical morphologies on semiconductor substrates. When the crystalline structure of the Ag nuclei and kinetics of the hole injection process are appropriate, Ag nanostructures with well-defined shapes, for example, nanoplates, can be obtained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5F","FIGS. 5A-5C","FIGS. 5D-5F","FIGS. 5A-5F","FIG. 6"],"sup":["+","+"],"sub":["3 ","3 "]},"As shown in , the conduction and valence bands of n-type GaAs bend upward in the space charge region upon contact with aqueous AgNOsolution. The bending of the conduction band in this way leads to the generation of concentrated electrons on the surface of the n-GaAs substrate, which is beneficial to the fast reduction of Ag ions needed to generate nucleic Ag nanoparticles on the surface of an n-GaAs wafer. In addition, the surface states (i.e., E=E\u22120.98 eV for As sites and E=E\u22121.15 eV for Ga sites) exist on the surface of GaAs wafers due to, for example, crystalline defects. Although the reducing ability of the surface states is lower than that of electrons, they can also quickly reduce Ag to form Ag clusters at the initial stage of reaction. The reduction of Ag ions by surface electrons and surface states at different rates may account for the formation of nucleic Ag particles with different sizes at the early stage of reaction. The conduction and valence bands of SI-GaAs exhibit similar bending behavior to that of n-GaAs except that the bending degree is smaller. The shallow bending induces a lower concentration of electrons on the surface of a SI-GaAs wafer, thus decreasing the number of Ag nuclei formed at the early stage of the reaction. In addition, the number of nuclei determines the density of final Ag structures in the as-prepared samples. The conduction and valence bands of p-GaAs bend downward in the space charge region when it is in contact with electrolyte. The downward bending causes the surface of a p-type GaAs wafer to be filled with concentrated holes (i.e., positive charges). As a result, the Ag nuclei formed on the p-GaAs wafers are mainly generated through the reaction between Ag ions and surface states. The deficiency of surface electrons causes a very low number of nuclei to form on the p-GaAs wafers, and thus a low density of Ag structures in the final samples ().","The nucleation reaction process for n-GaAs is illustrated in . Once the surface electrons and surface states of a GaAs wafer are completely consumed, continuous deposition of Ag atoms for further growth of the Ag nuclei into large structures is mainly dominated by the hole-injection process. Each Ag ion injects a hole into the lattice of the GaAs wafer through the Ag nuclei, because of the reduction potential of Ag\/Ag (E) being higher than the surface valence band of the GaAs at the concentration of the AgNOsolution.  illustrates the hole-injection process occurring during the growth of Ag plates. When a Ag ion reaches the surface of a Ag nucleus on the surface of the GaAs wafer, it releases a hole (h), converting the ion to a Ag atom, which deposits on the Ag nucleus. The hole travels through the Ag nucleus and injects into the lattice of the GaAs wafer. Then the hole diffuses to the surface region of the GaAs substrate, where it is not covered with Ag, to react GaAs with the assistance of water (from the AgNOsolution), resulting in the formation of oxides, namely, GaOand AsO. As the hole-injection-induced reaction continues, more Ag atoms deposit on the nucleic Ag particle to expand its dimensions, while more oxide species from GaAs are generated to thicken the oxide layer. The formation of an oxide layer prevents the GaAs lattice from directly reacting with Ag in solution. As a result, the Ag ions are reduced on the surface of the Ag particle to enlarge their size rather than on the surface of the oxide layer to form new Ag nuclei. The adhesion between the oxide layer and Ag is weak and the oxide layer repels the Ag structure, forcing it to lay on the surface of the GaAs wafer\u2014resulting in the growth of Ag structures out of the surface of the GaAs substrate as indicated in . These effects lead to the formation of Ag structures with half-moon, platelike morphologies.","Formation of nanoplates with (111) basal surfaces, as shown in , lowers the surface energy of the resulting particles because the (111) facet planes represent the ones with the lowest surface energy. The independence of the morphologies of as-synthesized Ag structures of the growth time implies that the crystalline structures of the nuclei may also provide an additional driving force to grow the Ag structures into platelike morphologies. As the concentration of AgNOdecreases, the value of Emoves upward (in the negative direction) during the reaction. Once the concentration of the AgNOsolution is below a critical value, the hole-injection process will automatically cease because the value of Eis lower than the valence-band level of the GaAs. Accordingly, growth of the Ag structures is terminated.","A substantially continuous amorphous layer with a thickness of about 2 nm substantially covers the substrate surface except at the specific contact points with the nanoplates. The amorphous layer comprises oxides formed from semiconductor substrates, such as oxides of Ga and As in the case of a GaAs substrate. The oxide layer stops only at the contact point at which a nanoplate attaches to the semiconductor lattice at the defect site through a relatively tiny protruded post with size less than about 10 nm. On the other hand, the oxide layer is still continuous at other contact points associated with the same Ag nanoplate; that is, the oxide layer separates the Ag nanoplate and the GaAs lattices at these contact points. The Ag nanoplate grows from a small nucleus initially formed at the defect site and expands its dimension laterally into a two-dimensional plate. The necked morphology of the nanoplates with small contacts between the nanoplates and the semiconductor lattices as well as their large planar basal surfaces could be beneficial in preventing the corrosion of the substrate covered with metal nanoplates as used as a photoelectrode in a PEC. The direct contact between the metal nanoplates and the semiconductor lattices is important to support the hole injection process to grow the Ag nanoplates into different sizes and to provide charge transfer pathways in PECs.","In at least the case of AgNO, the metal nanoplates formed through this approach can be assembled into concentric circles in the outmost region of the droplet of solution by controlling the evaporation of water from the solution. The evaporation moves the front line of the droplet to form series of circles through the so-called \u201ccoffee ring\u201d effect. In a typical growth process in ambient environments, where the humidity is lower than the saturated pressure of water vapor, water in the solution evaporates continuously. The loss of water leads the solution droplet to shrink in volume, resulting in the movement of its front edge towards the central direction. As a result, plates are assembled in concentric circular arcs around the edge of the solution droplet.  present low- and high-magnification SEM images of a typical sample showing the organization of the as-grown concentrically orientated Ag plates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2C"]},"Selected-area electron diffraction pattern obtained by focusing the electron beam perpendicular to the flat surfaces of the plate shown in  is presented in the inset of .

Nanoplates with edge lengths of about 85 nm are formed at an early stage, a reaction time of 5 seconds (). With increasing reaction time, the edge lengths of Ag nanoplates increase accordingly, whereas the thicknesses remain essentially constant. As a result, the sizes of the nanoplates grown via this approach are easily tuned by controlling the reaction time. The thicknesses of the plates are determined by the lateral dimensions of the nuclei formed at a very short reaction time.","The size as well of the thickness of the metal nanoplates on semiconductor substrates can be tuned. As shown in , the sizes of the metal nanoplates gradually increase with the growth time while the thicknesses increase stepwise at a certain stage. In this particular example, the plotted results reflect the samples of the Ag nanoplates grown on n-GaAs substrates through reaction with an 8 M AgNOsolution for varying times. The schematic illustration of  shows the major steps involved in the growth process of, for example, Ag nanoplates. Plate-like nanoparticles with very small sizes are formed on a semiconductor substrate, in this case, n-type GaAs, after the reaction between AgNOand GaAs is initiated (i.e., growth time of several seconds). The crystalline structure of the clusters is believed to be important for the formation of the plates. Once the plates are derived, further reaction produces more Ag atoms to deposit on the peripheral edges of the plates due to their higher surface energies in comparison to the basal (111) surfaces, which are the most stable crystalline facets for fcc Ag crystals. This anisotropic growth results in an increase in the size of the nanoplates and substantially no change in their thickness. Because of a certain level of short-range textural relationship between the Ag nanoplates and the GaAs substrates, adjacent nanoplates with the same crystalline orientation start to polymerize into dimers when they become large enough (). The partial contact between the two nanoplates of each dimer speeds up the deposition of Ag atoms to fuse the nanoplates together, resulting in the formation of a nanoplate with thickness twice that of the original nanoplates of the dimer (). When the growth is allowed to continue, the concentration of AgNOdrops below a level to support the continuous anisotropic growth of nanoplates and only the most thermodynamically stable Ag grains with very small sizes are generated and deposited on both basal and edge surfaces of the nanoplates. This decoration results in the formation of nanoplates with larger thicknesses and rough surfaces as shown in .","The growth of the nanoplates can further be controlled through illumination of the semiconductor substrate with electromagnetic radiation. For example, irradiation of a portion of the reaction area of the n-type GaAs substrate with a green laser or a synchrotron x-ray source inhibits the growth of Ag nanoplates in the illuminated regions and the nearby regions. On the other hand, the density of the Ag nanoplates in the dark regions is increased compared with samples formed in complete darkness. This is ascribed to the enhancement of the concentration of surface electrons in the dark regions generated though photoinduced charge separation and migration. The comparable effects of the green laser and x-ray irradiation on the growth of Ag nanoplates also implies that the interaction between x-rays and n-type GaAs wafers also generates accumulated holes in the valence bands of GaAs in the illuminated areas. In general, x-ray irradiation excites deep core levels of elements followed by relaxation through Auger processes or secondary photon emission, which creates a cascade of secondary electrons, holes, and photons. These secondary electrons and holes eventually thermalize to the band edges (i.e., electrons in the conduction bands and holes in the valence bands). The electrons and holes tend to migrate in the GaAs lattices and react with GaAs and AgNO. Because x-rays can penetrate the GaAs lattices deeply (i.e., greater than about 50 \u03bcm), the holes generated in the valence band in the bulk lattices take a relatively long time to isotropically diffuse along all directions to the surface of the substrate to oxidize GaAs with assistance of water. As a result, a relatively broad region around the x-ray beam is influenced by the holes generated in the illuminated area, resulting in the absence of Ag nanoplates.","The technique is also applicable to direct growth of, for example, Ag nanoplates on p-GaAs substrates, with the assistance of illumination of the substrate. Reactions between the pristine n-GaAs wafers with AgNO, reveal that surface electrons of the n-GaAs wafers account for the nucleation process, while the growth of nuclei into Ag nanoplates is dominated by the hole injection process, . The failure of this method to grow Ag nanoplates on p-GaAs substrates, as shown in , is ascribed to the lack of surface electrons for the formation of enough nuclei. On the other hand, concentration of surface electrons can be tuned through illumination of a semiconductor substrate with a light having photon energy higher than the bandgap of the semiconductor. For example, illuminating an n-GaAs wafer decreases the density of its surface electrons, as shown in , while illuminating a p-GaAs wafer increases the density of its surface electrons. As a result, a light source, for example, a red laser beam with wavelength of \u02dc650 nm (i.e., 1.9 eV), can be used to increase the density of surface electrons of p-GaAs substrates (with bandgap of 1.42 eV) and to trigger the growth of Ag nanoplates on the illuminated surfaces.","The noble metal nanoplates may also be tuned to exhibit enhanced extinction peaks in the UV-visible-near infrared (NIR) regimes due to strong SPR. The coupling between the optical properties of nanoplates and the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor wafers may induce unique optical and electronic properties in the metal\/semiconductor hybrid systems to enable them to find potential applications in photochemistry, photoelectrochemistry, photocatalysis, photovoltaic cells, photosplitting of water, etc. Nanostructures made of precious metals and semiconductor wafers have interesting optical properties because of their SPR and unique band structure, respectively. For example, the Ag nanoplates exhibit strong excitation peaks which are tunable from the visible to the NIR regime by controlling their dimensions. Ag nanostructures are usually a class of promising substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), in particular, when they have sharp edges and\/or rough surfaces. Rough Ag nanoplates synthesized on GaAs substrates can efficiently enhance Raman signals of the in situ deposited oxides of GaAs. Similarly, the Ag nanoplates can also significantly increase Raman signals of interesting molecules attached to their surfaces.","For example,  compares the Raman spectra of thiophenol molecules on the surfaces of the Ag nanoplates with rough surfaces formed through a 10 minute reaction with 0.1 M AgNOon a GaAs surface as shown in . Thiophenol molecules spontaneously form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the surfaces of the Ag nanoplates as well as the surface of clean GaAs substrate when the samples are dipped into an ethanol solution of thiophenol at room temperature. Focusing a laser beam on a selected area (with diameter of about 2.5 \u03bcm) of the Ag nanoplates covered with a SAM of thiophenol excites strong Raman signal of thiophenol molecules as depicted by the solid curve of . All the peaks are consistent with the fingerprint features of thiophenol molecules. On the other hand, it is difficult to record apparent Raman peaks (dashed curve, ) for thiophenol molecules assembled on the GaAs surface. The tailing effect is ascribed to the strong fluorescence of the GaAs substrate. The significant difference between the two spectral curves of  confirms the capability of the rough Ag nanoplates for enhancing Raman signals of molecules adjacent to their surfaces. As indicated in the dashed curve in , GaAs wafers exhibit strong fluorescence in the NIR regime, overlapping the SPR spectra of the Ag nanoplates. Therefore, coupling between GaAs and Ag nanoplates can provide novel optical properties for various applications.","Additionally, the samples of semiconductor substrates covered with nanoplates that protrude out of the surfaces of the GaAs substrates allow high percentage of light to pass through to interact with the semiconductor substrate. The large surface areas of the nanoplates can also significantly enhance the dissipation efficiency of accumulated holes into electrolyte. Therefore, for example, Ag nanoplate\/GaAs wafer composite structures, may serve as stable photoelectrodes for fabricating robust, highly efficient PEC cells for solar energy conversion. In addition to solar energy conversion, the holes accumulated in the metal nanoplates coupled with catalytic capabilities of the nanoplates may enable to catalyze specific useful reactions (for example, oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, oxidation of pollutants, etc.) in electrolytes driven by the received solar energy.","The following non-limiting examples illustrate various aspects of preferred embodiments of the invention.","With reference to , the nucleation and growth of Ag nanoplates on an n-type single crystal GaAs substrate through reaction with a substantially pure aqueous solution of AgNOis illustrated. In a typical synthesis, a droplet of aqueous solution of AgNOwith appropriate concentration, from about 0.1 M to about 10 M, is delivered to the surface of a piece of n-type GaAs wafer that has been cleaned by soaking in a dilute 2% hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution for 5 minutes. Contacting the GaAs wafer with AgNOsolution immediately leads to quick reduction of Ag by the surface electrons (as shown in ), resulting in the formation of small Ag clusters (i.e., nuclei) on the nucleation sites (usually surface defects) on the GaAs surface. Once the nuclei are formed, hole injection process dominates the growth of the nuclei into larger Ag particles because the equilibrium potential (greater than or equal to 0.74 V versus NHE for AgNOsolutions with concentrations higher than 0.1 M) of Ag\/Ag couple overlaps the valence band (with band edge of 0.32 V versus NHE) of GaAs in solution with pH=7 (as illustrated in ). The small Ag clusters, i.e., nuclei, mediate the hole transfer from the Ag ions to the GaAs lattice and the deposition of newly formed Ag atoms.","As shown in , when a Ag ion reaches the surface of a Ag nucleus, it releases a hole (i.e., h) and transforms itself into an Ag atom. The Ag atom moves over the surface of the nucleus and condenses at a specific site with a locally maximum surface energy. The released hole travels through the Ag nucleus to reach the Ag\/GaAs interface. Due to the overlap between the valence band of GaAs and the energy band of Ag, the hole can be injected into the lattice of the GaAs wafer. This hole continues to diffuse in the GaAs lattice to reach the surface area (due to band bending) uncovered with Ag nuclei to react with GaAs lattice with assistance of water, which is from the aqueous solution of AgNO. This reaction leads to formation of oxides (i.e., GaO, AsOand their corresponding hydrates) of GaAs over the surface of the GaAs wafer. The overall chemical change involved in the hole injection process can be summarized as:\n\n12AgNO+2GaAs+6HO\u219212Ag+GaO+AsO+12HNO\u2003\u2003(2)\n","According to equation (2), the AgNOsolution becomes acidic during the growth of the Ag nanostructures due to the generation of HNO. The strong acid HNOis able to dissolve the oxides through\n\nGaO+6H\u21922Ga+3HO\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nand\n\nAsO+3HO\u21922HAsO+2H\u2003\u2003(4)\n","When the concentration of AgNOsolution is high enough, the growth rate of oxides becomes higher than the dissolution rate of oxides, resulting in deposition of an oxide layer on the GaAs surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy confirms the existence of oxides in the samples obtained through reacting n-GaAs wafers with AgNOsolutions with concentrations higher than 0.3 M.","The in situ formation of the oxide layer can eliminate progressive nucleation process to facilitate the anisotropic growth of the existing nuclei into larger particles. As the reaction continues, the band edge position of the valence band of the GaAs shifts downward towards a more positive value because of the decreasing pH value of the surrounding solution. In addition, the equilibrium potential of the Ag\/Ag couple moves upward to a less positive value due to the decrease of the concentration of Ag. As a result, the hole injection process can automatically cease when the reaction time is long enough. The hole injection process (i.e., the growth of the Ag nanocrystals) can also be stopped by rinsing away the AgNOsolution at any time during the reaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","sup":["18 ","\u22123 "],"sub":"3"},"The size of the nanoplates can be tuned by controlling the growth time.  compare the Ag nanoplates obtained by reacting n-GaAs wafers (with dopant concentration of 1\u00d710cm) with a 2 M AgNOsolution for 30 seconds and 60 seconds, respectively. The nanoplate sizes, which are determined by measuring the lengths of the orthographic projections of individual nanoplates along their longitudinal axes in the surface of the substrate, increase from about 125 nm to about 210 nm with increasing growth time from 30 seconds to 60 seconds. On the other hand, the thicknesses of the nanoplates remain substantially constant at about 22 nm. The dimensional evolution of the Ag nanoplates upon growth time indicates that growing a Ag nanoplate may start with the formation of a Ag nucleus at a defect site of the GaAs surface because the defect site has higher surface energy, thus higher reactivity, than adjacent flat areas. The lateral dimension of the Ag nucleus may be consistent with the thickness of the resulting nanoplate and the nucleus may have many (111) twin planes. As a result, more Ag atoms derived from the hole injection process are deposited on the lateral surfaces of the nucleus to anisotropically enlarge the nucleus into a nanoplate with crystalline confinement of the multiple (111) twin planes. The preferable deposition of Ag atoms on the lateral surfaces is attributed to their surface energy higher than the basal (111) surfaces, which represent the most stable surfaces with the lowest surface energy for face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals. With increasing growth time, the sizes of the Ag nanoplates gradually increase as shown in  from about 100 nm to more than 500 nm. However, adjacent nanoplates can polymerize into oligomers (typically dimers and trimers) followed by fusion into thicker nanoplates when the growth time is sufficiently long enough.","The thicknesses of Ag nanoplates can also be finely tuned by controlling the concentration of AgNOsolution. Silver nanoplates with smooth surfaces can be achieved on the n-GaAs wafers by reacting with AgNOsolutions with concentrations ranging from 1 M to saturation concentration, about 10 M.  show typical SEM images of the samples prepared through reactions with 6 M and 8 M AgNOsolutions for 60 seconds, respectively. The comparison between the samples grown with different concentrations of AgNOsolutions for the same time, 60 seconds, indicates that the thicknesses of nanoplates increase with concentrations of the AgNOsolutions but their sizes remain substantially constant. The independence of the sizes of the Ag nanoplates on the concentrations of AgNOsolutions implies that the rate for adding Ag atoms to the peripheral edge surfaces of the nanoplates is determined by the kinetics of the hole injection process rather than the diffusion of Ag ions. In all the reaction systems, the sizes of the as-grown nanoplates increase with the growth time regardless of the concentration of AgNO. However, the as-grown nanoplates exhibit relatively large differences in thickness between the samples grown from AgNOsolutions with different concentrations.  plots the dependence of thickness on the AgNOconcentration, showing that the thicknesses of the Ag nanoplates increase with the AgNOconcentration higher than 4 M and is substantially constant, about 25 nm, when the concentration of AgNOis between about 1 and about 4 M. Accordingly, adjusting the concentration of the AgNOsolution and the growth time together enables the capability to tune the thicknesses of Ag nanoplates in a continuous range from about 25 to about 160 nm.","When the concentration of AgNOis low, for example, less than about 0.3 M, the kinetics of the hole injection process do not support the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates with continuous lattices. Instead, rough Ag nanoplates constructed with an assembly of nanosize grains are generated.  is an SEM image of Ag nanoplates deposited on an n-GaAs substrate through reaction with 0.1 M AgNOfor 10 min, showing the formation of nanoplates with rough surfaces and thickness of about 50 nm.

With reference to , once the AgNOsolution contacted the GaAs substrate, a green laser having a wavelength of 532 nm, with a flux of about 10photons\/s, (Coherent\u00ae Verdi-V10 laser source) is immediately turned on to illuminate a portion of the reaction area.  shows an SEM image of a region boxed by the black rectangle in , including both illuminated and dark surfaces, after 10 minutes of reaction time at room temperature.  shows a stark contrast around the edge of the laser beam, i.e., only sparse small nanoparticles with sizes of 20-40 nm are formed in the center of the illuminated region, as seen in . On the other hand,  is an SEM image of the unilluminated region that is covered with dense nanoplates that protrude out of the surface of the GaAs substrate.","By considering the Gaussian distribution of power density of the laser beam, the existence of the sharp contrast in the image of  indicates that completely inhibiting the growth of Ag nanoplates requires illumination with power higher than a critical value. When illumination with power density is less than the critical value at the edge of the laser beam, the illumination does not completely depress the growth of the Ag nanoplates. Instead, only a decrease in the density and size of the as-grown Ag nanoplates, indicated by the contrast gradient at the left side of the bright region in  is observed. The nanoplates of the present example are of substantially pure Ag without contamination from the GaAs substrate. Similar to the structures obtained through reactions under dark conditions, the nanoplates shown in  also exhibit rough surfaces and a thickness of about 50 nm to about 70 nm and edge lengths of about 1 \u03bcm. However, the density of the Ag nanoplates of  is higher than that of the Ag nanoplates obtained under dark conditions. The increased density of the nanoplates is ascribed to the enhanced density of surface electrons in the dark area of the GaAs substrate when the reaction area is partially exposed to the laser beam, as depicted in . Additional surface electrons facilitate the formation of more nuclei and thus produce more nanoplates with respect to the dark condition. The result is consistent with the Ag nanoplates grown on n-type GaAs wafers with various doping levels under dark conditions. That is, the density of the Ag nanoplates increases with the dopant concentration of n-type GaAs wafers, which determines the concentration of surface electrons.","Charge separation and migration induced by the illumination are illustrated in . When an n-type GaAs wafer is in contact with an electrolyte, for example, aqueous AgNOsolution, the valence and conduction bands of the GaAs wafer bend upward in the space-charge region. Illuminating the electrolyte-wetted area of the GaAs wafer with a green laser reduces the bending degree of the valence and the conduction bands due to the photovoltage V.  shows, the electron quasi-Fermi level Eunder illumination is displaced from the equilibrium Fermi level E. The shift of energy levels in the illuminated area forces the photoinduced electrons in the conduction band of the illuminated GaAs to flow to the conduction band of the dark GaAs region though the bulk GaAs lattices, due to the energy difference of the conduction bands in different regions. The enriched electrons in the dark region diffuse to the surface and subsequently reduce the Ag to elemental Ag, which may contribute to the formation of nuclei. Although the surface electrons can reduce Ag to grow the nuclei into larger particles, further growth into nanoplates is dominated by a hole injection process. Each Ag injects a hole into the lattice of GaAs though the Ag nuclei, resulting in the reduction of the Ag into Ag and oxidation of GaAs into oxides.","The leftover holes in the valence band in the illuminated area cannot flow to the dark area because of the energy barrier. Accordingly, the holes diffuse to the illuminated surface to oxidize GaAs to form oxides, preventing the deposition of Ag in the illuminated area.","Illuminating an n-type GaAs wafer with high-energy photons, for example, synchrotron x-rays, that deeply penetrate GaAs lattices with a depth greater than about 50 \u03bcm, alters the growth of Ag nanostructures relative to samples that are not illuminated.  shows an SEM image of Ag nanostructures grown on an n-GaAs wafer when only a partial reaction area designated by the black rectangle is illuminated with x-rays. The experimental setup is similar to the setup of Example 7, as shown in , except that x-ray irradiation is applied instead of the laser source. The experiments were conducted at the bending magnet beamline 12-BM-B at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.

A drop of 0.1 M AgNOsolution is delivered onto the GaAs wafer followed immediately by an exposure to x-ray irradiation. Once the x-ray beam is blocked, the reaction is terminated after about 30 seconds by rinsing the wafer with water.","The SEM images of the resulting structure,  show a contrast between the areas outside and inside the dashed ellipse after 11 minutes of reaction time (10.5 minutes with x-ray illumination followed by 0.5 minute reaction without x-ray illumination). Close observation of the bright region marked with box c in  shows the formation of dense Ag nanoplates, further depicted in , which are similar to the nanoplates formed on GaAs wafers under dark conditions. However, the side that is marked with box d in  and the center of the area inside the dashed ellipse, marked with box e in , are covered with only small particles, as shown in , and have a similar size of the nanoparticles shown in  formed on a GaAs wafer with a reaction time of 30 seconds and without x-ray illumination. Therefore, the small nanoparticles formed inside the dashed ellipse in  are likely deposited after the x-rays are blocked. The result indicates that the x-rays generate a similar effect of blocking the formation of Ag nanoplates in the illuminated area to the green laser. However, the density of the nanoparticles of , 1.8\u00d710cm, is much lower than the density of the nanoparticles of , 4.5\u00d710cm. The decreased density can be ascribed to the partial coverage of the oxide layer, which is formed upon x-ray irradiation on the illuminated surface of the GaAs substrate.","An n-type GaAs wafer with a (100) crystalline surface orientation and Si dopant concentration of about 1\u00d710cmwas cut into 36 mmsquare pieces along their cleavage planes (i.e., 0  and 0 1).

In the early growth stage (i.e., growth time of 0-30 seconds), the thicknesses of the nanoplates remain essentially constant and only the sizes increase. For example, the size of the nanoplates increases to about 139\u00b16 nm when the growth time is prolonged to 15 seconds, . Individual nanoplates shown in  are well-separated.","Some adjacent nanoplates tend to polymerize into dimers when they continue to grow in size. As shown in , many dimers (highlighted by arrows) appear in the sample formed after 30 seconds of reaction time.

The orientations of the as-grown Ag nanoplates are not completely random on the surface of the single-crystalline GaAs substrate. Some of the nanoplates orient along certain specific crystalline directions in short ranges. As highlighted in the inset of , the two plates of the dimer do not have the same size and only contact with partial surfaces.

The nanoplates obtained at 90 seconds and longer times exhibit rough surfaces, which are decorated with small nanocrystalline grains. The deposition of small grains on the surfaces of the nanoplates is ascribed to the decrease of concentration of AgNOduring the reaction. A low concentration of the AgNOsolution, in general, leads to low chemical potential of the reaction system, resulting in difficulty in continuing the anisotropic growth of smooth Ag nanoplates that may require high chemical potential.","Statistical analyses of the parameters of the Ag nanoplates derived from the SEM images are compared in .  shows that the sizes of the Ag nanoplates gradually increase from about 95 nm to about 330 nm with increasing growth time of 5 seconds to 120 seconds before the nanoplates coalesce into the substantially semi-continuous film shown in . Evolution of the thicknesses of the nanoplates during the reaction is given in , showing the existence of two plateaus followed by a gradual increase. The first plateau corresponds to the nanoplates with thicknesses of about 40 nm formed at short growth time (i.e., 0-30 seconds), where the thicknesses of the original nanoplates of each dimer formed at 30 seconds are used in the statistical evaluation. Polymerization of the nanoplates into dimers followed by fast growth leads to a step increase of the thicknesses of the nanoplates to the second plateau, which corresponds to the samples dominated by the nanoplates with thicknesses of about 80 nm, two times the value for the first plateau. The thicknesses of the nanoplates formed at growth times greater than 60 seconds show a gradual increase with growth time because of deposition of fine Ag nanocrystalline grains on their surfaces in a layer-by-layer fashion as shown in .","The decoration with small Ag grains provides a convenient approach to increase the surface area of the resultant nanoplates, leading to various potential applications including surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photocatalysis, etc. With reference to , the distributions of the thicknesses of the nanoplates obtained at various growth times are plotted in histograms. The results of the statistical analysis based on the measurements of at least 200 nanoplates for each sample show that the majority of the nanoplates in each sample have one or two dominating thicknesses. As shown in , the thicknesses of the nanoplates formed at 15 seconds of reaction time exhibit a narrow distribution with only one peak at about 40 nm, indicating essentially no polymerization of nanoplates happens at short growth times. Continuous growth of the nanoplates induces the polymerization of adjacent nanoplates with the same crystalline orientation into dimers, which grow and fuse into nanoplates with a thickness twice that of the original nanoplates. When only a portion of the nanoplates polymerize and fuse, the thicknesses of the nanoplates in the resulting sample should exhibit bimodal peaks: one peak corresponds to the thickness of the original, unpolymerized nanoplates and the other peak corresponds to the polymerized and fused nanoplates. For example,  shows that the sample formed at 45 seconds has two peaks located at about 43 nm and at about 88 nm, which is approximately a two-fold relationship. Once the growth time is long enough, all the pairs of adjacent nanoplates polymerize and fuse into thicker nanoplates, leading to a sample consisting of nanoplates with one dominating thickness again.  shows only one peak at about 110 nm for the sample formed at 90 seconds. The shift of the peak position to the right side compared with the right peak in  is ascribed to the deposition of fine Ag grains on the surfaces of the nanoplates.","The polymerization and fusion of adjacent nanoplates can cause a decrease in the density of nanoplates. Variation of the density of the Ag nanoplates formed at different growth times is illustrated in . It is notable that the density of the sample formed at 60 seconds does not drop to the half-value of the density of the sample formed at 5 seconds although the average thicknesses of the nanoplates in these two samples exhibit a two-fold relationship. This can be attributed to the small particles (indicated by the arrows in the inset of ) existing in the samples formed at the beginning stage that grow into nanoplates at longer times. These small particles are not counted for the sample formed at 5 seconds. When the growth time increases from 60 seconds to 90 seconds, the density of the nanoplates continuously decreases due to further fusion between nanoplates.

The widening of the peaks is ascribed to the broader distribution of the sizes of the nanoplates formed with 2 M AgNOthan those formed with 8 M AgNO.  shows multiple sharp peaks start to appear in the range of about 350 to about 550 nm due to the strong coupling between nanoplates when the growth time is 180 seconds.

The strong interaction of the Ag nanoplates with light irradiations in the visible and the NIR regimes could significantly affect photochemistry, photocatalysis, etc. induced by the Ag\/GaAs hybrid systems.","The influence of the dopant type and the dopant concentration has been evaluated by reacting an aqueous 0.1 M AgNOsolution with undoped semi-insulating GaAs (100) (SI-GaAs) and p-type GaAs (100) doped with Zn at a concentration of about 1\u00d710cm.  shows an SEM image of the sample formed on a SI-GaAs wafer. The density of the Ag structures is lower than that of the samples formed on n-doped wafers.  shows the sample generated on a p-type wafer has an even lower density of Ag structures. This variation in density of the resultant Ag structures is determined by the number of Ag nuclei formed at the early stage of the reaction. In general, the formation of Ag nuclei is dependent on the fast reduction of Ag ions by surface electrons and\/or surface states of the GaAs wafers. The sum of the surface electron concentration (C) and the surface state concentration (C) for different types of wafers is in the order: n-GaAs>SI-GaAs>p-GaAs. Low values of Cand Clead to low reducing rates of Ag ions, and thus a low density of nuclei for the growth of Ag structures.","Thick multiple-layered structures, compared with monolayered plates on n-GaAs wafers, are formed in the side regions of SI-GaAs wafers.  shows an SEM image of the Ag structures formed in the region indicated by the top box of , showing their multiple-layered features and rough surfaces.  shows the formation of some wire-like structures are formed in the central region, as indicated by the bottom box of , along with the formation of multiple-layered structures.  shows the formation of quasi-spherical structures and  shows the formation of oval structures with multiple-layered constructions formed in the side and central regions on the p-GaAs wafers, respectively. The type of dopant in the GaAs wafers significantly affects the reducing ability of Ag ions, and thus the formation of nuclei and the growth of Ag structures. Thus, the dopant dependence can provide a possible route to control the morphology of Ag structures.","Deposited Ag atoms form different structures with different morphologies when the GaAs substrate reacts with AgNOsolutions of various pH values. Oxides of GaAs can be dissolved in either acidic or basic media through the reactions:\n\nGaO+6H\u21922Ga+3HO and AsO+3HO\u21922HAsO+2H\n\nGaO+3HO\u21922Ga+6OH and AsO+2OH\u21922AsO+HO\n","When the oxides formed from GaAs are absent from the GaAs wafers during the reactions, the growth process of the Ag structures is affected in various aspects, including the nucleation steps, growth steps, and charge-transfer channels between GaAs and Ag. For instance, the GaAs substrates constantly expose their fresh pure GaAs lattices to the Ag ions, leading to forming nuclei progressively, when the oxides are dissolved simultaneously during the reactions.  shows an SEM image of Ag structures that are formed on an n-GaAs (100) wafer through reaction with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M AgNOand 1% (v\/v) hydrofluoric acid for 5 minutes. The resulting Ag structures exhibit high crystallinity and apparent crystalline facets that are different from the previously shown structures formed with a substantially pure AgNOsolution with a pH value of about 7. The GaAs wafer is fully covered with Ag crystals with multiple modal sizes and irregular shapes. The wide size distribution indicates that the growth of Ag crystals in the reactions between acidic AgNOsolutions and GaAs wafers is dominated by multiple steps of nucleation and growth. The average sizes of the Ag crystals also increases with reaction time. Due to the simultaneous dissolution of oxide layers by hydrofluoric acid, silver ions in the acidic AgNOsolutions always contact fresh GaAs lattices and directly react with GaAs, which results in more and more particles being formed over increasing reaction time. This mechanism is essentially different from the hole-injection process involved in the reaction between substantially pure AgNOsolutions and GaAs wafers, where the as-grown oxide layers prevent the direct contact and reaction between Ag ions and GaAs lattices. These differences indicate that the formation of the insoluble thin oxide (i.e., GaOand AsO) layers on the GaAs substrate plays a significant role in determining the generation of anisotropic Ag nanoplates that stand out of the surface plane of the GaAs substrate.","Ag nanoplates were grown on a semiconductor substrate by delivering a droplet (\u02dc20 \u03bcL) of AgNOsolution to the central area of the flat surfaces of cleaned GaAs substrates with a micropipettor through the aforementioned process. The substrates were covered with a black cap to eliminate the effect of light illumination and evaporation of water during reaction. The nanoplates were then coated with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 1-hexadecanethiol (HDT) molecules in order to decrease the surface energy of the Ag. The SAMs were formed by soaking the samples in a 5 mmol\/L ethanolic solution of 1-hexadecanethiol for 1 hour followed by rinsing with ethanol and drying with a gentle Nflow. The resulting thiol-modified samples were used for hydrophobic measurements.","Unexpectedly, wettability of the resulting Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surfaces can be tuned between the Wenzel wetting state, the Cassie nonwetting state, and the Cassie impregnating wetting state by controlling the dimensions and nanoscale surface roughness of the individual nanoplates. The necessary tuning can be achieved by choosing appropriate reaction conditions as described, for example, in Examples 1-12.","As described with respect to the above experiments, the majority of the Ag plates protrude from the surface of the substrate. The orientation of the Ag nanoplate thus increases the macroscopic roughness of the substrates. In other words, the micrometer scale roughness of the substrate is increased by the protruding Ag nanoplates. As described above, the AgNOconcentration decreases for longer growth times (greater than about 3 minutes), resulting in the formation of nanograins on the basal surfaces of the nanoplates. Decoration of the nanoplates with nanograins increases the microscopic roughness on the nanometer scale of individual Ag nanoplates. Further, the macroscopic roughness of the substrate also increases with increasing surface coverage of the substrate with the nanoplates as well as the sizes of the Ag nanoplates. Surface coverage generally increases with growth time as shown in  for the samples obtained through reacting n-GaAs wafers with a 2 M AgNOsolution for varying times. The surface coverage is estimated by integrating the bright areas (corresponding to the Ag nanoplates) of an SEM image and calculating integrated bright area as a percentage of the whole area of the SEM image.  shows that the size of Ag nanoplates increases rapidly in the early stages (i.e., growth times less than about 3 minutes), resulting in a fast increase in the surface coverage. At growth times longer than 3 minutes, the surface coverage only slightly increases with growth time because further reaction only mildly increases the sizes of the nanoplates. However, the microscopic roughness of individual nanoplates increases significantly with longer growth times.","All the measurements of contact angles and sliding angles were carried out on a First Ten \u212bngstroms system (Portmouth, Va.). In a typical measurement, a drop (about 4 mg) of deionized water was delivered on an Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite substrate horizontally sitting on a stage by slowly pushing the plug of a syringe located close to the top surface of the substrate. After the water droplet stabilized on the composite surface, a photograph was taken by the camera and the contact angles were determined by drawing the tangent of the water\/air interface and the line that represents the nominal surface of the composite substrate. The sliding angle was measured by slowly tilting the substrate to a certain angle at which the water droplet started to slide off the composite surface.","The Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surfaces exhibit interesting wetting behavior after modification with SAMs of HDT molecules.  plots the apparent static contact angles (contact angle) and sliding angles as a function of surface coverage of the Ag nanoplates as shown in . Here, the sliding angle is defined as the critical angle at which a water droplet with a mass of about 4 mg begins to slide down an inclined surface.  shows that the samples formed at longer growth time (greater surface coverage) are more hydrophobic than the samples formed at shorter time. The contact angle increases dramatically from about 105\u00b0 to about 150\u00b0 when the surface coverage increases from about 16% to about 30% (i.e., the growth time increases from about 15 seconds to about 60 seconds). This configuration is designated as Zone I in .","The contact angle of a water droplet on the substrate formed at 15 seconds is close to that of a water droplet on a flat GaAs wafer or a flat Ag film modified with SAMs of HDT molecules. This similarity indicates that the wettability of Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surfaces with low surface coverage, less than about 15%, is dominated by the GaAs surfaces because the roughness created by deposition of the small Ag nanoplates is negligible. As the surface coverage increases in the range of about 30% to about 60%, the macroscopic roughness significantly increases due to the increased size of the Ag nanoplates, resulting in an increase in the contact angle as expected from the Wenzel equation. The Wenzel equation is defined as cos(\u03b8*)=r\u00d7cos (\u03b8), where \u03b8* is the apparent static contact angle; \u03b8 represents the Young's contact angle of SAMs of HDT molecules on a flat surface; and r is the surface roughness, which is defined as the ratio of the actual surface area of the solid to its planar projection. The value of \u03b8 is determined to be 102.6\u00b0. This trend stops at a contact angle of about 152\u00b0 when the surface coverage is in the range of about 30% to about 60%. This configuration is designated as Zone II in . In both Zone I and Zone II, the water droplets do not detach from the substrates even when the substrates are turned upside down. As the sliding angle for the measurements in Zone I and Zone II is ill-defined, a sliding angle of 180\u00b0 is assigned for convenient comparison with measurements in Zone III.","In contrast, water droplets on the substrates with surface coverage greater than about 60% can easily slide down the surfaces with sliding angles less than about 30\u00b0 while the static contact angles only increase by several degrees. This configuration is designated as Zone III in . When the growth times are longer than 3 minutes, the basal surfaces of individual Ag nanoplates become rough, while the sizes of the nanoplates and the surface coverage both increase by very small percentages. Therefore, the ease with which water droplets slide down the surfaces depends on the microscopic roughness of the individual nanoplates. The Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surfaces with both macroscopic (on the micrometer and\/or submicrometer scale) and microscopic (on the nanometer scale) roughness are an analog of the surfaces of lotus leaves, on which water droplets usually exhibit high contact angles and low sliding angles.","Substrates with Ag nanoplates with highly rough surfaces were grown through reaction with AgNOsolution with a low concentration of 0.1 M, as described above. The surface coverage in relation to reaction time for the reaction with a solution of 0.1 M AgNOis presented in . The hydrophobic properties of the GaAs substrates covered with the rough Ag nanoplates, is shown in , plotting the dependence of the contact angle and sliding angle of water droplets on surface coverage as defined in . The use of surface coverage of Ag nanoplates, rather than growth time, allows for direct comparison of the effects of varying the dimensions and densities of different Ag nanoplates on the hydrophobicity because reactions with AgNOsolutions having different concentrations occur on different time scales.","The results depicted in  are similar to those of , the contact angles of water droplets on the substrates covered with rough Ag nanoplates increase continuously up to about 160\u00b0 with the increase in surface coverage from 0 to about 30%, designated as Zone I. The water droplets do not detach from the substrates even when the substrates are turned upside down. Once the surface coverage is greater than a critical value, about 30%, the water droplets can easily slide off the substrates with very small sliding angles of less than about 2\u00b0, while the contact angles of the water droplets remain essentially constant at about 164\u00b0 regardless of the surface coverage, designated as Zone III. The absence of a transition state with a high contact angle and a high sliding angle analogous to Zone II of  indicates that the microscopic roughness of individual Ag nanoplates significantly lowers the adhesion between water droplets and the as-fabricated substrates when the sizes of the Ag nanoplates are sufficiently large.","A comparison of the results shown in  shows that three different hydrophobic states can be achieved by controlling the growth time and the concentration of AgNOsolution during the preparation of the Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surfaces. Namely, Zone I comprises a relatively low contact angle (100\u00b0-150\u00b0) and high adhesion between water droplets and substrates; Zone II comprises a high contact angle (greater than 150\u00b0) and high adhesion; Zone III comprises a high contact angle (greater than 150\u00b0) and low adhesion (small sliding angle).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0135"},"figref":["FIGS. 27A-27D","FIGS. 27A and 27B","FIG. 26B"]},"The contact angles computed by Wenzel equation deviate dramatically from the measured values for surface coverage higher than 30%. This discrepancy indicates that the hydrophobic behaviors in Zone II and Zone III do not obey the Wenzel equation. Instead, they are dominated by the Cassie composite state, i.e., some air pockets are trapped underneath water droplets as illustrated in . Sitting on air pockets leads to water droplets on the surface exhibiting superhydrophobicity with apparent contact angles higher than 150\u00b0 according to the Cassie Baxter equation:\n\ncos(\u03b8*)=\u22121+\u03c6\u00d7[1+cos(\u03b8)]\n","where the fraction of solid in contact with liquid, \u03c6, can be estimated as about 15% for the water droplets in Zone II for the substrates covered with smooth Ag nanoplates by substituting \u03b8* and \u03b8 with 152\u00b0 and 102.6\u00b0 (see above), respectively. That this number is less than unity indicates that the surfaces of only some nanoplates are fully wetted by water when the sizes of the nanoplates are larger than a critical value (for example, about 290 nm for the samples of ) and the surface coverage is higher than about 30%.  shows a schematic drawing of a so-called Cassie impregnating wetting state, which usually generates high contact angles and strong adhesion as reflected by the measurements in Zone II. The pinning of water droplets in some of the grooves formed between large flat Ag nanoplates ensures that the droplets remain on the Ag nanoplate\/GaAs surface even when the substrate is tilted or inverted.","When the basal surfaces of the large Ag nanoplates become rough, the Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surfaces have roughness at both macroscopic and microscopic levels and behave in a similar way to lotus leaves, on which water droplets exhibits very high contact angles and very small sliding angles. This superhydrophobic behavior is a special Cassie state, i.e., the Cassie nonwetting state, which is consistent with the measurements in Zone III shown in .  illustrates the microscopic contact between water droplets and the composite surface, which differs from the Cassie impregnating wetting state of . In this case, substantially no water penetrates into the gaps between the rough Ag nanoplates so that the adhesion is too small to retain water droplets when the substrate is tilted.","Additionally, the diversity of hydrophobic states can also be understood when the Gibbs energy curve for a water droplet on a Ag nanoplate\/GaAs composite surface is characterized by multiple minima, as shown in . The three local minima correspond to the three wetting states observed in this work, i.e., Wenzel wetting state for Zone I, Cassie impregnating wetting state for Zone II, and Cassie nonwetting state for Zone III as illustrated in . For a particular GaAs substrate covered with Ag nanoplates, a water droplet on the substrate can spontaneously minimizes its Gibbs energy to one of the three local minima, resulting in a stable apparent contact angle. The measured contact angles for the samples shown in the present embodiment are approximated in the chart shown in . When the surface coverage of Ag nanoplates is less than 30%, the thin nanoplates (thickness of about 22 nm for flat nanoplates and thickness of about 50 nm for rough nanoplates) have small sizes (for example, less than 290 nm for the flat plates). Water can easily penetrate into the gaps between nanoplates and completely wet both the surfaces of the Ag nanoplates and the GaAs substrates regardless of the roughness of individual nanoplates, resulting in the Wenzel wetting state. When the sizes of the Ag nanoplates are sufficiently large, i.e., the surface coverage is greater than 30%, air in some of the grooves formed between the Ag nanoplates can be trapped underneath water droplets, leading to superhydrophobicity with apparent contact angles greater than 150\u00b0. For the samples with high surface coverage, both Cassie impregnating wetting state and Cassie nonwetting state are possible, depending on the nanoscale surface roughness of individual nanoplates. Water droplets on the samples with flat Ag nanoplates exhibit the Cassie impregnating wetting state, while water droplets on the samples with rough Ag nanoplates follow the behavior of the Cassie nonwetting state.","Therefore, the parameters of the Ag nanoplates required to fabricate substrates with the desired hydrophobic behavior can be conveniently determined from the chart in . By carefully controlling the growth conditions, for example, the growth time and the concentration of AgNOsolution, Ag nanoplates with predetermined parameters can be efficiently grown. Additionally, high aspect ratios of the Ag nanoplates are also important to achieve Cassie composite states. For example, thicker Ag nanoplates can be grown by reacting with AgNOsolutions with concentration of about 8 mol\/L. This reaction generates Ag nanoplates with aspect ratios less than 3, although surface coverage can be up to almost 100%. The contact angles of water droplets on these substrates are always less than about 140\u00b0. Conversely, surfaces formed with assemblies of low aspect ratio Ag nanoplates do not readily exhibit superhydrophobicity.","Ag nanoplates were grown on a p-GaAs substrates by using an illumination source to increase the electron concentration on the surface of the substrate. A red laser beam with wavelength of about 650 nm (i.e., 1.9 eV) was used to increase the density of surface electrons of the p-GaAs substrates (with bandgap of 1.42 eV) and to trigger the growth of Ag nanoplates on the illuminated surfaces.  shows a schematic of the experimental strategy. In a typical synthesis, a droplet (about 100 \u03bcL) of aqueous solution of AgNOwith concentration of 2 M is transferred to the surface of a p-type GaAs substrate (doped with Zn in concentration of about 1\u00d710cm). The GaAs substrate is cleaned by immersing in a 2% hydrofluoric acid solution for 5 minutes to remove the native oxide layer. The red laser is then turned on to illuminate a partial reaction area. The illumination induces charge separation in the GaAs lattice to pump electrons to the conduction band in the bright area, resulting in a shift of the band energy levels due to photovoltage, V (). The accumulated electrons in the conduction band flow to the illuminated surface because of the downward bending of energy bands of p-GaAs in the space charge region. The leftover holes in the valance band flow to the dark region through bulk GaAs lattice due to the difference in the band energies of different regions. The accumulated surface electrons in the illuminated surface area react with Ag ions to generate Ag nuclei and further grow them into large particles through either the hole injection process or the reducing reaction with more surface electrons continuously supplied by photoillumination. Ag ions, on the other hand, are difficult to be reduced to Ag atoms for the formation of Ag nanoparticles in the dark regions due to absence of surface electrons.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIGS. 29A-29D","FIG. 28A","FIG. 29A","FIG. 29A","FIG. 29B"],"sub":"3 "},"High-magnification images, , reveal that the Ag particles densely deposited in the illuminated area have plate-like geometries and thicknesses ranging from about 30 nm to about 60 nm and sizes (i.e., edge lengths) up to about 500 nm. The plate geometries of the Ag particles on the p-GaAs substrate are similar to that of the Ag structures grown on n-GaAs wafers (with dopant (Si) concentration of about 1\u00d710cm) through reaction with a 1 M AgNOsolution in a dark environment, as shown in . However, the density and thickness of the Ag nanoplates on the p-GaAs substrate are much higher than those grown on n-GaAs wafers. The comparison confirms the importance of surface electrons for the formation of Ag nuclei, which are crucial to the growth of Ag nanoplates. The higher density of Ag nanoplates shown in  implies that the laser beam used in the experiment is strong enough to generate a higher concentration of surface electrons over the illuminated surface area of the p-GaAs wafer than that of n-GaAs wafers. In contrast, only a sub-monolayer of particles with sizes less than 20 nm are deposited in the dark surface areas, . The reluctance of these particles to grow into large nanoplates indicates the Ag clusters formed in the dark regions on the p-GaAs substrates may be lack of appropriate crystalline structures to support growth into nanoplates.","The laser illumination can be removed after the nuclei are formed. Further growth of the nuclei, which are formed under illumination under dark environment leads to the formation of Ag nanoplates similar to those grown under continuous illumination. For instance,  shows an SEM image of Ag nanoplates grown on a p-GaAs substrate after reaction with a 2 M AgNOsolution under laser illumination of 15 seconds followed by 105 seconds continuous reaction under dark environment. The density, dimensions, and morphologies of the Ag nanoplates shown in  are similar to those grown through 120 seconds continuous reaction under constant laser illumination, as shown in . The independence of laser illumination at the growth step after the nuclei are generated confirms that the hole injection process is the dominative driving force to grow the Ag nuclei into Ag nanoplates, which is consistent with the growth mechanism illustrated in . This invented approach can grow metal nanoplates on p-type semiconductor substrates with high quality as those grown on n-type semiconductor substrates and the short-time laser illumination can significantly reduce the energy cost for supporting laser illumination.","The sizes and thicknesses of the Ag nanoplates grown on p-GaAs substrates can be tuned by controlling the reaction time.  and C compare the Ag nanoplates formed at different reaction times. The Figures show that the sizes of the nanoplates gradually increase at short reaction times (i.e., less than 60 seconds). When the reaction times are longer than 60 seconds, the adjacent nanoplates start to polymerize and fuse into thicker nanoplates,  and . In particular, the sample shown in  shows the multiple-layered structures of the thick nanoplates, confirming the polymerization and fusion process.","As indicated by the gradual decrease in density of Ag nanoplates at the interface of the illuminated\/dark region as shown in , the power density of the laser illumination affects the growth of the Ag nanoplates.  and C compare the Ag nanostructures grown on p-GaAs substrates after the reactions with 2 M AgNOfor 2 minutes under laser illumination of different power density. The results indicate that Ag nanoplates with similar density and dimensions can be synthesized regardless of the power density of laser illumination when the power density is higher than 16 mW\/cm, , A and B. When the power density is low enough, e.g., less than about 15 mW\/cm, almost no Ag nanoplates can be grown, .","In addition to laser illumination, white light from fluorescent bulbs can also facilitate the growth of Ag nanoplates on p-GaAs substrates.

Instead, only small nanocrystals of Au are deposited with sizes less than 20 nm on GaAs substrates (see ). Systemic studies reveal that the inter-diffusion coefficient between Au and GaAs is much higher than that between Ag and GaAs. The fast inter-diffusion is beneficial to the progressive nucleation process of Au nanocrystals during the reactions between Au precursors (e.g., NaAuCl) and GaAs, making it difficult to anisotropically grow the Au nanocrystals into nanoplates. On the other hand, the as-synthesized Ag nanoplates on GaAs substrate (see ) can be chemically converted into Au\/Ag alloy ones to significantly enhance their stability in applications, such as catalysis. The success of compositional conversion is determined by the unique configuration of the Ag nanoplates\/GaAs composite samples, i.e., thin layers of oxides (derived from the oxidation of GaAs) cover the surfaces of the GaAs substrates (as shown in the process flow diagram of ). In a typical sample, the oxide layer can prevent the inter-diffusion process between Au and GaAs, eliminating the nucleation and growth of new Au nanocrystals on the GaAs substrate, when the Ag nanoplates\/GaAs sample is in contact with the Au precursor (i.e., aqueous NaAuClsolution).

The compositional change from pure Ag to Au\/Ag alloy significantly enhances the chemical stability of the nanoplates when they are used in applications such as catalysis. For example, freshly synthesized Ag nanoplates on GaAs substrates exhibit good catalytic capability to accelerate the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) with NaBH. The derived Au\/Ag alloy nanoplates show the similar catalytic performance (). The absorption peak at 400 nm in  (corresponding to the characteristic feature of 4-NP) constantly decreases and the peak at 295 nm increases with reaction time, indicating the reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The reduction does not occur without assistance of the metal nanoplates under the same reaction conditions. Since these nanoplates are fixed on the substrates, they can be easily recovered to catalyze additional reactions. As shown in , both freshly prepared Ag nanoplates and Au\/Ag alloy nanoplates can catalyze the reduction of 4-NP for many successive cycles with similar conversion yield near 100%. After the samples are stored in ambient environment for 1 month, the pure Ag nanoplates essentially lose catalytic capability due to the oxidation to silver oxide. In contrast, the Au\/Ag alloy nanoplates with high concentration of Au (e.g., \u02dc75% Au and \u02dc25% Ag as shown in ) can still efficiently catalyze the reduction of 4-NP although the conversion yield slightly decreases by several percent. This obvious difference indicates that converting the Ag nanoplates into Au\/Ag alloy ones significantly increases their resistance towards oxidation in ambient environment. It is found that the nanoplates made of Au\/Ag alloys with Au concentrations higher than \u02dc60% could withstand oxidation in air to remain their catalytic capability.","In conclusion, Ag nanoplates grown on GaAs substrates have been successfully converted into chemically stable nanoplates made of Au\/Ag alloys. These alloy nanoplates retain the out-of-substrate orientations to expose their surfaces at the most to surrounding solutions for efficient catalysis. This synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare Pd\/Ag and Pt\/Ag alloy nanoplates by using appropriate precursors (e.g., NaPtClfor Pt\/Agand NaPdClfor Pd\/Ag) (see t ). The alloy nanoplates derived from the high-quality Ag nanoplates can serve as reusable catalysts with enhanced stability and efficiency.","Nanostructures made of precious metals have very interesting optical properties because of their strong SPR. For example, the Ag nanoplates exhibit strong extinction peaks which are tunable from the visible to the near infrared (NIR) regime by controlling their dimensions. Ag nanostructures are usually a class of promising substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), in particular, when they have sharp edges and\/or rough surfaces. Clusters of several Ag nanoplates are even better for SERS because strong coupling between individual nanoplates can produce more \u2018hot spots\u2019 for enhancing Raman scattering of molecules adjacent to their surfaces.  shows an SEM image of Ag nanoplates grown on an n-GaAs substrate coated with a patterned resist-layer.

Each cluster includes 3-54 Ag nanoplates, which touch each other to create more \u201chot spots\u201d for SERS.  compares the Raman spectra (taken from different clusters of Ag nanoplates) of thiophenol molecules self-assembled on the surfaces of the Ag nanoplates shown in . The spectral peaks are consistent with the fingerprint bands of thiophenol molecules. Variation of Raman intensity recorded from different spots is less than 20%, indicating good uniformity of the Ag nanoplates over the substrate. By integrating the area of the peak at 1000 cmand collecting spectra over the substrate (with stage moving step of 0.4 \u03bcm), a Raman mapping is obtained as shown in . The blowup image clearly shows a good match between the Raman image and the optical image (inset image). Spots with bright contrast in the optical image are covered with the Ag nanoplates, resulting in stronger Raman signals (darker gray). Areas with dark contrast in the optical image is absence of Ag nanoplates, leading to weak (or essentially no) Raman signals (dark). In addition, thiophenol molecules can also spontaneously form self-assembled monolayers on the surfaces of clean GaAs substrate when the samples are dipped into an ethanol solution of thiophenol at room temperature. Measurements at the same condition used for  do not show observable signals for thiophenol molecules on GaAs, further confirming the enhancement effect of the Ag nanoplates.","The foregoing description of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
