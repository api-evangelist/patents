{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates in general to remote controls for media devices, and more particularly to biometric user authentication using a remote control of a media device.","Communications systems operators provide guides to help provide the video channels and all the programs that come with them, including linear and on-demand programs. Metadata is associated with the programs including the name of the show, actors, start time, end time, ratings, etc. Based on this metadata, parental control may be set up to prevent the viewing of any scenes of programming of a predetermined rating, e.g., PG-13 and above because of adult content. Thus, when a channel is tuned to a program that is not below the predetermined rating, a screen is presented for entering a pin in order to watch access the program.","More often than not, authentication uses a four digit pin to enable access to content. Two forms of pin have been used. A first form of pin is for principal control and the other form of pin is for purchases. Typically, an adult in the house that theoretically has set the pin. Usually this person is the person that knows the pin. Accordingly, the person that set the pin can enter it and thereby watch programs that normally would be filtered to prevent children from watching such programs.","This procedure also applies to purchasing transactions. However, purchasing transactions may not correlate to the filtering requirements associated with program control ratings. For example, subscribers may not want their child to purchase a Disney on-demand movie. The subscriber may approve of the content, but not want such purchases to be enabled. Thus, a separate pin may be used for purchasing transactions.","One problem with such authentication methods, is the user often forgets one or both of the pins. Another problem is that someone else sets it up and the person that is not authorized may want to watch a program or purchase a video-on-demand program. For example, the pins may be set by the smart teenager in the house and the parent does not realize this until later. To have the pins reset, the parent has to contact the communications system operator to request the pin be reset. This is inconvenient to the customer and lowers customer satisfaction.","It can be seen then that there is a need for providing individualized user authentication using a media device remote control.","To overcome the limitations described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, embodiments for biometric user authentication using a media device remote control.","The above-described problems are solved by providing individualized authentication for each user associated with a particular subscriber.","An embodiment includes a remote control device for providing individualized access control. The remote control device includes an interface for accepting input from a user and forwarding a signal corresponding the to the input from the user to a conditional access device, a biometric scanner, coupled to the remote device, for reading a biometric characteristic of a user and a processor, coupled to the interface, for generating a signal associated with the reading of the biometric characteristic of the user that is transmitted to the conditional access device for analysis to determine a function corresponding to the input form the user to execute.","In another embodiment, a method for providing individualized access control for a user is disclosed. The system includes receiving, from a user of a remote control device, an input command via a user input interface of the remote control device, gathering biometric characteristics of the user using a biometric data retrieval module on the remote control device, providing the input command and the biometric characteristic of the user from the remote control device to a conditional access device, analyzing the biometric characteristic of the user with reference to biometric characteristics stored in memory at the conditional access device, determining whether to authenticate the user based on the analysis of the biometric characteristics of the user and executing, by the conditional access device, a process in accordance with the input data received from the remote control device when the user of the remote control device is authenticated.","A computer readable medium, including executable instructions which, when executed by a processor, provides individualized access control for a user, is disclosed. The computer readable medium includes instructions executable by the processor to receive, from a user of a remote control device, an input command via a user input interface of the remote control device, gather biometric characteristics of the user using a biometric data retrieval module on the remote control device, provide the input command and the biometric characteristic of the user from the remote control device to a conditional access device, analyze the biometric characteristic of the user with reference to biometric characteristics stored in memory at the conditional access device, determine whether to authenticate the user based on the analysis of the biometric characteristics of the user and executing, by the conditional access device, a process in accordance with the input data received from the remote control device when the user of the remote control device is authenticated.","These and various other advantages and features of novelty are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the disclosed embodiments, the advantages, and the objects obtained, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of the disclosed embodiments.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing biometric user authentication using a media device remote control. By using a remote control of a media device with a biometric input module, individualized authentication for each user associated with a particular subscriber may be provided. Each user may then be able to enjoy a personalized experience using individual associations and presentation characteristics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","115","120","115","110","115","105","140"]},"According to embodiments of the present invention, the CATV system  is in the form of a distributed client-server computing system for providing video and data flow across the HFC network  between server-side services providers (e.g., cable television\/services providers) via a server-side head end  and a client-side customer via a client-side set-top box (STB)  functionally connected to a customer receiving device, such as the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, modem CATV systems  may provide a variety of services across the HFC network  including traditional digital and analog video programming, telephone services, high speed Internet access, video-on-demand, and information services.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The remote control device  may include a biometric input module . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB . According to one embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  of the server-side application server and the middleware layer  of the client-side STB  format data passed between the client side and server side according to the Extensible Markup Language (XML).","The set-top box  passes digital and analog video and data signaling to the television  via a one-way communication transport . The STB  may receive video and data from the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  through a video\/data downlink and data via a data downlink. The STB  may transmit data from the client side of the CATV system  to the server side of the CATV system  via the HFC network  via one data uplink. The video\/data downlink is an \u201cin band\u201d downlink that allows for digital and analog video and data signaling from the server side of the CATV system  through the HFC network  to the set-top box  for use by the STB  and for distribution to the television set . As is understood by those skilled in the art, the \u201cin band\u201d signaling space operates at a frequency between 54 and 860 megahertz. The signaling space between 54 and 860 megahertz is generally divided into 6 megahertz channels in which may be transmitted a single analog signal or a greater number (e.g., up to ten) digital signals.","The data downlink and the data uplink, illustrated in , between the HFC network  and the set-top box  comprise \u201cout of band\u201d data links. As is understand by those skilled in the art, the \u201cout of band\u201d frequency range generally lies between zero and 54 megahertz. According to embodiments of the present invention, data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  is typically passed through the \u201cout of band\u201d data links. Alternatively, an \u201cin band\u201d data carousel may be positioned in an \u201cin band\u201d channel into which a data feed may be processed from the server-side application server  through the HFC network  to the client-side STB . Operation of data transport between components of the CATV system , described with reference to , is well known to those skilled in the art.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network . As described above with reference to the set-top box , the application server  includes a middleware layer  for processing and preparing data from the head end of the CATV system  for receipt and use by the client-side set-top box . For example, the application server  via the middleware layer  may obtain data from third-party services  via the Internet  for transmitting to a customer through the HFC network  and the set-top box . For example, a weather report from a third-party weather service may be downloaded by the application server via the Internet . When the application server  receives the downloaded weather report, the middleware layer  may be utilized to format the weather report for receipt and use by the set-top box .","According to one embodiment of the present invention, data obtained and managed by the middleware layer  of the application server  is formatted according to the Extensible Markup Language and is passed to the set-top box  through the HFC network  where the XML-formatted data may be utilized by a client application  in concert with the middleware layer , as described above. As should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of third-party services data, including news data, weather data, sports data and other information content may be obtained by the application server  via distributed computing environments such as the Internet  for provision to customers via the HFC network  and the set-top box .","According to embodiments of the present invention, the application server  obtains customer support services data, including billing data, information on customer work order status, answers to frequently asked questions, services provider contact information, and the like from data services  for provision to the customer via an interactive television session. As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer.","A billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. According to embodiments of the present invention, the billing system  may also include billing data for services and products subscribed to by the customer for bill processing billing presentment and payment receipt.","A customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database  may also include information on pending work orders for services or products ordered by the customer. The customer information database  may also include general customer information such as answers to frequently asked customer questions and contact information for various service provider offices\/departments. As should be understood, this information may be stored in a variety of disparate databases operated by the cable services provider.","An electronic mail system  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information and electronic mail usage data. An authentication system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services. As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments of the present invention, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . According to embodiments of the present invention, when the application server  requires customer services data from one or more of the data services , the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any required data for a requesting customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer data. The customer data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","210","210","220","230","240","200","240","220","250","210"]},"Accordingly, the remote control device  forwards a signal corresponding to the input from the user to a conditional access device. The processor  generates a signal associated with the reading of the biometric characteristic of the user via the biometric characteristic input device . This signal is transmitted to the conditional access device for analysis to determine whether to execute a function corresponding to the input provided by the user through the use of the user input interface .","Memory  may include persistent memory for storing biometric characteristic of a plurality of users of the remote control device .

The authentication module  at the conditional access device  stores the data in memory . The type of biometric characteristic used may be particular for the particular conditional access device . However, there may be other conditional access devices  in the home. Each time the user interfaces with a conditional access device , the biometric characteristic read by biometric data retrieval module  of the remote control device  has to be analyzed with reference to biometric characteristics stored in memory  at that conditional access device .","The conditional access device  may store biometric characteristics for multiple users and authenticate each user using the biometric characteristics stored in memory . Thus, each user can be granted different viewing privileges and purchasing privileges. The individual identification may also be used for other functions, such as accessing the user's score for video games, the user's viewing history, etc. Further, favorite channels could be setup for each user and associated with the stored biometric characteristic of that user. In this manner, channels may be filtered from the Interactive Program Guide (\u201cIPG\u201d) shown to the user to provide a customized IPG. Other settings may be tied to different biometric readings.","Some users may prefer using a biometric reading by the biometric data retrieval module , while others prefer using a secured input pin code. For the users that prefer using a pin code, the biometric data retrieval module  may be used to generate a unique four digit pin code for that user. The digital signature associated with the biometric characteristic may be forwarded to the conditional access device . The digital signature may also be stored in the memory (not shown) implemented in the remote control device .
