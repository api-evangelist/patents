When the blending quantity increases, the surface of the endless belt can be easily roughened, whereby the cleaning performance is deteriorated or the flexibility resistance is lowered.","On the contrary, in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, by employing the polyamide layer including the semi-aromatic polyamide resin and the carbon black as the polyamide resin layer constituting the endless belt, the lowering in cleaning performance is suppressed.","The reasons are uncertain, but are considered to be the following.","The semi-aromatic polyamide resin is a material satisfying mechanical characteristics as a tubular member, which is higher in compressive elastic modulus than a full-aliphatic polyamide resin and is more excellent in the flexibility necessary for a tubular member than a full-aromatic polyamide resin.","The water absorption of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is considered to depend on the amino group concentration in a molecule. That is, when the amino group concentration of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is excessively high, it is considered that the compressive elastic modulus is easily lowered due to the absorption of water.","On the other hand, the compressive elastic modulus of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is considered to correspond to the aromatic ring concentration in a molecule. That is, when the aromatic ring concentration in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is excessively low, it is considered that the mechanical strength is lowered and the compressive elastic modulus is easily lowered. It is also considered that the surface hardness is easily lowered.","On the contrary, when the alkyl carbon number in the aliphatic diamine compound from which the repeating unit structure of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is derived is set to be 9 or more, it is considered that the amide group concentration in a molecule of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is suppressed and the lowering of the compressive elastic modulus due to, the absorption of water based on the amide group concentration is suppressed.","On the other hand, when the alkyl carbon number in the aliphatic diamine compound from which the repeating unit structure of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is derived is set to be equal to or smaller than 13, it is considered that the lowering of the aromatic ring concentration in a molecule of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is suppressed and the lowering of the compressive elastic modulus based on the aromatic ring concentration is suppressed.","As described above, in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, it is considered that the lowering of the compressive elastic modulus is suppressed and the lowering of the cleaning performance is suppressed.","Particularly, in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, for example, it is considered that the lowering in compressive elastic modulus due to an environmental change (change in the low-humidity environment and the high-humidity environment) is suppressed and the lowering in cleaning performance is suppressed. It is considered that the endless belt has appropriate rigidity and has a mechanical characteristic that the cracking or breaking of an end portion due to the repeated deformation is suppressed and thus the lowering in cleaning performance is suppressed.","When the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment is employed as an endless belt for an image forming apparatus, for example, the embedding of attachments such as external additives of a toner in the endless belt for an image forming apparatus is suppressed and thus the lowering in cleaning performance is suppressed, whereby an image forming apparatus is embodied in which image defects due to the cleaning failure of the endless belt by repeated use thereof is suppressed.","In the tubular member  according to this exemplary embodiment, the polyamide resin layer preferably includes carbon black and a semi-aromatic polyamide resin having at least a repeating unit structure derived from the aromatic dicarboxylic compound and the aliphatic diamine compound with the alkyl carbon number in the range of from 9 to 12.","That is, the alkyl carbon number of the aliphatic diamine compound in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is preferably in the range of from 9 to 12.","Here, in order to achieve the maintainability of electric resistance (specifically, the maintainability of electric resistance due to the repeated use of the belt and the maintainability of electric resistance (that is, the stability in electric resistance) due to a change in applied voltage or an environmental change) in the endless belt having the polyamide resin layer including the polyamide resin and the carbon black, a technique of controlling the crystallization by mixing a crystalline polyamide resin and an amorphous polyamide resin (hereinafter, referred to as \u201ctechnique 1\u201d), a technique of stabilizing the dispersibility of carbon black by suppressing the resin pyrolysis in melting and kneading by blending a heat-resistant agent (hereinafter, referred to as \u201ctechnique 2\u201d), and a technique of stabilizing the electric resistance by the parallel use of an electrolyte compound and carbon black (hereinafter, referred to as \u201ctechnique 3\u201d) have been known.","However, in technique 1, the layer separation is caused in the crystalline polyamide resin and the amorphous polyamide resin and thus the electric resistance varies. In technique 2, the electric resistance varies due to the heat-resistant agent remaining in the endless belt after the molding. In technique 3, the electric resistance varies due to the environmental change based on the discharge degradation of the electrolyte compound.","On the contrary, the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, since the polyamide layer including carbon black and the semi-aromatic polyamide resin having at least a repeating unit structure derived from the aromatic dicarboxylic compound and the aliphatic diamine compound with the alkyl carbon number in the range of from 9 to 12 is employed as the polyamide resin layer constituting the endless belt, the maintainability in electric resistance is excellent.","The reason is uncertain, but is based on the following.","The polyamide resin layer (the endless belt ) is obtained by kneading the semi-aromatic polyamide resin and the carbon black and molding the resultant resin composition. The polyamide resin is melted at the time of kneading and molding and is then cooled. At the time of cooling, the polyamide resin is crystallized.","When the polyamide resin is crystallized, it is considered that the carbon black can be easily excluded from the resin and the carbon black forms aggregates. As a result, when the carbon black forms aggregates, it is considered that the aggregates form a conductive path.","On the contrary, when a semi-aromatic polyamide resin including the aliphatic diamine compound with the alkyl carbon number in the range of from 9 to 12 is employed as the semi-aromatic polyamide resin, it is considered that the crystallization due to the cooling is suppressed and the exclusion of the carbon black from the resin is suppressed, whereby the formation of aggregates of the carbon black is suppressed. Accordingly, it is considered that conductive points formed by the carbon black are uniformly scattered without forming a conductive path in the resultant polyamide layer (the endless belt ).","On the other hand, it is considered that the semi-aromatic polyamide resin has an appropriate intermolecular cohesive force and thus the dispersibility of the carbon black is improved. Accordingly, it is considered that conductive points formed by the carbon black are uniformly scattered without forming a conductive path in the resultant polyamide layer (the endless belt ).","As a result, in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, by setting the alkyl carbon number of the aliphatic diamine compound in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin to the range of from 9 to 12, it is considered that the conductive points can be easily uniformly scattered and thus the maintainability of electric resistance is excellent.","Specifically, in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, for example, the maintainability of electric resistance due to the repeated use of the belt and the maintainability of electric resistance (that is, the stability in electric resistance) due to the change in applied voltage or the environmental change is achieved.","When the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment is employed as an endless belt for an image forming apparatus, for example, it is possible to provide an image forming apparatus in which image defects due to the change in electric resistance due to repeated use, the change in applied voltage, or the environmental change is suppressed.","In the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, it is preferable that the curve (T-log\u03b7 curve) indicating the relationship between the temperature (T (\u00b0 C.)) and a common logarithm (log\u03b7) of the melt viscosity (\u03b7(Pa\u00b7s)) at a shear rate of 608 (1\/s) in the polyamide resin layer has a slow-sloped region in which a slope (\u0394 log\u03b7\/\u0394T) of equal to or greater than \u22120.010 and equal to or less than 0 (or equal to or greater than about \u22120.010 and equal to or less than about 0) is present in the range of from log200 to log1000, and that the temperature range of the slow-sloped region is equal to or higher than 15\u00b0 C. (hereinafter, the viscosity characteristic may also be referred to as \u201ca specific viscosity characteristic\u201d).","Here, an extrusion molding method is appropriately used to mold a resin composition in a layered structure (a belt shape). In extruding the resin composition by the use of an extrusion molding method, it is preferable that the plasticized resin composition is uniformly extruded in the circumferential direction and the axis direction from die parts of an extruding head with a screw.","Since the extruding screw has a spiral structure, it is considered that it gives certain pulsation to the melted resin composition. Particularly, in a crosshead type, it is considered that since the extruding head changes the flow direction of the resin composition to be perpendicular to the extruding screw, the flow path in the circumferential direction is not uniform and thus the thermal and dynamic histories given to the resin composition varies in the circumferential direction. Even when a mechanism that keeps the temperature in the circumferential direction of the head constant is employed, it is difficult to keep the temperature completely constant with the lapse of time and thus the temperature difference in the circumferential direction occurs in the resin composition, thereby causing a viscosity difference. It is considered that this causes the viscosity difference in the circumferential direction at the die outlet and the viscosity difference in the axis direction (with the lapse of time), whereby the thickness in the circumferential direction and the axis direction is not uniform. When the thickness is not uniform, the resistivity is not also uniform.","Therefore, in order to suppress the non-uniformity in thickness, attention is paid to the fact that the temperature dependence of the viscosity of the resin composition in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment has only to be small in a predetermined temperature range capable of being set in the molding process.","That is, in the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment, when the viscosity characteristic of the resin composition, that is, the polyamide resin layer formed thereof, is set to the above-mentioned specific viscosity characteristic, the region in which the variation in melt viscosity with respect to the temperature of the polyamide resin layer (the resin composition) is suppressed is present in the range corresponding to the variation of the extrusion molding condition, whereby the non-uniformity in thickness and resistivity of the polyamide resin layer is suppressed.","The materials and characteristics of the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment will be described below.","The polyamide resin layer will be first described.","The polyamide resin layer includes a semi-aromatic polyamide resin and carbon black and further includes other additives as needed.","The semi-aromatic polyamide resin will be described.","The semi-aromatic polyamide resin is a semi-aromatic polyamide resin having at least a repeating unit structure derived from an aromatic dicarboxylic compound and an aliphatic diamine compound with the alkyl carbon number in the range of from 9 to 13.","A specific example of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is a polycondensate of an aromatic dicarboxylic compound and an aliphatic diamine compound.","The aromatic dicarboxylic compound is a dicarboxylic compound having an aromatic ring (such as a benzene ring, a naphthalene ring, and a biphenyl ring).","Specific examples of the aromatic dicarboxylic compound includes terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 2,7-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 1,4-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 1,4-phenylene dioxydiacetic acid, 1,3-phenylene dioxydiacetic acid, dibenzoic acid, 4,4\u2032-oxydibenzoic acid, diphenylmethane-4,4-dicarboxylic acid, diphenylsulfone-4,4-dicarboxylic acid, and 4,4-biphenyl carboxylic acid.","Among these examples, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid are preferable in view of the economy and the performance of polyamide, and terephthalic acid is more preferable.","The aliphatic diamine compound is an aliphatic diamine compound with the alkyl carbon number (that is, the carbon number) in the range of from 9 to 13 (preferably in the range of from 9 to 12 and more preferably in the range of from 10 to 11).","Here, the alkyl carbon number of the aliphatic diamine compound means the number of carbons in the aliphatic groups (alkyl groups) linked by two amino groups in the aliphatic diamine compound.","In view of the cleaning performance of the endless belt , when the alkyl carbon number of the aliphatic diamine compound is less than 9, the amino group concentration in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is higher and the compressive elastic modulus is lowered due to the absorption of water, whereby the cleaning performance is lowered.","On the other hand, when the alkyl carbon number is greater than 13, the aromatic ring concentration in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is lowered, the compressive elastic modulus is lowered, and the surface hardness along with the rigidity is lowered, whereby the cleaning performance is lowered.","As a result, by setting the alkyl carbon number in the aliphatic diamine compound to the range of from 9 to 13, the lowering in cleaning performance of the endless belt  is suppressed.","In view of the electric resistance of the endless belt , when the alkyl carbon number in the aliphatic diamine compound is less than 9, the carbon black is excluded from the semi-aromatic polyamide resin by the crystallization accompanied with the cooling of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin after the melting of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin and the carbon black forms aggregates to form a conductive path, whereby the electric resistance is lowered.","On the other hand, when the alkyl carbon number is greater than 12, the aromatic ring concentration in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is lowered and the intermolecular cohesive force of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is lowered, whereby the dispersed state of the carbon black is damaged.","As a result, when the alkyl carbon number in the aliphatic diamine compound is set to the above-mentioned range, the maintainability of the electric resistance of the endless belt  is improved.","Specific examples of the aliphatic diamine compound include straight-chain aliphatic alkylene diamines (such as 1,9-nonane diamine, 1,10-decane diamine, 1,11-undecane diamine, and 1,12-dodecane diamine), branched-chain aliphatic alkylene diamines (such as 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexane diamine, 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexane diamine, 2,4-diethyl-1,6-hexane diamine, 2,2-dimethyl-1,7-heptane diamine, 2,3-dimethyl-1,7-heptane diamine, 2,4-dimethyl-1,7-heptane diamine, 2,5-dimethyl-1,7-heptane diamine, 2-methyl-1,8-octane diamine, 3-methyl-1,8-octane diamine, 4-methyl-1,8-octane diamine, 1,3-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 1,4-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 2,4-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 3,4-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 4,5-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 2,2-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 3,3-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, 4,4-dimethyl-1,8-octane diamine, and 5-methyl-1,9-nonane diamine), and cyclic aliphatic alkylene diamines (such as 1-amino-3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl cyclohexane, and 1-amino-3-aminomethyl-2,5,6-trimethyl cyclohexane).","Among these examples, for example, in view of the polyamine performance or the environmental protection, 1,10-decane diamine (decamethylene diamine) and 1,11-undecane diamine can be preferably used and 1,10-decane diamine (decamethylene diamine) can be more preferably used.","An example of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is a polycondensate of the aromatic dicarboxylic compound and the aliphatic diamine compound. Without damaging the function, a product (for example, polyamide-polyether block copolymer) obtained by polymerizing another monomer with the polycondensate may be used.","Here, in the polyamide-polyether block copolymer, an example of the polyether constituting a polyether chain is polyalkylene glycol with a carbon number of alkylene in the range of from 2 to 6 (preferably in the range of from 2 to 4). Specific examples thereof include polytetramethylene glycol (polytetramethylene ether glycol), polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and copolymers thereof (such as polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide block copolymers).","The crystallinity of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is, for example, equal to or less than 30% (or equal to or less than about 30%), preferably equal to or less than 25%, and more preferably equal to or less than 20%.","When the crystallinity is excessively high, the carbon black is excluded from the semi-aromatic polyamide resin due to the crystallization accompanied with the cooling after the melting of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin and thus the carbon black can easily form aggregates.","Accordingly, as the crystallinity becomes lower, it is considered that the formation of aggregates of the carbon black is more suppressed and the carbon black is more densely and uniformly dispersed.","On the other hand, in the semi-aromatic polyamide resin, it is considered that high-strength parts originating from crystalline parts and flexible parts originating from amorphous parts are balanced to guarantee the strength and the toughness. Accordingly, the crystallinity (the lower limit) of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin is preferably equal to or higher than 2% (more preferably equal to or higher than 4%).","The crystallinity is acquired by the X-ray diffraction measurement. Specifically, measurement is made using an X-ray diffractometer (made by Rigaku Corporation), peak resolution analysis is performed on the resultant data using anaylsis software made by Bruker AXS Inc., and the crystallinity is calculated from the crystalline peak area and the amorphous peak area after the peak resolution.","The carbon black will be described below.","Examples of the carbon black include oil furnace black, channel black, and acetylene black.","The primary average particle diameter of carbon black is, for example, equal to or less than 25 nm (or equal to or less than about 25 nm) and preferably equal to or less than 20 nm. By setting the primary average particle diameter to the above-mentioned range, the conductive points based on the carbon black become fine and uniform and the lowering in electric resistance due to the discharge degradation on the surface of the polyamide resin layer (endless belt ) can be easily suppressed.","From the above-mentioned viewpoint, the primary average particle diameter of the carbon black is preferably smaller. However, when the primary average particle diameter is excessively small, the bulk density decreases to make treatment difficult or the surface area increases and the dispersed materials thus exhibit a thixotropy property. Accordingly, the primary average particle diameter of the carbon black is preferably equal to or greater than 10 nm (more preferably equal to or greater than 12 nm).","The primary average particle diameter of carbon black is measured as follows.","First, the resultant polyamide resin layer (the endless belt ) is cut by the use of a microtome to acquire a measuring sample with a thickness of 100 nm and the measuring sample is observed by the use of a TEM (Transmissive Electron Microscope). The diameters of 50 carbon black particles are measured and the average value thereof is defined as the primary average particle diameter.","The content of carbon black is, for example, in the range of from 15 parts by mass to 30 parts by mass (or from about 15 parts by mass to about 30 parts by mass) with respect to 100 parts by mass of the semi-aromatic polyamide resin and preferably in the range of from 20 parts by mass to 25 parts by mass.","When the content of carbon black is set to the above-mentioned range, the conductive points of carbon black in the polyamide resin layer (the endless belt ) are denser and discharge energy applied to the surface of the polyamide resin layer (the endless belt ) can be more easily dispersed, whereby the deterioration thereof is suppressed.","When the content of carbon black is excessively small, it is difficult to densely form the conductive points in the polyamide resin layer (the endless belt ). When the content of carbon black is excessively large, the electric resistance becomes excessively low and the polyamide resin layer (the endless belt ) tends to get brittle.","Other additives will be described below.","Examples of other additives include known additives which are blended into an endless belt of an image forming apparatus, such as an antioxidant used to prevent the thermal degradation of the polyamide resin layer and a surfactant used to improve the fluidity.","The characteristics of the endless belt  according to this exemplary embodiment will be described below.","In the endless belt  (the polyamide resin layer) according to this exemplary embodiment, the surface resistivity which is measured by applying a voltage of 100 V under the normal-temperature and normal-humidity conditions (at a temperature of 22\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 55 RH %) is preferably in the range of from 7 log \u03a9\/\u25a1 to 13 log \u03a9\/\u25a1. Particularly, when the endless belt  is employed as an intermediate transfer belt, the surface resistivity is preferably in the range of from 8 log \u03a9\/\u25a1 to 12 log \u03a9\/\u25a1. When the endless belt is employed as a recording medium transport and transfer belt, the surface resistivity is preferably in the range of from 9 log \u03a9\/\u25a1 to 13 log \u03a9\/\u25a1.","The surface resistivity is a measured value obtained by applying a voltage of 100 V under the normal-temperature and normal-humidity conditions (at a temperature of 22\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 55 RH %).","In the endless belt  (the polyamide resin layer) according to this exemplary embodiment, the difference between the surface resistivity measured by applying a voltage of 100 V under the normal-temperature and normal-humidity conditions (at a temperature of 22\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 55 RH %) and the surface resistivity measured by applying a voltage of 1000 V under the normal-temperature and normal-humidity conditions (at a temperature of 22\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 55 RH %) is preferably equal to or less than 1.0 log \u03a9\/\u25a1.","In the endless belt  (the polyimide resin layer) according to this exemplary embodiment, the difference between the surface resistivity measured by applying a voltage of 100 V under the low-temperature and low-humidity conditions (at a temperature of 10\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 10 RH %) and the surface resistivity measured by applying a voltage of 100 V under the high-temperature and high-humidity conditions (at a temperature of 30\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 85 RH %) is preferably equal to or less than 1.0 log \u03a9\/\u25a1.","Here, the surface resistivity is measured using a circular electrode (a UR probe of HIRESTA IP made by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd., with an outer diameter of a cylindrical electrode of \u03c616 mm, an inner diameter of a ring-like electrode part of \u03c630 mm, and an outer diameter of \u03c640 mm) on the basis of the JIS-K-6911 (1995) by placing a measuring sample on an insulating plate, applying a target voltage thereto under a target conditions, and measuring a current flowing from the outer diameter to the inner diameter in 5 seconds after the application of the voltage by the use of a microammeter R8340A made by Advantest Corporation, and calculating the surface resistance value acquired from the current value.","In the endless belt  (the polyamide resin layer) according to this exemplary embodiment, the compressive elastic modulus at the time of saturated absorption of water is, for example, equal to or greater than 3500 MPa (preferably in the range of from 3700 MPa to 9000 MPa and more preferably in the range of from 4000 MPa to 7500 MPa).","When the compressive elastic modulus at the time of saturated absorption of water in the endless belt  (the polyamide resin layer) is set to the above-mentioned range, it means that the lowering of the compressive elastic modulus due to the absorption of water is suppressed.
