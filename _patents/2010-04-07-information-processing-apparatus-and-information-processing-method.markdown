Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a printing system and a method for controlling the same, in particular, relates to an information processing apparatus for managing a device, a client machine, which are provided on a network, and software required for printing by using an administration server, and a program for controlling the same. Hereinafter, the term \u201cclient machine\u201d as used herein is referred to simply as \u201cclient\u201d. Print data-forming software installed on a client is so-called a printer driver, and hereinafter is also referred to as \u201cdriver\u201d.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, a network printing environment provided with a client, a print server, a printer, and an administration server for managing these has been proposed. A printing method using the printer driver corresponding to a shared printer on the print server and the driver corresponding to the network printer object is known. There is another printing method using a printer driver that corresponds to the local printer object locally connected to the client. The technique for forming a network printer object corresponding to a shared printer on the client is disclosed, for example, in \u201cWindows Point and Print Technical Overview\u201d, Microsoft, Published: Mar. 21, 2003, Update: Nov. 20, 2006.","On the client, for example, when the printer driver corresponding to the local printer object is updated, its printer object may overwrite the printer driver corresponding to the network printer object. Consequently, the versions and the like between the print server-side printer driver corresponding to the shared printer object and the printer driver corresponding to the network printer object may become inconsistent.","As a result, printing via the print server may be disabled from the client using the network printer, or incorrect print results may be obtained. Therefore, a printing system environment cannot be appropriately maintained in the prior art, resulting in problems associated with maintenance and management.","In order to solve these situations, the present invention provides an information processing apparatus that has a function of transmitting print data to a network printer via a locally connected local printer or a print server for print processing. In addition, the information processing apparatus is used in an environment in which a printing method for processing print data by using a printer driver installed on the print server to cause the network printer to print the print data coexists with a printing method for transmitting print data to the locally connected local printer without the intervention of the print server for printout. The information processing apparatus includes a determination unit and a setting unit.","The determination unit determines whether or not a printer driver to be set up on the local printer is newer version than that of a printer driver for a network printer, which is set up on the information processing apparatus, and is shared therewith.","The setting unit sets up a printer driver to be set up on the local printer driver as well as perform settings on a printer driver for the print server so as to cause the network printer to operate normally if the determination unit determines that a printer driver to be set up on the local printer is a newer version than that of a printer driver for a network printer, which is set up on the information processing apparatus, and is shared therewith.","When a local printer is updated in a printing environment where a network printer coexists with the local printer, the settings for a printer driver on the print server are performed so as to cause the network printer to operate normally. With this arrangement, a driver version can be appropriately managed, and thereby a normal printing system environment can be maintained and the convenience of maintenance and management can be improved as well.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings.","In the network printing system environment exemplified in , a device  having a printing function, a client , a print server , and a management server  for managing these components are connected to each other via a communication line . Here, the client  transmits print data to a locally connected local printer or a network printer via the print server  for print processing.","In such a system environment, the following printing methods are available.","One is a method for processing print data by using the printer driver installed on the print server  so as to cause the network printer to print the print data. As shown in print paths indicated by the solid line in , this is a printing method via a print server, in which print data is transmitted from the client  to the device A via the print server  for printout. In other words, in this method, a shared printer object is generated on the print server , and a network printer object corresponding to the printer is generated on the client  so as to perform printing via the print server .","Another is a method for transmitting print data to a local printer without the intervention of the print server  for printout. In this case, as shown in the print path indicated by the dotted line in , print data is transmitted from the local printer of the client  directly to the device B for printout. In other words, printing is directly performed from the client  without the intervention of the print server .","Thus, the client  is available in an environment in which two different methods coexist.","Hereinafter, the aforementioned terms will be described.","First, the term \u201cadministration server\u201d as used herein refers to a server that comprehensively performs device searching, operating state monitoring, various settings, and the like mainly conducted by the IT (information technology) administrator. In other words, the administration server searches for a device to be managed, monitors whether or not the found device is in normal operation, and further sets MIB (Management Information Base) information and the like held by the device. Furthermore, the administration server has an additional function that directs installation processing or uninstallation processing for an appropriate print driver corresponding to the device with respect to a plurality of clients or a print server. Here, as used herein, the printer object is the settings for a printer which is registered at a registry managed by the print server or the OS provided in the client . More specifically, a print destination (address), a printer name, a driver path, and printer attributes (shared printer, network printer, local printer, and the like) are stored in the printer object.","Next, the term \u201cshared printer method\u201d as used herein refers to an installation mode of a printer driver, in which settings are made to share the printer driver installed on the print server so as to allow for use from a plurality of clients. The shared printer object is a structure that includes various settings of a shared printer to be set on the print server. The shared printer object performs communication between a network printer to be described below and various objects so as to realize print processing.","The term \u201cnetwork printer object\u201d as used herein refers to a structure to be installed on a client in a manner corresponding to a shared printer in order to utilize the shared printer on the client. For example, the network printer corresponding to the shared printer can be formed on the client by using the Point and Print function provided by the operating system Windows\u2122 developed by Microsoft (e.g., see \u201cWindows Point and Print Technical Overview\u201d, Microsoft, Published: Mar. 21, 2003, Update: Nov. 20, 2006).","In this system, it is important that the shared printer on the print server and the printer driver for the network printer on the client are synchronized. The synchronization for the printer drivers here means maintaining the identity of the driver attributes. In other words, the print driver includes attributes such as the manufacturer, direction, PDL (e.g., page description language for forming a print job such as PCL, PostScript, or the like), and version. The synchronization for the printer drivers means maintaining the identity of these attributes. In particular, when focusing on a single printer driver, the version of the print driver is often upgraded to deal with fault countermeasure and functional improvement. In such a case, if the printer driver of a shared printer is version 1.00 for example, the network printer on the client, which corresponds to the shared printer, also needs to be upgraded to version 1.00.","In the printing method via a print server, the network printer on the client essentially performs document settings for forming a print job, and the shared printer on the print server performs device settings and spooling. As used herein, the term \u201cdocument settings\u201d means the items to be set individually for printing, such as sheet size, copies, the method for feeding sheets, and the like for forming a print job. On the other hand, the term \u201cdevice settings\u201d refers to the items to be uniquely determined by the device, which include port settings, sheet-discharging options that can be used in the device, and the like. In other words, document settings are the items to be set individually for each client, and device settings are the items to be set for clients in common. Note that in the printer driver for Windows\u2122, such settings can be made by a property function held by each of the printer drivers. In addition, rendering processing for forming a print job may be performed by the print server.","In this way, in the printing method for printing via the print server, print processing is realized by the client and the printer driver on the print server in a pair-wise form.","For the Point and Print function, when a version upgrade of the shared printer on the print server is made, an automatic version upgrade of the client network printer corresponding to the shared printer is also made.","Next, the term \u201clocal printer\u201d as used herein generally refers to a printer connected locally to a client. For a local printer, the client may perform all processing for printing, such as document settings, device settings, rendering processing, spool processing, port processing, and the like. Hence, in the printing method using a local printer, a print job formed by the client printer driver is transmitted directly to the device without the intervention of the print server.","As described above, there are two different modes for realizing printing from the client to the device. One is a mode for employing the network printer corresponding to the shared printer on the print server, and the other is a mode for employing an individually-installed local printer.","Here, it should be noted that a version upgrade of the printer driver on the client is different between the network printer and the local printer. In other words, there is no need for the client to perform individual updates for the network printer. This is because the network printer corresponding to the shared printer is automatically updated when the version of the shared printer on the print server is upgraded.","In contrast, an update for a local printer needs to be performed separately for each client.","However, in the prior art described above, the problem of the integrity of the printer driver exists when the network printer and the local printer are present on the client.","In other words, assume the case where the version of the printer driver for the local printer is upgraded when the network printer and the local printer have the same kind of the printer driver and are shared with an output device. With this version upgrade, the version of the same printer driver for the network printer is also upgraded. Consequently, the print driver of the shared printer on the print server and the print driver of the network printer on the client become different and are inconsistent with each other.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"Next, using the Point and Print function, the network printer A (v100) corresponding to the shared printer A is generated on the client.","Thereafter, the printer driver A (v200) for the local printer B is installed on the client. In other words, the term \u201cv200\u201d as used herein means the printer driver version 2.00, the printer driver A (v200) is an upgraded version of the printer driver A (v100).","With this arrangement, the version of the network printer A (v100) on the client is also upgraded to the printer driver A (v200).","As a result, although the network printer A on the client is upgraded to version 2.00, the shared printer A for the print server corresponding thereto remains at version 1.00.","Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings.","Prior to the explanation of the flowchart shown in , the configuration of the printing system environment will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1000","2000","3000","4000","5000","5000"]},"Each of the information processing apparatuses is configured with a computer, includes one central processing unit , , , and , respectively, and functions as a main control unit.

For example, each component of the device  is connected to each other via a bus .","The device  is a printing device having a print processing function, and includes a device interface control section  and a printer engine section . The device  may be a single function peripheral (SFP) having only a printing function, or a multi function peripheral (MFP) having a scanner function, copying function, fax function, and the like, in addition to the print function. Furthermore, the device  holds device information such as MIB. Acquiring and setting such information are performed by an IT administrator from the management server  via a network.","On the client , printing becomes possible either by performing printing using the network printer from the device  via the print server , or by transmitting print data directly to the device  via the local printer. These print paths are as shown in .","In a printing method via a network printer, as shown by the solid line in , print data is transmitted from the client  to the device  (device A) via the print server .","In a printing method via a local printer, as shown by the dotted line in , print data is directly transmitted from the client  to the device  (device B). In other words, this method does not pass through the print server  as a print path.","Here, on the print server , a driver is installed as a shared printer so as to provide a network printer to the client  using the Point and Print function from the client .","Next, an essential part of a system configuration to which the present invention is applied will be described with reference to .","The main components are the device management application section  of the management server , the executable file section  of the client , and the driver management service section  of the print server .","Furthermore, the device management application section  is configured with a driver management control section , an information management section , and a driver storage section .","The device management application section  has a search function for the device .

In other words, when the driver to be newly installed on the local printer is the same kind as that of the existing network printer, and the driver itself is also the same kind, the network printer is changed to the local printer so as to ensure the integrity of the drivers. In the update mode , the local printer to be newly generated on the client is prioritized, and hence it is understood that the PULL mode is prioritized.","In contrast, the second to the fourth update modes are prioritized on the print server mode.","The second update mode (hereinafter referred to as \u201cupdate mode \u201d) brings the print server  under control when the print server  is not brought under control. With the present mode, the integrity of the drivers to be used by the shared printer on the print server, the network printer on the client, and the local printer is ensured. Here, the term \u201cto bring the print server  under control\u201d means to bring the print server  under the control of the driver management control section .

Assume the case where a local printer, in which the version of the driver A is 2.00 and the output destination device  is the device B, is to be newly generated on the client  (see V200 and device B in the top field).","The devices A and B are physically present print ports, i.e., the devices  with a different IP address.","In this case, the rule () among the installation rules in  is applied. In other words, it means that the existing network printer is changed to the local printer, in which the output destination device  is the device A, by using the driver A of version 2.00. Furthermore, the rule () means generating a newly specified local printer object in which the output destination is the device B.","Another example is that the version of the driver for the existing network printer is 3.00 and the output destination device  is the device A (see V300 and device A in the left field). Assume the case where a local printer, in which the version of the driver A is 1.00 and the output destination device  is the device B, is to be newly generated on the client  (see V100 and device B in the top field).","In this case, the rule () among the installation rules in  is applied. In other words, it means that the existing network printer is generated after changing to the local printer, in which the output destination device  is the device A, by using the existing driver A of version 3.00. Furthermore, in the rule (), it means that a new local printer, in which the output destination is the device B, is also generated by using the existing driver A of version 3.00.","As described above, an appropriate installation rule is obtained depending on the existing network printer information and the driver information to be newly installed. Note that the installation rules in  are intended as an example, a different installation result from that of the present embodiment can of course be obtained by changing the installation rules.","For example, in the latter example, the version of the driver for the existing network printer is compared with that of the newly specified driver. When the version of the driver for the existing network printer is newer than that of the newly specified driver, it is also possible that the existing network printer is not changed to the local printer. For the newly specified local printer, the local printer object, in which the output destination is the device B, is generated by using the driver constituting the existing network printer. Note that the installation rules in  may be acquired from the first driver management control section  of the management server  (see step  in  to be described below), or may be incorporated as a part of the executable file section .","Next, the conditions assumed in the present embodiment will now be described.","First, assume that a printer name \u201cprinter A\u201d, which is supported by a driver having a driver name of \u201cdriver A\u201d and a version of 1.00, is installed on the print server . Also, the printer A is a shared printer having the shared name \u201cshared printer A\u201d, and the print server  is not yet managed by the driver management control section  of the management server .

The driver used for the shared printer \u201cshared printer A\u201d and the driver of the network printer \u201cprinter A\u201d for the client  are both the same kind and the same version, and are in the state where they are mutually consistent.","In such a printing system environment, the following driver is assumed to be managed by the information management section  and the driver storage section  of the driver management control section  in the management server .","The driver which is the same kind as that for the network printer (its version is newer that that of the driver for the network printer, i.e., 2.00).","In other words, the driver name is \u201cdriver A\u201d and its version is 2.00, and the printer name is \u201cprinter A\u201d. Here, the printer name may be same as or different from that of the network printer. When the driver is installed on the client , processing for updating a driver used in the network printer on the client  is involved.","Under the aforementioned assumed conditions, processing shown in , which is performed by the management server , will now be described.","First, an IT administrator accesses the device management application section  of the first data control section  by using the first input section  and the first display section  of the management server  (see step ).","Here, when the application used for the device management application section  is a Web application, such an application can be accessed from a separate client for administrator instead of the management server . When the client for an administrator can remotely access the management server , the device management application section  may use what is referred to as a native application.","Next, an IT administrator uses the first input section  and the first display section  of the management server  so as to perform a selection operation under the update mode setting menu on the first driver management control section  (see step ). This means that the user interface screen exemplified in  is displayed so as to prompt the IT administrator to carry out an operation, and this screen is under the control of the driver management control section .","Next, during execution of the executable file in the client , the driver management control section  selects the update mode for the user interface screen shown in  when the network printer is present in the client  (see step ).","Subsequently, when any operation of the registration button on the screen in  has been detected, the driver management control section  stores data indicating the selected update mode into the information management section  (see step ).
