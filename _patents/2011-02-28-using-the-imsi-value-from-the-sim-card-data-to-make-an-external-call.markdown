{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present disclosure is directed in general to mobile communication devices operative in wireless communication networks. In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to the methods, systems and devices for making external phone calls to mobile communication devices.","2. Description of the Related Art","Mobile communication devices provide a wide range of capabilities and functionalities to the user, such as sending and receiving telephone calls, electronic messages and instant messages. In addition, mobile devices typically include capabilities defined by the different applications which are installed in the mobile device, such as voice telephony applications, a data or message synchronization applications (e.g. for e-mail messages or calendar items), a Web browser or Internet search applications, as examples, or combinations thereof In the case of telephone communications, a mobile device may be capable of making and receiving calls through both a PBX or enterprise domain (possibly administered by the user's place of employment) and through other non-enterprise domain(s), such as a wireless wide area networks, personal cellular service, and the like. In support of making calls to and from a mobile device, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card is mounted to the mobile device as a smart card that includes a processor and a memory chip for storing and processing predetermined subscriber information and information loaded in a pre-personalization state. However, depending on what information is stored on the SIM card, the mobile device may not be able to make or receive a call when traveling outside of the service area associated with the SIM card. For example, when a mobile device in an enterprise network does not have country code information encoded in its SIM card, the enterprise network server cannot construct the required dialing code for an international call to the mobile device without the country code information from the SIM card. For example, in Hong Kong, local SIM cards do not encode the Hong Kong Country code (). Similarly, SIM cards in Canada do not encode the country code () before the local number. As a result, an international call from Canada made by the enterprise server to a mobile device in Hong Kong cannot be made by the PBX when the SIM card at the mobile device does not include the encoded country code for Hong Kong.","Accordingly, a need exists for improved method, system and device for overcoming the problems in the art, such as outlined above, where the same or similar problems may exist in other networks and devices. Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional processes and technologies will become apparent to one of skill in the art after reviewing the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings and detailed description which follow.","A method, system and device are provided for making external calls to a mobile device which does not have a country code encoded in its SIM card by transforming an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) value from the SIM card into a country code value, and then using the country code value to construct a dialing sequence for calling the mobile device. As disclosed, a communication network server supports calls to or from a mobile device without country code information encoded in the SIM card (e.g., the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN) by deriving or constructing country code information from other SIM card data (e.g., the IMSI element), and then constructing a dialing sequence to the mobile device using the constructed country code information so that a call switching node (e.g., PBX) can establish an outgoing call to the mobile device using the dialing sequence. In selected embodiments, the communication network server constructs the country code information when a mobile device without a country code encoded in the SIM card attempts to place a fixed mobile convergence call that requires a mobile terminated dialog to the mobile device. If the mobile device is outside the enterprise-controlled network and the country code field is not included in the mobile device's SIM data, the communication network server derives or constructs the country code by extracting a mobile country code (MCC) from other SIM card data (e.g., the IMSI element), and then translating the extracted MCC into a constructed country code for the mobile device, such as by using a table lookup operation. The constructed country code may be stored with the SIM data from the mobile device and also inserted into the mobile number for use in constructing dialing sequences to the mobile device to enable PBX-initiated calls to the mobile device over a wide-area cellular network. In this way, the communication network server uses the IMSI value to construct the country code of the mobile number so that long distance calls can be placed to the mobile number of the mobile device.","Various illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. While various details are set forth in the following description, it will be appreciated that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details, and that numerous implementation-specific decisions may be made to the disclosure described herein to achieve the device designer's specific goals, such as compliance with communication system limits or design-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. While such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, it would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. For example, selected aspects are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid limiting or obscuring the present disclosure. In addition, some portions of the detailed descriptions provided herein are presented in terms of algorithms and instructions that operate on data that is stored in a computer memory. Such descriptions and representations are used by those skilled in the art to describe and convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. In general, an algorithm refers to a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result, where a \u201cstep\u201d refers to a manipulation of physical quantities which may, though need not necessarily, take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It is common usage to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. These and similar terms may be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that, throughout the description, discussions using terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","Referring now to , there is depicted is a schematic block diagram representation of an example system  for control and management of enterprise-related mobile calls, including an enterprise communications platform for making calls to a mobile device. The system  includes an enterprise or business system  which may be embodied as a local area network (LAN). In the description below, the enterprise or business system  may be referred to as an enterprise network . It will be appreciated that the enterprise network  may include more than one network and may be located in multiple geographic areas in some embodiments.","The enterprise network  may be connected, often through a firewall , to a wide area network (WAN) , such as the Internet. The enterprise network  may also be connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  via direct inward dialing (DID) trunks or primary rate interface (PRI) trunks.","The enterprise network  may also communicate with a public land mobile network (PLMN) , which may also be referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN) or, in some cases, a cellular network. As known in the art, the connection with the PLMN  may be made via a relay (not shown).","The system  may include a number of enterprise-associated mobile devices . Each of the mobile devices  may be equipped for cellular communication through the PLMN , and\/or may be equipped for Wi-Fi communications over one or more wireless local area network (WLAN) configured in accordance with one of the IEEE 802.11 specifications.","As described more fully below, each of the mobile devices  may include one or more radio transceivers and associated processing hardware and software to enable wireless communications with the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs. In this way, the PLMN  and mobile device(s)  may be configured to operate in compliance with any one or more of a number of wireless protocols, including GSM, GPRS, CDMA, EDGE, UMTS, EvDO, HSPA, 3GPP, or a variety of others. It will be appreciated that each mobile device  may roam within the PLMN  and across PLMNs, in known manner, as the user moves. In some instances, dual-mode mobile devices  and\/or the enterprise network  are configured to facilitate roaming between the PLMN  and a WLAN, and are thus capable of seamlessly transferring sessions (such as voice calls) from a connection with the cellular interface of the dual-mode device  to the WLAN interface of the dual-mode device , and vice versa.","The enterprise network  typically includes a number of networked servers, computers, and other devices. For example, the enterprise network  may connect one or more desktop or laptop computers (not shown) and\/or desktop telephones , where the connections may be wired or wireless.","Though not separately shown, the enterprise network  may include one or more mail servers for coordinating the transmission, storage, and receipt of electronic messages for client devices operating within the enterprise network . Typical mail servers include the Microsoft Exchange Server\u2122 and the IBM Lotus Domino\u2122 server. Each user within the enterprise typically has at least one user account within the enterprise network . Associated with each user account is message address information, such as an e-mail address. Messages addressed to a user message address are stored on the enterprise network  in the mail server. The messages may be retrieved by the user using a messaging application, such as an e-mail client application. The messaging application may be operating on a user's computer connected to the enterprise network  within the enterprise. In some embodiments, the user may be permitted to access stored messages using a remote computer. Using the messaging application, the user may also compose and send messages addressed to others, within or outside the enterprise network . The messaging application causes the mail server to send a composed message to the addressee.","The enterprise network  may also include an enterprise server . Using a relay, the enterprise server  functions to redirect or relay incoming e-mail messages addressed to a user's e-mail address within the enterprise network  to the user's mobile device  and to relay incoming e-mail messages composed and sent via the mobile device  out to the intended recipients within the enterprise network  or elsewhere. In this way, the enterprise server facilitates \u201cpush\u201d e-mail service for the mobile device  enabling the user to send and receive e-mail messages using the mobile device  as though the user were connected to an e-mail client within the enterprise network  using the user's enterprise-related e-mail address.","The enterprise network  also includes a Private Branch eXchange (PBX) , such as a standard PBX or an IP-PBX, that is connected with the telephone network  for routing incoming and outgoing voice calls for the enterprise. The PBX  may be connected to the PSTN  via DID trunks or PRI trunks, for example. In addition, the PBX  may use ISDN signaling protocols for setting up and tearing down circuit-switched connections through the PSTN  and related signaling and communications. In some embodiments, the PBX  may be connected to one or more conventional analog telephones . The PBX  is also connected to the enterprise network  and, through it, to telephone terminal devices, such as digital telephone sets, softphones operating on computers, etc. Within the enterprise, each individual may have an associated extension number, sometimes referred to as a PNP (private numbering plan), or direct dial phone number. Calls outgoing from the PBX  to the PSTN  or incoming from the PSTN  to the PBX  are typically circuit-switched calls. Within the enterprise, e.g. between the PBX  and terminal devices, voice calls are often packet-switched calls, for example Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls.","The enterprise network  may further include a Service Management Platform (SMP)  for performing some aspects of messaging or session control, like call control and advanced call processing features. The SMP  may, in some cases, also perform some media handling. Collectively, the SMP  and PBX  may be referred to as the enterprise communications platform. It will be appreciated that the enterprise communications platform and, in particular, the SMP , is implemented on one or more servers having suitable communications interfaces for connecting to and communicating with the PBX  and\/or DID\/PRI trunks. Although the SMP  may be implemented on a stand-alone server, it will be appreciated that it may be implemented into an existing control agent\/server as a logical software component or as part of the enterprise server . As will be described below, the SMP  may be implemented as a multi-layer platform.","The enterprise communications platform ,  implements the switching to connect session legs and may provide the conversion between, for example, a circuit-switched call and a VoIP call, or to connect legs of other media sessions. In some embodiments, in the context of voice calls the enterprise communications platform ,  provides a number of additional functions including automated attendant, interactive voice response, call forwarding, voice mail, etc. It may also implement certain usage restrictions on enterprise users, such as blocking international calls or - calls. In many embodiments, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may be used to set-up, manage, and terminate media sessions for voice calls. Other protocols may also be employed by the enterprise communications platform , , for example, Web Services, Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) protocol, Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), and various custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as will be described in greater detail below.","One of the functions of the enterprise communications platform ,  is to extend the features of enterprise telephony to the mobile devices . For example, the enterprise communications platform ,  may allow the mobile device  to perform functions akin to those normally available on a standard digital or analog telephone set . Example features may include direct extension dialing, enterprise voice mail, conferencing, call transfer, call park, etc.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic block diagram representation of a first embodiment of the enterprise communications platform intended for use in a circuit-switched TDM context where the SMP  operates as a voice mobility server. As described below, it will be appreciated that the references to \u201ccalls\u201d or call-centric features are applicable to session-based communications in general and, in some instances, to messaging-based communications. As depicted, the PBX  is coupled to the SMP  via PRI connection  or other suitable digital trunk. In some embodiments, the PRI connection  may include a first PRI connection, a second PRI connection, and a channel service unit (CSU), wherein the CSU is a mechanism for connecting computing devices to digital mediums in a manner that allows for the retiming and regeneration of incoming signals. It will be appreciated that there may be additional or alternative connections between the PBX  and the SMP .","In this embodiment, the SMP  assumes control over both call processing and the media itself. This architecture may be referred to as \u201cFirst Party Call Control.\u201d Many of the media handling functions normally implemented by the PBX  are handled by the SMP  in this architecture. Incoming calls addressed to any extension or direct dial number within the enterprise, for example, are always first routed to the SMP . Thereafter, a dialog is established from the SMP  to the called party within the enterprise, and the two legs are bridged. Accordingly, the SMP  includes a digital trunk interface  and a digital signal processing (DSP) conferencing bridge . The DSP conferencing bridge  performs the bridging of calls for implementation of various call features, such as conferencing, call transfer, etc. The digital trunk interface  may be implemented as a plurality of telephonic cards, e.g. Intel Dialogic cards, interconnected by a bus and operating under the control of a processor. The digital trunk interface  may also be partly implemented using a processor module such as, for example, a Host Media Processing (HMP) processor. The SMP  may include various scripts  for managing call processing. The scripts  are implemented as software modules, routines, functions, etc., stored in non-volatile memory and executed by the processor of the SMP . The scripts  may implement call flow logic, business logic, user preferences, call service processes, and various feature applications.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic block diagram representation of a second embodiment of the enterprise communications platform in which the PBX  performs the functions of terminating and\/or bridging media streams, but call control functions are largely handled by the SMP . In this embodiment, the SMP  may be referred to as a call control server . This architecture may be referred to as \u201cThird-Party Call Control.\u201d As depicted, the call control server  is coupled to the PBX , for example through the LAN, enabling packet-based communications and, more specifically, IP-based communications. In selected embodiments, communications between the PBX  and the call control server  are carried out in accordance with SIP so that the call control server  uses SIP-based communications to manage the set up, tear down, and control of media handled by the PBX . In other embodiments, the call control server  employs a communications protocol conforming to the ECMA-269 or ECMA-323 standards for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA).","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic block diagram representation of a third embodiment of the enterprise communications platform which reflects the adaptation of an existing set of call processing scripts to an architecture that relies on third-party call control, with separate call control and media handling. The SMP  includes a call processing server . The call processing server  includes the scripts or other programming constructs for performing call handling functions. The SMP  also includes a SIP server  and a media server . The separate SIP server  and media server  logically separate the call control from media handling. The SIP server  interacts with the call processing server  using a computer-implemented communications handling protocol, such as one of the ECMA-269 or ECMA-323 standards. These standards prescribe XML based messaging for implementing Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA). The SIP server  may interact with the media server  using SIP-based media handling commands.","To understand how the predetermined IMSI value from the SIM card of a mobile device can be used to make an external call to the mobile device, reference is now made to  which schematically depicts a communication system  in which an enterprise communications server  places a call or call-back to a mobile device  which is not encoded with country code information.","To support wireless communications, the depicted mobile device  includes one or more processors  that run one or more software programs or modules embodied in circuitry and\/or non-transitory storage media device(s)  (e.g., RAM, ROM, flash memory, etc.) for performing various communication-related operations using dedicated input\/output (I\/O) circuitry . For example, when a SIM card is first installed, the mobile device  is configured during bootup to transmit the SIM card data  in an uplink message  to the enterprise communications server . The uplink SIM card data message  may include the MSISDN field which is used to identify a mobile phone number internationally with a defined numbering plan to uniquely identify the mobile device , including a country code (CC) field, a national destination code (NDC) field, and a subscriber number (SN) field of up to 15 digits in total. In addition, the uplink SIM card data message  may include up to 15 digits of an IMSI field which includes a Mobile Country Code (MCC) field, a Mobile Network Code (MNC) field, and the mobile station identification number (MSIN) within the networks customer base. At the enterprise communications server , the SIM data is stored in memory  by the SIM data storage module  for purposes of identifying the subscriber of the mobile device  and processing calls as described more fully hereinbelow.","The mobile device  is also configured to process incoming and outgoing calls using predetermined call processing operations. For example, an enterprise user using the mobile device  may initiate a call to a called party  by sending a request message  to a serving network node, such as the enterprise communications server  or other enterprise data server  which mediates the request message . For example, when placing an outgoing call, the mobile device  may be configured to initiate a call sequence , such as by sending a request  over a data channel (e.g., SMS, SIP, USSD or IP-based message) to the enterprise communications server  to initiate an outgoing call to a called party.","Upon receiving the request message  from the mobile device  (receive module ), the service logic at the enterprise communications server  may be configured to use the received information to effectuate two dialogs in association with a call switching node, such as a SIP-capable PBX\/CENTREX node . The first dialog will be set up between the call switching node  and the mobile device , and the second dialog will be established between the called party's phone (e.g., phone ) and the call switching node  so that the enterprise user's enterprise address is presented to the called party instead of the non-enterprise address associated with the mobile device (i.e., the cellular number). The second dialog is established when the enterprise communications server  constructs and sends a first dialing sequence to the PBX  for placing the second leg of the call from the PBX  to the called party  using the called number provided by the mobile device  in the call request .","To establish the first leg\u2014also referred to as a \u201cmobile terminated\u201d call or a PBX-initiated call\u2014the enterprise communications server  retrieves the stored SIM data  for the calling party\/mobile device . If the retrieved SIM data includes the Country Code prefix (affirmative outcome to decision ), then the call request is processed as normal at step  by constructing and sending a dialing sequence to the PBX  for placing the first leg of the call to the mobile device  using any required national or international dialing code for the PBX, along with the retrieved Country Code prefix and local number for the mobile device .","However, if the retrieved SIM data does not include the Country Code prefix (negative outcome to decision ), this means that the mobile device's SIM card is not encoded with the Country Code. This can happen, for example, in Hong Kong where local SIM cards are not encoded with Hong Kong's Country Code () since Hong Kong is not officially recognized as a country apart from China. Another example is in Canada where some SIM cards are not encoded with the Canada country code () before the local number.","In an example sequence, the enterprise communications server  checks to see if the mobile number (from the stored SIM data ) contains a Country Code prefix by comparing the prefix of the local number with the Country Code prefix (e.g., with a string comparison). Any match will indicate that the mobile number contains the Country Code. On the other hand, if there is not a match, this indicates that the mobile number does not contain the Country Code since the local number will not start with the country code sequence, in which case the enterprise communications server  can insert the Country Code prefix to the local number.","If the SIM card for the mobile device  is not encoded with the country code and only has a local number, the enterprise communications server  cannot establish the first leg call to the mobile device  if the mobile device  and the PBX  are in different countries because the dialing sequence for the first leg call requires the Country Code for the mobile device  or the PBX  cannot make the first leg call.","To address the missing country code problem, the enterprise communications server  is configured to read the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) value from the stored SIM data . The 15 digit IMSI value typically includes a Mobile Country code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC) and Mobile station identification number (MSIN). From the IMSI value, the enterprise communications server  extracts the MCC code (step ) and then transforms the MCC value into a Country Code value for the mobile device  (step ). In an example implementation, the PBX  is located in the USA and the mobile device  includes a Vodafone UK SIM Card having a phone number of 13701827788. Based on the MCC sent from the mobile device  (234.XXX.XXXXXXXXX), the enterprise communications server  recognizes that this SIM card is in UK with country code , and also recognizes that the phone number 13701827788 is just a mobile number that does not have the country code in front of it. As a result, the enterprise communications server  constructs the following dialing sequence: 011 (IDD of USA)+44 (UK Country code)+wireless phone number (13701827788). In this example, it will be noted that the United Kingdom has wireless numbering plan that is similar to China's numbering plan where each wireless carrier has its own \u201carea\u201d code. As a result the \u201c1-370-XXXXX\u201d dialing sequence belongs to a Vodafone UK numbering block.","Thus, the MCC value is transformed by using the MCC value to access a table list to obtain or construct the corresponding Country Code value. The constructed Country Code may then be stored in the SIM data  as part of the mobile number for the mobile device . At this point, the call request may be processed step  by constructing and sending a dialing sequence to the PBX  for placing the first leg of the call to the mobile device  using any required national or international dialing code for the PBX, along with the constructed Country Code prefix and local number for the mobile device .","Once the dialing sequences for the first and second legs are constructed, the enterprise communications server  sends the dialing sequences for the first and second dialogs as SIP calls to the gateway  over the LAN . The media gate way converts the SIP call to ISDN and sends the call to the PBX . Thereafter, the first and second dialogs are patched together at the PBX . For example, the two respective Session DescriptionProtocol (SDP) streams associated with the dialogs are joined in order to establish an end-to-end bearer communications path between the mobile device  and the called party . In this way, the PBX  sends the first dialog over the telephone network  to the mobile device\/calling party  via wireless network , and sends the second dialog over the telephone network  to the called party  via call link .","Referring now to , there is depicted in flow chart form a procedure or algorithm  for constructing a dialable callback number. After an initial step , the mobile number that is to be called back is retrieved from the SIM card data. If it is determined that there is no location for the telephony connector (negative outcome to decision step ), the mobile number is passed directly to the PBX (step ) where it is configured to be dialable (step ). However, if it is determined that the telephony connector has a location (affirmative outcome to decision step ), the mobile number is inspected to identify and remove any \u201c+\u201d sign (step ). In addition, the mobile number is inspected to determine if a country code is present (step ). If there is no country code present (negative outcome to decision step ), the Country Code from the IMSI field is added to the mobile number (step ), and otherwise the mobile number is inspected to determine if the country code in the mobile number matches the PBX country location (step ). If the PBX country location and country code mobile do not match (negative outcome to decision ), then the required International Direct Dialing Code for the mobile device is retrieved from the telephony connecter and added to the mobile number in the callback dialing sequence (step ). However, if the PBX country location and country code mobile do match (affirmative outcome to decision ), then the National Direct Dialing Code is retrieved from the telephony connector and added to the mobile number for the call back dialing sequence (step ). Thereafter, the mobile number is in a dialable format (step ), and the process ends.","With respect to the behavior of the enterprise UE for purposes of facilitating integration of an outgoing cellular call, reference may now be taken to  which depicts in flow chart form a procedure  for making external calls to a mobile device. When the procedure starts (step ), each mobile device associated with an enterprise user (EU) has previously uploaded predetermined subscriber information from the SIM card to the serving network node, such as a mobile voice server or other unified communications platform. The uploaded SIM data includes, but is not limited to, the MSISDN field (which typically, but not always, includes the Country Code) and the IMSI field (which typically includes the Mobile Country Code, Mobile Network Code, and Mobile Station Identification Number).","At step , the enterprise user uses the mobile device to send a request message to a serving network node (i.e., the SMP server  shown in ) via the cellular network's data network or via an intermediate enterprise data server. The request message is sent to initiate an outgoing call from the mobile device to a called party using a called dialing sequence in the request message. In selected embodiments, the request message is a SIP Request or any other message that contains the necessary information to enable the serving network node to establish a call between the EU's mobile device and the called party's equipment that the enterprise user is attempting to call (e.g., an SMS message, an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) message, or an IP based message). In accordance with an embodiment, the following pieces of information may be transmitted as part of the request message: (i) the enterprise address (e.g., SIP URI or E.164 number) that the enterprise user is reachable at; (ii) the non-enterprise address (e.g., E.164 number) that the enterprise UE is reachable at when it is attached to the cellular network; (iii) the E.164 number or SIP URI of the called party; and (iv) an indication of whether privacy is required.","Upon receiving the request message from the EU's mobile device (step ), service logic at the serving network node uses the received information to process the call request by first retrieving SIM data for the EU from a database to verify that the call request is from a registered enterprise user. The verification status may be forwarded to an enterprise server (i.e., the enterprise server  shown in ). Though not separately shown, the Mobile Number from the retrieved SIM data may be inspected by the serving network node to determine if there is an encoded IMSI value and if there is a telephony connector that has a connection. If not, the Mobile Number is passed directly to a call switching node, but otherwise the Mobile Number may be processed to remove any +sign.","At step , the retrieved SIM data for the EU\/calling party is processed by the serving network node to determine whether the Mobile Number has an encoded Country Code provided with the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network (MSISDN) number for the mobile device. While a variety of Country Code detection algorithms may be used, the presence or absence of the Country Code may be detected by comparing the mobile number (from the MSISDN field) with the Mobile Country Code (from the IMSI field, where there is a 1:1 match between the IMSI MCC code to the Country Code) to see if there is a match. Alternatively, the MSISDN and IMSI fields may each be parsed to extract information from the Country Code and Mobile Country Code fields, respectively, and then compared to determine if there is a match. If the Mobile Country Code from the IMSI field matches the Country Code prefix from the MSISDN field (affirmative outcome to decision ), this indicates that the SIM data for the mobile device was encoded with the Country Code, and the serving network node proceeds to service the call request by inserting any required national or international dialing code prefixes.","In selected embodiments, the serving network node services the call request by establishing two dialogs in association with a call switching node, such as a PBX node. In this case, the serving network node sets up a first dialog between the PBX node and the EU\/calling party, and a second dialog between the PBX node and the called party so that the EU's enterprise address is presented to the called party. To establish the first dialog, the serving network node determines if the PBX node and EU's mobile device are in the same dialing zone at step . If the PBX node and mobile device are in different dialing zones (negative outcome to decision ), then the serving network node inserts the required International Direct Dialing Code for the EU's mobile device before the mobile number in the dialing sequence for the first leg (step ). However, if the PBX node and mobile device are in the same dialing zone (affirmative outcome to decision ), then the serving network node inserts the required National Direct Dialing Code for the EU's mobile device before the mobile number in the dialing sequence for the first leg (step ). Thereafter, the serving network node interacts with the call switching node at step  to set up the first and second dialogs and patch the dialogs or call legs together using the dialing sequence to the EU's mobile device for the first leg (to the EU's mobile device) and the called dialing sequence for the second leg in order to establish an end-to-end bearer communications path between the enterprise user and the called party. At step , the process ends.","When the SIM card of a mobile device is not encoded with the Country Code, this may be detected by the serving network node from the retrieved SIM data for the EU\/calling party (negative outcome to decision ), such as by determining that there is not a match between the MSISDN number for the mobile device and the Mobile Country Code (from the IMSI field). Again, this determination may be performed by parsing the MSISDN and IMSI fields to extract information from the Country Code (CC) and Mobile Country Code (MCC) fields, respectively, and then comparing the CC and MCC fields. If there is not match, this indicates that the SIM data for the mobile device was not encoded with the Country Code.","To derive the missing country code information, the serving network node may be configured to transform the Mobile Country Code into a corresponding Country Code and then insert the constructed Country Code into the mobile number (step ). In selected embodiments, the transformation is performed by reading the IMSI value from the EU's SIM data, extracting the Mobile Country code (MCC), and then translating the MCC value into a Country Code value for the EU that can be stored as part of the mobile number with the EU's SIM data. The translation process may be implemented by using the MCC value to access a lookup table of Country Code values. Alternatively, the Mobile Country Code from the IMSI may be added to the Mobile Number. Once the constructed Country Code is inserted into the mobile number, the serving network node proceeds to service the call request by inserting any required national or international dialing code prefixes as described hereinabove with reference to steps -.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic block diagram illustrating exemplary components of a mobile wireless communications or user equipment device  which may be used with selected embodiments of the present disclosure. The wireless device  is shown with specific components for implementing features described above. It is to be understood that the wireless device  is shown with very specific details for exemplary purposes only. As depicted, user equipment  includes a number of components such as a main processor  that controls the overall operation of user equipment . Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem . The communication subsystem  receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this illustrative embodiment of user equipment , communication subsystem  is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The GSM\/GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and these standards may be superseded eventually by Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem  with the wireless network  represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM\/GPRS communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.","Although the wireless network  associated with user equipment  is a GSM\/GPRS wireless network in one implementation, other wireless networks may also be associated with user equipment  in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that may be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM\/GPRS networks (as mentioned above), and future generation networks like EDGE, UMTS, WiMAX, LTE and LTE-A. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11, Mobitex\u2122 and DataTA\u2122 network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.","The main processor  also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) , a flash memory , a display , an auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystem , a data port , a keyboard , a speaker , a microphone , short-range communications , and other device subsystems .","Some of the subsystems of the user equipment  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. By way of example, the display  and the keyboard  may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over the network , and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.","The user equipment  can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the user equipment . To identify a subscriber, the user equipment  requires a SIM\/RUIM card  (i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module) to be inserted into a SIM\/RUIM interface  in order to communicate with a network. The SIM card or RUIM  is one type of a conventional \u201csmart card\u201d that can be used to identify a subscriber of the user equipment  and to personalize the user equipment , among other things. Without the SIM card , the user equipment  is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM card\/RUIM  into the SIM\/RUIM interface , a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services may include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voice mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services may include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. The SIM card\/RUIM  includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM card\/RUIM  is inserted into the SIM\/RUIM interface , it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber, the SIM card\/RUIM  can include some user parameters such as a Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network (MSISDN) number and an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number. An advantage of using the SIM card\/RUIM  is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical user equipment. The SIM card\/RUIM  may store additional subscriber information for user equipment as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. Alternatively, user identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory . In cases where the SIM card\/RUIM  does not include a Country Code parameter in the MSISDN number required for placing calls to the user equipment , the serving network node which sets up a call to the user equipment  may be configured to extract a Mobile Country Code from the IMSI number which is translated or appended to define a reconstructed Country Code for calls to the user equipment  over the wide-area cell network .","The user equipment  is a battery-powered device and includes a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments, the battery  can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery  in providing power V+ to the user equipment . Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells may provide the power to the user equipment .","The user equipment  also includes an operating system  and software components  which are described in more detail below. The operating system  and the software components  that are executed by the main processor  are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory , which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system  and the software components  such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.","The subset of software components  that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the user equipment  during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application  that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the user equipment  to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application  as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the random access or flash memory  of the user equipment  or some other suitable storage element in the user equipment . In at least some embodiments, some of the sent and received messages may be stored remotely from the device  such as in a data store of an associated host system that the user equipment  communicates with.","The software applications can further include a device state module , a Personal Information Manager (PIM) , and other suitable modules (not shown). The device state module  provides persistence, i.e. the device state module  ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory , so that the data is not lost when the user equipment  is turned off or loses power.","The PIM  includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, contacts, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items may be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network with the user equipment subscriber's corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the user equipment  with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the user equipment subscriber's office computer system.","The user equipment  also includes a connect module , and an IT policy module . The connect module  implements the communication protocols that are required for the user equipment  to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system, such as an enterprise system, that the user equipment  is authorized to interface with.","The connect module  includes a set of APIs that can be integrated with the user equipment  to allow the user equipment  to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system. The connect module  allows the user equipment  to establish an end-to-end secure, authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module  can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the user equipment . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module  to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively, in some cases, the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.","The IT policy module  receives IT policy data that encodes the IT policy. The IT policy module  then ensures that the IT policy data is authenticated by the user equipment . The IT policy data can then be stored in the flash memory  in its native form. After the IT policy data is stored, a global notification can be sent by the IT policy module  to all of the applications residing on the user equipment . Applications for which the IT policy may be applicable then respond by reading the IT policy data to look for IT policy rules that are applicable.","The IT policy module  can include a parser (not shown), which can be used by the applications to read the IT policy rules. In some cases, another module or application can provide the parser. Grouped IT policy rules, described in more detail below, are retrieved as byte streams, which are then sent (recursively, in a sense) into the parser to determine the values of each IT policy rule defined within the grouped IT policy rule. In at least some embodiments, the IT policy module  can determine which applications are affected by the IT policy data and send a notification to only those applications. In either of these cases, for applications that aren't running at the time of the notification, the applications can call the parser or the IT policy module  when they are executed to determine if there are any relevant IT policy rules in the newly received IT policy data.","All applications that support rules in the IT Policy are coded to know the type of data to expect. For example, the value that is set for the \u201cWEP User Name\u201d IT policy rule is known to be a string; therefore, the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as a string. As another example, the setting for the \u201cSet Maximum Password Attempts\u201d IT policy rule is known to be an integer, and therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as such.","After the IT policy rules have been applied to the applicable applications or configuration files, the IT policy module  sends an acknowledgement back to the host system to indicate that the IT policy data was received and successfully applied.","Other types of software applications can also be installed on the user equipment . These software applications can be third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the user equipment . Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.","The additional applications can be loaded onto the user equipment  through at least one of the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the user equipment  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the user equipment .","The data port  enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the user equipment  by providing for information or software downloads to the user equipment  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the user equipment  through a direct, and thus reliable and trusted connection, to provide secure device communication.","The data port  can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the user equipment  and another computing device. The data port  can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port  can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery  of the user equipment .","The short-range communications subsystem  provides for communication between the user equipment  and different systems or devices, without the use of the wireless network . For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short-range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth, and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.","In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the main processor . The main processor  will then process the received signal for output to the display  or alternatively to the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the keyboard  in conjunction with the display  and possibly the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem  may include devices such as: a touch screen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard  is preferably an alphanumeric keyboard or telephone-type keypad. However, other types of keyboards may also be used. A composed item may be transmitted over the wireless network  through the communication subsystem .","For voice communications, the overall operation of the user equipment  is substantially similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker , and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, can also be implemented on the user equipment . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The mobile device, enterprise communications platform, and serving network node elements described herein may include any general or special purpose computer with sufficient processing power, memory resources, and network throughput capability to handle the necessary workload placed upon it.  illustrates an example computer system  that may be suitable for implementing one or more embodiments disclosed herein. The computer system  includes a processor  (which may be referred to as a central processor unit or CPU) that is in communication with input\/output (I\/O) devices , network connectivity devices , an optional secondary storage , random access memory (RAM) , and read only memory (ROM) . The processor may be implemented as one or more CPU chips.","The secondary storage  is optionally included for storing SIM data from one or more enterprise users, and typically includes one or more disk drives or tape drives used for non-volatile storage of data and\/or for over-flow data storage device if RAM  is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage  may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM  when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM  is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM  is a non-volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage. The RAM  is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM  and RAM  is typically faster than to secondary storage .","I\/O devices  may include on or more printers, video monitors, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), touch screen displays, keyboards, keypads, switches, dials, mice, track balls, voice recognizers, card readers, paper tape readers, or other well-known input devices.","The network connectivity devices  may take the form of modems, modem banks, ethernet cards, universal serial bus (USB) interface cards, serial interfaces, token ring cards, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) cards, wireless local area network (WLAN) cards, radio transceiver cards such as code division multiple access (CDMA) and\/or global system for mobile communications (GSM) radio transceiver cards, and other well-known network devices. These network connectivity  devices may enable the processor  to communicate with an Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection, it is contemplated that the processor  might receive information from the network, or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above-described method steps. Such information, which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor , may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave or a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, such as RAM, ROM or other memory storage devices.","Such information, which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor  for example, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embodied in the carrier wave generated by the network connectivity  devices may propagate in or on the surface of electrical conductors, in coaxial cables, in waveguides, in optical media, for example optical fiber, or in the air or free space. The information contained in the baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be ordered according to different sequences, as may be desirable for either processing or generating the information or transmitting or receiving the information. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave, or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed, referred to herein as the transmission medium, may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art.","The processor  executes instructions, codes, computer programs, scripts which it accesses from hard disk, floppy disk, optical disk (these various disk-based systems may all be considered secondary storage ), ROM , RAM , or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor  is shown, multiple processors may be present. Thus, while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor, the instructions may be executed simultaneously, serially, or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. In addition or in the alternative, any required processing functionality may be executed by a cryptographic engine or other hardware accelerator circuit (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["900","904","904","904","906","902","908","910","912","908","910","912","914"]},"By now it should be appreciated that there is disclosed herein a method, apparatus, computer program product, and system for facilitating integration of an outgoing cellular call as an enterprise call. As disclosed, a request is received at a communication control server for an outgoing cellular call from an enterprise user towards a called party where the enterprise user is attached to an external wide area cellular network via a mobile communications device. The communication control server retrieves a mobile number (e.g., a MSISDN number with a CC field) and an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) value from subscriber identity module (SIM) data associated with the enterprise user, and then generates a derived Country Code value from the IMSI value if the mobile number for the enterprise user does not include a Country Code value. In selected embodiments, the derived Country Code value is generated by extracting a Mobile Country Code value from the IMSI value, and then using the MCC value to access a table of Country Code values to retrieve the derived Country Code value. The derived Country Code value is added to the mobile number to generate at least part of a first dialing sequence to the mobile communications device. In addition, an International Direct Dialing code may be added to the first dialing sequence if the derived country code does not match a dialing zone for a call switching node which will establish a first dialog to the mobile communications device using the first dialing sequence. Alternatively, a National Direct Dialing code may be added to the first dialing sequence if the derived country code matches a dialing zone for a call switching node which will establish a first dialog to the mobile communications device using the first dialing sequence. As finally constructed, the first dialing sequence is sent to a Private Branch eXchange (PBX) which will establish a first dialog to the mobile communications device using the first dialing sequence. In addition, the communication control server may generate a second dialing sequence to the called party, and then send the first and second dialing sequences to a call switching node for establishing a first dialog to the mobile communications device using the first dialing sequence and a second dialog to the called party using the second dialing sequence such that the second dialog contains an enterprise address of the enterprise user as a calling line identity.","There is also disclosed herein a method, apparatus, computer program product, and system for making an enterprise call from a mobile device attached to an external wide area cellular network. As disclosed, a communications server receives a request from an enterprise user to initiate an external call from the mobile device to a called party. In response to the request, the communications server determines if a mobile number from subscriber identity module (SIM) data associated with the enterprise includes a Country Code value. If not, the communications server constructs an updated mobile number by generating a derived Country Code value and adding the derived Country Code value to the mobile number. The updated mobile number may be constructed by retrieving a mobile number and MSISDN Number from SIM data associated with the enterprise user, determining whether the mobile number (e.g., MSISDN Number) from the SIM card data includes a Country Code value, retrieving an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) value from the SIM data associated with the enterprise user if the mobile\/MSISDN number from the SIM card data does not a Country Code value, and constructing the updated mobile number by generating a derived Country Code value from the IMSI value and adding the derived Country Code value to the mobile number. In selected embodiments, the updated mobile number is constructed by extracting an MCC value from the IMSI value and adding the MCC value to the mobile number. In addition, if the mobile number includes a \u201c+\u201d sign, the \u201c+\u201d sign is removed during construction of the updated mobile number. If the derived Country Code value does not match a country location indicator for a call switching node which will call the mobile device, an International Direct Dialing code is added during construction of the updated mobile number. However, if the derived Country Code value matches a country location indicator for a call switching node which will call the mobile device, a National Direct Dialing code is added during construction of the updated mobile number. The communications server uses the updated mobile number to establish a first call leg to said enterprise user by sending a circuit-switched call using the updated mobile number, and also establishes a second call leg to said called party upon receiving an indication that said first call leg has been established. Finally, the first and second call legs are patched together to establish an end-to-end communications path between the enterprise user and the called party.","In still further embodiments, there is disclosed a network node for making an outgoing cellular call as an enterprise call originated by an enterprise user towards a called party when said enterprise user is attached to an external wide area cellular network via a mobile communications device. The disclosed network node includes or has access to a memory or database for storing subscriber identity module (SIM) data associated with the enterprise user, including but not limited to a mobile number, MSISDN Number, and IMSI value. The network node also includes one or more processors configured to execute programming code and\/or instructions to place the outgoing cellular call. In selected embodiments, the processor(s) are programmed to determine if a Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network (MSISDN) Number in the SIM data includes a Country Code value. The processor(s) are also programmed to generate a derived Country Code value if the MSISDN Number for the enterprise user does not include a Country Code value. The derived Country Code may be generated by retrieving an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) value from the SIM data stored in the memory, and then constructing the updated mobile number by generating a derived Country Code value from the IMSI value and adding the derived Country Code value to the mobile number. In addition, the processor(s) are programmed to construct an updated mobile number by adding the derived Country Code value to a mobile number from the SIM data associated with the enterprise user. The updated mobile number may be constructed by extracting a Mobile Country Code (MCC) value from the IMSI value, and adding the MCC value to the mobile number. Finally, the processor(s) are programmed to establish a first dialing sequence for a call to said enterprise user by sending a circuit-switched call using the updated mobile number.","Although the described exemplary embodiments disclosed herein are described with reference to using the Mobile Country Code number from the IMSI SIM data field to derive missing Country Code SIM values in the context of a mobile terminated call, the present disclosure is not necessarily limited to the example embodiments which illustrate inventive aspects of the present disclosure that are applicable to a wide variety of authentication algorithms.
