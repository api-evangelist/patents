{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of network communications and, more particularly, to detecting abnormal bearer termination and dynamically restoring flows utilizing an alternative bearer.","A radio access network (RAN) is a part of a mobile communication system that implements radio access technology. That is, a RAN is a portion of a communication network that connects mobile devices to a core network (CN). One or more bearers (e.g., discrete communication connections) can be established between a RAN and mobile device. One or more distinct flows of information can be conveyed over each bearer. Some mobile devices are able to concurrently connect to multiple RANs at the same time.","At present in a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network, connectivity between a mobile device and a RAN is enabled by at least a default bearer. When this bearer (or any other bearer) is lost, the mobile device is no longer able to communicate with the core network over the lost bearer. Conventional 3GPP networks effectively monitor the dedicated bearer for a loss of coverage (or performs this function through some mechanism: for example, LTE monitors a Layer 2 (L2) state to determine attachment), which if it occurs an assumption is made that the mobile device experiences an RF loss. The network may attempt to \u201cpass-off\u201d all the bearers established between the mobile device and the RAN to an alternative network in response. Moving the bearers of the mobile device from one RAN to another is an all-or-nothing process. Even if one bearer (assuming multiple bearers connect a RAN and mobile device and assuming a default bearer is lost) is operating fine, all communications between the mobile device and RAN are moved. It should be appreciated that a mobile device can be concurrently connected to multiple RANs at a time, and that only bearers connecting the mobile device to a single RAN (the one where the default bearer was lost) are affected by the \u201cpass-off\u201d.","One embodiment of the disclosure detects an abnormal termination of a dedicated bearer, referred to as a lost bearer. The lost bearer is a bearer that is not a default bearer within a communication network. The lost bearer includes one or more lost communication flows, wherein each of the lost communication flows is an information exchange between a network component and a mobile device. Bearer properties of the dedicated bearer that was terminated can be determined. At least one radio access network (RAN) capable of communicating with the mobile device can be determined, wherein the at least one RAN is not one used for the dedicated bearer that was abnormally terminated. At least one alternative bearer can be detected or established at the at least one RAN. The alternative bearer can have bearer properties ensuring no loss of quality as defined by the bearer properties of the lost bearer. Each of the lost communication flows can be automatically and dynamically moved to the at least one alternative bearer. Moved lost communication flows can be referred to as restored flows. A one-to-one correspondence can exist between lost flows and restored flows. The moving of the lost communication flows to the restored flows can occur without interrupting communications and in a manner that requires no manual actions to be taken by a user of the mobile device.","One embodiment of the disclosure is for a system that includes a node for detecting a limited quality of service (QoS) capability within a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. The limited QoS can result in an unexpected termination of a dedicated bearer within the LTE or a change in bearer characteristics (such as lowered bandwidth or increased bearer packet latency) that renders the bearer unusable. The system can further include a device bearer application programming interface (API) configured to communicate a change of radio access network parameters associated with re-establishing a communication flow linked to the dedicated bearer. The radio access network parameters can be associated with an alternative radio access network.","Detection of lost communications between a radio access network (RAN) and mobile device is currently determined solely using the default bearer. When communications involving another bearer (e.g., a dedicated bearer, which is not the default bearer) are lost, this loss is not detected. Attempts to send data over the lost bearer (to\/from the mobile device) are unsuccessfully attempted and no corrective adjustments are made by a traditional system. This problem was noticed by the innovators during the course of developing the solution detailed herein.","There are many reasons, other than being outside a communication range, that a bearer can be lost. For example, a bearer may be pre-empted by a higher priority request. This type of pre-emption can be common at an accident scene or at a disaster scene, where many mobile device carrying responders are often present, which may overload a capacity of a particular communication cell. Pre-emption of existing bearers is becoming increasingly problematic as responders are using more advanced communication technology devices, such as video streaming, Web connected devices, two-way audio, and the like, where video communications consume substantially greater bandwidth compared to audio content. These problems will continue to escalate.","In accordance with the various embodiments, a bearer associated with a primary communication network can be abnormally terminated; the termination can be detected and can trigger one or more restoration actions. Upon detection, an appropriate alternative radio access network (RAN) can be selected for providing communication for the mobile device. Quality of service attributes associated with the dedicated bearer can be determined which can be used in negotiation of communication restoration. In one instance, a new bearer can be established within the alternative RAN. In another instance, existing bearers within the alternative RAN can be utilized to restore communication flows associated with the dedicated bearer.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.

In one embodiment, the alternative bearer  can be a new bearer able to handle flows (e.g., the restored flows ) of the lost bearer . In another embodiment, the alternative bearer  can be a set of one or more pre-existing bearers to which one or more additional flows (e.g., the restored flows ) are added. The establishment of the alternative bearer  and\/or restored flows  can dynamically and automatically occur without user (of device ) awareness. Additionally, the alternative bearer  can have bearer properties that are compatible with those of the lost bearer .","To elaborate, in scenario , mobile device  (e.g., mobile phone) can communicate with a primary network (e.g., Long Term Evolution or LTE network). The mobile device  can utilize network components (e.g., LTE Evolved Packet System) to communicate with one or more devices and\/or software elements (e.g., applications) within and\/or communicatively linked to the network . The network  can be connected to a communication backbone.","As used herein, bearers  can be a discrete connection established by a RAN  and\/or mobile device . Each bearer  can have a set of characteristic bearer properties , which can vary from bearer-to-bearer. For example, a bearer  in one embodiment can be an evolved packet system (EPS) bearer.
