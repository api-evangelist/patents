title: Kinetic energy absorber and method for gun-launched projectile
abstract: A round for launching from a gun may include a cartridge case and a projectile body adjacent the cartridge case. A pusher may be disposed in the cartridge case and may be operable to push the projectile body upon firing the round. An imaging sensor may be disposed at least partially in the projectile body. The imaging sensor may include a sensor base and a sensor lens. A first kinetic energy absorber may be disposed around the sensor base. A second kinetic energy absorber may be disposed around the sensor lens. After the round is fired and the pusher exits the gun, the pusher may separate from the projectile body and the second kinetic energy absorber may separate from the imaging sensor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to kinetic energy absorbers and in particular to kinetic energy absorbers for protecting sensitive components of gun-launched projectiles.","A gun-launched projectile may experience acceleration forces throughout its flight, particularly at launch and at impact. The projectile may carry a payload such as, for example, one or more sensors. Sensor projectiles are being developed with increasing frequency to facilitate a variety of needs. Sensors and other devices carried by these projectiles are required to function after initial impact. Thus, the internal sensors and associated electronics in the projectile must not be damaged during the projectile's launch and impact.","Different types of materials configured in various ways have been used to protect sensitive devices from excessive acceleration forces. The placement of imaging sensors in gun-launched projectiles presents unique challenges for energy absorption. A need exists for an energy absorber to protect fragile sensors in gun-launched projectiles.","It is an object of the invention to provide an energy absorber to protect fragile sensors in gun-launched projectiles.","One aspect of the invention is a round for launching from a gun. The round may include a cartridge case and a projectile body adjacent the cartridge case. A pusher may be disposed in the cartridge case and operable to push the projectile body upon firing the round. An imaging sensor may be disposed at least partially in the projectile body. The imaging sensor may include a sensor base and a sensor lens. A first kinetic energy absorber may be disposed around the sensor base. A second kinetic energy absorber may be disposed around the sensor lens. After the round is fired and the pusher exits the gun, the pusher may separate from the projectile body and the second kinetic energy absorber may separate from the imaging sensor.","The sensor lens may include a convex surface that is substantially contiguous with a concave surface of the second kinetic energy absorber. The pusher may include a concave surface that is substantially contiguous with a convex surface of the second kinetic energy absorber.","The projectile body may include a plurality of aft-extending legs. Each leg may include a flat portion that rests on a recessed shoulder of the first kinetic energy absorber. The first kinetic energy absorber may include an annular recessed base for receiving flat portions of the sensor lens.","Another aspect of the invention is a method that may include providing a round and firing the round from a gun. A projectile body in the round may be propelled by a pusher in the round. After the pusher exits the gun and while the round is airborne, the pusher may separate from the projectile body and a kinetic energy absorber may separate from a sensor lens.","The impact of an imaging sensor in the round may be cushioned by a kinetic energy absorber. After impact, the imaging sensor may be used to generate images of an area around the impact point.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","104","102","106","102","104","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["10","102","10","12","14","12","14","17","12","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1B"],"b":["10","14","12","14","16","38","16","38","16","10","10","18","20","22","22","24","22","26","24","28","26","29","16","29","30","32","29"]},"First kinetic energy absorber  may be disposed around sensor base  of imaging sensor .

Projectiles were launched from an air-gun to simulate launch and impact. Some projectiles had kinetic energy absorbers ,  and some projectiles did not. Imaging sensors  were X-rayed after each shot to determine their survivability. Without energy absorbers , , imaging sensor  consistently failed.
