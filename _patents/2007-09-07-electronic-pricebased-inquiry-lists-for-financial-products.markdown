title: Electronic price-based inquiry lists for financial products
abstract: Price-based inquiry lists for financial interests are submitted, negotiated and traded between investors and dealers over a network or networks. An investor interface for display is provided to an investor. A dealer interface for display is provided to a plurality of dealers. The investor can create a price-based inquiry list via the investor interface containing a plurality of inquiries for a corresponding plurality of different financial interests and can transmit the price-based inquiry list to one or more selected dealers, where an established relationship exists between the investor and the dealers. One or more of the selected dealers may provide responses to the received price-based inquiry list, where the response contains one or more offers/bids on the plurality of inquiries contained in the inquiry list via the dealer interface. The respective offers/bids are displayed in the price-based inquiry list on the investor interface. The investor may receive the best response for each bond on the price-based inquiry list and, if desired, execute one or more trades using the investor interface.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The invention relates generally to electronic or electronic assisted trading. More particularly the invention relates to the use of price-based inquiry lists for the purpose of trading, by buying or selling a variety of different financial products or financial instruments with a number of different trading parties.","There are many approaches to bringing buyers and sellers together in financial markets. These approaches can generally be assigned to one of two categories: exchange traded markets, or over-the-counter markets. Market participants face particular challenges to economic efficiency in over-the-counter markets where market-makers are more disparate than on exchanges and assets can trade in multiple locations at multiple prices simultaneously. Over-the-counter trading is prone to the risk of fragmentation wherein certain buyers and sellers do not have access to the full range of liquidity available in the marketplace increasing the costs of execution or even impeding execution. Also, there may be a resultant lack of transparency where some participants do not see the most recent and accurate prices for a given asset, increasing price volatility and decreasing the quality of execution. Although inefficiencies in price discovery from fragmentation and lack of transparency are not limited to over-the-counter markets, they are particularly salient in markets where there is no central exchange to concentrate the communication of buyers and sellers and provide structures to maintain orderly markets.","With the growth of trading financial products (such as, for example, stocks, options, futures, bonds and other fixed income securities, forward contracts, commodities and commodities contracts, and the like) over-the-counter, market participants have an increasing need to add efficiencies in their trading operations. One area where efficiencies have been late to arrive is in inquiry lists\u2014or the ability to request bids or offers on multiple issues simultaneously. This process has conventionally been labor intensive. An institutional investor may put together a list of items to sell and items to buy. These lists are then disseminated to various dealers for reply. For many years this process was done using a combination of paper, telephone, Teletype and fax machines. Lists are sent to one or more dealers with due-in times set for later that day (or beyond). Dealer responses come back to the investor at various times via various means (phone, fax, teletype, etc.). The responses are collated and analyzed by the sender. Ultimately the investor would make decisions to buy or sell (or not buy or sell) based on the analysis of the data. This work is labor intensive for both the institutional investor and the dealer. It is not uncommon for this process to take many man-hours, primarily due to the need to collate the data and then analyze the responses before acting on the responses and then again spend more time on the latter stages of a trade when final pricing and other particulars need to be agreed for each list item.","One area where efficiencies have been late to arrive is in inquiry lists\u2014or the ability to request bids or offers on multiple issues simultaneously.

For example, using a standard email account, investors can post their bid and\/or offer lists to one or more dealers. Recipients of the lists can review the list and respond at or before a specified time. Although this method is more efficient than previous means, investors were still required to collate the responses across several mediums and analyze the responses, and then again through various mediums act on said responses until each item on the list is traded or not traded.","There are many reasons why institutional investors may try to perform multiple transactions at or near the same time. One example of this can be found in the area of portfolio management. For example, portfolio managers and other market participants find the need from time to time to re-balance their portfolios. Although this can and does happen at any time, this is a common occurrence near month end and quarter end. When going through this re-balancing process the portfolio manager may decide to do one or more of the following:\n\n","Conventional methods for trading various quantities of a certain bond or multiple bonds in a secondary market require the seller to locate a buyer or buyers in a \u201cbids-wanted\u201d process. This process utilizes a broker intermediary for settlement in a process that causes the buyer and seller to appear anonymous to each other. There are a number of important disadvantages to these conventional processes.","First, any \u201cbids-wanted\u201d process limits trading to the inventory presented by sellers. Bids-wanted is a seller-initiated process, with buyers in a reactive mode. This is generally consistent with the municipal bonds market focused on by some prior art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,209, issued on Jun. 22, 1999 and entitled \u201cBond Trading System.\u201d The municipal bond market is inventory driven. There are numerous small unique lots of bonds. Municipal bond buyers peruse lists of bonds each day that are available either in the secondary market or by primary offerings. Broker\/dealers in the municipal bond market act predominantly on an agency basis connecting buyers and sellers since municipal bonds do not have an active \u201cbonds borrowed\u201d market that would enable sellers to sell bonds they don't own (i.e. \u201cshort\u201d bonds). This contrasts with the government bond market and the corporate bond market where there are active security lending markets. The MA system allows for offer lists as well as bid lists. Offer lists allow the buyer to initiate a process, selecting a bond or list of bonds for trading from a reference database without limitation as to whether or not such bond is any system participants' inventory. The offer list allows the buyer to present a list of desired bonds to a selected group of dealers whereupon each dealer may return with offers. The MA system maintains a reference database of potential issues that may be selected, in a manner that buyers and sellers accept as an acceptable standard for defining the bond to be transacted.","Second, a broker intermediated anonymous settlement process is fundamentally different from a direct counter-party settlement where the parties are known to each other prior to trade execution. The prior art broker process allows various parties to trade with each other without those parties having any established financial or credit relationship with each other. The various parties need only have a credit relationship with the central broker in order to conduct their transactions. In the past, this was the most feasible method of conducting such transactions because of the unwieldy task of creating, maintaining, and referencing a database of unique and dynamic trading and credit relationships between numerous parties in the financial markets. However, this presents multiple limitations to investors, particularly to investors in less liquid products (e.g., products which do not mostly trade on an exchange), investors in credit products such as corporate bonds, and also to large investors.","Investors in less liquid or illiquid products derive considerable economic value from developing and maintaining direct relationships with a number of dealer market-makers who, on the basis of that relationship, are willing to take risk as a principal (i.e. put up their own balance sheet) to buy bonds from the investor or sell bonds that they do not own to the investor. This liquidity expectation reduces the liquidity component of an investor's net value at risk. In the past, the investor had to balance the needs to maintain relationship versus the economic efficiencies of being able to show bonds, for example on a bids-wanted basis, to a large number of dealer in a timely manner. The MA system allows the investor to gain the economic efficiency of instantaneous communication with many without having to give up the ability to transact business in a way that counts towards their relationship building. The MA system establishes a number of criteria required for participation and provides a unique facility that permits the creation, maintenance, and referencing of thousands of distinct economic relationships. These relationships are defined across a matrix including legal entities, members of legal entities, products, and jurisdictions. The MA system provides for the instantaneous retrieval and control by these relationships at the moment of bid or offer list creation by an investor. The investor can see their relationships in the MA system, and can select from those relationships and transact by directly with those relationships.","The preferred embodiments of the invention provide an electronic interface providing clients with the ability to create and submit multi-issue, price-based inquiries to multi-dealers, via one integrated system. The system then allows for multi-dealer responses to these multi-issue, price-based inquiries and allows for the client to execute (trade on) any one or more of the issues.","Instead of relying on a central broker to maintain the anonymity of the buyer and seller, the preferred embodiments of the invention use a model where the potential counterparties (the investor and the dealer recipients) have an established relationship. All price-based inquiry list negotiations and trades are done without intermediation of a third party. The buyer and seller of each instrument are fully known to each other throughout the trading process.","A preferred implementation of the invention is a device, such as a computer, that enables performing the entire list transaction process from entry of interests to completion of transaction. The device is self-contained in being able to gather, disseminate, and process information relevant to list transactions, and make state transitions based upon that information. This streamlined approach adds efficiencies by reducing the amount of time and errors associated with the process.","The preferred embodiments of the invention employ various trading protocols depending on instrument type and industry convention. It is determined merely, by the nature of the instrument, whether or not the item is traded in a one-step price method, two-step yield\/price or discount margin\/price method or a three-step spread\/benchmark price\/bond price method.","At all times each participant to a price-based inquiry list is aware of the protocol employed, the current state of the list, the time remaining in that state, and what is expected of each participant during each state. This method adds order and efficiency to a process that was beforehand less organized and therefore more time-consuming.","Instead of being limited to addressing the sellers concerns by providing for a \u201cbids wanted\u201d process, the preferred embodiments of the invention provide for price-based inquiry lists to be in the form of either bid list or offer list, each list containing multiple identifiers. All individual items in the list are independent from other items. The ability to create and submit the items together is primarily done to allow the user to perform the work more efficiently.","As part of creating the list, list initiators set various parameters such as the specific identifiers on the list, whether the items are traded as outright or crossed with an underlying benchmark, the \u201cdue in\u201d time for the responses, the \u201cgood for\u201d time for which each response is actionable and a selection of dealer(s) to receive the list.","The preferred embodiments of the invention allow the sender to initiate a process, selecting a bond or list of bonds for trading from a reference database without limitation as to whether or not such bond is in any system participants' inventory. Once the items are selected and a corresponding size for each item entered, and other relevant parameters set, the price-based inquiry list can be presented simultaneously to a selected group of dealers whereupon each dealer may return with spread, yield, discount margin or price levels (depending on instrument type) where they are willing to transact on each list item.","During and after the price-based inquiry list has been submitted, both the list initiator and dealer can easily recall the list from their activity console (and at certain points download the information). All items on the list are \u201crolled-up\u201d and displayed as one line item. By clicking on the line item the user can \u201cexplode\u201d the list and see each individual item in the list as well as the status of each line item.","The preferred embodiments of the invention streamline the entire trading process from list creation through trade negotiation and execution.","In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, systems and methods for creating and executing price-based inquiry lists between an initiator and multiple respondents are provided. A list creation state that that allows an initiator to enter an inquiry list of items of buying or selling interest with select volumes may be provided. The list creation state may then transition to a list response state. The list response state transmits the inquiry list to one or more dealers and then receives one or more offers or bids for one or more items on the inquiry list from the one or more dealers. In response to receiving two or more offers or bids for an item of the inquiry list, the best responses for each item on the inquiry list may be selected.","The list response state may then transition to a list trade state. The list trade state provides the initiator with an opportunity to execute a trade on one or more items on the inquiry list at the best responses. The prices for the items on the price-based inquiry list are determined based on the best responses received from the one or more dealers. After, for example, the \u201cdue in\u201d timer expiring, the list trade state transitions to a list complete state. The list complete state may provide the initiator and the one or more dealers with a notification indicating whether each item on the list was traded or not traded.","It should be noted that no further action is needed by the initiator or the one or more dealers to complete the trade. It should also be noted that the initiator and the one or more dealers have an established relationship prior to entering the list creation state.","In some embodiments, a subject state may be provided, where the subject state provides the initiator with an opportunity to request a repeat from one or more dealers that previously provided best responses.","In some embodiments, a notification to a dealer that provided a best response for an item on the inquiry list may be transmitted, where the notification indicates to that dealer that the initiator remains interested in executing a trade on that item.","In some embodiments, the initiator may be provided with an opportunity to select a dealer for requesting a repeat when two or more dealers are tied for providing a best response.","In some embodiments, a subject state timer is provided and a request for repeat for an item on the inquiry list may be made when the subject state timer has not expired.","In some embodiments, the initiator and the one or more dealers that provided best responses may be prevented from negotiating.","In some embodiments, a response to the request for repeat may be received from a dealer. In response, the system may automatically trade the particular item from the dealer and notify the initiator and the dealer of the trade.","Thus, there has been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.","In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.","As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and description matter in which there are illustrated preferred embodiments of the invention.","In accordance with the present invention, systems and methods for creating and executing items (e.g., financial instruments, security instruments, and the like) in a price-based inquiry list are provided. Price-based inquiry lists for financial interests are submitted, negotiated and traded between investors and dealers over a network or networks. The investor or initiator can create a price-based inquiry list via one or more investor interfaces including a plurality of inquiries for a plurality of different financial interests. The price-based inquiry list may be transmitted to one or more dealers selected by the initiator, where an established relationship exists between the initiator and the dealers. One or more of the selected dealers may provide responses to the received price-based inquiry list, where the responses may contain one or more offers or bids on the plurality of inquiries contained in the price-based inquiry list. The respective offers\/bids are displayed to the initiator in the price-based inquiry list. The initiator may receive the best response for each item on the price-based inquiry list and, if desired, execute one or more trades using the interface.","Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.

Thus, the specific order of steps described herein is not to be considered implying a specific sequence of steps to perform the process. Other alterations or modifications of the above processes are also contemplated. For example, further insubstantial approximations of the process and\/or algorithms are also considered within the scope of the processes described herein.","In addition, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on other embodiments to yield a still further embodiment. Additionally, certain features may be interchanged with similar devices or features not mentioned yet which perform the same or similar functions. It is therefore intended that such modifications and variations are included within the totality of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","112","114","116","110","120","112","112"]},"Syndication generally refers to the process of having a group of banks acting together, to underwrite a new issue of bonds. Specifically, the syndication functions  include providing a calendar of new issues, including the managers of the issue, details of the issue (sometimes referred to as a \u201cterm sheet\u201d), such as type of bond issue, term, coupon, rating, announcement date, pricing date and so forth. The syndication function  may also include links to on-line prospectuses for the issues, and marketing presentations. The syndication function  also allows investors to submit indications of interest (IOIs) in new bond issues to allow the underwriters\/dealers to determine the demand for the issue. The dealers will track the investors IOIs in the Issue Book and subsequently allocate those orders and set a final price. The research and marketing information  functions may include on-line research reports regarding the bond issues, announcements, and other data and analytics, which are tools for analyzing bond issues.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["220","230","220","230","250","230","250","220","220","230","250","220","210","220"]},"In one possible implementation, the investors  communicate with the data center  via an Internet-Protocol based network . Network  may be the Internet or a portion of network  may comprise a portion of the Internet. The dealers  may communicate with the data center  via secure leased lines , such as Ti lines. Of course, other variations are possible, but the implementation shown is believed to be appropriate for situations where the number of dealers  is relatively small, and the number of investors  is relatively large.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["220","1","1"]},"As shown in , the software in the computer or data processing system is preferably comprised of a distribution manager , a presentation manager , a transaction engine , a RV message bus  \u201cconnecting\u201d each of the above, and a database . It should be understood that these elements are logically distinct, but need not be physically distinct or even distinct in their programming, such as constituting different executable program files or different modules. Database  is separate and distinct, and is preferably a conventional relational database with interfaces available to permit data to be saved, modified and retrieved quickly in real-time or near real-time.","Distribution manager  includes a session manager which is responsible for authenticating and establishing connections between the trading system and the external users and dealers. It also manages the communication sessions between the trading system and the users. Preferably, distribution manager uses or is based upon commercially available software suitable for carrying out these functions. It should be understood that the users and dealers need not use standard Internet browser software for communications. Indeed, it is preferable that the parties utilize software that is well suited for trading in financial interests and pass messages according to a suitable messaging protocol, such as messages according to a predefined XML data definition set.","Presentation manager  carries out a paint screen function which merges a screen layout with data from transaction engine  to provide a complete screen display (\u201cpaint user screens\u201d). It also performs rudimentary functions relating to the entry of data on displayed inquiry lists. It validates data as it is entered or edited in an inquiry list by a user (client). If a user leaves an inquiry list edit page, it saves the inquiry list in database . If a user returns to an inquiry list edit page, presentation manager  retrieves the saved inquiry list from database . If a user submits an inquiry list to one or more dealers, then it deletes the list from database . Many of the functions may be carried out using known software program elements or they be carried out using program elements developed specifically for this trading system or similar trading systems.","Transaction engine  executes most of the logic associated with the trading system. It submits the inquiry lists, receives and aggregates the dealers' responses to the inquiry list, and depending on instrument type manages the spread, yield, discounted margin or price responses and if necessary the spot responses, and submits the final price for items on the inquiry list to the dealers and users. This aggregation occurs automatically as dealers' responses are received without the need for any intervention by the user.","Although transaction engine  can be implemented in different ways, it preferably creates an independent thread for each individual item on an inquiry list. Each such thread (a \u201cworker\u201d thread) is responsible for functions and actions unique to its individual item. For example, each worker thread asynchronously saves an associated inquiry in database . For each inquiry list, there are a number of worker threads corresponding to the number of items in the inquiry list and a master thread. The master thread carries out the functions common to all items in the inquiry list. For example, it sends the list alert for submitted lists to the dealers and starts the \u201cDue In\u201d timer described below.","Transaction engine  updates each item in the inquiry list as dealers respond thereto with, depending on instrument type, spread, yield, discount margin or price, or pass on the item. When the Due In timer expires, each thread saves the responses in database  and sends a response alert to the user. The threads also update the item as the user takes action on the dealers' responses by either hitting, lifting or passing, and saves the response to the database . Depending on instrument type it may then start a Spot Request Timer, sends a \u201cDONE-ASC\u201d (Done-awaiting spot confirmation) alert and an auto spot request to all contributing dealers as described in more detail below.","When required the transaction engine  also receives spot prices as the dealers respond, calculates the composite spot when the Spot Request Timer expires, and calculates yield in the spotting process. The threads for each item in the individual inquiry list save this information to database  and send the \u201cDONE-APC\u201d (Done-awaiting price confirmation) alert to the dealer. The transaction engine  also updates each item in the inquiry list as dealers submit the final price and sends a final price alert to the user. It updates the data and saves it to the database when the user agrees to the final price and sends a \u201cDONE\u201d alert to the corresponding dealer.","RV Message Bus  is not a physical data bus. It is a software interface between distribution manager , presentation manager , and transaction engine  that allows information to be passed there between. Such software is commercially available from Tibco, Inc. and similar software is commercially available from other sources.","Whereas  illustrates the inquiry list process from a system and logical standpoint,  illustrates a high level state diagram of an inquiry list business process carried out by a computer system from its inception through to its conclusion.  continue to describe in greater detail the flow of an inquiry list process from a user's point of view including various decision points and alternate flows depending on those decisions.","In  the inquiry list process begins when the list initiator selects the \u201cBid\/Offer List\u201d option from the main view (). He is then presented with an inquiry list edit screen (). During the edit list state, the list initiator is creating a new list or modifying a list that was either previously sent or previously created but not sent. The list initiator populates the inquiry list by selecting items from an instrument database provided by the system or by selecting items from his uploaded portfolios. For each instrument on the inquiry list the list initiator then enters a size or amount that he wants to transact.","As defined by the system, certain financial instrument types require the list initiator to select a corresponding benchmark instrument. The benchmark instrument is selected from a separate group of system-defined instruments. During the negotiation and trading phase the financial instrument is quoted on a spread basis in relation to the selected benchmark instrument. After a spread is agreed, this benchmark instrument is used to price the financial instrument (the traded instrument).","For financial instruments that require the selection of a benchmark instrument, the list initiator must select the method for trading. The list initiator can choose to trade the financial instrument \u201coutright\u201d as a single transaction, or \u201ccross\u201d the instrument selected with the chosen benchmark instrument. For each item where \u201ccross\u201d is selected, the list initiator is looking to perform two simultaneous or near simultaneous opposing transactions; the buy\/sell of the financial instrument and the sell\/buy of the selected benchmark instrument.","After the list initiator enters in all the required information including the selection of the dealers for which he wants to send the list, he submits the list.","Once the list is submitted, it immediately goes into a Due At State (). Recipients of the list are alerted that a list has been received. When the recipient opens the list, they can submit responses to any or all items on the list. Responses are sent to the list initiator during the response due in time. The list initiator can see the number of respondents, but all responses are kept in a \u201cholding bin\u201d and are not released or visible to the list initiator until the due in time has expired.","When the \u201cdue in\u201d time expires, the \u201cgood for\u201d timer begins to count down in Good For State (). All responses to items on the list are presented to the list initiator in a straightforward manner. The list initiator is presented with all the responses to each inquiry with the \u201cbest\u201d response and the \u201ccover\u201d (second best response) to each inquiry displayed on the same screen and along side each other. The list initiator can pass (elect to not trade) on any or all items or he can execute trades by \u201chitting\u201d or \u201clifting\u201d the response submitted\u2014all from the main screen. The list initiator can do this in rapid succession until he has acted on all the items or until the \u201cgood for\u201d time has expired. All items that are passed on by the list initiator will go into a DNT (Did not trade) state. All items that are traded (by hitting or lifting) will go into one of two states. Those items that require a benchmark price will go into a \u201cDone-Awaiting Spot Confirmation\u201d (Done-ASC) state, while traded items that do not require benchmark pricing will immediately go into a \u201cDone-Awaiting Price Confirmation\u201d (Done-APC) state.","After the list initiator has acted on all items on the list and has traded on at least one list item or when the \u201cgood for\u201d timer has expired (whichever comes first) the invention moves the process into a Spotting State () and a new spot timer begins counting down. The spotting phase provides for the investor to request a spot price for each traded item that requires the pricing of an underlying benchmark (items in the Done-ASC state) to ultimately determine the final dollar price of the traded security. The spot price may be set through an auto spot process as described in detail below or it may be set through some other spot process. After receipt of the spot price the list initiator acts by either accepting or rejecting the spot price.","Each Done-ASC line item where the spot price has been agreed to by the list initiator will move into a \u201cDone-Awaiting Price Confirmation\u201d (Done-APC) state or Pricing State (). During this pricing phase, the list initiator is presented with the final dollar price for the spotted items.

When clients join the platform, they are required to provide documentation that lists the legal entities for which they want to be approved to trade with and the market segments and products for which they want to trade in. This information is passed on to the dealers who are on the platform. Dealers are then required to authorize a trading relationship for each client and client user on a product-by-product level. The preferred embodiments of the invention provide for a database to store and manage this information and for the instantaneous retrieval and enforcement by these relationships at the moment the client exits from the List Start State ().","Step  permits the list initiator to select dealers where a pre-approved relationship exists.

The preferred embodiment illustrated in  provides for both manual and automatic spotting methods.","If \u2018auto spot\u2019 is used as the method to spot, then all traded list items that require the spotting of an underlying benchmark will be priced on an automated basis. The automated spot process may occur when the list initiator, via a sender interface, requests from the system a spot price for the benchmark. The \u201cauto spot\u201d function utilizes an application programming interface (API) that allows the respondent dealer or the system to provide a spot price to the list initiator upon his request without human intervention. As one example, a system may be configured to use the \u201cauto spot\u201d feature when the following conditions exist: 1) the list initiator selects \u201cauto spot\u201d as the spot method when the list was originally sent; 2) the system value for \u201cuse auto spot\u201d for that dealer=yes; 3) the inquiry size (quantity) for that line item is less than or equal to the system \u201cauto spot\u201d value set for that dealer; and 4) the dealer does not override the \u201cuse autospot\u201d selection",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 6","FIG. 5A and 5B"],"b":["552","552","601"]},"a) If the system value for \u201cuse own spot price\u201d for that dealer=yes; then the invention will use the dealer provided benchmark price and present it to the list initiator (steps -).","b) If the system value for \u201cuse own spot price\u201d for that dealer=no; then the invention will provide a system-derived \u201ccomposite\u201d benchmark price and present it to the list initiator (steps -).","The system determines at step  whether or not a composite benchmark spot price is to be provided. If the system determines that a composite benchmark spot price is not to be provided, then the auto spot request is submitted to a single counterparty only and steps - are performed. At step , it is determined whether the counterparty has responded. If so, the result is sent at step  and can be displayed to the dealer. If the counterparty has not responded, then at step  it is checked whether or not a response due timer has expired. If the response due timer has not expired, then step  is repeated. If the response due timer has expired, then the spot process is deemed to have failed (step ). This result is also sent at step .","If the system determines at step  that a composite benchmark spot price is to be provided, then the system will submit the \u201cauto spot\u201d request to all participating dealers that have \u201ccontribute to composite price\u201d=yes. A system-defined response due timer is started, and it is determined at step  whether all dealers have responded. If not, then the response due timer is checked to determine if it has expired at step , and step  is repeated until the timer has expired or all dealers have responded. If the timer expires before all dealers have responded, then it is determined at step  whether or not a response quota of a minimum number of dealers have been reached and responded with a spot price. If the response quota has not been reached, then the method proceeds to steps  and .","If the response quota has been reached and a minimum number of respondents exist, then a system-defined calculation is performed at step  to determine the composite price.","The composite spot price is then sent at step  and can be displayed to the list initiator.","Requesting Auto Spot for Multiple List Items","In further preferred embodiments of the invention (not illustrated), the list initiator is enabled to submit one auto spot request for all traded items that use the same benchmark. In the likely event that multiple traded list items use the same benchmark, the list initiator, rather then submitting individual auto spot requests, can streamline the spotting process by selecting this option. When this option is selected, the system will attempt to use one auto spot request to satisfy multiple traded items. After requesting one spot price for all list items that use the same benchmark, the system will check to see which of the dealers use the composite auto spot price. For all dealers that use the composite price, the system will retrieve and present one spot price to the list initiator. If accepted, the benchmark spot price will be used to price all of the traded items from those dealers using that benchmark. For dealers that do not use the composite spot price, the system will require the list initiator to request individual auto spots.","Regardless of the auto spot method used, after the list initiator selects \u201crequest spot\u201d, and a spot price is presented to the list initiator, the list initiator has a predetermined period of time (i.e., 10 seconds) to accept the price provided. If the list initiator does not act on the price within the allotted period of time, then the price presented is no longer valid. The list initiator can \u201crequest spot\u201d a predetermined number of times. Each time the list initiator requests a spot for the predetermined number of times, a new spot price is provided via the auto spot function and a new timer begins to count down. The spot timer is a system configurable value that can be reduced or expanded as market convention dictates.","The \u201cauto-spot\u201d implementation allows the investor to request spot prices for multiple list items in one action, or in rapid succession, thus greatly reducing the time it takes to spot over the phone or by some other means. Whereas in prior art the spotting process for all traded list items could take many minutes or hours, the auto spot function of this invention allows for the same work to be completed in a manner of seconds. Therefore this auto-spot functionality adds a high degree of efficiency to the overall inquiry list process from both the investor and the dealer's perspective.","Presentation of Responses","Other features also add efficiency by allowing pricing to be handled in advantageous manner for a number of list items potentially being traded at or near the same time. In particular, a user interface is provided which facilitates the execution of multi-dealer, multi-issue trades via a single screen. These features streamline and automate the conventional process and add efficiencies by reducing the amount of time and number of errors.","All the best responses to the items on the inquiry list are presented to the user in a straight forward manner on one single screen. The user is presented with the \u201cbest\u201d response to each item on one screen, and has the ability to easily display all of the responses to each item. The user can view details of each response in rapid succession as desired and then choose to either: 1) execute trades by \u201chitting\u201d of \u201clifting\u201d on the dealer responses, or 2) not execute trades by passing on the dealer responses\u2014all from a single display screen until he has completed all the items.","In addition, the user interface makes it easy to display the \u201ccover\u201d (second best response) in conjunction with the best response. For example, the cover can be displayed to the client on the same screen as, and along side, the best response to each item on the list. This gives the client a quick point of reference with respect to the best response for each item on the list.","In the case where the list initiator executes with the dealer with the best response, then the following presentations may occur. The user interface may also display the cover to the dealer returning the best response for a list item after that list item has been hit or lifted. For every item where a dealer returned the best response, that dealer will be shown the value of the cover. The dealer is thus given a point of reference of his executed response (the best) with respect to the cover. In addition, for every list item, the dealer with the second best response (\u201ccover\u201d) will be notified as such thus giving him immediate feedback as to the position of his response. Other respondent dealers are notified that the list item traded without any additional information.","The system does not prevent the list initiator from trading with respondents other than the dealer with the best response. In the case where the list initiator does not execute with the best response, then similar information is displayed to the best respondent and the executing respondent. For example, the user interface may also display the best response to the executing respondent of a list item after that list item has been hit or lifted. The executing dealer is thus given a point of reference of his response with respect to the best response. For every item where that dealer was the best response but the initiator did not trade the item with that dealer, that dealer will be notified as such thus giving him immediate feedback as to the position of his response. Other respondent dealers are notified that the list item traded without any additional information.","A variety of different user interfaces may be employed to implement these features.  are example screen displays containing user interfaces for creating and submitting inquiry lists in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. These screen displays and included user interfaces are preferably provided by a viewer software application installed on computer .","Preferably, interface  generated by the viewer application includes a plurality of high-level buttons or the like -, which are displayed across all client screens, and specific information displayed pursuant to the process flow of a selected button is displayed below high-level buttons -. Preferably, the currently selected high-level button is indicated on the screen, such as by highlighting the selected button or displaying the selected button in a color different than the other buttons. The high-level buttons offer different process flows to the functions of the system and do not necessarily provide mutually exclusive functions. In other words, it may be possible to perform the same function through a different sequence beginning with a different high-level button. The buttons - may be arranged in any manner. In the embodiment shown in , the \u201cMy Portfolios\u201d button  is located to the right side of \u201cBid\/Offer List\u201d button , which in turn is located to the right side of the Trade button , and there is a space between the Inventory, ACTIVEs, Trade, Bid\/Offer List, My Portfolios buttons - and the Activity and Blotter buttons  and . Inventory button  allows an investor to selectively view an available inventory of financial products that are being offered or bid on by dealers in the secondary (resale) market. The inventory contributions may be entered manually by the dealers at their respective interfaces, and\/or imported from a database. The inventory accessed by inventory button  preferably contains indicative rather than executable prices (although both types of inventory may be present in the trading system). Indicative inventory refers to those financial products posted by a dealer along with the terms, such as the spread, with which they contemplate they might execute a trade for those financial products. The financial products may or may not actually ultimately trade at or near the indicated spread because of negotiation, competition from other dealers or other factors. On the other hand, executable inventory refers to financial products offered for trade as active bond issues accessible through active button  described below.","The investor may click on \u201cactives\u201d button  or the like to view offers and\/or bids on actively traded securities. Instead of indicative inventory, actives button  accesses only the bonds in executable inventory which a dealer is willing to buy or sell and is firm with respect to the terms of those bonds. Therefore, actives button  is used for trade orders where there is no negotiation rather than simple inquiries with negotiated trading.","The investor may initiate an inquiry (which may or may not ultimately be used for a trade of a selected financial product) using the \u201ctrade\u201d button  or the like. Preferably, an inquiry screen is initially displayed in response to the user clicking on trade button . Such an initial inquiry screen may have a field that allows a user to search for financial products, and various empty fields relating to a financial product (such as, Product, Rating, Issuer, Ticker, Coupon, Maturity, and\/or Identifier) that are automatically populated and filled in as the user searches or otherwise selects financial products. The user manually fills in a size field with an amount that might be traded and selects a \u201cRequest Bid\u201d radio button or a \u201cRequest Offer\u201d radio button to submit an inquiry. The investor seeking to buy an issue will select \u201coffers\u201d to view the offer or selling terms of the dealers, while an investor seeking to sell an issue will select \u201cbids\u201d to view the bid or buying terms of the dealers. Moreover, while separate interfaces may be provided for offered and bid issues, it is possible to have a combined interface that lists both offered and bid issues. The selected financial product may not be in the inventory, or the user may not see a bond in inventory they are interested in buying, and may select trade button  to get a blank trade form or inquiry form to search for that bond. Thus, an investor (user) may use trade button  to submit an inquiry for a financial product which is contained in an available database, but not in an inventory accessed through inventory button .","Clicking on the \u201cBid\/Offer List\u201d button  will bring the user to an \u201cInquiry List\u201d view, such as the Inquiry List view  shown in , which will allow them to create and submit the inquiry list. The screen may be set to default to Bid List or Offer List, with the client being able to override the default and choose a bid list or offer list by clicking on a Bid List radio button or an Offer List radio button, respectively. Alternatively, the system can be configured or configurable so that there is no default and the user must select either Bid List or Offer List before submitting a list. Bid and offer requests cannot be co-mingled on the same list. The name on the header of the Inquiry List view will change from Bid List to Offer List depending on the type of list selected by the user.","The Inquiry List view may have any layout. In the embodiment shown in , the items in the inquiry list are displayed in a grid  on the left side of the screen. The Bid List and Offer List radio buttons and the settings\/choices for the selected bid or offer inquiry list are on the right side of the screen. Clients can create a bid\/offer inquiry list with any number of issues up to the maximum number of lines offered in the grid. Preferably, the number of lines is configurable on a system wide basis, with a maximum of, for example, 16 lines.","There are seven column headings -.

For example, money market equivalent (MME) bond issues and non-MME bond issues may both be available, in which case, \u201cN\/A\u201d will be displayed in the benchmark field for MME issues. (Money market equivalent bond issues are generally considered to be those issues having a maturity of 13 months or less.) Cross column indicates if the transaction will be versus a Treasury or an Outright transaction. The fields in Identifier column  are editable fields during the creation of the Inquiry List. The fields in Ticker column , Coupon column , and Maturity column  are not editable since the values in these fields will be dictated by the CUSIP entered in the field in Identifier column . The fields in the Sz(000)s column , Benchmark column  and Cross column  only become editable once the user enters a CUSIP into the Identifier column .

Using the inquiry list edit screen or any other suitable screen, the list initiator may create a new price-based inquiry list, modify a list that was previously sent, modify a list that was previously created but not sent, etc. The list initiator may populate the inquiry list by, for example, selecting items from an instrument database provided by the system, selecting items from his uploaded portfolios, inputting a ticker in a ticker field, inputting an ISIN number in an identifier field, etc. For each item on the inquiry list, the list initiator may also enter additional information, such as the size or the amount that the list initiator would like to transact.","As described previously, the list initiator may select to transmit the price-based inquiry list to one or more dealers.

When the recipient opens the list, that recipient may submit one or more responses to one or more of the items on the price-based inquiry list. Responses are then sent to the list initiator during the response due in time. The list initiator can see the number of respondents, but all responses are kept in a \u201cholding bin\u201d and are not released or visible to the list initiator until the due in time has expired.","In some embodiments, an indicator, such as an alert or a reminder, may be provided to each respondent (or list recipient) to inform the respondent that the prices (responses) inputted in response to one or more items on the list will be released to the list initiator at a given time and that the respondent has an opportunity to review the list and the inputted prices. An alert or any other suitable indicator may be provided to each respondent at a given time prior to the expiration of the \u201cdue in\u201d timer (e.g., one minute, five minutes, thirty seconds, or any other suitable time). For example, a respondent may be provided with an alert one minute prior to the \u201cdue in\u201d timer expiring. The alert may inform the respondent that, for example, the one or more responses and prices inputted by the respondent will be released to the list initiator upon the expiration of the \u201cdue in\u201d timer.","In some embodiments, the alert may also prompt the respondent with questions, such as \u201cDo you want to review the list?\u201d The alert may provide the user with a suitable interface, such as \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d buttons. In response to the respondent selecting the \u201cYes\u201d button, the respondent may be provided with a list response screen or any other suitable display that allows the respondent to review the inputted responses (e.g., prices) and allow the respondent to adjust the responses. Alternatively, if the respondent selects the \u201cNo\u201d button, the alert may terminate or close.","When the \u201cdue in\u201d timer expires, the process enters the list trade state (step ). In the list trade state, the \u201cgood for\u201d timer begins to count down and responses to items on the inquiry list are presented to the list initiator. For example, the list initiator may be presented with the \u201cbest\u201d response to each item (e.g., the highest bid, the highest offer, etc.) on the inquiry list. The responses from the respondents or dealers may be sorted and the highest response for each item may be displayed to the initiator on the inquiry list. Alternatively, the list initiator may be presented with the \u201cbest\u201d response and the \u201ccover\u201d (second best response) to each inquiry displayed on the same screen and along side each other. The list initiator may pass (elect to not trade) on one or more of the responses. The list initiator may execute trades by \u201chitting\u201d or \u201clifting\u201d the responses submitted. The list initiator may perform this in rapid succession until the list initiator has acted on all the items or until the \u201cgood for\u201d time has expired. The items that are passed on by the list initiator (not traded) will go into a DNT (Did not trade) state. The items that are traded (by hitting or lifting) advance to \u201cDone\u201d or list complete state (step ). No further action is required by the list initiator or recipient to complete the trade in at least one embodiment. For example, in response to executing trades on one or more of the items in the inquiry list, the list initiator may be provided with a confirmation display including details of the trades.","In some embodiments, when the \u201cgood for\u201d time expires, the \u201cSubject\u201d grace timer begins to count down in a subject state (step ). While the subject grace timer counts down, the list initiator may act on any remaining items that were not acted on in the Good for State by, for example:","1) The list initiator may pass (elect not to trade) on one or more of the items. Items that are passed on by the list initiator enter a DNT (Did Not Trade) state.","2) The list initiator may attempt to execute trades on one or more items by \u201crequesting a repeat\u201d of those items' best initial responses.","By requesting a repeat of the best initial response to a list item, the list initiator is performing the following:\n\n","In some embodiments, one or more of the following constraints may apply when requesting for a repeat:\n\n","In some embodiments, the list initiator may request a repeat by, for example:\n\n","When the list initiator requests a repeat from the list recipient that provided the best response, the list recipient may be provided with a pop-up window or any other suitable indication. The list recipient may respond to the request while the subject grace timer is counting by, for example:\n\n","When the list recipient receives the request for repeat from the list initiator, the list recipient may accept or decline the request by, for example:\n\n","When the subject grace timer expires, items that have not been acted upon by the list initiator or list recipient will go into the DNT (Did Not Trade) state.","As shown in , , and , the price-based inquiry list process begins with creating an inquiry list (step  of ). For example, when the list initiator selects a \u201cBid\/Offer List\u201d option (option  of ) from a main view or any other suitable screen, the list initiator is presented with an inquiry list edit screen. Using the inquiry list edit screen or any other suitable screen, the list initiator may create a new price-based inquiry list, modify a list that was previously sent, modify a list that was previously created but not sent, etc.","In some embodiments, the list initiator may select a particular type of list (option  of ). For example, as shown in , the list initiator has selected the list type \u201cEmerging Mkts (Price),\u201d which is a price-based list for emerging markets. Alternatively, a particular list type may be set within the list initiator's preferences or a default list type may be automatically selected.","The list initiator may input item into the price-based inquiry list (step  of ). For example, the user may select items from an instrument database provided by the system, select items from his uploaded portfolios, input a ticker in a ticker field of the inquiry list, input an ISIN number in an identifier field of the inquiry list, etc. (item  of ). For each item on the inquiry list, the list initiator may also enter any other suitable information, such as the size or the amount that the list initiator would like to transact. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, the list initiator may be required to input certain information like size prior to submitting the price-based list. For example, the system may prevent the list initiator from submitting the list (e.g., disabling the \u201cSubmit\u201d button) until certain information is inputted by the list initiator (e.g., ticker, size, etc.).","The list initiator may also, using the display, select a \u201cdue in\u201d time and a \u201cgood for\u201d time (step  of ). For example, the list initiator may select a \u201cdue in\u201d time of three minutes, and a \u201cgood for\u201d time of one minute within the inquiry list display (options  of ). Responses from recipients of the inquiry list are sent to the list initiator during the response due in time. While the list initiator may see the number of respondents or recipients, the one or more responses from one or more of the respondents are placed in a \u201cholding bin\u201d and are not released or visible to the list initiator until the due in time has expired.","The list initiator may select to transmit the price-based inquiry list to one or more dealers (step  of ) (dealer options  of ). Again, instead of relying on a central broker to maintain the anonymity of the buyer and seller, the preferred embodiments of the invention use a model where the potential counterparties (the list initiator and the dealer recipients) have an established relationship. All inquiry list negotiations and trades are done without intermediation of a third party. The buyer and seller of each instrument or item are fully known to each other throughout the trading process.","In response to, for example, creating the price-based inquiry list, selecting one or more dealers to transmit the list, and select \u201cdue in\u201d time and \u201cgood for\u201d time parameters, the list initiator may submit the list by selecting a \u201cSubmit\u201d button (button  of ). In response to submitting the inquiry list, the price-based inquiry list is transmitted to the selected dealers (step  of ).","In some embodiments, the list initiator may be provided with a confirmation screen (screen ) to confirm the submission of the price-based inquiry list.","Dealers that receive the list may be alerted that a list has been received. When the recipient opens the list, that recipient may submit one or more responses to one or more of the items on the price-based inquiry list. Responses are then sent to the list initiator during the response due in time. The list initiator can see the number of respondents, but all responses are kept in a \u201cholding bin\u201d and are not released or visible to the list initiator until the due in time has expired.","In some embodiments, an indicator, such as an alert or a reminder, may be provided to each respondent (or list recipient) to inform the respondent that the prices (responses) inputted in response to one or more items on the list will be released to the list initiator at a given time and that the respondent has an opportunity to review the list and the inputted prices. An alert or any other suitable indicator may be provided to each respondent at a given time prior to the expiration of the \u201cdue in\u201d timer (e.g., one minute, five minutes, thirty seconds, or any other suitable time). For example, a respondent may be provided with an alert one minute prior to the \u201cdue in\u201d timer expiring. The alert may inform the respondent that, for example, the one or more responses and prices inputted by the respondent will be released to the list initiator upon the expiration of the \u201cdue in\u201d timer.","In some embodiments, the alert may also prompt the respondent with questions, such as \u201cDo you want to review the list?\u201d The alert may provide the user with a suitable interface, such as \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d buttons. In response to the respondent selecting the \u201cYes\u201d button, the respondent may be provided with a list response screen or any other suitable display that allows the respondent to review the inputted responses (e.g., prices) and allow the respondent to adjust the responses. Alternatively, if the respondent selects the \u201cNo\u201d button, the alert may terminate or close.","When the \u201cdue in\u201d time expires, the process enters the list trade state. In the list trade state, the \u201cgood for\u201d timer begins to count down and responses to items on the inquiry list are presented to the list initiator and the list initiator is provided with the opportunity to execute trades on one or more of the received responses (step  of ). The list initiator may pass (elect to not trade) on one or more of the responses. The list initiator may execute trades by \u201chitting\u201d or \u201clifting\u201d the responses submitted. The list initiator may perform this in rapid succession until the list initiator has acted on all the items or until the \u201cgood for\u201d time has expired. For example, the list initiator may be presented with the \u201cbest\u201d response or \u201cbest\u201d price to each item on the inquiry list. The prices provided in the responses from the respondents are the prices that the trades are executed. Accordingly, the items that are traded (by hitting or lifting) advance to \u201cDone\u201d or list complete state.","In some embodiments, the price may be calculated by the trading system. For example, because the list initiator and the respondent have an established relationship, the list initiator and the respondent may have a history of trades executed between them. When a price has not been indicated by the respondent in the list response, the trading system may use the last price transacted on between the list initiator and the respondent.","Alternatively, the list initiator may send a request to the respondent inquiring as to whether the respondent is interested in executing a trade for an item at the same price as done in the past (e.g., same as last time). The list initiator may be provided with a historical price-based list, where the initiator inputs the item for trading and selects dealers that the list initiator has traded with in the past. In response to a respondent accepting the request, the trading system may determine the last price (e.g., from a database, etc.).","In some embodiments, the list initiator may be provided with a \u201chit all\u201d button or user interface (button  of ) that allows the list initiator to accept all of the dealer responses instead of executing a trade with each list item individually. Alternatively, the list initiator may select a \u201cHit\u201d or \u201cLift\u201d button for each item on the inquiry list.","In some embodiments, the list initiator may be provided with the opportunity to review the items being executed (step  of ). For example, the list initiator may be provided with a confirmation screen (screen  of ). The confirmation screen may provide the user with an opportunity to review the items being executed. For example, the confirmation screen may allow the user to view the prices in a particular currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars, Euros, etc.). In another example, items on the inquiry list may be traded in different currencies and the confirmation screen may allow the user to view each price and\/or the total price of the items being executed in a selected currency.","In response to executing the trades and\/or confirming the trades, the list initiator may be provided with a trading ticket or any other suitable display indicating that the trade(s) have been completed (step  of ). For example, the list initiator may be provided with a trading ticket (screen  of ). The trading ticket may provide the list initiator with a summary of the transaction and\/or details of the trade. Additional information may also be included on the trading ticket (e.g., status, settlement date, trader name, salesperson name, dealer name, trade identification number, issuer, coupon, maturity, ISIN number, size, price, etc.).","Accordingly, systems and methods for creating, submitting, and trading price-based inquiry lists are provided.","It will also be understood that the detailed description herein may be presented in terms of program procedures executed on a computer (e.g., an endpoint) or network of computers. These procedural descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.","A procedure is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. These steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared and otherwise manipulated.
