A primary distinction between Philadelphia-chromosome positive (Ph+) and Philadelphia-chromosome negative (Ph\u2212) can be made. Ph+ MPD results in chronic myelogenous leukemia and is driven by a bcr-abl fusion protein that drives hematopoietic cell proliferation. Ph\u2212 MPD can be further subclassified into three distinct disorders by related varieties, namely polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF). Dameshek, W., 6(4):372-375 (1951). Patients with PV suffer from high counts of red blood cells, whereas patients with ET have high levies of circulating platelets. If left untreated, both diseases can result in life-threatening thrombotic events. Patients with IMF experience fibrosis of the bone marrow with subsequent displacement of hematopoiesis into the spleen and liver. This primarily leads to splenomegaly, which is followed by anemia in later stages of the disease as hematopoiesis becomes non-productive. These patients have a poor prognosis, although under certain conditions they can be cured by means of an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. There is no known cure for Ph\u2212 MPD diseases.","An activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 is associated with PV, ET, IMF and other diseases. Virtually all patients with PV and about 50% patients with ET and IMF harbor this mutation. Morgan, K. J. and Gilliland, D. G., 59:213-222 (2008). The mutation is an exchange from valine to phenylalanine at position 617 in the mature human JAK2 protein (V617F). Additional mutations in JAK2, commonly found in exon 12 and referred to as exon 12 mutations, also have an activating effect and can lead to MPD. Furthermore, a T875N mutation was associated with megakaryoblastic leukemia. Finally, JAK2 fusion proteins have been identified in acute leukemias.","The V617F mutation functions to activate JAK2, which leads to MPD. In non-mutated form, JAK2 is linked to cytokine receptors (i.e. EPO-R, TPO-R and others) and only gets activated if the receptor itself is activated by stimulation with the cognate cytokine ligand. Hematopoiesis as a whole is then regulated through the availability of ligands. For example, the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates hematopoietic progenitor cells to give rise to red blood cells. A mutation that uncouples JAK2 activation from EPO, therefore, leads to elevated levels of red blood cells. By analogy, thrombopoietin (TPO) regulates platelet growth by binding to the TPO-R, which in turn also signals through JAK2. Thus, elevated levels of platelets can also result from aberrant JAK2 activation.","Compounds are needed that inhibit JAK2, which would be beneficial to patients with JAK2 driven myeloproliferative disorders, as well as, other diseases that are responsive to the inhibition of JAK2. Such diseases include both diseases in which JAK2 is activated by mutation or amplification, as well as, diseases in which JAK2 activation is a part of the oncogenic cascade. Numerous tumor cell lines and tumor samples have high levels of phospho-STAT3, which is a JAK2 target gene.","JAK1 was initially identified in a screen for novel kinases (Wilks A. F., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:1603-1607). Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), type II interferon (e.g., IFNgamma), IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine receptor complexes (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; Levy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:651-662; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signaling (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN, IL-10, IL-2\/IL-4, and IL-6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway (Tocilizumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (Scheinecker et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:273-274).","JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain, which is present in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (O'Shea et al., 2002, Cell, 109 (suppl.): S121-S131). Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes, JAK3 and JAK3-mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications (e.g., transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis) (Baslund et al., 2005, Arthritis & Rheumatism 52:2686-2692; Changelian et al., 2003, Science 302: 875-878).","TYK2 associates with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokine receptor complexes (Kisseleva et al., 2002, gene 285:1-24; Watford, W. T. & O'Shea, J. J., 2006, Immunity 25:695-697). Consistent with this, primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL-12 and 11-23 cytokines (Ustekinumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Krueger et al., 2007, N. Engl. J. Med. 356:580-92; Reich et al., 2009, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 8:355-356). In addition, an antibody targeting the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn's Disease (Mannon et al., 2004, N. Engl. J. Med. 351:2069-79).","One embodiment includes a compound of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.77mm","wi":"56.05mm","file":"US08609687-20131217-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4 ","5 "]},"Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition that includes a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.","Another embodiment includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of one or more Janus kinase activity, selected from JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, in a patient.

Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder, (for example, through a genetic mutation) or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.","The phrase \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.","A \u201cliposome\u201d is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and\/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug (such as a compound of Formula I and, optionally, a chemotherapeutic agent) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.","The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt,\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of Formula I. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of Formula I. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.","The term \u201cprotecting group\u201d or \u201cPg\u201d refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example, an \u201camino-protecting group\u201d is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalimido, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a \u201chydroxy-protecting group\u201d refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable hydroxy-protecting groups include acetyl, trialkylsilyl, dialkylphenylsilyl, benzoyl, benzyl, benzyloxymethyl, methyl, methoxymethyl, triarylmethyl, and tetrahydropyranyl. A \u201ccarboxy-protecting group\u201d refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy-protecting groups include \u2014CHCHSOPh, cyanoethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, 2-(p-toluenesulfonyl)ethyl, 2-(p-nitrophenylsulfenyl)ethyl, 2-(diphenylphosphino)-ethyl, nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene and P. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999; and P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Third Ed., Verlag, 2003.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes human patients and animal patients. The term \u201canimal\u201d includes companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats and horses), food-source animals, zoo animals, marine animals, birds and other similar animal species.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and\/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and\/or the mammal being treated therewith.","The terms \u201ccompound of this invention,\u201d and \u201ccompounds of the present invention\u201d, and \u201ccompounds of Formula I\u201d, unless otherwise indicated, include compounds of Formula I and stereoisomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, salts (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts) and prodrugs thereof. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds of Formula I, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced deuterium or tritium, or one or more carbon atoms are replaced by a C- or C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.","\u201cInflammatory disorder\u201d as used herein can refer to any disease, disorder, or syndrome in which an excessive or unregulated inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms, host tissue damage, or loss of tissue function. \u201cInflammatory disorder\u201d also refers to a pathological state mediated by influx of leukocytes and\/or neutrophil chemotaxis.","\u201cInflammation\u201d as used herein refers to a localized, protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues, which serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is notably associated with influx of leukocytes and\/or neutrophil chemotaxis. Inflammation can result from infection with pathogenic organisms and viruses and from noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following myocardial infarction or stroke, immune response to foreign antigen, and autoimmune responses. Accordingly, inflammatory disorders amenable to treatment with Formula I compounds encompass disorders associated with reactions of the specific defense system as well as with reactions of the nonspecific defense system.","\u201cSpecific defense system\u201d refers to the component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the classical response to foreign antigens, autoimmune diseases, and delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells. Chronic inflammatory diseases, the rejection of solid transplanted tissue and organs, e.g., kidney and bone marrow transplants, and graft versus host disease (GVHD), are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.","The term \u201cnonspecific defense system\u201d as used herein refers to inflammatory disorders that are mediated by leukocytes that are incapable of immunological memory (e.g., granulocytes, and macrophages). Examples of inflammation that result, at least in part, from a reaction of the nonspecific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as adult (acute) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ injury syndromes; reperfusion injury; acute glomerulonephritis; reactive arthritis; dermatoses with acute inflammatory components; acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders such as stroke; thermal injury; inflammatory bowel disease; granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.","\u201cAutoimmune disease\u201d as used herein refers to any group of disorders in which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell-mediated responses to the body's own constituents.","\u201cAllergic disease\u201d as used herein refers to any symptoms, tissue damage, or loss of tissue function resulting from allergy. \u201cArthritic disease\u201d as used herein refers to any disease that is characterized by inflammatory lesions of the joints attributable to a variety of etiologies. \u201cDermatitis\u201d as used herein refers to any of a large family of diseases of the skin that are characterized by inflammation of the skin attributable to a variety of etiologies. \u201cTransplant rejection\u201d as used herein refers to any immune reaction directed against grafted tissue, such as organs or cells (e.g., bone marrow), characterized by a loss of function of the grafted and surrounding tissues, pain, swelling, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The therapeutic methods of the present invention include methods for the treatment of disorders associated with inflammatory cell activation.","\u201cInflammatory cell activation\u201d refers to the induction by a stimulus (including, but not limited to, cytokines, antigens or auto-antibodies) of a proliferative cellular response, the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited to cytokines, oxygen radicals, enzymes, prostanoids, or vasoactive amines), or cell surface expression of new or increased numbers of mediators (including, but not limited to, major histocompatability antigens or cell adhesion molecules) in inflammatory cells (including but not limited to monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes (i.e., polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), mast cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and endothelial cells). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can contribute to the initiation, perpetuation, or exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder.","The term \u201cNSAID\u201d is an acronym for \u201cnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\u201d and is a therapeutic agent with analgesic, antipyretic (lowering an elevated body temperature and relieving pain without impairing consciousness) and, in higher doses, with anti-inflammatory effects (reducing inflammation). The term \u201cnon-steroidal\u201d is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (among a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. As analgesics, NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non-narcotic. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, acute gout, dysmenorrhoea, metastatic bone pain, headache and migraine, postoperative pain, mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury, pyrexia, ileus, and renal colic. Most NSAIDs act as non-selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes.

Formula I that has Kand\/or ECthat is at least 15 fold, alternatively 10 fold, or 5 fold or more selective in inhibiting one Janus kinase activity over inhibiting each of the other Janus kinase activities.","The compounds of Formula I may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I, including but not limited to: diastereomers, enantiomers, and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers, e.g., resulting from the N-oxidation of the pyrimidinyl and pyrrozolyl rings, or the E and Z forms of compounds of Formula I (for example oxime moieties), are also within the scope of the present invention.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.","The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention, as defined by the claims, embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.","In an embodiment, compounds of Formula I may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of Formula I include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I, and I, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., H) and carbon-14 (i.e., C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C, and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Synthesis of Triazolopyridine JAK Inhibitor Compounds","Compounds of Formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes described herein. In certain embodiments, processes well-known in the chemical arts can be used, in addition to, or in light of, the description contained herein.

Methods for triazolopyridine synthesis are also disclosed in: WO 02\/38572 and WO 2006\/038116.","Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds of Formula I. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial \u2018split and mix\u2019 approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formula I, enantiomers, diasteriomers, tautomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.","For illustrative purposes, reaction schemes 1-6 depicted below provide routes for synthesizing the compounds of the present invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and\/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.","In the preparation of compounds of the present invention, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W.

A common protected intermediate 5, which is available from 2-amino-3-bromopyridine (2), can be subjected to palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions such as the Suzuki reaction with boronic acids or boronate esters to form compounds of Formula 6 after protective group removal. Palladium-catalyzed amination of aryl or heteroaryl halides with triazolopyridinamine 6 provides compounds of Formula 1a. Palladium-catalyzed amination of methoxycarbonyl substituted phenyl halides or methoxycarbonyl substituted heteroaryl halides 7 with triazolopyridinamine 6 provides compounds of Formula 1b. Hydrolysis of the corresponding methyl esters 1b affords carboxylic acids 1c, which can be subjected to standard amide formation methods to yield amides 1d.","It will be appreciated that where appropriate functional groups exist, compounds of various formulae or any intermediates used in their preparation may be further derivatised by one or more standard synthetic methods employing condensation, substitution, oxidation, reduction, or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, sulfonylation, halogenation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures.","In a further example, primary amine or secondary amine groups may be converted into amide groups (\u2014NHCOR\u2032 or \u2014NRCOR\u2032) by acylation. Acylation may be achieved by reaction with an appropriate acid chloride in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, or by reaction with an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a suitable coupling agent such HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Similarly, amine groups may be converted into sulphonamide groups (\u2014NHSOR\u2032 or \u2014NR\u2033SOR\u2032) groups by reaction with an appropriate sulphonyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Primary or secondary amine groups can be converted into urea groups (\u2014NHCONR\u2032R\u2033 or \u2014NRCONR\u2032R\u2033) by reaction with an appropriate isocyanate in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine, in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane.","An amine (\u2014NH) may be obtained by reduction of a nitro (\u2014NO) group, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or an alcohol e.g. methanol. Alternatively, the transformation may be carried out by chemical reduction using for example a metal, e.g. tin or iron, in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid.","In a further example, amine (\u2014CHNH) groups may be obtained by reduction of nitriles (\u2014CN), for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon, or Raney nickel, in a solvent such as an ether e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at an appropriate temperature, for example from about \u221278\u00b0 C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent.","In a further example, amine (\u2014NH) groups may be obtained from carboxylic acid groups (\u2014COH) by conversion to the corresponding acyl azide (\u2014CON), Curtius rearrangement and hydrolysis of the resultant isocyanate (\u2014N\u2550C\u2550O).","Aldehyde groups (\u2014CHO) may be converted to amine groups (\u2014CHNR\u2032R\u2033)) by reductive amination employing an amine and a borohydride, for example sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane, or an alcohol such as ethanol, where necessary in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid at around ambient temperature.","In a further example, aldehyde groups may be converted into alkenyl groups (\u2014CH\u2550CHR\u2032) by the use of a Wittig or Wadsworth-Emmons reaction using an appropriate phosphorane or phosphonate under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art.","Aldehyde groups may be obtained by reduction of ester groups (such as \u2014COEt) or nitriles (\u2014CN) using diisobutylaluminium hydride in a suitable solvent such as toluene. Alternatively, aldehyde groups may be obtained by the oxidation of alcohol groups using any suitable oxidising agent known to those skilled in the art.","Ester groups (\u2014COR\u2032) may be converted into the corresponding acid group (\u2014COH) by acid- or base-catalused hydrolysis, depending on the nature of R. If R is t-butyl, acid-catalysed hydrolysis can be achieved for example by treatment with an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in an aqueous solvent, or by treatment with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid in an aqueous solvent.","Carboxylic acid groups (\u2014COH) may be converted into amides (CONHR\u2032 or \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033) by reaction with an appropriate amine in the presence of a suitable coupling agent, such as HATU, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane.","In a further example, carboxylic acids may be homologated by one carbon (i.e \u2014COH to \u2014CHCOH) by conversion to the corresponding acid chloride (\u2014COCl) followed by Arndt-Eistert synthesis.","In a further example, \u2014OH groups may be generated from the corresponding ester (e.g. \u2014COR\u2032), or aldehyde (\u2014CHO) by reduction, using for example a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, or sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol. Alternatively, an alcohol may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding acid (\u2014COH), using for example lithium aluminium hydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, or by using borane in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.","Alcohol groups may be converted into leaving groups, such as halogen atoms or sulfonyloxy groups such as an alkylsulfonyloxy, e.g. trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy, e.g. p-toluenesulfonyloxy group using conditions known to those skilled in the art. For example, an alcohol may be reacted with thioyl chloride in a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane) to yield the corresponding chloride. A base (e.g. triethylamine) may also be used in the reaction.","In another example, alcohol, phenol or amide groups may be alkylated by coupling a phenol or amide with an alcohol in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl-, diisopropyl, or dimethylazodicarboxylate. Alternatively alkylation may be achieved by deprotonation using a suitable base e.g. sodium hydride followed by subsequent addition of an alkylating agent, such as an alkyl halide.","Aromatic halogen substituents in the compounds may be subjected to halogen-metal exchange by treatment with a base, for example a lithium base such as n-butyl or t-butyl lithium, optionally at a low temperature, e.g. around \u221278\u00b0 C., in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, and then quenched with an electrophile to introduce a desired substituent. Thus, for example, a formyl group may be introduced by using N,N-dimethylformamide as the electrophile. Aromatic halogen substituents may alternatively be subjected to metal (e.g. palladium or copper) catalysed reactions, to introduce, for example, acid, ester, cyano, amide, aryl, heteraryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, thio- or amino substituents. Suitable procedures which may be employed include those described by Heck, Suzuki, Stille, Buchwald or Hartwig.","Aromatic halogen substituents may also undergo nucleophilic displacement following reaction with an appropriate nucleophile such as an amine or an alcohol. Advantageously, such a reaction may be carried out at elevated temperature in the presence of microwave irradiation.","Methods of Separation","In each of the exemplary Schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium, and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point, and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., 113(3):283-302 (1975)). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: , Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g. (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob, 47:4165 (1982)), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York, (1989); Okamoto, 513:375-378 (1990)). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Positional isomers, for example E and Z forms, of compounds of Formula I, and intermediates for their synthesis, may be observed by characterization methods such as NMR and analytical HPLC. For certain compounds where the energy barrier for interconversion is sufficiently high, the E and Z isomers may be separated, for example by preparatory HPLC.","Biological Evaluation","Previous studies have shown that the isolated kinase domains of human JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 phosphorylate peptide substrates in in vitro kinase assays (Saltzman et al., 246:627-633 (2004)). The catalytically active kinase domain of human JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 was purified from extracts of SF9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expression vector encoding the human JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinase domains (JAK1 amino acid residues N852-D1154 according to the numbering of GenBank sequence accession number P23458, JAK2 amino acid residues D812-01132 according to the numbering of GenBank sequence accession number NP004963.1; JAK3 amino acid residues S783-S1124 according to the numbering of GenBank sequence accession number P52333, and TYK2 amino acid residues N873-C1187 according to the numbering of GenBank sequence accession number P29597). The activity of the JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinase domains can be measured by a number of direct and indirect methods, including quantification of phosphorylation of peptide substrates derived from the human JAK3 protein (Saltzman et al., 246:627-633 (2004)). The activity of the JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinase domains was measured in vitro by monitoring phosphorylation of JAK3 derived peptides using the Caliper LabChip technology (see Examples).","The compounds of the present invention are tested for their capacity to inhibit a Janus kinase activity and activation (primary assays) and for their biological effects on growing cells (secondary assays) as described herein. The compounds having ICof less than 10 \u03bcM (preferably less than 5 \u03bcM, more preferably less than 1 \u03bcM, most preferably less than 0.5 \u03bcM) in the appropriate Janus kinase activity and activation assay (see Examples A and B), and ECof less than 20 \u03bcM (preferably less than 10 \u03bcM, more preferably less than 5 \u03bcM, most preferably less than 1 \u03bcM) in the appropriate cellular assays (see Example C) are useful as Janus kinase inhibitors.","Administration of Triazolopyridine Compounds","Another embodiment includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of one or more Janus kinase activity, selected from JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, in a patient. The method includes administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I.","Another embodiment includes a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of JAK2 kinase activity in a patient. The method includes the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I.","In one embodiment, the disease or condition is cancer, stroke, diabetes, hepatomegaly, cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, viral disease, autoimmune diseases, atherosclerosis, restenosis, psoriasis, allergic disorders, inflammation, neurological disorders, a hormone-related disease, conditions associated with organ transplantation, immunodeficiency disorders, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, conditions associated with cell death, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, liver disease, pathologic immune conditions involving T cell activation, CNS disorders or a myeloproliferative disorder.","In one embodiment, the disease or condition is cancer.","In one embodiment, the disease is a myeloproliferative disorder.","In one embodiment, the myeloproliferative disorder is polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).","In one embodiment, the cancer is breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, penile, genitourinary tract, seminoma, esophagus, larynx, gastric, stomach, gastrointestinal, skin, keratoacanthoma, follicular carcinoma, melanoma, lung, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), lung adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma of the lung, colon, pancreas, thyroid, papillary, bladder, liver, biliary passage, kidney, bone, myeloid disorders, lymphoid disorders, hairy cells, buccal cavity and pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, salivary gland, pharynx, small intestine, colon, rectum, anal, renal, prostate, vulval, thyroid, large intestine, endometrial, uterine, brain, central nervous system, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, head cancer, neck cancer, Hodgkin's or leukemia.","In one embodiment, the cardiovascular disease is restenosis, cardiomegaly, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.","In one embodiment, the neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury, glutamate neurotoxicity or hypoxia.","In one embodiment, the inflammatory diseases is rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis or delayed hypersensitivity reactions.","In one embodiment, the inflammatory disease is inflammatory bowel disease,","In one embodiment, the autoimmune disease is lupus or multiple sclerosis.","Evaluation of drug-induced immunosuppression by the compounds of the invention may be performed using in vivo functional tests, such as rodent models of induced arthritis and therapeutic or prophylactic treatment to assess disease score, T cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Other in vivo systems including murine models of host defense against infections or tumor resistance (Burleson G R, Dean J H, and Munson A E. , Vol. 1. Wiley-Liss, New York, 1995) may be considered to elucidate the nature or mechanisms of observed immunosuppression. The in vivo test systems can be complemented by well-established in vitro or ex vivo functional assays for the assessment of immune competence. These assays may comprise B or T cell proliferation in response to mitogens or specific antigens, measurement of signaling through one or more of the Janus kinase pathways in B or T cells or immortalized B or T cell lines, measurement of cell surface markers in response to B or T cell signaling, natural killer (NK) cell activity, mast cell activity, mast cell degranulation, macrophage phagocytosis or kill activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst and\/or chemotaxis. In each of these tests determination of cytokine production by particular effector cells (e.g., lymphocytes, NK, monocytes\/macrophages, neutrophils) may be included. The in vitro and ex vivo assays can be applied in both preclinical and clinical testing using lymphoid tissues and\/or peripheral blood (House R V. \u201cTheory and practice of cytokine assessment in immunotoxicology\u201d (1999) Methods 19:17-27; Hubbard A K. \u201cEffects of xenobiotics on macrophage function: evaluation in vitro\u201d (1999) Methods; 19:8-16; Lebrec H, et al (2001) Toxicology 158:25-29).","Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) 6-week detailed study using an autoimmune mechanism to mimic human arthritis; rat and mouse models (Example 68). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is one of the most commonly used animal models of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Joint inflammation, which develops in animals with CIA, strongly resembles inflammation observed in patients with RA. Blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an efficacious treatment of CIA, just as it is a highly efficacious therapy in treatment of RA patients. CIA is mediated by both T-cells and antibodies (B-cells). Macrophages are believed to play an important role in mediating tissue damage during disease development. CIA is induced by immunizing animals with collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). It is most commonly induced in the DBA\/1 mouse strain, but the disease can also be induced in Lewis rats.","There is good evidence that B-cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disease. Protein-based therapeutics that deplete B cells such as Rituxan are effective against autoantibody-driven inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Rastetter et al. (2004) Annu Rev Med 55:477). CD69 is the early activation marker in leukocytes including T cells, thymocytes, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. The CD69 human whole blood assay (Example 69) determines the ability of compounds to inhibit the production of CD69 by B lymphocytes in human whole blood activated by crosslinking surface IgM with goat F(ab\u2032)2 anti-human IgM.","The T-cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR) is a predictive assay for immune function testing when potential immunotoxic effects of compounds need to be studied. The IgM-Plaque Forming Cell (PFC) assay, using Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC) as the antigen, is currently a widely accepted and validated standard test. TDAR has proven to be a highly predictable assay for adult exposure immunotoxicity detection in mice based on the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) database (M. I. Luster et al (1992) Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 18:200-210). The utility of this assay stems from the fact that it is a holistic measurement involving several important components of an immune response. A TDAR is dependent on functions of the following cellular compartments: (1) antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells; (2) T-helper cells, which are critical players in the genesis of the response, as well as in isotype switching; and (3) B-cells, which are the ultimate effector cells and are responsible for antibody production. Chemically-induced changes in any one compartment can cause significant changes in the overall TDAR (M. P. Holsapple In: G. R. Burleson, J. H. Dean and A. E. Munson, Editors, , Volume 1, Wiley-Liss Publishers, New York, N.Y. (1995), pp. 71-108). Usually, this assay is performed either as an ELISA for measurement of soluble antibody (R. J. Smialowizc et al (2001) Toxicol. Sci. 61:164-175) or as a plaque (or antibody) forming cell assay (L. Guo et al (2002) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 181:219-227) to detect plasma cells secreting antigen specific antibodies. The antigen of choice is either whole cells (e.g. sheep erythrocytes) or soluble protein antigens (T. Miller et al (1998) Toxicol. Sci. 42:129-135).","A compound of Formula I may be administered by any route appropriate to the disease or condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound of Formula I is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound of Formula I is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.","A dose to treat human patients may range from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of a compound of Formula I. A typical dose may be about 100 mg to about 300 mg of a compound of Formula I. A dose may be administered once a day (QD), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.","Another embodiment of the invention aspect of this invention provides a compound of this invention for use as a medicament in the treatment of the diseases or conditions described herein in a mammal, for example, a human, suffering from such disease or condition. Also provided is the use of a compound of this invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein in a warm-blooded animal, such as a mammal, for example a human, suffering from such disorder.","Pharmaceutical Formulations of Triazolopyridine Compounds","Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition that includes a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.","In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition also includes an additional therapeutic agent selected from an anti-proliferative agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunomodulatory agent, a neurotropic factor, an agent for treating cardiovascular disease, an agent for treating liver disease, an anti-viral agent, an agent for treating blood disorders, an agent for treating diabetes, or an agent for treating immunodeficiency disorders.","In another embodiment, a compound of Formula I is present in a pharmaceutical formulation in an amount to detectably inhibit one or more of a Janus kinase activity, selected from JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.","In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I is present in a pharmaceutical formulation in an amount to detectably inhibit JAK2 kinase activity and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.","In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I is present in a pharmaceutical formulation in an amount to detectably inhibit JAK2 kinase activity and is at least 10 fold or more selective in inhibiting JAK2 kinase activity over inhibiting each of JAK1, JAK3 and Tyk-2 activity.","In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I is present in a pharmaceutical formulation in an amount to detectably inhibit one of a Janus kinase activity and is at least 15 fold, alternatively 10 fold, or 5 fold or more selective in inhibiting one such Janus kinase activity over inhibiting each of the other Janus kinase activity.","In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I is present in a pharmaceutical formulation in an amount to detectably inhibit a Janus kinase activity and is at least 15 fold, alternatively 10 fold, or 5 fold or more selective in inhibiting one Janus kinase activity over inhibiting each of the other JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and\/or Tyk-2 activity.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water, and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG400, PEG300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound, such as a complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical, formulations of a compound of Formula I may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. A compound of Formula I having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","The inhibitory compound for use herein is preferably sterile. The compound ordinarily will be stored as a solid composition, although lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions are acceptable.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion, i.e. amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles, and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the disorder. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLUKONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile, which is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of a compound of Formula I suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the compound of Formula I.","Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.","Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g. gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral use. Formulations of a compound of Formula I intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.","For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.","If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween\u00ae 60, Span\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkyl oxide (e.g. ethylene oxide, propylene oxide) with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical composition of a compound of Formula I may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight).

A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes.

Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound.","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art.
