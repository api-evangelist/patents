title: System and method for capturing, storing and analyzing revenue management information for the travel and transportation industries
abstract: A revenue management system for a travel provider, such as airline, a car rental agency, a cruise line, a lodging provider; a travel agency; a bus line or a passenger rail service provider. The revenue management system comprises a database for storing revenue, product and service, and customer information; a logical data model comprising a plurality of entities and relationships defining the manner in which the revenue, product and service, and customer information is stored and organized within the database; and a revenue management application for analyzing the revenue, product and service, and customer information contained within the database to manage inventory, pricing and demand forecasting for the travel provider. Analysis of Passenger Name Record (PNR), booking, ticketing, inventory, schedule, authorization adjustment and flown/ticket lift data maintained within the database enables a travel provider to identify fraudulent and improper booking and ticketing activity, or an airline to determine optimal passenger and revenue mix for airline flights.

Still more particularly, the present invention is related to a logical data model for storing and organizing revenue management information for travel and transportation industries such as airlines, travel agencies, cruise lines, hotel companies, rental car companies, passenger rail companies and bus lines.","NCR Corporation has developed a data warehouse solution including a comprehensive suite of analytical and operational applications that captures, organizes and advances the use of high-value business information for the travel and transportation industries. This solution provides a travel provider with answers to basic questions such as:\n\n","The Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) has proved a strategic weapon for most modern organizations. It should be active, dynamic and flexible in order to cope with changing business requirements. It should provide a strategic background to support changing retail consumer-travel provider relationships.","The foundation of the enterprise data warehouse is a comprehensive and responsive logical data model addressing challenges in the near future without compromising existing business processes. A logical data model is a graphical representation of the way data is organized in a data warehouse environment. The logical data model specifically defines which individual data elements can be stored and how they relate to one another to provide a model of the business information. The data model ultimately defines which business questions can be answered from the data warehouse and thus determines the business value of the entire decision support system.","A properly designed LDM provides a foundation for more effective sales, marketing and customer management and supports the customer relationship management (CRM) requirements related to identifying, acquiring, retaining and growing valuable customers. A logical data model for the travel and transportation industries reflects the operating principles and policies of these industries and provides the underlying structure for the data imported into the data warehouse.","Ideally, a logical data model for the travel industry should provide support for current and future revenue management applications, such as NCR Corporation's Teradata\u00ae Revenue-Management Intelligence (RMI) solution. The Teradata RMI solution offers travel providers the capability to understand customer demand and behavior and optimize their current revenue-management systems and processes. The Teradata RMI solution allows travel providers to integrate historic, current and future inventory, schedule, flight and booking data onto a single platform to support both tactical and strategic decision-making, allowing for reduced delays and gaps in information. Travel providers will also be able to monitor and refine the success of their efforts through the measurement, tracking and reporting of revenue-management performance.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and useful system and method for capturing, storing and organizing information supporting revenue management applications for travel and transportation industries.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a logical data model that defines the structure for storing and organizing revenue management information for travel and transportation industries.","The foregoing objects are accomplished through utilization of a revenue management system for a travel provider comprising: a database for storing revenue, product and service, and customer information for a travel provider; a logical data model comprising a plurality of entities and relationships defining the manner in which the revenue, product and service, and customer information is stored and organized within the database; and a revenue management application for analyzing the revenue, product and service, and customer information contained within the database to manage inventory, pricing and demand forecasting for the travel provider. The travel provider can be an airline, a car rental agency, a cruise line, a lodging provider; a travel agency; a bus line or a passenger rail service provider.","Analysis of Passenger Name Record (PNR), booking, ticketing, inventory, schedule, authorization adjustment and flown\/ticket lift data maintained within the database enables a travel provider to identify fraudulent and improper booking and ticketing activity, or an airline to determine optimal passenger and revenue mix for airline flights.","Still other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein the preferred embodiments of the invention are shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated of carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention.

The application server  supports analytic and operational applications, such as NCR Corporation's Teradata Solutions for Travel and Transportation suite of business applications.","The Travel Logical Data Model is a consumer-centric travel data model supporting Revenue Management, Financial Management, Customer Relationship Management, Privacy and Click Stream analysis. It can serve as the base for a full enterprise data warehouse implemented at the client's site. The model has been designed in a modular fashion so non-relevant components can be removed without impacting the consistency of the model. It's an integrated, subject-oriented base of strategic business information that serves as a single source of decision support, providing the travel provider with the ability to make simple reports or sophisticated information analysis.  shows the travel and transportation core, industry, and revenue management segments supported by the TLDM.","The TLDM supports the following core areas: Base Functions , Privacy , Customer Relationship Management (CRM) , Click Stream  and Financial . Together with Revenue Management segment , the TDLM supports functionality broken down into three main areas:","(1) Solution support\u2014The Travel LDM supports the Teradata CRM, the Financial Management and the Revenue Management Intelligence solution offers.","(2) Business Information areas covered by the Model\u2014The Travel LDM contains application-neutral information about the following subjects and more:\n\n","(3) Business Intelligence that can be derived from the information\u2014The Treavel LDM supports a vast amount of business intelligence. Some examples:\n\n","The Teradata Travel Logical Data Model, as described herein, serves several different kinds of customers, including Airlines , Rental Car Companies , Cruise Lines , Lodging (Hotel) Companies , Travel Agencies , Bus Lines , and Passenger Rail . Companies.","As stated earlier, a properly designed logical data model provides a foundation for more effective sales, marketing, and operations management and supports the customer relationship management requirements related to identifying, acquiring, retaining and growing valuable customers.","A logical data model (LDM) is an abstract construct that is physically realized in the database or data warehouse. The data model provides an architecture for the information that will be included in a data warehouse. The database provides the physical realization of that architecture in a form that can be efficiently maintained and used. There may well be some differences between the logical data model and the final database design. The database may include some tables (summary tables, etc.) or columns that have no direct correlation in the logical data model. Elements in the logical model may be grouped differently in the physical database.","A logical data model is organized by Subject Areas, each comprised of numerous Entities, Attributes and Relationships. The data model hierarchy includes one or more Subject Areas. Each Subject Area includes one or more Entities or Tables, each having Attributes and Relationships. Each Attribute describes a fact about an Entity. Relationships between two or more Entities are further defined by Cardinality. The Relationships define which entities are connected to other entities and the cardinality of the relationships. Each of these elements will be described in greater detail below.","A subject area is a subset of objects taken from the universe of data objects for a particular line of business or industry that focus on a particular Business Process. Typically, a subject area is created to help manage large data architectures that may encompass multiple business processes or business subjects. This is the highest-level data concept within a conceptual entity\/relationship (E\/R) model. Working with subject areas is especially useful when designing and maintaining a large or complex data model. Dividing the enterprise into several distinct subject areas allows different groups within an organization to concentrate on the processes and functions pertinent to their business area.","An Entity represents a person, place, thing, concept, or event (e.g. PARTY, ACCOUNT, PRODUCT, etc.). It represents something for which the business has the means and the desire to collect and store data. An Entity must have distinguishable occurrences, e.g., one must be able to uniquely identify each occurrence of an entity with a primary key (e.g. Party Identifier, Account Identifier, Invoice Number, etc.). An Entity is typically named with a unique singular noun or noun phrase (e.g., PARTY, TRANSPORTED PASSENGER, etc.) that describes one occurrence of the Entity and cannot be used for any other Entity. It should be exclusive of every other Entity in the database. An Entity cannot appear more than once in the conceptual entity\/relationship (E\/R) model. Each Entity may have relationships to other Entities residing in its own Subject Area or in other Subject Areas.","An Attribute is a data fact about an Entity or Relationship. It is a logical (not physical) construct. It is data in its atomic form. In other words, it is the lowest level of information that still has business meaning without further decomposition. An example would be FIRST NAME, or LAST NAME. An example of an invalid attribute would be PERSON NAME if it includes both the first and last names, as this could be further decomposed into the separate, definable (first name, last name) data facts.","A Relationship is an association that links occurrences of one or more Entities. A Relationship must connect at least one Entity. If only one Entity is connected, the Relationship is said to be Recursive. A Relationship is described by a noun or passive verb or verb phase that describes the action taken in the Relationship. A Relationship represent a static state of being between the occurrences of the Entities it connects. Relationships are not intended to represent processes or data flows. They cannot be linked to another Relationships. They may optionally represent future, present, and\/or past relatedness. The time frame must be explicitly defined in the data definition. Relationships may contain attributes. In a normalized model, a Relationship containing Attributes will result in the creation of an Entity.","In order for a data model to be considered accurate, it must contain both the maximum and minimum number of Entity occurrences expected. This is controlled by rules of cardinality, which describes a relationship between two Entities based on how many occurrences of one Entity type may exist relative to the occurrence of the other Entity. Typically, it is a ratio, commonly depicted as a one-to-one (1:1); one-to-many (1:N); and many-to-many (M:N) relationship.","The maximum cardinality may be an infinite number or a fixed number but never zero. The minimum cardinality may be zero, or some other positive number, but it must be less than or equal to the maximum cardinality for the same relationship.","The logical data model for the E-Business will now be described in more detail.

To effectively view and understand the data model, the data tables have been logically organized into smaller groups called subject areas. Each subject area is comprised of a set of tables that contain information relevant to a particular entity. In addition, the subject areas address particular business questions.","The Travel Logical Data Model is presented in the following views to facilitate its understanding:\n\n","The Conceptual View of the Travel Logical Data Model is illustrated in . This view provides an overall high-level understanding of the major entities and how they relate to each other. This conceptual level forms the foundation for the remaining views. Its purpose is to show the most important entities in the logical data model and how they generally relate to each other.","The Conceptual View is derived directly from the Travel Logical Data Model by selecting the most important entities from every subject area, being sure that at least one entity from each subject area was selected and distilling the relationships among the selected entities, while still maintaining the general nature of the way the entities relate to each other. During this process, intervening entities were abstracted into relationships. Many-to-many relationships were used where appropriate. Several entities shown in the Conceptual View, e.g., PAYMENT ACCOUNT \/, OnD PRODUCT PERFORMANCE , FM JOURNAL ENTRY , and WEB OPERATIONS , represent a subject area or combination of entities within a subject area. The result is a simple, easy to understand diagram that conveys the general content of the underlying logical data model.","Each subject area within the logical data model, as well as the entities included within the subject area, will be illustrated in the Figures and described in greater detail below.","The Subject Area Views show small (but highly detailed) subsets of the model. Subject areas are collections of entities about business information objects or concepts that are closely related. The sum total of all subject areas equals the TLDM. These views contain the definitive full details of the logical data model. For example, one view shows entities related to assets controlled by the travel business and another view shows entities related to reservations with the travel business. Subject areas are application neutral, and make no assumption as to usage. Additionally, subject areas form the building blocks with which to construct solution views.","For ease of use and understanding, the Travel Logical Data Model has been divided into twenty-six subject areas titled: ACCOUNT, ASSET, DEMOGRAPHICS, FM ASSET, FM EQUITY, FM EXPENSE, FM GENERAL LEDGER ACCOUNT, FM JOURNAL ENTRY, FM LIABILITIES, FM REVENUE, FORECASTS AND MODELS, GEOGRAPHY, LOCATION, OND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, PARTY, PASSENGER EN ROUTE, PRN OPERATIONS, PRIVACY, PRODUCT, PROMOTION, PURCHASE, RESERVATION, TRAVEL TRANSACTION, WEB OPERATIONS, WEB SITE, and WEB VISIT subject areas. There is some natural overlap between the subject areas, i.e., an entity may appear in multiple subject areas if it has direct relationships with entities in multiple subject areas. For example, the FARE BASIS table appears in the Figures for both the PURCHASE and RESERVATION subject areas. This means that the information in the FARE BASIS table is relevant to each of those subject areas; each subject area refers to the same physical item table.","A discussion of the subject area views illustrated in detail in  is presented below.","The ACCOUNT Subject Area, shown in , deals mainly with tracking balances associated with consumer loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer programs, and allowing customers to redeem points earned or on LEGs traveled for travel awards or other items such as retail discounts or points exchanges.","Provisions have been made to handle award balance transfers from partners and their various loyalty programs. These can include hotel, rental car, credit card and other loyalty programs. Most current award redemption options are built into the model. Additional award options can to be added. These reflect awards in an actual AWARD CERTIFICATE or an electronic version of one.","Payment can be made in a variety of ways.

A key data source is the Customer Reservation System (CRS) data  that typically contains booking data extracted at various checkpoints for flights across various booking classes and compartments\/cabins. Additional data is output from a typical revenue management engine such as PROS from PROS Revenue Management, Inc. and SABRE from Sabre Airline Solutions. Through an Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL)  process, information required from data sources  through  is loaded into the travel data warehouse . Once the data is loaded into the warehouse (the physical database prepared using the Travel LDM), the functional areas can be analyzed using OLAP reports  or Ad-hoc queries .","The following are real world examples of Revenue Management (RM) questions that can be answered by the system described above.","RM Base Questions:","These base questions deal with fundamental RM issues defined in conjunction with a major international airline.\n\n","This set of analytics is designed to identify flight exceptions or anomalies that need to be manually reviewed by a Revenue Management analyst. The analytics support drill down and drill across to allow the analyst to look at the data in a variety of views. They can be executed for a particular departure date or a range of departure dates. The requests can be for all segments, all O&Ds, all O&Ds for a particular market and\/or region, all O&Ds with a particular origin, or all O&Ds for a particular destination.

This means that drill down and drill across is critical since it is impossible to create just one view that satisfies any one requirement, because the analyst must specify the filter criteria over which to calculate the averages.\n\n","This set of analytics is used to perform show rate analyses. They are designed to answer questions about how actual show rates compare to projected show rates. These analytics can be for an entire departure date, a departure time, a flight, or for a specific market, origin, or destination within a particular departure date.","Questions 1, 3 and 5 are concerned with calculating the show rate at one departure date for some unit (a specific O&D path, for example) and comparing the show rate of that unit to the actual or average show rate of all like units over some filter criteria. This being the case, it is impossible to create just one view that satisfies any one requirement, because it is up to the person writing the query to specify the filter criteria over which to calculate the show rates. However, views can be defined as a common base for constructing queries of the type required. This can be presented as drill down or drill across analytics.\n\n","This set of analytics is designed to display information about specific segments or market O&Ds.
