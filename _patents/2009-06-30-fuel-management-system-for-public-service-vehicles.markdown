{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This invention relates to an improved fuel and maintenance management system for public service vehicles. More particularly, the present invention relates to fuel saving systems utilizing an integrated auxiliary battery and management system to provide power to auxiliary equipment when the vehicle's engine is not in operation.","Recently, the severity of the air pollution, occasioned by noxious gases, such as NO, CO and CO, in the exhaust of automobiles and other motor vehicles has been increasing. As a result, individual automobile companies, in compliance with exhaust emission restrictions, have developed various types of low-emission and fuel economic vehicles. However, while these advances may produce lower levels of pollution, they do not address the constant fuel consumption waste that is often necessary for public service vehicles as those vehicles are used in regular working shifts. Additionally, the increasing prices of gas have caused havoc with municipalities to keep fleet vehicles in operation, as they face budgetary constraints.","On these working shifts, it is often necessary to leave a vehicle idling with the engine running to power auxiliary equipment in the vehicle. For example, in public service vehicles, such as police cars, it is necessary to keep the vehicle idling to power equipment, as the officer is on a call or monitoring highway traffic. More specifically, because the officer is in need of equipment, such as sirens, CB radios, radar, climate controls, air conditioning and computers, the officer is forced to leave the vehicle's engine on and idling for extended periods of time. Research has shown that, while the average police vehicle's 230 HP engine is idling to provide electrical power to this equipment, only approximately 2.68 HP or 2000 Watts is actually needed. This research has also shown that while this engine is idling for 2 hours, it consumes approximately 1 gallon of fuel. This type of use is a significant cause of the budgetary constraints and amounts to significant amounts of wasted fuel each day while fleet vehicles operate and idle. These increased budgetary constraints become particularly important as the cost of fuel rises and becomes more unpredictable. For example, in a larger public municipalities having 600 fleet vehicles (assuming for this example: (a) 200 vehicles\/per 8 hour shift, (b) idling (on average) 4 hours per shift and (c) $2.00\/per gallon of fuel), this equates to $800 per shift or $2400 per day in fuel consumed only to provide power to the auxiliary equipment. Over the course of a year, this use can easily cost a public municipality upwards of $1 M in fuel waste during the idling periods used in this example. Accordingly, there is a need for a system that can reduce the engine idle time of public service vehicles, thus reducing fuel consumption, while providing the power necessary to run equipment used during a normal working shift.","While these costs may not affect larger municipalities as significantly as smaller municipalities, there are other factors in this type of use that can have significant additional effects on the budgets of these entities. For example, because an engine is constantly running in this idling manner, engine maintenance is substantially more frequent than the average vehicle. Accordingly, the maintenance frequency and costs of public service vehicles are significantly higher than the average vehicle simply because the engine run\/idle times are significantly more frequent. Finally, because of the engine run time required in normal public service use, the life cycle of a public service vehicle is shortened. As a result, municipalities are required to replace vehicles more frequently. Therefore, there is also a need for a system that is capable of reducing the maintenance cycle and increasing the life cycle of a public service vehicle.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed innovation. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","To resolve the problems mentioned above, an object of the present invention is to provide a fuel saving apparatus and system that can, in combination with a control module provide power to vehicle cooling systems and auxiliary equipment, for extended periods of time, while the vehicle engine is not in operation.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a rechargeable battery system connected to the fuel saving system and apparatus, such that when the vehicle's engine is in operation, the fuel saving apparatus may be recharged for use at later time.","It is yet another object of the present invention to have efficient DC motors electrically connected to the fuel saving apparatus and system so that minimal electrical load is needed to power the vehicle's auxiliary equipment.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an efficient mechanical connection between the vehicle's engine and the fuel saving apparatus such that the fuel saving apparatus does not cause unnecessary load on the engine when the engine is in operation and the fuels saving apparatus is installed on the vehicle.","Finally, the present invention efficiently enables a vehicle to use auxiliary power produced by the system and to utilize this auxiliary power for extended periods of time.","Still other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following description wherein there is shown and described the embodiments of this invention, simply by way of illustration of the best modes suited to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious aspects all without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawing and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings.

Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving electronic instructions or in accessing a network such as the Internet or a local area network (LAN). Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of the claimed subject matter.","Moreover, the word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs.

As used in this application, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor\u201d. That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},"The hybrid-idle system and apparatus , when installed into a vehicle, allows the vehicle operator to switch off the vehicle engine  and provide power to all auxiliary vehicle equipment. In the preferred application, the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  provides an adequate amount of power to operate the vehicle equipment for extended periods of time. Operation of each component shown in  will be described in greater detail in .  is presented simply to provide an overview of the preferred installation of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus . However, it should be appreciated that different system and installation configurations are available without departing from the scope of this invention. Also, it should be appreciated that substitute and equivalent components of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  may be necessary to fit the particular installation application. For example, the DC deep cycle battery  may be substituted with traditional DC batteries to fit the particular installation.","In the engine bay of the vehicle, as shown in , the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  has a brushless DC motor  that is mechanically connected to an air conditioner (A\/C) compressor  previously existing on vehicle engine . The mechanical connection between the brushless DC motor  and air conditioner (A\/C) compressor  is accomplished using a v-belt and pulley system . Also contained in the engine bay is a system control module  which provides operation, switching and control of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus . The system control module  is electrically and bi-directionally connected to graphical user interface  contained in the vehicle cabin. The graphical user interface  serves as an input and display terminal for the operator so that the status, operation, programming and input for the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  can be controlled by the operator at the graphical user interface . The graphical user interface  may also display of the charge levels of the DC deep cycle battery , power consumption levels and fuel savings calculations of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus . The graphical user interface  may additionally provide an administrator mode where technicians can access diagnostic and configuration settings from a diagnostic port or via a wireless connection with a laptop computer (not shown) or the like. The graphical user interface  and the system control module  may also be implemented by use of the on-board computer system already installed in the vehicle. For example, the monitoring and display as described above may be provided by the Drive Connected\u2122 system produced by Hughes Telematics, Inc. of Atlanta, Ga.","As described in further detail below with respect to , the DC deep cycle battery  is electrically connected to provide power to the brushless DC motor , graphical user interface , system control module  and other components of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus . While the DC deep cycle battery  is shown in the trunk bay of the vehicle, it should be appreciated that the DC deep cycle battery  could be located anywhere in the vehicle. Finally, while the preferred embodiment described herein depicts DC deep cycle battery  separate from the existing vehicle battery (not shown), it should be appreciated that the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  could receive electrical power from the existing vehicle battery without departing from the scope of this invention. However, the preferred embodiment provides the DC deep cycle battery  so that the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  does not cause unnecessary drain on the existing vehicle battery, to provide more efficient operation and to ease installation of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus .","In operation, the operator may, for example, park the vehicle with the auxiliary equipment and engine running. When the operator activates the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  and then shuts off the vehicle's engine, the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  then immediately provides power to the auxiliary equipment in the vehicle.","Other methods to activate the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  are also available without departing from the scope of this invention. For example, the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  may be automatically activated; using an automatic mode, when the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  detects the vehicle's engine has been shut off. This automatic activation may be dependent on the time of day or the day of the week. For example, when in an automatic mode, the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  may be programmed to detect, using a work schedule function that the operator is not on a working shift and override the automatic activation function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","10","21","13","17","16","26"]},"If the heating module  is needed, the system control module  activates the heating module  and awaits adjustment of the climate controls or a system shutdown command from the operator at the graphical user interface .","If the air conditioner (A\/C) compressor  is needed, as determined by the system control module , the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  then reads the status of high and low pressure sensors (not shown) contained within the A\/C pressure sensor  to ensure that there aren't dangerous levels of pressure already in the vehicle's air conditioning lines (not shown). If the pressure measurements from the A\/C pressure sensor  are within acceptable limits, the system control module  will activate the brushless DC motor  by providing electrical power from the DC deep cycle battery .","Upon activation, the brushless DC motor  produces rotational force and torque to turn a connector between the brushless DC motor  and the v-belt and pulley system . The specific type of connector and coupling between the brushless DC motor  and v-belt and pulley system  can be any well known connector suitable for provide rotational force to the v-belt and pulley system , such as, but not limited to, a direct drive shaft.","As shown in , the v-belt and pulley system  includes a first gear  and a second gear  that are coupled together using a v-belt . The v-belt  can be any now known or later developed automobile drive\/timing belt. Tension is provided on the v-belt  during operation of the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  by the bearing idler belt tensioner . As the brushless DC motor  begins to spin and generate torque at the first gear , the bearing idler belt tensioner  provides tension to the v-belt  such that the brushless DC motor  can over come the frictional forces and load provided by mechanical connection between the second gear  and the air conditioner (A\/C) compressor . The rotational motion of the first gear  is transmitted to the second gear  through the v-belt .","For those who have expertise in the field, it is obvious that other parts could be added to or reconfigured on this system to improve efficiency and\/or simplify the control strategy. For example, the first gear  may be smaller than the second gear  to provide an efficient and small loss gear ratio for the hybrid-idle system and apparatus . Also, as shown in , a one-way clutch  may be added on the connection between the second gear  and the air conditioner (A\/C) compressor . The purpose of the one-way clutch  is to engage and disengage the rotation of the second gear  and to keep the v-belt and pulley system  from moving during normal operation and driving.","In this embodiment and example, the second gear  is coupled to the one-way clutch . When engaged, the one-way clutch  transmits the rotational force from the second gear  to the air conditioner (A\/C) compressor . The one-way clutch  serves as an over-running clutch allowing torque transmission from the one-way clutch  to the air conditioner (A\/C) compressor , while blocking torque and vibration transmission from other rotating parts when the hybrid-idle system and apparatus  is not in operation. This configuration provides efficiency and nominal frictional losses through the mechanical connections.","The one-way clutch  can be engaged electrically, hydraulically, or electro-hydraulically. For example, the one-way clutch  can receive a control signal from the system control module  via the A\/C clutch control . The control signal may be a pulse width modulated signal to engage, partially engage, and disengage, the one-way clutch  based on operating conditions input by the operator using graphical user interface , or due to override conditions, as described herein. The A\/C clutch control  engages and disengages the one-way clutch  from the air conditioner (A\/C) compressor  as indicated by the control signal from the system control module .","The A\/C clutch control  may also provide pressure measurements of the one-way clutch  as provided by the bearing idler belt tensioner . The A\/C clutch control  can output the pressure measurements to the system control module  to determine if the bearing idler belt tensioner  has achieved a minimum amount of tension on the v-belt  as the brushless DC motor  begins to spin. If the pressure on the one-way clutch  is above a predetermined range, the system control module  may provide a control signal to the A\/C clutch control  to engage the one-way clutch . If the pressure measurements are below the range, the system control module  determines that the one-way clutch  has not engaged and a backup procedure can be performed, such as measuring the pressure again and providing additional control signals attempting to engage the one-way clutch. If there continues to be an error, the clutch is not engaged and the operator is notified of the problem on the graphical user interface .","Once the operator has resumed normal operation (re-started) of the vehicle engine, the system control module  senses the restart and disables the one-way clutch  and cuts electrical power from the DC deep cycle battery  to the auxiliary equipment and accessories  and brushless DC motor .","In an additional embodiment, as the vehicle engine is in its normal operation state, the system control module  sends a control signal to a switch to electrically connect the DC deep cycle battery  to the existing vehicle alternator  for recharging the DC deep cycle battery . Once the DC deep cycle battery  has reached the desired charge level, the system control module  may disconnect the vehicle alternator  from the DC deep cycle battery .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["17","14","14","130","150","130","142","150","130","110","17","132","122","112","120","17"]},"The bidirectional links , ,  and  and the transmission network  can be any now known or later-developed device or system usable to connect the one or more user input devices  and the CPU  to the operator input system , including, but not limited to, a direct cable connection, a connection over a wide area network or a local network, a connection over an intranet or a connection over an extranet, a connection over the Internet, a wireless connection, or a connection over any other distributed processing network or system.
