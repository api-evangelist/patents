{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES","REFERENCES"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61\/367,196, filed Jul. 23, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grant Number HL084076 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Tissue characterization is of great interest in disease diagnosis and treatment. For example, in atherosclerosis, the composition of an atherosclerotic plaque is directly linked to the vulnerability of the plaque. Despite advances in determining risk factors and treating myocardial infarction, there are few techniques available for imaging the development and\/or composition of atherosclerotic plaques, which play a major role in cardiovascular disease.","Macrophages are one of the key components involved in the pathology of atherosclerosis. At a relatively early stage in atherosclerotic development, macrophages are present at the \u201ccrime scene\u201d: macrophages are formed from the blood monocytes that enter the arterial wall because of the initial inflammation in the arterial endothelial layer. During the progression of the disease, lipid-laden macrophages play a partial role in the formation of atheroma. In particular, macrophages located in the arterial wall may accumulate low density lipoproteins (LDL) through endocytosis and form foam cells. Foam cells can form lipid pools under the endothelial layer of the arterial wall, which contributes greatly to the vulnerability of a plaque. Macrophage infiltration into the fibrous cap of plaques also accelerates disease progression by causing the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which weaken the fibrous cap and make the plaques prone to rupture. Clearly, the distribution and activity of macrophages provide important information on the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Therefore, it is important to develop robust and cost-effective imaging methods sensitive to the cellular composition of plaques.","The present disclosure generally relates to photoacoustic imaging. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to temperature dependent photoacoustic imaging.","In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method wherein a tissue sample is exposed to electromagnetic radiation and varying levels of thermal energy. Upon irradiation, the tissue sample generates acoustic signals, which are then detected using an ultrasonic sensor. The amplitudes of the detected acoustic signals are determined in relation to the varying levels of thermal energy, which may then be used to characterize the composition of the tissue sample. In some embodiments, the detected acoustic signals may be used to generate an image of the tissue sample. In some embodiments, a tissue sample may also comprise a contrast agent.","The features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are within the spirit of the invention.","While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific example embodiments have been shown in the figures and are herein described in more detail. It should be understood, however, that the description of specific example embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, this disclosure is to cover all modifications and equivalents as illustrated, in part, by the appended claims.","The present disclosure generally relates to photoacoustic imaging. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to temperature dependent photoacoustic imaging.","In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure may allow for characterization of a tissue composition based on intrinsic properties, such as acoustic scattering, optical properties (optical scattering or absorption), and\/or through introducing a contrast agent. The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the fact that the amplitude of a photoacoustic signal is proportional to the fluence of the light, optical absorption coefficient of tissue, and a temperature dependent coefficient, known as the \u201cGr\u00fcneisen coefficient.\u201d For different tissue types, the Gr\u00fcneisen coefficient behaves differently with varying temperature. For example, the Gr\u00fcneisen coefficient of water increases linearly with increased temperature, while the Gr\u00fcneisen coefficient of fat decreases with increased temperature. Therefore, the present disclosure provides methods wherein the composition of a tissue sample may be detected by monitoring the amplitude of an acoustic signal under varying temperatures and in some embodiments, correlating an amplitude measurement to a Gr\u00fcneisen coefficient.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method comprising exposing a tissue sample to thermal energy and electromagnetic radiation so as to generate an acoustic signal. The amplitude of the generated acoustic signal is determined, which may then be used, along with the correlated temperature, to provide information about the composition of the tissue sample. In particular, in some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure may be used to detect the activity and\/or location of macrophages and\/or foam cells in a plaque. The methods of the present disclosure may further comprise subjecting the tissue sample to varying levels of thermal energy while maintaining the same wavelength of radiation. By monitoring photoacoustic signal amplitude changes relative to temperature, characteristics of a tissue sample may be determined. Similarly, the methods of the present disclosure may also allow for the identification of vulnerable plaques, which may be used to guide invasive treatments, such as stent deployment.","As mentioned above, the methods of the present disclosure comprise exposing a tissue sample to electromagnetic radiation. Examples of suitable sources of electromagnetic radiation may include, but are not limited to, a light source such as a laser, including a tunable pulsed laser or a fixed frequency pulsed laser. In some embodiments, a tissue sample may be exposed to pulses of irradiation with a duration of about 1 nanoseconds (\u201cns\u201d) to about 1000 ns. When the tissue to be imaged is simulated by a solid slab tissue, the radiation fluence on the surface of the slab will be about 10 mJ\/cm. For other configurations of the test sample, or for living human or non-human bodies the surface fluence will vary, but will always be in a range which is generally considered safe according to the ANSI laser operation standards.","In accordance with the present disclosure, a wavelength of electromagnetic radiation may be chosen to match the type of tissue being imaged or, if a contrast agent is present in the tissue sample, based on the absorption of the contrast agent. For example, lipid has an optical absorption peak at approximately 1200 nm. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will be able to select an appropriate wavelength based on the type of tissue sample being evaluated and\/or the optical absorption spectra of the contrast agent present within the sample. Furthermore, in some embodiments, a tissue sample may be irradiated at only one wavelength. As a result of using the temperature dependent photoacoustic imaging methods of the present disclosure, the present disclosure may allow for characterization of a tissue sample without the need for multi-wavelength imaging, which may dramatically lower the cost and requirement of the electromagnetic radiation source.","In addition to electromagnetic radiation exposure, the methods of the present disclosure also comprise exposing a tissue sample to varying levels of thermal energy. Examples of suitable thermal energy sources may include any type of heating or cooling element, a heating or cooling water immersion element, etc.","The methods of the present disclosure generally contemplate irradiating a tissue sample at a first temperature and then irradiating the sample at a second increased temperature, however the methods of the present disclosure may also be practiced by irradiating a tissue sample at a first temperature and then irradiating the sample at a second decreased temperature. In some embodiments, the temperature may be varied by approximately 5\u00b0 C. between measurements, although a difference of any amount is contemplated within this disclosure. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the temperature may vary from approximately 4 to 55\u00b0 C. However, as would be recognized by someone of skill in the art, a temperature exceeding 40\u00b0 C. would only be used in conjunction with photothermal therapy, as temperatures in excess of 40\u00b0 C. generally damage tissue.","After irradiation, a generated acoustic wave may be detected using any suitable detection source including, but not limited to, an ultrasonic sensor. Example ultrasonic sensors may include, but are not limited to, transducers including piezoelectric films, such as polyvinylidene fluoride, optical transducers, and optical interferometers.","In some embodiments, a suitable electromagnetic source, a suitable thermal energy source, and a suitable detection source may be combined into one system, which may also be capable of generating an image based at least in part on the detected acoustic signals. Systems suitable for use in the present disclosure may comprise not only a suitable electromagnetic source, a suitable thermal energy source and a suitable detection source, but may also comprise additional electronic and mechanical components such as a pulser\/receiver, a digitizer, a motion controller, a three-dimensional positioning stage, a stepper motor, a delay switch, a microprocessor or data acquisition unit, and\/or a display monitor. One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize additional electronic and mechanical components that may be suitable for use in the methods of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, photoacoustic imaging may be augmented by ultrasound imaging as these imaging systems are complementary. Indeed, photoacoustic imaging can generally be transparently integrated with ultrasound since both photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging systems can utilize the same ultrasound sensor and associated receiver electronics.","In one embodiment, the methods of the present disclosure may comprise using an intravascular photoacoustic (IVPA) imaging device, which may be a catheter-based imaging device. An IVPA imaging device may be particularly useful when imaging atherosclerosis. In particular, IVPA imaging has high spatial resolution and sufficient imaging depth for detecting atherosclerosis. Compared to noninvasive cardiovascular imaging modalities such as MRI and CT, IVPA imaging can achieve higher spatial resolution depending on the transducer frequency used in the application. Furthermore, as compared to invasive but high resolution imaging modalities such as OCT, IVPA has a larger penetration depth of several millimeters relative to 1-2 mm imaging depth in OCT. In addition, by choosing the imaging wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) range where the optical absorption of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is low, IVPA imaging may be performed in the presence of luminal blood without the need to flush the vessel with saline.","Tissue samples suitable for use in the methods of the present disclosure may comprise any biological tissue. In some embodiments, a tissue sample suitable for use in the present disclosure may comprise one or more contrast agents or other foreign object. Contrast agents suitable for use in the present disclosure may include, but are not limited to, any metallic nanoparticle comprising a biocompatible metal that exhibits plasmon resonance. Examples of suitable biocompatible metals that exhibit plasmon resonance include, but are not limited to, copper and noble metals, such as gold and\/or silver. In some embodiments, nanoparticles suitable for use may be coated to optimize their biological and chemical properties and\/or to maximize the acoustic signal generated. Examples of suitable nanoparticles may include those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005\/0175540, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Additionally, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, suitable nanoparticles may also act as a targeted delivery system for therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the targeting mechanism may be antibodies, foliates, aptamers, and\/or polymers that are attached to the outside of the nanoparticles. For example, the targeting antibodies may be specific to upregulated receptors on the surface of cancerous cells. In some embodiments, the drug release may be optically triggered with the use of a laser.","To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples of certain aspects of some embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be read to limit, or define, the scope of the invention.","One example of a specific setup suitable for measuring the photoacoustic response from gold nanorods is schematically illustrated in . A single element focused ultrasound transducer (7.5 MHz center frequency, 50.4 mm focal distance, and 13 mm aperture, Panametrics Inc., V320) was mounted on a one-dimensional positioning stage. Nanosecond laser pulses (7 ns pulse duration, 2 Hz repetition rate) uniformly irradiated the sample. For each laser pulse, the photoacoustic signal was captured and stored for off-line processing. The amplitude of the recorded photoacoustic signal from each pulse was first compensated for the pulse-to-pulse fluence fluctuation, then the photoacoustic signal of each pulse was normalized to the maximum photoacoustic signal recorded. For each sample, mean and standard deviation were computed using 60 photoacoustic signals. No systematic changes that would indicate a change in the nanorods was detected.","The photoacoustic responses from gold nanorods in water solution were characterized by using the setup shown in . The extinction of each 100 \u03bcL gold nanorod solution in a standard 96-well plate was first adjusted to 1.5 using UV-Vis measurements. A 1 mm diameter glass tube was fixed in an acrylate water tank containing an optical window inlay. The glass tube contains an inlet and an outlet for injecting the 20 \u03bcL aliquot into the glass tube without moving the tube during the experiment. The position of the transducer was adjusted so that the injected solution within the tube was located in the center of the ultrasound beam, and the distance between the transducer and the glass tube was kept constant during the entire experiment. During the experiment the water temperature of the acrylate tank was controlled by a thermal circulator.","To exchange solvent from water to oil, 2 \u03bcL of the gold nanorods aqueous solution (O.D.=1.5) was added to a custom-made cone shape well drilled within the optically transparent acrylate plate. The plate was placed in a low-temperature vacuum oven to evaporate the solvent. This procedure was repeated twenty times until 20 \u03bcL aliquote of gold nanorods was added and solvent was evaporated. Thereafter, 20 \u03bcL of silicon oil was added to each well. The experimental setup to measure the photoacoustic response of the samples is shown schematically in . The bottom of the sample plate was immersed in water to ensure good acoustic coupling and signal transmission. The collimated laser beam irradiated the sample from the top and the ultrasound transducer was placed below the plate near the bottom of the water tank. The position of the transducer was adjusted so that the sample was located at the intersection of laser and ultrasound beams and the distance between transducer and sample was kept constant during the entire experiment.","Another example of a specific setup suitable for measuring the photoacoustic response from a sample is schematically illustrated in . Samples (oxLDL mixed with Au NPs or Au NPs in water) were placed in a cuvet which was immersed in a water tank. A heater was immersed in the water tank to increase the sample's temperature. To cool down the samples, ice was added to the water tank. Laser beam was directed through an optical fiber onto the sample. The bottom of the cuvet was made out of glass cover slip. A 40 MHz single element intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) transducer was placed under the cuvet, with the transducer element aligned with the laser beam. As the temperature of the samples was changed, photoacoustic signals generated by the sample were captured after each laser pulse using the IVUS transducer.","The results in  were obtained by heating a commercial off-the-shelf syringe needle (21G) in a water bath and monitoring continuously using photoacoustic imaging. Photoacoustic imaging was performed at 800 nm, at which the stainless steel metal of the needle has an absorption coefficient of approximately 10cm. A 7.5 Mhz ultrasound array transducer was used to detect photoacoustic signals. One complete imaging plane was obtained every 10 seconds, and imaging was performed continuously over one hour. Images were reconstructed offline and the photoacoustic intensity of the needle was recorded in each image. At the 37 minute mark, the heat increase was stopped. Results showed that the photoacoustic intensity decreased with increasing temperature. When the temperature remained constant, the photoacoustic intensity also remained unchanged. Additional experiments were conducted in which the temperature was lowered over time, and demonstrated increasing photoacoustic intensity.","Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein.
