the compounds.","Signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulates and fine-tunes many processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The improper activation of RTKs is involved in the pathogenesis, growth, and metastasis of many cancers. The receptor tyrosine kinase ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) is a member of the insulin receptor superfamily that was initially identified from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (Fischer, P., et al. Blood, 72: 234-240. (1988)). The protein product of this translocation is ALK fused to nucleophosmin (NPM) (Morris et al., 1994). When fused to ALK, the dimerization domain of NPM results in constitutive dimerization and activation of ALK (reviewed in Chiarle, R., Nature reviews, 8:11-23 (2008)). Once activated, ALK recruits several adaptor proteins and stimulates multiple signaling pathways known to mediate tumor cell growth and survival including STAT3, PLC-\u03b3, RAS-ERK1,2, and PI3K-AKT (Bai, R. Y., et al. Molecular and cellular biology 18: 6951-6961 (1998); Bai, R. Y., et al. Blood 96:4319-4327 (2000); Chiarle, R., et al. Nature medicine 11:623-629 (2005); Pulford, K., et al. Journal of cellular physiology 199:330-358 (2004)). The dysregulation of ALK is highly oncogenic, as it is sufficient to induce cell transformation in a several immortalized cell lines (Bischof, D., et al. Molecular and cellular biology 17:2312-2325 (1997); Fujimoto, J., et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 93: 4181-4186 (1996)) and to form tumors in animal models (Chiarle, R., et al. Blood 101: 1919-1927 (2003); Kuefer, M. U., et al. Blood 90: 2901-2910 (1997)). Moreover, NPM-ALK drives tumor formation, proliferation and survival in ALCL (reviewed in (Duyster, J., et al. Oncogene 20: 5623-5637 (2001)).","More recently, ALK translocations have been detected in \u02dc5% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Similar to ALK translocations in ALCL, the fusion proteins in NSCLC display constitutive ALK activity and drive tumor growth and survival (Soda et al., Nature 448: 561-566 (2007); Soda et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105: 19893-19897 (2008)). NSCLC tumors harboring ALK translocations are mutually exclusive from K-Ras or EGFR aberrations and predominantly occur in younger patients that are non-smokers (Rodig et al., Clin Cancer Res 15: 5216-5223 (2009); Shaw et al., J Clin Oncol 27: 4247-4253 (2009); Wong et al., Cancer 115: 1723-1733 (2009)). In addition to chromosomal rearrangements, activating point mutations and amplifications have been reported in a subset of sporadic and familial neuroblastomas, further expanding the spectrum of tumors dependent on ALK activity (Chen et al., Nature 455: 971-974 (2008); George et al., Nature 455: 975-978 (2008); Janoueix-Lerosey et al., Nature 455: 967-970 (2008); Mosse et al., Nature 455: 930-935 (2008)). Neuroblastomas with ALK genetic aberrations also are dependent on ALK for proliferation and survival, and cells expressing ALK containing activating mutations form tumors in animal models.","Inhibitors of RTKs have the potential to cause lethality in cancerous cells that are reliant on deregulated RTK activity while sparing normal tissues. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of ALK would be beneficial for therapeutic intervention in ALCL, NSCLC, neuroblastoma, and other cancers that are dependent on ALK for growth and survival.","The present invention has numerous embodiments.

Examples of such substituents include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, 2-butynyl, and 3-butynyl and the like.","The term \u201ccarbocyclyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d), partially saturated cyclic (i.e., \u201ccycloalkenyl\u201d), or completely unsaturated (i.e., \u201caryl\u201d) hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms (\u201cring atoms\u201d are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent). A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.","A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl. In a fused-ring carbocyclyl system, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two- or three-fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl (tetralinyl), indenyl, indanyl (dihydroindenyl), anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and decalinyl.","The term \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring, which typically contains from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single-ring cycloalkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. A cycloalkyl may alternatively be polycyclic or contain more than one ring. Examples of polycyclic cycloalkyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls.","The term \u201caryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. An aryl may be monocyclic or polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). In the case of polycyclic aromatic rings, only one ring the polycyclic system is required to be unsaturated while the remaining ring(s) may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated. Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, indenyl, indanyl, and tetrahydronapthyl.","In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC\u2014C\u2014\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.","The term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.","The term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.","The term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.","The term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term \u201cperfluoro\u201d means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term \u201cperfluoroalkyl\u201d means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.","The term \u201ccarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014.","The term \u201caminocarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014NH.","The term \u201coxo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means (\u2550O).","The term \u201coxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an ether substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014O\u2014.","The term \u201calkylhydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-OH.","The term \u201calkylamino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-NH.","The term \u201calkyloxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an alkylether substituent, i.e., \u2014O-alkyl.

Such a substituent may be depicted as \u2014S\u2014. This, for example, \u201calkyl-thio-alkyl\u201d means alkyl-S-alkyl (alkyl-sulfanyl-alkyl).","The term \u201cthiol\u201d or \u201csulfhydryl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a sulfhydryl substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014SH.","The term \u201c(thiocarbonyl)\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a carbonyl wherein the oxygen atom has been replaced with a sulfur.

The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard. Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, J. of Immunology 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides.

The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand.","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.

These values were converted to apparent Kvalues using the Cheng-Prusoff relationship.","Results are shown in Table 1",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0595","num":"0616"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"HTRF ALK"]},{"entry":[{},"Example","Human-K"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"2","0.0015"]},{"entry":[{},"3","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"4","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"5","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"6","0.004"]},{"entry":[{},"7","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"8","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"9","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"10","0.005"]},{"entry":[{},"11","1.1"]},{"entry":[{},"12","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"13","0.079"]},{"entry":[{},"14","0.065"]},{"entry":[{},"15","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"16","0.013"]},{"entry":[{},"17","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"18","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"19","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"20","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"21","0.18"]},{"entry":[{},"22","0.008"]},{"entry":[{},"23","0.005"]},{"entry":[{},"24","0.007"]},{"entry":[{},"25","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"26","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"27","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"28","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"29","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"30","0.18"]},{"entry":[{},"31","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"32","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"33","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"34","0.003"]},{"entry":[{},"35","0.004"]},{"entry":[{},"36","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"37","0.004"]},{"entry":[{},"38","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"39","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"40","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"41","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"42","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"43","0.0015"]},{"entry":[{},"44","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"45","0.004"]},{"entry":[{},"46","0.015"]},{"entry":[{},"47","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"48","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"49","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"50","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"51","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"52","0.057"]},{"entry":[{},"53","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"54","<0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"55","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"56","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"57","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"58","0.018"]},{"entry":[{},"59","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"60","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"61","0.011"]},{"entry":[{},"62","0.002"]},{"entry":[{},"63","0.008"]},{"entry":[{},"64","0.006"]},{"entry":[{},"65","0.077"]},{"entry":[{},"66","0.001"]},{"entry":[{},"67","0.013"]},{"entry":[{},"68","0.12"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Compounds of the present invention assessed by the above-described assays were found to have ALK kinase-inhibiting activity.","All publication and patent applications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
