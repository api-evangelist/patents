{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/366,045, entitled RESTRAINT HARNESS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS OF USE AND MANUFACTURE, filed Jul. 20, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/375,205, entitled RESTRAINT HARNESS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS OF USE AND MANUFACTURE, filed Aug. 19, 2010, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The following disclosure is directed generally to personal restraint systems for use in vehicles and, more particularly, to restraint harnesses for use with land vehicles, air vehicles, and other vehicles.","Conventional restraint systems, such as those used in passenger vehicles, typically include one or more webs to restrain passengers in their seats. One type of restraint system, for example, includes a shoulder web and a lap web. Other restraint systems, such as restraint harnesses, include more than two webs (e.g., two shoulder webs, a lap web, and a crotch web) to more adequately restrain passengers during impacts that can cause dislocation of the passengers in the vertical direction. Military vehicles generally include these multiple web restraint harnesses because such vehicles can experience destructive forces (e.g., mines, improvised explosive devices, etc.) that can violently jolt and\/or eject passengers from the vehicle. For example, high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (\u201cHMMWVs\u201d) typically include multiple web restraint harnesses to restrain turret gunners and prevent dislocation during an impact.","The present disclosure describes various embodiments of personal restraint harnesses for use with restraint systems in military land vehicles and other land, air, and sea vehicles. In one embodiment, for example, a restraint harness includes stiffened shoulder webs that enable quick and easy donning of the restraint harness and prevents the webs from tangling and\/or twisting. As used herein, the term \u201cweb\u201d can refer to various known types of straps or belts used with seat belts and other personal restraint systems. Such webs can include, for example, woven material (e.g., nylon, etc.) known in the art for use with personal restraint systems. In certain embodiments, the webs described herein can include segments of a fixed length and\/or adjustable length to accommodate different sized wearers. Webs can be static and\/or the distal ends of the webs can be operably coupled to one or more retractors (e.g., inertial reels) to provide adjustable lengths of the webs.","Certain details are set forth in the following description and in  to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Other details describing well-known structures and systems often associated with vehicle seats, webs, retractors, buckles and other personal restraint devices have not been set forth in the following disclosure to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the invention.","Many of the details, dimensions, angles, and other features shown in the Figures are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments can have other details, dimensions, angles, and features without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that further embodiments of the disclosure can be practiced without several of the details described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["150","100","100","150","152","154","100","154","150","154","100","150","154","100","150","154","154","100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","150","102","104","102","100","102","100","102","102"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b "]},"The shoulder webs  can include a stiffening material  that provides enough rigidity to form and shape the shoulder webs , while remaining flexible enough to substantially conform to the wearer's shoulders. The stiffening material , for example, can include spring steel, foam, molded plastic, formed metal pieces, additional layers of webbing, structural and\/or nonstructural sewing, etc.","In one embodiment, the stiffening material  can extend within a portion of the shoulder webs , such as along portions denoted Y-Y. In this configuration, the stiffening material  can form the shoulder webs  into a shape corresponding to the shape the shoulder webs  take when in use (e.g., inverted U-like shape). This allows the wearer to quickly identify the front, the back, and the inside of the harness . Additionally, the stiffened portion of the shoulder webs  can form openings  (identified individually as a first opening and a second opening ) that make it relatively easy for the wearer to insert his or her arms into the harness . The wearer can don the harness , for example, by first inserting his or her right arm through the first preformed opening created by the first shoulder web and, despite the harness being obscured behind the wearer's back, the wearer can easily insert his or her left arm into the second preformed opening created by the second shoulder web . To further simplify donning, the stiffening material  can be configured to position the obscured second shoulder web substantially outside and\/or above the wearer's shoulder level. Additionally, the stiffened portions of the shoulder webs  are less likely to twist and\/or tangle than conventional, non-structured webs. In other embodiments, the stiffening material  can extend within larger or smaller portions of the shoulder webs  and\/or can form the shoulder webs  into different shapes. In one embodiment, for example, the stiffening material  can extend through the entire length of the shoulder webs .","The torso web  can include a buckle  and a connector  at opposing end portions  (identified individually as a first end portion and a second end portion ) configured to securely fasten the torso web  around the wearer's waist or chest. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the buckle  and the connector  can be any suitable assembly configured to fasten together at least two portions of a web. The torso web  can be fixedly and\/or releasably attached to the shoulder webs . In the illustrated embodiment, first end portions and of the shoulder webs  are sewn to the torso web , and second end portions and of the shoulder webs  are coupled to the torso web  with fittings . In other embodiments, the shoulder webs  and the torso web  can be attached with different fastener systems including, for example, slides, buckles, etc. In another embodiment, the shoulder webs  and the torso web  can be integrally formed.","In various embodiments, the torso web  can include the stiffening material  to form the torso web  into a shape corresponding to the general shape the wearer's torso. The stiffened torso web  can differentiate the torso web  from other webs (e.g., the shoulder webs ), and further simplify orientation of the harness  for donning by the wearer. The stiffened torso web  can also prevent twisting and\/or tangling of the webs. Additionally, the stiffened torso web  can provide the wearer with quick location and orientation of the buckle  and the connector .","In the embodiment illustrated in , the harness  further includes a back web  extending between the first shoulder web and the second shoulder web . The back web  and the shoulder webs  can be fixedly and\/or releasably coupled together using various fastener systems known in the art including, for example, stitching, slides, buckles, fittings, glue, etc. In other embodiments, the back web  and the shoulder webs  can be integrally formed.","In one aspect of this embodiment, the back web  can also include stiffening material  to facilitate spacing the shoulder webs  apart from one another. The stiffened back web  forms the harness  into a shape that corresponds to its shape during use and, thus, further orients the harness  to facilitate donning by the wearer. Additionally, the stiffened portion of the back web  can also help reduce web entanglement.","As shown in , the harness  can further include a back panel  positioned between the shoulder webs , the back web , and the torso web . The back panel  can be made from a mesh material (e.g., a nylon, etc.) to enhance ventilation, a solid material (e.g., a cotton, neoprene, etc.), the stiffening material , additional webs, padding, and\/or other suitable materials. The back panel  can reduce the likelihood that the wearer will mistakenly place his or her arm into the opening created by the shoulder webs , the back web , and\/or the torso web . In other embodiments, the harness  can include additional panels similar to the back panel  that cover superfluous openings and, thereby, orient the harness  for the wearer.","Additionally, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the harness  can include a tail web  attached to the torso web . The tail web  and the torso web  can be attached together using any suitable fastening mechanisms (e.g., stitching, a buckle, etc.) and, in other embodiments, the tail web  can attach to other portions of the harness  (e.g., the shoulder webs , the back web , etc.). The tail web  can include an end fitting  that operably couples to a fixed and\/or retractable engagement feature (e.g., a buckle, a hook, etc.) in the vehicle. In one embodiment, for example, the end fitting  can operably couple to a retractor having a pretentioner that allows the tail web  to change length during normal vehicle operations (e.g., driving, parking, etc.), and tightens the tail web  in a fixed position during an impact. Accordingly, the tail web  can be configured to secure the wearer restrained by the harness  to a vehicle (e.g., a HMMWV, a rotorcraft, a boat, etc.) and reduce dislocation and\/or substantial vertical movement of the wearer. One skilled in the art will recognize that the end fitting  can be any type of connector that can adequately secure the harness  to a vehicle.","The harness  can further include a retainer clip  configured to releasably retain the end fitting  when it is uncoupled from the vehicle. The retainer clip  can prevent the loose tail web  and the end fitting  from entangling with the harness , catching on the surroundings, and\/or damaging nearby objects. Additionally, the retainer clip  can position the uncoupled end fitting  in a location that is easy for a wearer to find and grasp, such as on the front of the harness . The features of the retainer clip  are described in more detail with reference to .","In various aspects of the disclosure, the harness  can further include one or more adjusters  and\/or one or more web slides . The adjusters  can be configured to extend or shorten the webs (e.g., the shoulder webs , the torso web , etc.) for different sized wearers, and can be any suitable adjuster known in the art for use with a restraint system. The web slides  configured to secure loose and\/or extra webbing, and can be any suitable web slide for use with restraint systems. In alternative embodiments, loose and\/or extra webbing can be secured by a different fastener (e.g., Velcro) or the web slides  can be omitted. A person skilled in the art will recognize that the adjusters  and the web slides  can be made out of any suitable material, such as plastic, rubber, metal, etc.","Additionally, as shown in , the harness  can further include one or more pull tabs  that orient the harness  for the wearer. In the illustrated embodiment, the first shoulder web and the first end portion of the torso web  includes one pull tab , and the second shoulder web and a second end portion of the torso web  includes two pull tabs . By glancing at the pull tabs , the wearer can easily determine which shoulder web  corresponds to which side of the torso web . In other embodiments, the shoulder webs  and\/or the torso web  can include other identifying features that orient the harness  for the wearer. For example, the shoulder webs  and the torso web  can include an \u201cL\u201d and an \u201cR\u201d stitched into the webbing to demarcate a left and a right side of the harness .","In still further embodiments, the harness  can include one or more additional webs. For example, the harness  can include a crotch web configured to extend between the wearer's legs and further secure the wearer in the harness . Each additional web can include the stiffening material  to form the webs and prevent the webs from tangling and\/or twisting.","As shown in , the stiffening material  extends within a portion of the shoulder web  along the curve Y-Y to form the shoulder webs  into an upside-down U-like shape. The wearer can easily orient the harness  because the stiffened portions of shoulder webs  create an identifiable shape and reduce twisting and tangling of the webs (e.g., the shoulders webs , the torso web , the tail web , etc.). In use, the wearer can insert one of his or her arms into one of the preformed openings  created by the stiffened portion of the shoulder webs , and can easily locate and insert his or her other arm into the preformed opening  created by the stiffened portion of the other shoulder web . Additionally, the wearer does not have to blindly search behind his or her back for the other shoulder web  because the stiffening material  can form the shoulder webs  outward and upward to ease insertion of the wearer's arms. The back web  can also aid in more effectively positioning the shoulder webs  by spacing them apart from one another. Moreover, the back panel  can prevent the wearer from accidentally inserting his or her arms into the incorrect opening. After inserting both arms into the harness , the wearer can encircle the torso web  around his or her torso (e.g., the chest, the waist, etc.) and engage the connector  with the buckle . If necessary, the wearer can tighten and\/or loosen the harness  with the adjusters  and secure any loose webbing with the web slides . The tail web  can be secured to a vehicle, and therefore the harness  can reduce vertical displacement of the wearer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["4","4","102","406","130","406","404","130","406","402","406","402","130","404","406"]},"In further embodiments, the shoulder web  can made from the stiffening material itself. The shoulder web  can include, for example, spring steel integrated throughout the webbing. In still further embodiments, the shoulder web  can include additional layers of webbing, rubber, structural sewing, nonstructural sewing, and\/or other suitable features that stiffen portions of the webbing. A person skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments of the shoulder web  described with reference to  can be applied to other features of the harness  including, for example, the torso web , the back web , and the back panel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A"],"b":["550","500","500","100","500","502","502","502","530","130","502","500","502","506","550","520","500","550","500","504","504","508","510","508","510","550","500","502","514","504"],"i":["a ","b "]},"Referring now to , the side view of the wearer  donning the harness  illustrates the stiffening material  within a portion of the second shoulder web extending along a curve Z-Z. The portion including the stiffening material  is more structured than the limp web ends  dangling from the torso web . As shown, the stiffening material  still provides the shoulder web with at least enough flexibility to conform to the wearer's shoulder. Additionally,  shows a tail web  attached to the torso web  and an end fitting  attached to the tail web . The end fitting  can be releasably coupled to an engagement feature  (e.g., a buckle, a retractor, clip, etc.) attached to a portion of a vehicle to prevent dislocation and\/or substantial vertical movement of the wearer  in response to rapid movement of the vehicle. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the engagement feature  is positioned on a rail  proximate a turret gunner position  of a vehicle  (e.g., an HMMWV, military jet, etc.). The engagement feature  can slide along the rail  to facilitate rotational movement of the turret gunner (i.e., the wearer ) and the harness  coupled thereto can restrain the vertical displacement of the turret gunner during sudden impacts. In other embodiments, the engagement feature  can be coupled to stationary portions of the vehicle  (e.g., the floor of the vehicle ) and\/or proximate other positions in the vehicle  (e.g., the driver position).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5C","b":["550","500","516","502","530","500","518","516","502","504","518","550"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6B"],"b":["127","127","127","628","631","628","124","628","634","632","124","632","625","124","632","628","632","127","127","127","128","632","124"]},"In various embodiments, the engagement feature  can further include a spring portion  configured to increase the flexibility and\/or resiliency of the engagement feature  and, thus, ease retaining and\/or releasing the end fitting . In the illustrated embodiment, the spring portion  extends along a section of the engagement feature  denoted X-X. In other embodiments, the spring portion  can extend within a different portion of the engagement feature  and\/or the retainer clip . In further embodiments, the engagement feature  can releasably secure another portion of the end fitting  and\/or the tail web .","The attachment feature  can be configured to secure the retainer clip  to a portion of a restraint harness (e.g., the harness  of ). In the illustrated embodiment, the attachment feature  defines an opening  configured to receive at least a portion of a web (e.g., the shoulder webs  or the torso web  of ) to attach the retainer clip  on the web.
