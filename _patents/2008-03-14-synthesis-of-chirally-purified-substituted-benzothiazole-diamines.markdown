Field of Invention:","Not applicable","2. Description of Related Art:","The compound 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole is a synthetic aminobenzothiazole derivative whose (6S) enantiomer, commonly known as pramipexole and commercially available under the Mirapex\u00ae name, is a potent dopamine agonist, and thus, mimics the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Pramipexole has also been shown to have both neuroprotective and dopaminergic activities, presumably through inhibition of lipid peroxidation, normalization of mitochondrial metabolism and\/or detoxification of oxygen radicals. Therefore, pramipexole may have utility as an inhibitor of the cell death cascades and loss of cell viability observed in neurodegenerative diseases and is indicated for treating Parkinson's disease, cluster headaches, restless legs syndrome and bipolar disorder with only small daily doses required and tolerated by patients activates dopamine receptors. Additionally, oxidative stress may be caused by an increase in oxygen and other free radicals, and has been associated with the fatal neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving the motor neurons of the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. About 10% of all ALS patients are familial cases, of which 20% have mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) gene. The SOD-1 enzyme may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Recent studies also link the premature neuronal death associated with ALS to mutated mitochondrial genes which lead to abnormalities in functioning of the energy production pathways in mitochondria.","The neuroprotectant activity of both enantiomers of pramipexole have typical therapeutic doses expected to be in the range of about 10 mg\/day to about 1,500,mg\/day. However, the pramipexole's agonistic effect on of the Dfamily of dopamine receptors only requires therapeutic doses that range between 0.5 and 5.0 mg\/day, and even these relatively low doses adverse side effects have been reported. For example, the Boehringer Ingelheim product insert for Mirapex\u00ae sets the maximally tolerated dose for humans at 4.5 mg\/day, and a dose of pramipexole as low as 1.5 mg has been shown to cause somnolence in humans. Single dose toxicity of pramipexole after oral administration has been studied in rodents, dogs, monkeys and humans. In rodents, death occurred at doses of 70-105 mg\/kg and above which is equivalent to a human dose of 7-12 mg\/kg\/ or approximately 500-850 mg for a 70 kg (\u02dc150 lb) individual. In dogs, vomiting occurred at 0.0007 mg\/kg and above, while monkeys displayed major excitation at 3.5 mg\/kg. In human subjects, an initial single dose of pramipexole of greater than 0.20 mg was not tolerated. All species showed signs of toxicity related to exaggerated pharmacodynamic responses to the pramipexole related to dopaminergic agonism.","Thus, a clinical use of pramipexole as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant is unlikely, as the high doses needed for the neuroprotective or anti-oxidative\/mitochondrial. normalization action are not accessible due to high dopamine receptor affinity associated with the (6S) enantiomer. In contrast, (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine is an effective mitochondria-targeted neuroprotectant that exhibits excellent anti-oxidative properties when administered without adverse side effects. Thus, higher doses of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N-6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine can be tolerated by patients and will allow greater brain, spinal cord and mitochondrial concentrations increasing the degree to which oxidative stress and\/or mitochondrial dysfunction may be reduced. The neuroprotective effect of the compositions of this disclosure may also be derived at least in part from the ability of the (6R) enantiomer of pramipexole to prevent neural cell death by at least one of three mechanisms. First, the (6R) enantiomer of pramipexole may be capable of reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species in cells with impaired mitochondrial energy production. Second, the (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N-6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine may partially restore the reduced mitochondrial membrane potential that is correlated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Third, the (6R) enantiomer of pramipexole may block the apoptotic cell death pathways which are produced by pharmacological models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases and mitochondrial impairment. High doses of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine required to elicit these neuroprotective effects generally require highly pure preparations of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine which take into account the upper limit of (6S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine contamination (0.5 mg to 5.0 mg).","Processes for the preparation of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole using a simple alkylation reaction were first described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,843,086 and 4,886,812. Other preparations of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole have been described that involve reductive amination rather than simple alkylation and, thus, produce a mixture of the R and S optical isomers with no direct means for further purification of the optical isomers. These known processes for the production of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole are expensive, labor intensive, and utilize hydride reducing agents that pose safety risks. Furthermore, there are currently no known processes for the direct synthesis of the pure (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine from a diamine. Therefore, the R isomer must be synthesized as a mixture of the optical isomers that is purified by expensive and time consuming methods that may utilize other problematic substances. Moreover, known processes involving deamination result in a loss of enantiomeric purity, and methods useful for resolution of the optical isomers from mixtures fall short of producing chirally and chemically pure preparations of the R enantiomer or the S enantiomer.","Embodiments of the invention presented herein are directed to a process for preparing a chirally purified substituted 4,5,6,7,-tetrahydro-benzothaizole diamine including the steps of: heating a solution comprising entantiomerically enriched 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzothiazole diamine of general formula (1):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"15.16mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08519148-20130827-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Rrepresents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkenyl or alkynyl group each having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkanoyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl alkyl or phenyl alkanoyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl part, whilst the above-mentioned phenyl nuclei may be substituted by 1 or 2 halogen atoms;","Rrepresents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;","Rrepresents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to 7 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 7 carbon atoms, an alkenyl or alkynyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkanoyl group having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, a phenyl alkyl or phenyl alkanoyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl part, whilst the phenyl nucleus may be substituted by fluorine, chlorine or bromine atoms,","Rrepresents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkenyl or alkynyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms; and","at least one or R, R, Ror Ris a hydrogen in an organic solvent; and an alkyl sulfonate or an alkyl halide in a solvent to form a reaction mixture reacting the reaction mixture; and recovering a chirally purified, substituted 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzothiazole diamine."]}}}},"In various embodiments, the alkyl sulfonate may be of general formula (11):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"14.56mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08519148-20130827-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["R\u2032 is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbons, or a cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, allyl, having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or a benzyl, chlorobenzyl, phenyl or phenyl alkyl; and","Z is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbons, or a cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, allyl, having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or a benzyl, chlorobenzyl, phenyl or phenyl alkyl.

In other embodiments, after the n-propyl halide or n-propyl sulfonate has been completely added to the 2,6 diamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzothiazole, the reaction may continue under heating for an additional period of time ranging from, for example, about 1 hour to about 12 hours, in a reaction step.

Any solvent or mixture of solvents known in the art in which the diamine and alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate can dissolved may be used. For example, in various embodiments, the solvents may be, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethly sulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylohosphoric triamide, glacial acetic acid, pyridine, dioxan, ethanol, 1-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol, or combinations thereof, for example, dioxan\/water, ethanol\/water, tetrahydrofuran\/water and the like. In embodiments in which a combination of an organic solvent and water are used, the organic solvent may have a water content of from about 0 to about 10 volume percent. Preferably, the solvents used in the practice of this invention are standard ACS grade solvents. The selection of a solvent may enhance the reaction rate of the S2 reaction. In some embodiments, one or more base such as, for example, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, sodium acetate, potassium-tertbutyloxide, triethylamine, di-isoproplyethylamine and the like, may be additionally added to the reaction mixture which may further enhance the efficiency of the reaction. When added, a base may be present in a concentration of about 0.5 to about 3.0 equivalents based on the solvent.

For example, alkylating agents may include, but not limited to, methyliodide, dimethylsulfate, ethylbromide, diethylsulfate, allyliodide, benzylbromide, 2-phenylethylbromide and methyl-p-toluenesulfonate.","In general, the reaction may be carried out under ambient conditions. However, the reaction temperature may vary among embodiments from between about \u221210\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. and, in particular embodiments, from 0\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C.","In further embodiments, dissolved diamine may be heated and mixed or stirred during the reaction. For example, various embodiments include the step of heating a dissolved diamine, adding a n-propyl sulfonate or n-propyl halide which may, in some embodiments, be dissolved in a solvent to form a mixture, and stirring the mixture. In other embodiments, a base such as di-isoproplyethylamine may be added to a solution including a diamine. N-propyl sulfonate or n-propyl halide may be, dissolved in a solvent, and then added to the diamine\/di-isoproplyethylamine solution and this reaction mixture may be stirred. The temperature of reactions of such embodiments may, generally, be below the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture, more specifically, below the boiling temperature of the solvent(s) of the reaction mixture. For example, in some embodiments, an elevated temperature may be lower than about 125\u00b0 C. In others, an elevated temperature may be lower than about 100\u00b0 C., and in yet another embodiment lower than about 95\u00b0 C., and in still others less than about 75\u00b0 C. Therefore, the reaction temperature may range from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 125\u00b0 C. in some embodiments, about 55\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C. in other embodiments, about 60\u00b0 C. to about 95\u00b0 C. in still other embodiments, about 60\u00b0 C. to about 75\u00b0 C. in yet other embodiments and in certain embodiments, from about 55\u00b0 C. to about 65\u00b0 C.","The reaction time may vary within embodiments, and may depend upon, for example, the identities of the reactants, the solvent system and the chosen temperature. For example, in some embodiments, the reaction time may be from about 0.5 hours to about 12 hours. In other embodiments, the reaction time may be from about 1 hour to about 8 hours, and in certain embodiments, the reaction time may be about 4 hours. In, general, the reaction time is chosen to provide sufficient time for substantially all of the diamine to undergo alkylation. In particular embodiments, the reaction time further provides sufficient time for the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole formed to precipitate out of the reaction solution and from visible crystals.","Embodiments of the invention may further include the step of cooling the reaction to a temperature about, room temperature (25\u00b0 C.) following the reaction. In such embodiments, the reaction may be cooled for any amount of time with or without continued stirring. For example, in some embodiments, the reaction may be cooled with stirring for about 0.5 to about 4 hours or more, and in other embodiments, the reaction may be cooled with stirring for about 2 hours.","More specific embodiments may include the steps of: dissolving a diamine in dimethylformamide; heating the dissolved diamine to an elevated temperature; adding the n-propyl sulfonate or n-propyl halide dissolved in dimethylformamide to form a reaction mixture; and stirring the reaction mixture for about 4 hours. In another embodiment, the steps may include dissolving a diamine in dimethylformamide, heating the dissolved diamine to an elevated temperature, slowly adding to the heated dissolved diamine 1.25 molar equivalents of n-propyl sulfonate or n-propyl halide dissolved in 10 volumes of dimethylformamide and 1.25 molar equivalents of di-isoproplyethylamine with stirring the reaction over a period of about 4 hours. In yet another embodiment, 1.25 molar equivalents of di-isoproplyethylamine may be added to a diamine dissolved in dimethylformamide and the n-propyl sulfonate or n-propyl halide dissolved in dimethylformamide may be added to this mixture with stirring for about 4 hours.","Following synthesis, entantiomerically pure isomers of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole may be recovered using a trituration step in which the major isomer is isolated as a precipitated crystals, while the minor stereoisomer remains in solution. Without wishing to be bound by theory, insolubility of the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product in achiral reagents, such as p-TSA, may be independent of the R or S enantiomer, such that purity of the recovered isomer may depend only on the volume of the reaction solution and starting percentage of the major isomer. Thus, in an embodiment such as is described above, an entantiomerically pure (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine (R:S equals 100:0) yield may be produced from a reaction in which diamine is provided in an R to S ratio of 60:40.","An unexpected advantage of the process for preparing 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole described above is the limited solubility of the sulfonate or halide salt of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole in polar organic solvents which causes the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product to precipitate once formed thereby purifying the final synthesis product, 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole, from the reaction mixture. In further embodiments, the substitution reaction such as that illustrated in  may result in a sufficient achiral salt, p-TSA, concentration to cause the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole to become insoluble. and crystallize in the reaction solution without adding additional agents, such as, for example, additional achiral salts.","The reaction embodied above and described in  may provide highly purified 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole in a one-pot synthesis method. For example, in embodiments of the process, the chemical purity of the final 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole prepared may be at least 97%, 98%, and up to 100% without additional purification steps, and in particular embodiments, the chemical purity may be from 99.90% to 100% without any additional purification steps. In still other embodiments, the final 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole may be substantially free of achiral salts such as, for example, p-TSA. For example, in some embodiments, the achiral salt concentration of the final synthesis product may be less than 3%, and in others the achiral salt concentration of the final synthesis product may be less than 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001% and so on. In certain embodiments, the achiral salt concentration may be less than 1.5 ppm to less than 25 ppb or less than 0.00015% to less than 0.0000025%. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the ability to produce highly chemically pure 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole in a one-pot method may demonstrate a significant advancement in the production of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole. Moreover, such purity may provide pharmaceutical grade 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole more efficiently than previous methods.","In various embodiments, the chiral purity for the R enantiomer prepared and purified may be greater than 99.6% about. when a starting material that is entantiomerically enriched for R diamine is used. Similarly, in various other embodiments, the chiral purity for the S enantiomer produced and purified may be greater than 99.6% when a starting material that is entantiomerically enriched for S diamine is used. In some embodiments, the chiral purity for the R enantiomer prepared and purified may be greater than 99.8% about when a starting material that is entantiomerically enriched for. R diamine is used. Similarly, in some other embodiments, the chiral purity for the S enantiomer produced and purified may be greater than 99.8% when a starting material that is entantiomerically enriched for S diamine is used. In particular embodiments, the chiral purity for the R enantiomer prepared and purified may be greater than 99.9% about when a starting material that is entantiomerically enriched for R diamine is used. Similarly, in particular other embodiments, the chiral purity for the S enantiomer produced and purified may be greater than 99.9% when a starting material that is entantiomerically enriched for S diamine is used.","Not wishing to be bound by theory, the solubility of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine and (6S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine may be the same in the trituration step of the synthesis and purification processes. For example, if a synthesis process is carried out with 90 grams of the (6R) diamine and 10 grams of the (6S)diamine, and the solubility of the final 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product is 10 grams for either enantiomer, then 80.grams of the (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine product and 0 grams of the (6S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine product would precipitate (assuming a 100% chemical conversion from the diamine and no change in molecular weight in going to the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product). That is, 10 grams of each enantiomer of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole may be expected to go into solution. This would lead to a 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product with a 100% chiral purity for the (6R) enantiomer. The opposite ratio of starting materials for the synthesis process (90 grams of the (6S) diamine and 10 grams of the (6R) diamine) may generate a reaction product of 90 grams of the (6S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine and 10 grams of the (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine. From this reaction product mixture, 80 grams of the (6S) enantiomer and 0 grams of the (6R) enantiomer of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole would be expected to precipitate, leading to a 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product with a 100% chiral purity for the (6S) enantiomer. Thus, the volumes which are used for a reaction may have a large potential effect on the final yield and chiral purity. That is, too large a volume will reduce the yield as more of the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole enantiomer products will go into solution (but. increase the chiral purity) and too small a volume will increase the yield as less of the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole products will go into solution (but reduce the chiral purity).","Other embodiments of the invention are directed to a process for the purification of entantiomerically pure 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole from a mixture of (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine and (6S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine including a trituration step.

In a particular embodiment, the organic solvent may be ethanol.","The acid of various embodiments may include: halogenic acids such as, for example, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and hydroiodic acid; inorganic acids such as, for example, nitric, perchloric, sulfuric and phosphoric acid; organic acids such as, for example, sulfonic acids (methanesulfonic, trifluoromethane sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic or p-toluenesulfonic), acetic, malic, fumaric, succinic, citric, benzoic, gluconic, lactic, mandelic, mucic, pamoic, pantothenic, oxalic and maleic acid; and amino acids such as aspartic or glutamic acid. The acid may be a mono- or di-acid, such as, for example, a di-hydrohalogenic, di-sulfuric, di-phosphoric or di-organic acid. The acid of embodiments may be used as an achiral reagent which is, generally, not selected on the basis of any expected or known preference for interaction with, or precipitation of, a specific optical isomer of the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole to be isolated. For example, in one embodiment, the selected acid may be p-toluenesulfonic acid. The amount of acid added may vary and is generally provided at about 1 molar equivalent to about 4 molar equivalents of the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole.","Insoluble 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole may be separated from the reaction solution by any method known in the art.

There are numerous methods for filtering a solid from a solution, and any such method may by useful in embodiments of the invention. In other embodiments, insoluble 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole may be isolated by centrifugation. Again, such methods are well known in the art and any such method may be used in various embodiments of the invention. The insoluble crystalline 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole may then be washed to remove any contaminating solvent, sulfonate or halide salt, or soluble enantiomer of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole from the crystals using any method available.

For example, in some embodiments, the starting mixture may contain at least 55% or greater of either the R or S enantiomer, and in others the starting mixture may contain about 70% or greater of either the R or the S enantiomer. In still other embodiments, the starting material may contain greater than about 90% of either the R or S enantiomer. In particular embodiments, the starting mixture is enriched for (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine.","Without wishing to be bound by theory, the relative solubility of the optical isomers of the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole in the achiral salt or acid solutions allows for chiral and chemical purification that is unexpected by using a relatively easy recovery method via a simple trituration step. The enhanced enrichment resulting from the purification methods described above result in that may reach optical purity.

In particular embodiments, the optical purity may be 100%.","The processes disclosed herein have several advantages. First, the processes avoid the use of borane reagents such as sodium borohydride, common in the reductive amination schemes used in the prior art, which decomposes rapidly to borane and hydrogen upon acidification. Second, reductive amination schemes involve the use of a two-step procedure in which the amide is formed first, followed by a reduction step. The methods of this disclosure are one-pot synthesis and purification procedures, and therefore provide a safer, easier and more economical synthesis. Third, there is no loss of chirality during the alkylation processes of the S2 reaction mechanism of this disclosure, as opposed to previous synthesis schemes where chiral purity is often reduced or lost altogether during synthesis. Finally, the 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product of the nucleophilic substitution reaction precipitates from the reaction mixture. This may be especially true for the p-TSA salt. form of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole. This is an unexpected advantage of the methods of the instant disclosure and provides unique methods for chiral and chemical enrichment or purification of the final 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product.","Additional embodiments of the invention include the conversion of either sulfonate or halide salts of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole or free base 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole into an hydrochloric acid (HCl) salt as illustrated in .

Further, the data shows that the synthesis is equally efficient for either enantiomer of 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole. These data also demonstrate that the enantiomers behave independently of one another, in that the solubility of one enantiomer appears to be unaffected by the concentration in solution of the other. For example, the various synthesis reactions carried out using condition F all have chemical yields of about 50%, independent of the percentage of predominant diamine enantiomer of the starting material. When the volume of the organic solvent used in the synthesis reaction is increased, the chemical yield is reduced, but the chiral yield is increased. This is apparent by comparison of the reaction carried out in conditions F and G, where an 85:15 ratio of (6R):(6S) diamine produced a 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product having an 86.8% chiral purity for the (6R) enantiomer when the reaction used 10 volumes of the organic solvent and a 99.8% chiral purity for the (6R) enantiomer when the reaction used 18 volumes of the organic solvent.

The MTBE is observed to increase 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole recovery (yield) from the synthesis reaction, but may reduce the overall chiral purity. This is born out by a comparison of the results for trials carried out in an 85:15 ratio of (6R):(6S) diamine, which produced a 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole product having a 86.8% chiral purity for the (6R) enantiomer when the reaction included the MTBE organic solvent and a 99.9% chiral purity for the (6R) enantiomer when the reaction did not include the MTBE organic solvent.
