{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This patent application claims priority U.S. provisional application 61\/376,171, filed on Aug. 23, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein.","The present invention relates generally to communications. More specifically, particular embodiments of the invention relate to an organizational critical messaging system, and related methods, for enabling and implementing a messaging system that allows an organization to communicate critical information with mobile users in real time.","Today's organizations are faced with challenges involving the need to make informed decisions in the shortest time possible. In order to make such informed decisions, organizations must get feedback or input from multiple members of their organizations, many of whom are available and reachable through mobile connections on mobile devices.","With today's increasingly mobile world\u201490% of the planet has access to mobile networks\u2014organizations are able to connect to increasingly distributed groups. However, ubiquitous mobile connectivity has not yet provided these organizations with capabilities to connect to their mobile users utilizing structured and prioritized messaging. Organizations are faced with challenges in establishing priority connections to members to deliver and receive important information quickly, elevating priority for response and for requests and, furthermore, structuring these communications so the organization can make rapid and informed decisions.","Communications over mobile data networks for both business and non-business purposes have expanded rapidly, as exhibited by the explosion in text messaging, social networking, voice-over Internet protocol usage, and expanded messaging capabilities on mobile devices such as telephones. Advances in data connectivity such as LTE 3G and 4G data connectivity, GPS functionality, and push technology platforms, have enabled organizations to distribute and gather information directly and immediately. However, these same advances enable many other services to directly communicate with the same mobile devices and these communications aggregate on the same mobile devices with the organization's communications. Numerous applications exist that create a flood of information messages and updates but have little or no degree of priority and importance relative to the organization's communications. As a result, organizational priority access and information exchanged with mobile users is compromised and minimized by non-organizational information. Organizations therefore continually face significant challenges in communicating and receiving important information with their mobile users. Yet, mobility service and technology solutions have yet to be made available which are designed as a mobility solution, that are built for organizations, that enable those organizations to send and received communications on a dedicated system, that provide the organization with status and analytics of the communications, that aggregate the messages on a mobile application dedicated to the organization on their users mobile devices, that utilize emerging technological features to make those communications highly visible, and that structure messages between the organization and their mobile users.","In close correlation to the adoption of mobile devices is the world of online, web-based social networking. Individuals' willingness to connect in defined user groups for specific social and business reasons represents an unprecedented advancement in connectivity and socialization. As social networking opportunities increase and technology advances, individuals and organizations will become more and more connected and will continue to participate in this type of communication with growing frequency.","Since the invention of the pager, there have been many attempts to leverage mobile connectivity to extend messaging to a wider organized community of mobile users. These early concepts were handicapped by small populations of users, limited connectivity and crude mobile devices. Advancements in mobile device technology and networking present a game-changing opportunity to establish a prioritized solution for distributing important messages.","The growth in use of mobile devices, mobile applications and social and professional online networking has opened opportunities for structured and priority handling of messages specifically tailored for communities of mobile device users. The present invention, known generally by its commercial brand as Ambit, is a tool that enables organizations to extend structured messaging to communities of people using mobile devices.","The present invention establishes a connection between the organization and its members in order to distribute important messages that are delivered using mobile device utilities and features to display and alert the mobile user that a priority message has delivered to the mobile user's device. The connection between the organization and mobile user is secure and authenticated, and all communications are made between end points that are dedicated to that communication between the organization and mobile user. All messages sent and received by the organization are logged and auditable by the organization, and messages received and sent by the mobile user are also logged and auditable on the user's mobile device.","The present invention is a method and apparatus to exchange secured, critical structured messages between an organization and mobile users. Features of the system enable prioritizing important information, empowering and demanding mobile user response, establishing real-time status, enhancing effectiveness and timeliness of event response, and enabling priority communications more effectively, directly, and around the clock to all selected personnel regardless of their location. The system contains structured messaging applications for organizations and their mobile users, which are delivered to organizations as a service. The service is designed to be deployed by organizations such as businesses, schools, clubs, unions, fan bases, law enforcement and government, and is extensible to smaller groups such as families, communities and neighborhoods. One objective of the invention is therefore to enable organizations to communicate directly with their mobile users on a system that provides applications for communication for both the organization and their mobile users.","The present invention is designed for organizations and to work over Internet-connected and mobile carrier networks. By establishing priority connectivity through Internet, push technology services and wireless carrier networks to mobile users of the organization, the invention improves organizational decision making, workforce security and safety, and raises the standard of mobile connectivity and information distribution. The invention is designed to deliver low-bandwidth structured messaging over a dedicated and prioritized network while minimizing use of mobile device resources such as battery power, computing, memory, and bandwidth.","Elements of the present invention's technology platform combine mobile data connectivity and structured messaging to provide a powerful mobile user connectivity tool. Among the many functions of the present invention are information distribution, such as prioritized handling of important information, from the organization, mobile user-initiated messaging to the organization, and status request messaging distribution from the organization. In each case, the use of data communication and push technologies over Internet and mobile data networks to send structured messages creates a highly organized and near real-time exchange of information.","The present invention's platform complements existing organizational communications such as e-mail, voicemail, instant messaging and voice. The Ambit service augments many operational activates of organizations such as security, mass notification communications, sales information and status, and business continuity operations which are focused on distributing and gathering time sensitive information and connecting to its mobile users. The system provides value as a highly adaptable and customizable system that can be implemented and used with minimal administrative burden on the organization.","Other benefits to the Ambit service include easy registration and management of users, linkage to other response organizations such as local law enforcement agencies, and extension of service to the families of personnel. The Ambit service also allows organizations to have their own colors, look and logo (i.e., a branded presence). The system provides organizations with a communication base to build on, and offers organizations a new, prioritized information sharing capability.","The Ambit service therefore offers product choices to organizations driven by at least two dynamics. The first of these is the rapidly-improving capabilities of mobile devices and the second is the maturation of user base expectations as they gain experience with this developing technology.","Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, a private mobile data communications apparatus comprises a system client configured to manage interaction with a system user and including at least one system client database and a system client user interface controlled by an application server, a mobile client configured to manage interaction with a mobile user having one or more mobile devices assigned to the mobile user, and a secure messaging server configured to manage interaction between the system client and the mobile client and with one or more external systems providing supportive services to either of the system client or the mobile client, the secure messaging server including an application server component and a database server component each performing messaging functions in the interaction between the system client and the mobile client and with one or more external system. The apparatus also comprises an event relay module configured to initiate events from the secure messaging server and manage communication of event data between the secure messaging server and the system client, the mobile client, and the one or more external systems, the event data including information determined from initiated events among the messaging functions that is distributed to and collected from any of the system client, the mobile client, and the one or more external system, the messaging functions including executing instructions to send structured messages from the system client and receiving structured responses from the mobile client related to one or more initiated events, a first application programming interface module configured to respond to calls initiated for exchange of the event data between the secure messaging server and the system client to enable communication with the mobile user, and a second application programming interface module configured to respond to calls initiated for exchange of the event data between the secure messaging server to and the mobile client to enable communication with the system user.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of managing private communications with one or more mobile users within an organization comprises connecting an organizational system user with one or more mobile users in the organization via a secure messaging server configured to manage a system client for communicating with the organizational system user and a mobile client for communicating with the one or more mobile users, creating a structured request for information communicative of an event in response to an event initiation call from the secure messaging server to the one or more mobile users and pushing the information communicative of the event to at least one of the one or more mobile users, and enabling the at least one of the one or more mobile users to push, via a mobile device, a structured response having information responsive to the event to the secure messaging server that allows the organizational system user to interpret and execute a course of action related to the event initiation call.","In still another embodiment of the present invention, a method of coordinating a private mobile messaging infrastructure, comprising integrating a set of defined interface protocols that execute one or more messaging functions and facilitate communications between a system user and mobile users, the set of defined interface protocols including a relay protocol configured to call one or more external systems and execute events instructive of the one or more messaging functions, a system protocol configured to carry out messaging functions directed to the mobile users that include sending structured messages to and interpreting structured responses from the mobile users, and a mobile protocol configured to carry out messaging functions directed to the system user that including sending structured messages to and responding to structured messages from the system user via a mobile device.","Other embodiments, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments, taken together with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.","In the following description of the present invention reference is made to the accompanying figures which form a part thereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, exemplary embodiments illustrating the principles of the present invention and how it is practiced. Other embodiments will be utilized to practice the present invention and structural and functional changes will be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The present invention, referenced herein as the Ambit service and more generally as Ambit, is a communications platform and service that enables organizations to establish a priority channel to distribute critical messaging between, to and from communities of mobile users both within organizations and with users and systems external to organizations. The present invention can also be considered as a method and apparatus of providing information, empowering response, establishing real-time status, enhancing effectiveness of event response, and enabling support to all selected mobile users regardless of the time and their location. The present invention leverages the proliferation of mobile computing devices to interact with selected personnel via one or more software applications that are either resident on and\/or accessible via the mobile computing devices. One aspect of the invention is that a message sent to any community of mobile users has an elevated requirement for a response from each and every mobile user. Furthermore, the system delivers messages that mobile applications display for response\u2014the mobile user response in turn is in a structured format that can be quickly aggregated, and easily analyzed among many other mobile user responses, in just moments after the response is received by the organization. Finally the invention is designed to be agnostic of mobile device platforms as well as the underlying carrier used for general mobile voice\/data functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","200","210","110","120","240","320","130","140","150","152","154","160","160","160","120","170","170","170","140","180","160","170","100","400","360","140","150","110"]},"The Ambit server  is the focal point and central element of the private mobile data communications apparatus  according to the present invention and enables exchanges of structured messages  between a system user  and mobile users . The server  includes server components such as an application server  and a database server . The application server  includes a messaging service module . The database server  includes a managed database , through which the server  is responsible for routing message traffic between the system user  and the mobile users . All message traffic in the Ambit service passes through the server , which communicates over local and wide area networks, the Internet, wireless (wifi) networks, and mobile and wireless carrier data, SMS, and voice networks, and uses mobile push service technology on different platforms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","130","105","120","400","500","600","115","120","115","185","187","600","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["110","105","110","120"]},"The server  is configured to perform message exchange, archiving and analytics services for the private mobile data communications apparatus . The application server  includes the messaging service module , which manages structured messaging  within the Ambit service, performing messaging sending functions that include communicating structured messages  from the system client  to the mobile client , and messaging receiving functions that include communicating structured messages  from the mobile client , as well as performing event analysis in coordination with the database server . The messaging service module  communicates with the database server  in the managed database  for storing information about the messaging functions, such as events, event rules, and messaging forms. The messaging service module  is therefore a focal point between the system event push service  and the mobile push messaging service .","Messaging systems are typically designed to convey an information payload from one user to another, such as, in general, from a sender to a receiver. For many uses the meta-information, often called metadata, [i.e. the information about the message] is of relatively little interest or use.","In the case of critical messaging applications, however, this metadata can be as important, or even more important, than the information in the message payload itself. The Ambit system has been defined with a very rich set of metadata and a protocol for that metadata called the Ambit Intelligent Message Structure, or AIMS, which enhances the ability to manage and analyze message traffic to accomplish functions such as assessing the status of a mobile workforce, validating the successful distribution of critical messages to a distributed population, maintaining the message thread for support requests from mobile workers and performing after-action or forensic analyses of event response activities.","The AIMS protocol is defined in Applications Programming Interface (API) specifications for both the mobile application component used by the mobile client  of the Ambit service and its system clients .","Typical examples of message metadata are globally-unique IDs of the message and the mobile devices, message type, times associated with message handling by various components of the mobile network infrastructure, status of the mobile device as reported to the mobile service carrier, geo-location of the mobile device (if permitted by the system protocol]), the ID of related or associated message(s), group associations of the mobile user, and application-unique metadata that can be utilized to achieve specific Ambit system capabilities required by individual users.","The AIMS protocol is designed to enhance the ability to manage all Ambit messages as a set of database objects that can be stored, queried and managed efficiently for analysis and reporting.","The server  architecture is adaptable and distributable, as is the Ambit service itself, to enable hosting of the private mobile data communications apparatus  in many different ways, including in a cloud computing environment, by an Internet service provider (ISP), or by an organization  itself. The choice of hosting option is influenced by the size and messaging needs of the organization. For example, smaller organizations  will likely choose a more hardware-intense hosting solution while larger ones could opt for any approach that suits their needs. Regardless, the present invention contemplates that functional and operational capabilities of the server  are not driven by the customer's choice of host, so that the system is scalable and practical to organizations  of all sizes.","The server  is designed to be highly stable and implementable as both dedicated to single systems and shared among different systems. The present invention contemplates that updates of the server's  software are synchronized so as to be independent of server  configuration for effective support. The capabilities of the server  are enhanced continuously to provide additional value-added services to mobile users , often as requested when customizing the system. Therefore it is to be understood that the server , and the Ambit service itself, regardless of network configuration, is highly customizable and configurable based on customer needs.","The highly customizable and configurable nature of the present invention means that the Ambit service may be utilized in many different organizational applications. Ambit's core messaging capabilities can be therefore used in many different organizational scenarios to communicate critical information to, from and between mobile users. For example, Ambit's Support\/Priority Messaging capability may be implemented in an application to request building access to provide another layer of security via the use of structured messages and communication with external systems with System Push. Another application is a security system that broadcasts a structured message to mobile users when an exception occurs (such as a forced entry to a building or a building's temperature threshold being exceeded) and allows users to quickly assess responses to provide real-world feedback to the situation.","The server  manages structured message  exchanges between a small number of organizational or system users  and a large number of mobile users  that have mobile devices  assigned to them, which have applications  either separate from or as part of the mobile device's  operating system. Several different types of structured messages  within the AIMS protocol define the behavior of the mobile devices  and the mobile applications  hereon. Structured messages  sent from organizational or system users  are delivered to individual mobile users  or pre-defined groups of mobile users . Structured messages  sent from the mobile users  are delivered to the organizational users .","The server  of the present invention is a messaging server that performs at least the following messaging functions: 1) pass all structured messages  addressed to mobile users  to the messaging service module  that distributes these messages  to the mobile users , and 2) pass all structured messages  addressed to system users  and archive these messages  if the organization's system client  is not available.","Other, specific server functions are integrated with mobile push messaging services , either provided as part of the Ambit service directly, or by third parties. In one embodiment of the present invention, such a mobile push messaging service  includes a BlackBerry push server. Integration with such a mobile push messaging service  allows the secure mobile data communications apparatus  to pass all system and exception messages from the messaging service module  to the system client , include a database that characterizes all mobile users  as well as all message types and group associations among mobile users , support web-attached system clients  for sending and receiving messages, support web-attached administrators to maintain and update the database, support pre-defined distribution lists of mobile users , and log all message activity including acknowledgements  and provide the log to system users  (upon request) for audit trail information.","The server  is designed to operate as a stand-alone server with web connections to the system users  and connections to push messaging services . With regard to the Blackberry push server, the server  is connected to the BlackBerry BES and BIS-B servers via the web, and minimizes the latency of all message passing activity, supports a SQL database and a Java run-time environment, supports multiple instances of a standard web server (such as Apache), and supports message server application programming interfaces. The server  supports intermediary push services such as the BlackBerry push service API, operates generally on the Linux operating system, and includes a server control system that coordinates the server activity and supports the various integration elements.","Generally, the server  according to the present invention operates autonomously on a continual basis, and provides for non-disruptive updating of the server control system and\/or integration elements. The server  implements automatic restart and recovery, supports backup of the SQL database, logs and other important state information, and is capable of running in a virtualized server environment.","The design of the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service enables message exchange, archiving and analytics services to be implemented as single or distributed multi server solutions. Depending on the implementation of the service, several classes of users may interact directly with the Ambit server , including service manager(s) and the system administrator(s). Components of the server  which provide analytics and serve a system client  can be implemented on separate and distinct machines.","The system client  provides an organization  or system user  with the capability to administer and manage the Ambit service, to distribute structured messages  to all or selected parts of the organization, and to analyze the responses from the organization's mobile users .  is a block diagram depicting various administrative actions of the system client . An application server  includes thereon various modules, including an administration portal module  for managing one or more administration portals , which are used primarily to administer the Ambit service. The one or more administration portals  control a user administration interface  and a message administration interface . Another module is an event portal module  for managing one or more event portals , which manage critical message and response traffic via an analytics and reports module . The system client  includes significant analysis and event presentation capabilities in order to provide the organization with information in a format that is well structured for decision making and action.","In one embodiment of the present invention these portals are web portals  and  implemented in Java and the .net framework. Other frameworks are also contemplated, and therefore the present invention is not limited to any one framework for implementing a web-based portal.","The one or more administration portals  provide the system user  with the ability to add, delete and modify individual users and groups in the Ambit service. Administration portals  are also responsible for assigning rights and privileges for the service. Once the Ambit service is configured to meet the system user's  requirements, administration portal  duties are primarily adding or deleting individual users or changing user characteristics or permissions, as well as maintaining form messages (structured messages  that are available for re-use) and message policies (rules that determine how the message is delivered and displayed on the mobile device). For smaller organizations, the one or more administration portals  provide administrative functions as a service for the system user . The one or more administration portals  are designed for ease of use and utilize organizational defaults for many of the administrative characteristics of individual users or groups.","The one or more event portals  provide the system user  with operational interfaces for the secure mobile data communications apparatus . Event portals  are used for the day-to-day operation of the private mobile data communications apparatus . Organizations  use the one or more event portals  to originate messaging from either internal or external sources into the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service, to receive alert messages from individuals using mobile applications , and to generate analysis reports from the server . The one or more event portals  function as stand-alone applications or are integrated with other systems, and are accessed through both mobile and non-mobile system client applications. Event portal  activities are shared among multiple users or co-located with the server  or the system user's  security or information technology systems.","The system client  includes a database server  that has multiple components, including a user administration database , a message administration database , and an event sync database . The user administration database  is a storage component for system user  and mobile user  information, and includes modules configured for managing system permissions and system user  and mobile user  profiles. The message administration database  is a storage component for message and response types, and the event sync database  is a storage component for data regarding structured messages  and how mobile users  respond. The server  communicates with both the application server  and with the database server  as a controller that allows the organization's users to work within the private mobile data communications apparatus  and the Ambit service via the administration and event portals  and , and that allows data flowing within the private mobile data communications apparatus  to be communicated, stored, manipulated, and transformed as needed by the organization .","Regardless of the configuration embodiment, the integration techniques and network components of the present invention are used to perform the key features of the present invention. -are diagrams of different examples, or use cases, in which the private mobile data communications apparatus  facilitates structured messaging  between system users  and mobile users .","In one embodiment, the present invention enables an organizational system user  to send, monitor the success of, and confirm receipt of structured messages  to and from the one or more mobile users . Certain elements of the structured messages , such as the display and information elements, are structured to give preset choices for delivery and response. The messages  include identifiers that facilitate handling and processing which expedite analytics and organized presentation of aggregated messages . In addition to identification and classification information, the structured messages  may include a text payload that is limited only by the payload of the mobile devices  it is delivered to.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["a","d ","a","d "],"b":["5","360","190","110","150","140","180","190","110","120","154","150","120","154","152","152","5","190","105"]},"Each of these applications utilizes the following core communication activities:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":["150","120","110","220","410","190","150","420","120","220","160","420","150","140","420","150","170","420","220","180","120","150","150","152","420","152"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["b ","c ","d "],"b":["120","150","150","130","190","130","150","154","152","380","180","120","130","180","130","390","150","150","154","152","370","130","390","220","190","150","170","120","190","180"]},"The present invention therefore enables an organizational system user  to distribute structured requests  and then assess the status of the distribution and the structured responses . Mobile users  may initiate a structured message  through the one or more Ambit mobile applications  or through the mobile device  operating system, and the message is pushed to the organizational system user . The structured message  has predetermined protocols for delivery based on the recipient and the message type. The structured message  may also include GPS location and other information. In the embodiment where GPS is activated, an Ambit native application may deliver location and updates until the mobile user  has ended that message session. Other information may be provided based on phone or device functions, including voice recording, audio, video, and photography. Purposes of structured messaging  within the secure mobile data communications apparatus  include duress notification, status updates, movement monitoring, and maintenance notification. Specific applications of the structured messaging aspect of the present invention include, but are not limited to, critical messaging alerts, emergency alerts, guard tours, mustering, training exercises, security alerts, geo-located information, and dissemination of video and photos to the organization .","In one embodiment, the present invention provides organizational information distribution, with the capability to distribute information through the system client  to individuals, a group, or groups of users with registered mobile applications . All mobile users  targeted for such information distribution receive immediate notification in one or more of the following ways: changes to icons, pop-up messages in the display of the mobile device , and sounds and vibrations all to indicate messages arrived and, or has not been read. These indicators that indicate the arrival of a message are made possible by the interaction registered mobile applications  and the mobile device  when the message arrives. Key features of organizational information distribution include the use of mobile TCP\/IP data connectivity, mobile platform push technologies and applications that reside both at the organizational system user  and on the mobile device . These features enable information distribution to be communicated quickly via various levels of confirmation that the message was successfully sent, that the message arrived on the mobile user's  mobile device , and that the message was confirmed by the mobile user  through interaction with a mobile application .","In another embodiment the present invention provides a mobile user-initiated status service. Ambit provides mobile applications  to the mobile users  of organizations  from which those mobile users  are able to initiate and send messages to the organizational system user  that update their status. The service of this embodiment offers a high degree of utilization of the features, functions and capabilities of mobile devices  that enable mobile users  to communicate structured messages  to their organizations . The identity of the mobile user  is predetermined through registration, and the message initiated by the mobile user  has structured characteristics that enable the message to be routed to the appropriate system client .","Mobile user-initiated status enables the mobile user  to quickly send a message to the server  which in turn distributes to the designated system client  throughout the organization . Examples include panic button alerts or more complex aid requests with status and location information, similar to the existing OnStar\u2122 service. Organizational responses to mobile user-initiated status messages are defined by policy and workflow of the organization  and are unique to the organization . For all mobile user-initiated status messages, responses from the server  confirm receipt of the message by the server  and, when available, confirmation of receipt from the system client .","The present invention also provides organizations  with message capabilities that enable the organizational system user  to initiate a status request that delivers a structured message  in the form of a pop-up message on the mobile device  of a mobile user . With these services, described as organization-initiated status requests, the organization  originates a structured message  containing a structured response for delivery to specified registered mobile applications . The structured messages  are generally simple, intuitive and provide for easy response, but allow for the mobile user  to provide additional information.","Following delivery of an organization-initiated status request, organizations  immediately receive from the server  the status of each of the structured messages  sent to the mobile applications . The message status includes automated acknowledgment of successful delivery through networks and to the mobile application , as well as when the message is interacted with by the mobile user . The acknowledgement also includes opted-in or available auxiliary information, such as GPS location of the mobile user , when available.","In another embodiment, organization-initiated status requests are structured to allow the organization  to canvass or poll mobile user  group(s) for a variety of uses. A primary function of the organization-initiated status request is to obtain time critical feedback from the mobile user  that is required for decision making. Another function of organization-initiated status requests is to rapidly establish the status of the community of mobile users  so that the organizational system user  can plan effectively in the case of events that challenge the availability of the individuals in the organization . Responses can be analyzed or synthesized and the responses can be presented in a summarized form so that the originator of the message can make a quick but informed decision.","The system event push service  is a system interface that sends detailed information as events occur, by triggering actions configured within the server  that integrate and communicate data. Actions include, but are not limited to, calling a web service hosted by a third party, calling an external application programming interface, sending an email, pushing a message, or populating a database table. The system event push service  allows organizations  to receive event data as the event occurs and then store and process it without any further dependency on the secure mobile data communications apparatus  for that event data. Actions are triggered by the initiation of events, and event data flows through the private mobile data communications apparatus  to and from system clients  and mobile clients , and to and from external systems , regardless of whether initiated on the system client  side or the mobile client  side.","Events can be initiated by the system client  and by the mobile client . The system event push service  allows the secure mobile data communications apparatus  to relay these events in several different ways and to different types of external systems , as noted above. Examples of a system client-initiated event include a survey broadcast to mobile users . Examples of a mobile client-initiated event include registration with the secure mobile data communications apparatus , an indication of duress, a support request, or a response to a survey.","The present invention integrates with external systems  by communicating information via the event relay module in many different ways. Expanding on the above examples, the present invention can generate a custom email that is sent to any email address to be processed by an external system . The private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service can also be configured to call any application programming interface over HTTP (via a web service call or socket interface), such as where a mobile user  presses a help button and triggers an action in an external security system to alert other personnel who are using that external system . This is referred to in the diagrams as a \u201cSystem Push\u201d. The private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service can further be configured to insert records into an external database, such as where a mobile user  presses a support button and triggers an action to insert a support request into a queue in a database of an external system .","Yet another example includes sending a structured message  via a mobile push messaging service . In this case, the event relay module  triggers an action that is handled within the private mobile data communications apparatus  itself. For example, a mobile user  presses a \u201cMonitor Me\u201d button and this triggers an action to push a warning message to other mobile users  within the same organizational network.","The first application programming interface  and the second application programming interface  are system interfaces that determine how event data is communicated through the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service. These two application programming interfaces  and , otherwise known as APIs, are a system API (the first application programming interface ) and a mobile API (the second application programming interface .) The mobile API  is a communications layer that is standard across all mobile clients  and mobile users , and the system API  is communications layer that is standard across all organizational system clients  and system users . The system API  and the mobile API  are designed to operate across all system environments and mobile device platforms, without any dependency on specific tools or libraries.","The system and mobile APIs  and  are formatted as REST-based web services with all data being sent as parameters in a query string via GET or parameters within a POST. Note that all calls are made to the same API function name \u201cExecute\u201d, and that it is the parameters that determine which method is to be called. This further simplifies client integration because the main part of the API call is essentially the same. This format is employed across both system APIs  and mobile APIs . All API responses are in XML format (or JSON, CSV, etc.). Standard fields are returned with every call, in addition to information specific to the API call.","System APIs  are used by system administrators and operations staff to manage an organization's use of the secure mobile data communications apparatus  and the Ambit service generally and to communicate by sending structured messages  to the mobile users . One example of a system API is a Send-Message-To-Mobile-Phones API, used whenever the organizational system user  wants to communicate with individual or groups of mobile users . All structured messages  are delivered and displayed in structured formats that require the mobile user  to send a structured response. Structured messaging  allows for straightforward response aggregation and statistical analysis. Example uses include broadcasting a message to mobile users , polling mobile users , and sending a survey to mobile users .","A system API  of this type may have, as input data, information that determines time and date, credentials to use the API, message title, a list and count of recipient mobile devices, a format of a structured message, message text, a type response to be displayed on a mobile device , a list and count of mobile user responses, a flag to determine if additional responses are permitted, a flag to request a GPS location, and a software release version number. Several different types of output data may also be generated by this system API . A system API  of this type may have output data that includes a structured message broadcast identifier, an event identifier, the time and date that the secure mobile data communications apparatus  both received the request and completed the request, a code indicating success or failure, an identifier for a return message, a description of a result, a message to be displayed on a system level, and the organization  that the mobile user  belongs to. This input and output data may therefore also include one or more of the system identifiers that identify and track certain events and physical devices.","Input and output data may vary depending on the type of API and the intended communication. In another example of a system API , a Get-GPS-From-MobileDevice API is used whenever the secure mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service wants to obtain the geo coordinates from one or more of the mobile devices . Input data for an API of this type, in addition to the data fields, described above, may include a GPS request option field that determines whether the user will be notified regarding the request for GPS information and whether they will be prompted to confirm the GPS request.","Mobile APIs  are APIs that are called by the mobile applications  and are used consistently across all mobile platforms. One type of mobile API  is a Register-Mobile-With-Ambit-System API, used to register the mobile application  on the mobile device . When called, this API results in the generation of a MobileDevice GUID by the server  and returned in the response. The GUID is also stored on the mobile device  and used for all future API calls. Any re-registration attempts of by the same mobile device  should send the MobileDevice GUID previously stored. This type of API  is a also security feature of the present invention, as the Ambit service will reissue a registration key if the MobileDevice GUID is returned upon re-registration, because it will be unable to determine if the registration key is being shared.","Input data for this type of API  may include the date and time and indicated by the mobile device , the GUID identifier generated by the mobile device  for each and every response or mobile device-initiated message, an alternative mobile device identifier and code, a phone number for the mobile device  if it includes phone capability, a codes indicating the device platform, product, operating system version, and mobile data and\/or telephony carrier, and a product registration key. Output data from such an API  may include web service log identifiers, start and end time and date, success and return codes and descriptions, a mobile send identifier, the mobile device GUID mentioned above, an organization identifier, and display types, messages, and number of seconds the display should be shown.","Other mobile APIs  include, but are not limited to, a Update-Push-Status-For-Message-Recipient API, to be called any time the status changes for a broadcasted message, for example whenever the push status is updated, to acknowledge mobile receipt of a system message. Another mobile API  is a Send-Mobile-Response-To-System-Message API, which is a function to send data from a mobile device  by a mobile user  to the server  in response to a system message broadcast. Yet another mobile API  is a Send-Mobile-Incident-Message API, initiated by and sent from a mobile application  by a mobile user  for any duress-related message. Still another mobile API  is a Send-Mobile-Support-Message-Request API initiated by and sent from the mobile user  to request support. Note that this API  results in the request of a structured form which is to be displayed within the mobile application , the content of which may vary as determined by the Ambit message server  based on the context of the user or situation. In this mobile API , the mobile application receives the standard confirmation XML plus the information necessary to generate a popup form, just as if it had received it from a regular push message.","The system APIs  and mobile APIs  work together to provide end-to-end integration for typical organizational uses, and the following examples demonstrate steps in the process of such system API  and mobile API  integration. In the embodiment of the present invention where registration of a mobile device  is sought, for example, the Register-Mobile-With-Ambit-System mobile API  is called by a mobile device  via a mobile application  or device operating system based on a mobile user-initiated or mobile device-initiated action. The API call is made via a web service. The system client  acknowledges registration by calling a Mobile-Push-Wrapper API, which begins on the mobile client-side  by pushing a message via a platform mobile push messaging service . A log message and log registration are communicated to a push messaging database, and a send registration status message is sent to the mobile client . The mobile device  is then registered via the push service, and on the system client  side, the mobile device  is added to the server database . The mobile client  displays a registration notification on the mobile device  of success or failure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["190","100","190","430","190","440","190"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["460","190","460","190","180","190","430","440","190","450","120","130","110","180","190"]},"In another embodiment of the present invention where system messaging in the form of a survey broadcast is the form of system communication, the system API  and mobile API  integration begins on the system client  side with a message selection by a system user  via the system client . The system client  adds the message to the server's  managed database  and initiates a message push with a list of all subscriber recipients with a Mobile-Push-Wrapper API call. On the mobile client  side, this API  then pushes messages to each subscriber via the mobile push messaging service , and the message is displayed on the mobile device  to the mobile user . Since a survey response is requested, the response sent back to the mobile client  initiates two mobile APIs , one for acknowledgment of the mobile receipt of the system message, and another to send the mobile response to the system message. Each of these mobile API calls via the Ambit web service update the server's  managed database , with information about the mobile receipt and user response, respectively.","In still another embodiment of the present invention where mobile messaging in the form of a requesting support and indicating duress is the form of system communication, the system API  and mobile API  integration begins on the mobile client  side with a mobile device-initiated or mobile user-initiated message. The mobile client  initiates a mobile API  to send the mobile message, and the private mobile data communications apparatus  adds the message to the managed database  of the server  and acknowledges receipt. It then initiates a system API  to push a message to the subscriber, logs the push, and acknowledges the mobile user  via mobile push messaging services  and the mobile client , which displays the acknowledge for the mobile user  on the mobile device .","In one embodiment of the present invention, the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service identifies and tracks certain events and physical devices by assigning one or more unique identifiers. Identifiers are values assigned in several different fields for the purpose of identifying and tracking, and may be assigned so as to guarantee uniqueness across all systems and customers by having a generic format.","One such identifier is a mobile identifier. All mobile devices  must register with a unique value, and the mobile identifier may be a randomly generated guaranteed unique identifier, or GUID, which allows the format to be generic across all brands and types of mobile devices . Another identifier is an event identifier, which is a GUID generated by the either the system client  or by the mobile client  via an API and used to group multiple structured messages  and responses for any given subscriber under a single \u201cevent\u201d. The present invention contemplates that an event identifier be sent back and forth between the mobile client  and system client  for all communication relating to a specific event. If multiple structured messages  are exchanged between the system client  and mobile client  for a given event, then this identifier remains the same throughout this exchange. For example, if a mobile application  sends a duress signal followed by a series of coordinates, then each of these messages will share the same event identifier that was generated at the start of the duress session. Once the duress session has ended the corresponding event identifier will not be used again. Any new duress session will have a new unique event identifier.","A mobile send identifier is another unique identifier generated by the system client  or mobile client  via an API and therefore may also a guaranteed unique identifier. If there are multiple structured messages  being sent for the same event, then each structured message  must have a different send identifier. The mobile application  returns this identifier in any responses so that the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service can associate these with the original message, as well as any communication back to the system client  via its system API  calls. If the send identifier is a guaranteed unique identifier, the value is agnostic to the push server technology (which may have its own push identifier that can also be included when sending the message to the mobile device itself). For example, if a mobile application  sends a duress signal followed by a series of coordinates, then each of these messages will have a new send identifier, but still share the same event identifier that was generated at the start of the duress session.","Another unique identifier, the organization identifier, assigns a value to the organization  itself and therefore identifies the highest level aspect of system usage. Note that one organization  may have its own private mobile data communications apparatus , or it may co-reside on one private mobile data communications apparatus  with other organizations . Therefore all other identifiers in the system ultimately relate back to one organization identifier, and consequently to only one organization  either directly or indirectly.","It is to be understood that many other identifiers are contemplated within the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service, as described herein. For example, application programming interface calls may require, as input or output data, specific identifiers. Examples include a push identifier generated by a push server to identify a particular mobile device  that is receiving a structured message  push, to provide the Ambit service with a way to tie back to the data on the push server for debugging, an audit trail, etc. Other identifiers contemplated a structured message broadcast identifier representing one broadcast of a specific message to multiple mobile users , and a structured message recipient identifier generated for each mobile user  that is a recipient of a particular message. Still others include a web service log identifier for each and every web service call made that is used for an audit trail of events, and a web service log identifier that is a GUID for each and every web service call made, and tied to log file messages on the server .","The private mobile data communications apparatus  of the present invention contemplates that one or more mobile applications  provide an organization's mobile users  with access to the Ambit service. The server  interacts with these mobile applications  to several core communication activities, including but not limited to information distribution initiated through the system client , mobile user-initiated messaging initiated through mobile applications , and status request messaging initiated through the system client . These core communication activities provide a rich set of communication solutions for organizations , and provide a basis for the private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service to access and use many current features of mobile devices  and also connect to available features and applications of those mobile devices .","Mobile applications  are designed to work on a wide range of mobile device  platforms, and therefore the present invention is to be implemented regardless of the handset manufacturer, network provider, data carrier, or mobile operating system. These mobile applications  are designed so that they can easily be implemented with logos, color schemes and skins appropriate for organizations .","The core communication activities described above are provided with best practices in mobile security and are encrypted to ensure privacy and integrity of the service. Since the packet communication required is small in size for most communications, the private mobile data communications apparatus  provides lightweight encryption techniques as an appropriate level of protection in most cases\u2014the objective is to provide the greatest degree of resiliency in stressed communications environments. Nevertheless, the present invention is designed to implement many other types of encryption, and the invention is not limited by any particular technique.","The server  identifies the instances of the registered mobile applications  using several methods. Typically identity can be accomplished at the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identifier) level for the greatest flexibility, but alternative approaches are also contemplated. This also permits individual users to participate in multiple instantiations without conflict or interference. In the case of an individual participating in multiple instantiations, a separate mobile application  for each instance may be provided.","The mobile applications  component of the private mobile data communications apparatus  is dynamic and functional across all mobile device  platforms that are in wide use within organizations . This includes, but not limited to, the BlackberryOS, iPhoneOS, Android, Symbian and Windows Mobile 7 operating systems. The mobile applications  contemplated within the present invention take advantage of the features and information available on mobile devices  as well as the push technologies available for messaging on the many mobile device  platforms.","The present invention is designed to access other applications and features of mobile devices  such as video, sounds, camera, recording and other third party applications available to provide information over the private mobile data communications apparatus . While in most cases, the present invention maintains low-bandwidth and small message size character of the communications between the mobile applications  and the server , the use of imagery, sounds, recording and other applications and features are available. Regardless, it is within the scope of the secure mobile data communications apparatus  to utilize other features and applications, and to that end, the present invention uses compression techniques or other known methods of transmitting large files.","The private mobile data communications apparatus  of the Ambit service, as described above, is in one embodiment implemented in a network configuration that connects a system client  with mobile users  via the server . Depending on the needs of the customer, each of the various components may be split across multiple servers for distributed processing to ensure a high-availability, high-performance system\u2014as well as consolidated onto fewer servers for smaller business with more modest requirements. It is therefore to be understood that the present invention is not limited to any one type of network configuration. The present invention may also be implemented as partially or entirely cloud-based, so that no hardware components need be resident in any system-side or central location.","It is to be understood that other embodiments will be utilized and structural and functional changes will be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The foregoing descriptions of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Accordingly, many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings.
