{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates, in general, to an exercise device and a method of using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an exercise device and method wherein the exerciser exerts muscle force against an adjustable portion of the exerciser's own body weight, and other methods described herein.","Home exercise is becoming increasingly more popular. Home exercise offers the health benefits of regular exercise while recognizing that many people have difficulty in finding sufficient time in their schedule for a full workout at a health club or gymnasium. An exerciser may exercise at home whenever the exerciser's schedule permits. This flexibility in scheduling often allows for a more consistent and thus healthful exercise regime.","Home exercise, however, has its drawbacks. In particular, in order to exercise all or most of the muscle groups, multiple pieces of home exercise equipment may be required. Furthermore, these multiple pieces of equipment may require permanent installation in the exerciser's home.","Permanent or not, many popular pieces of home exercise equipment occupy a great deal of space. This makes the use of this equipment impractical in homes or apartments which do not have the required extra space. Furthermore, non-permanent pieces of equipment are often difficult to disassemble and may require much storage space even when disassembled. A user must then often choose between an exercise device providing a complete exercise regime and a device which fits the exerciser's home space.","There is, thus, a need for exercise equipment which may be easily stored when not in use, does not occupy a great deal of space when in use and provides for exercising all or most of the muscle groups.","Exercise devices are known in which a user, positioned on a support platform, propels that support platform up an inclined ramp. One way by which the platform may be propelled is by pulling a cable connected to the support platform through a variety of pulleys positioned on the exercise device. By changing positions on the platform and by changing the method by which the platform is propelled, a user can exercise multiple muscle groups.","While early versions of these devices did not allow for easy storage, later designs were proposed that allowed for some type of disassembly in the design. Even the later designs do not, however, provide complete foldability of the exercise unit. The designs include some separate elements which must be disengaged to allow for foldability of the device. Thus, these designs cannot be folded and stored as a unit. Moreover, the designs are not easily converted from the folded stored state to an unfolded state for use.","Another problem with early versions of these devices is that they did not allow for a wide variety of different types of muscle exercises, especially multiple muscle exercises for each specific muscle group.","In view of the foregoing, there is a need for an inclined ramp exercise device which is easily foldable to a size which allows for easy storage, is easily unfolded into a useable state, and which allows for exercising multiple muscle groups and multiple exercises for each muscle group.","There is also a need for multiple exercises, sequences of exercises, instruction, and education related to an inclined ramp exercise device.","In the inclined ramp exercise device, a user can make the workout more difficult by increasing the angle and height of the inclined ramp on which the platform is propelled. In the past, this was manually performed by the user by lifting one end of an inclined ramp and setting the inclined ramp at a desired height and angle of inclination for the desired level of difficulty. A user may have to lift and reset the inclined ramp multiple times, depending on which exercises the user is performing and the desired resistance level. This can be tiring and cumbersome.","Thus, a need also exist for an inclined ramp exercise device and a method where the exercise device includes an automatic lift mechanism for automatically setting the height and angle of the inclined ramp.","Alternatively, in circumstances where a consumer can not justify the additional cost of an automatic lift mechanism (e.g., such as, but not limited to home gym use), a need exists for a lift-assist mechanism to assist the user in lifting the inclined ramp and setting the inclined ramp at a desired height and angle of inclination for the desired level of difficulty.","Accordingly, an aspect of the invention involves a method of using a collapsible exercise device. The method includes providing a collapsible exercise device including a vertical support member, an adjustable incline having a first end and a second end, the first end of the adjustable incline pivotally coupled to, adjustably supported by, and vertically movable with respect to, the vertical support member for adjusting the incline of the adjustable incline, a user support platform movably attached to the adjustable incline, first and second combination pulley-support and pull-up bars each pivotally connected to the first end of the adjustable incline for movement between at least a substantially vertical position and a substantially non-vertical position, first and second pulleys movably connected to the first and second combination pulley-support and pull-up bars for movement of the pulleys to a desired location, and one or more cables extendable through first and second pulleys and connected to the user support platform for movement of the support platform along the adjustable incline through cable movement, wherein the exercise device is foldable such that the vertical support member and the adjustable incline are substantially parallel to each other when collapsed; positioning the first end of the adjustable incline at a desired height with respect to the vertical support member so that the adjustable incline is at a desired inclination; moving the first and second combination pulley-support and pull-up bars to a desired position; moving the first and second pulleys connected to the first and second combination pulley-support and pull-up bars to a desired location; and moving the support platform along the adjustable incline through cable movement through the first and second pulleys on the combination pulley-support and pull-up bars.","Further implementations of the aspect of the invention described immediately above include one or more of the following.

The slide bars  at the proximal ends  of the upper rails  are lowered to the bottom of the tower level tracks  of the vertical support tower , and the squat stand  is folded over onto the user support platform . The rail pivot points  and the upper pivot bar  are then drawn up away from the floor while rollers on the cross member  roll along the floor. The exercise device  continues to be folded until the vertical support tower , the strut , the upper rails , the lower rails , the user support platform , the squat stand , and the combination pulley-support and pull-up bars  are substantially parallel as shown in . It should be noted that in this position, the user support platform  may be rolled up the lower rails  and off of the collapsed exercise device . To unfold the exercise device , the rollers on the cross member  at distal ends  of the lower rails  are rolled along the floor away from the vertical support tower . Once the upper rails  and the lower rails  are extended along the floor , the slide bars  at the proximal ends  of the upper rails  are raised via the proximal ends  of the upper rails  just above a desired height and lowered into tower level hooks  at the desired height. The squat stand  may then be folded to the position shown in .","In use, the exerciser positions himself or herself on the user support platform  and grasps one or both of the handles .

The adjustment of this angle \u03b8 alters the percentage of the exerciser's weight which the exerciser's muscles are moving. This allows for adjustment of the intensity of the exerciser's workout. Weight bars (not shown) may be added to the user support platform  so that weight plates (not shown) may be positioned on the weight bars, thus adding to the weight propelled by the exerciser's muscles.","The exerciser may vary the position of the pulleys  on the combination pulley-support and pull-up bars  in the manner described above. For example, the pulleys  may be raised or lowered on the inner tubular sections  so that the handles  and pulling motion are at a more comfortable orientation or to work different muscle groups. The pulleys  may be moved to the outer tubular sections  (or other sections) for a wider grip and motion of the handles  or to work different muscle groups.","An exerciser may also vary the resistance while working upper body muscles by positioning him or herself on the user support platform  with the exerciser's feet on the squat stand  or floor. The legs and lower body then provide assistance in moving the user support platform , lessening the load on the upper body muscles. The exerciser may also use the squat stand  to perform the squat exercise for the lower body muscles.","In an alternate embodiment, an exerciser may lie on the user support platform  with the exerciser's feet positioned in the foot platform  as described above. By bending the exerciser's legs, the exerciser draws the user support platform  up along the rails , . The exercise may also perform sit ups on the user support platform  by securing his or her legs in the foot platform . In this embodiment, the squat stand  and folding platform  may be replaced with the padded foot support accessory  to support the feet.","In a further embodiment, the squat stand  and folding platform  may be replaced with the push-up bar accessory . The exerciser performs push ups using the push-up bar accessory  with his or her feet on the floor, and the chest over the distal part of the lower rails . The exerciser may also lie on the user support platform  and use the push-up bar accessory  to perform a military press or similar exercise.","In another embodiment, the exerciser may lie on the user support platform , grip the handles  of the dip bar accessory  (, B), and perform dips, exercising the arms and chest.","Furthermore, an exerciser may lower the combination pulley-support and pull-up bars  to the position shown in , B as described above, position himself or herself on the user support platform , and grasp the handles . By drawing the exerciser toward the handles , the exerciser is exercising additional muscle groups.","With reference to , an alternative embodiment of an exercise device  will now be described. The exercise device  is similar to the exercise devices shown and described above with respect to , except the exercise device  includes an automatic lift mechanism  () to set the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform . This eliminates the need for a user to manually set the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform  by lifting or lowering the rails ,  and user support platform , sliding the inwardly extending slide bars  up or down in the tower level tracks , and setting the bars  in corresponding tower level hooks  as described above with respect to .","The exercise device  includes a tower  with a tower housing  extending from an intermediate base section  of a base . The tower housing  includes a front vertical face , a rear vertical face , and opposite symmetric sides . The sides  include elongated vertical tracks . Slide bars  extend inwardly from proximal ends  of the upper rails . The inwardly extending slide bars  are coupled to chains  () of the automatic lift mechanism  through couplers .","With reference to , an inner frame assembly  of the tower  is shown. The inner frame assembly  includes the sides  extending from the base  and a horizontal cross support  spanning the distance between the sides  at a top of the frame assembly . Near a bottom of the frame assembly, between the sides , a driving mechanism  (e.g. motor with attached power cord) of the automatic lift mechanism  is disposed.","With reference to , the automatic lift mechanism  of the exercise device  will be described in more detail. The automatic lift mechanism  includes the opposite chains , an upper pulley assembly , and the driving mechanism , which includes lower pulleys  and shafts . The upper pulley assembly  includes opposite pulleys  and shaft . In use, after the driving mechanism  is plugged into a wall outlet, the automatic lift mechanism  is actuated to raise or lower the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform . This may be accomplished with a three-way toggle switch that may be set to an up or raise position for causing the driving mechanism  to rotate in one direction to increase the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform , may be set to an down or lower position for causing the driving mechanism  to rotate in an opposite direction to decrease the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform , and may be set to a third neutral position where the driving mechanism  is off and the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform  is locked in place. Varying the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform  varies the portion of the exerciser's own body weight that the user exerts muscle force against during use of the exercise device . The automatic lift mechanism  eliminates the need for a user to manually set the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform  by lifting or lowering the rails ,  and user support platform , sliding the inwardly extending slide bars  up or down in the tower level tracks , and setting the bars  in corresponding tower level hooks  as described above with respect to .","With reference to , an alternative embodiment of an exercise device  will now be described. Elements of the exercise device  that are similar to the elements described above with respect to exercise devices ,  will be described with like reference numbers. The exercise device  is similar to the exercise devices shown and described above with respect to , except the exercise device  includes a non-motorized lift-assist mechanism  to assist the user in setting the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform . This assists the user and reduces the work required to manually set the height and angle of the rails ,  and user support platform  when lifting or lowering the rails ,  and user support platform , sliding the inwardly extending slide bars  up or down in the tower level tracks , and setting the bars  in corresponding tower level hooks  as described above with respect to .","Similar to the exercise device , the exercise device  includes a strut  that is pivotally connected to the base  at one end and is pivotally connected to the rail pivot points  at an opposite end. The strut  includes an upper half  and a lower half . At approximately a mid-point of the upper half , a bottom end of the non-motorized lift-assist mechanism  is pivotally attached to the strut  at pivot point . An opposite end of the non-motorized lift-assist mechanism  is pivotally attached to approximate mid-points of the upper rails  though a pivot bar  similar to pivot bar  () discussed above. In the embodiment shown, the non-motorized lift-assist mechanism  is a push-type gas spring. In alternative embodiments, other types of non-motorized lift-assist mechanisms are used such as, but not by way of limitation, standard coil springs (extension and\/or compression as needed).

Introduction","GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae is a safe and effective program designed to focus on movement dysfunction of the shoulder, lumbar spine and knee. The program provides a series of exercise progressions that allow for a sequential approach to post-rehabilitation. Importantly, the focus is on training of the muscles surrounding the joint rather than the treatment of a specific joint pathology. This approach to post-rehabilitation is possible if you consider that each joint complex, due to its skeletal and muscular system, is designed to move and function in a specific manner. Therefore, it is possible to progress through a series of specific exercises (in a pain-free environment) that will strengthen the stability and function of the joint complex. To minimize any damage to the muscular skeletal system, pain-free is the key consideration during the progressional exercise sequencing. However, it should be observed that significant limitations in range of motion and strength of a movement, as well as pain, may be clear indications that the client should seek advice from a rehab professional.","GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae is designed to fit within a personal fitness trainer's scope of practice by focusing on the training and conditioning of the function of the joint complex rather than treating a specific diagnosis, which should only be performed by a physical therapist or physician. Guidelines are given to assist the personal fitness trainer in determining when a client's joint ailment is beyond the scope of the program, requiring referral to a medical professional. In addition to the individual conditioning of the involved joint complex, GRAVITYPost-rehab includes a total body conditioning program to help integrate the overall fitness objectives of the client.","The GRAVITYPost-rehab program can be divided into three stages: awareness, pre-positioning and dynamic. The first stage of the program, \u2018awareness\u2019, involves the client focusing on improving proprioception and coordination of the joint complex and the surrounding local muscle system. This is followed by the \u2018pre-positioning\u2019 stage, which begins to improve the function of the joint complex by initiating specific, controlled movement patterns. Finally, the \u2018dynamic\u2019 stage progresses the client into loaded functional tasks designed to increase the strength and functionality of the joint complex and its relationship to multi-joint movements. All three stages work together progressively to achieve the GRAVITYPost-rehab objective: to improve the movement of a joint complex and incorporate it into functional movement patterns while ensuring conditioning of the total body.","GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae was developed by a team of physical therapists, exercise physiologists and personal fitness trainers to ensure that the methodology and exercises are pertinent, safe and effective.","GRAVITYPost-rehab objective: to improve the movement of a joint complex and incorporate it into functional movement patterns while ensuring conditioning of the total body.","B. GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae in the Health Club Industry","Following a physical injury or surgery, physical therapy is one of the first steps to returning to an active lifestyle. Often the limited number of sessions provided for by the healthcare system can prevent an individual from achieving his or her complete rehabilitation objectives. Therefore, patients may have a greater responsibility in managing their continued rehabilitation following physical therapy. Generally, that person will either do very little and never achieve full potential for joint strength and movement, or return to activity prematurely and unsupervised, risking re-injury.","Below is a representation of a sequence that a moderately active individual may experience in the occurrence of an injury.","In this example, a premature return to an active lifestyle can produce a compound injury or reoccurrence of the original injury, leading back to the cyclic process of care and treatment. However, the opportunity for training an existing movement dysfunction in a joint complex, within a controlled environment, may be the answer for a long-term active lifestyle. With any activity there is a risk of re-injury, but when appropriate training of the injured joint complex occurs, the risk of re-injury is minimized.","In recent years the health club industry has identified the business opportunity that exists in the client demographic that experiences some form of movement dysfunction. The challenge for the clubs, however, is in accessing quality education on post-rehab guidelines for personal fitness trainers, marketing to the targeted population, and acquiring appropriate equipment for a post-rehab program.","The GRAVITY SYSTEM pairs post-rehab guidelines and exercises approved and accredited by leading physical therapists with one of the most effective pieces of post-rehabilitative equipment in the industry. GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae provides the necessary information and training to apply a specific exercise sequence for the three most common joint complexes that experience movement dysfunctions: the lumbar spine, shoulder and knee.","C. Client Demographics","GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae provides the personal fitness trainer an opportunity to market him or herself to a new client demographic. Among GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae clients, movement dysfunctions may be caused by a number of different reasons. A comprehensive health and lifestyle history questionnaire will clarify the client's background and assist in future programming. Some of the types of Post-rehab clients a trainer can anticipate working with are listed below:\n\n","Although the clients will have a variety of backgrounds and causes for their movement dysfunctions, the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program addresses the common experience of joint pain and\/or movement dysfunction through the training not treatment approach. The exercises will be consistent within the program outlined for each joint complex (shoulder, lumbar spine or knee), and each stage (awareness, pre-positioning or dynamic). Throughout the GRAVITYPost-rehab program the client's health history and personal objectives will continue to play a role in determining the next programming goals.","D. The Post-Rehab Network","In order to maximize the client's outcomes, it is ideal for the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u2122 trainer and the client's physical therapist to work together. While this may not always be possible, it is recommended that the trainer communicate with the therapist to report on the client's status and progress. This will help ensure that the GRAVITYPost-rehab program avoids any contraindications for the client, based on the physical therapist's prior assessments and treatments. In the event that a contraindication occurs, the trainer will have an open line of communication to refer the client back to the therapist, if needed.","For a successful line of communication and working relationship between the physical therapist and the trainer, it is imperative that the physical therapist clearly understands the training not treatment approach of the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program. It is the trainer's responsibility to explain this approach to the therapist and be able to describe how it builds upon the foundation established by the physical therapist.","The GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program was developed by a team of physical therapists, exercise physiologists and personal fitness trainers. It is a sound, safe and effective program. However, trainers should be aware that the physical therapy industry has numerous approaches to treatment and an individual therapist's philosophy will play an integral role in the post-rehab program. In the event that the physical therapist has feedback for program modifications, the personal fitness trainer should follow those suggested guidelines. Both the physical therapist and the personal fitness trainer play integral roles in helping the client return to a functional, active lifestyle. Working together, they can ensure the client's success.","In addition to maximizing the client's outcomes, a good working relationship with the physical therapist provides the opportunity for a two-way referral system between therapist and trainer. By referring clients in need of a physical therapist, the trainer further strengthens his or her professional relationship with the therapist, and the therapist can directly assist the trainer in building his or her business. In some cases a physical therapist may use a personal fitness trainer to assist in other on-site conditioning programs, within the physical therapy clinic.","Principles of GRAVITYPost-Rehab","A. Position Statement","The GRAVITYPost-rehab program was designed for the training of a joint complex that has a movement dysfunction, not on identifying a treatment strategy for a specific pathology. By doing so, the program assists in not only improving functionality of a joint complex, but also falls within the scope of practice of a personal fitness trainer. Careful consideration is given to identifying any contraindications that will direct the personal fitness trainer to cease the program and ask the client to seek medical advice.","Each joint complex is made up of a series of structures including muscles, bones, ligaments, tendons, etc., which are designed to function in a precise manner and through specific movement patterns. Each movement pattern is rarely isolated to a single joint complex and its surrounding tissues, but rather incorporates the involvement of other joints and their structures. When an injury occurs, a part of the joint complex's structure is affected, causing a movement dysfunction. A movement dysfunction can be defined as a pathological change of a joint complex's range of motion and strength, possibly with areas of pain. The medical community, including physical therapists, are the first to diagnose and treat a movement dysfunction.","Following treatment with a physical therapist, continued care may be required to maximize the function of the joint complex and its utilization within the network of structures that are required for movement. GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae continues this care through identifying the movement dysfunction and utilizing a progressional sequence of exercises that are safe and performed pain-free. The focus is on training of the structures of the joint complex rather than the treatment of a specific joint pathology.","Training of a movement dysfunction rather than pathology (specific injury) is effective when you consider that numerous pathologies will produce the same movement dysfunction. Therefore, it minimizes the need to know the specific pathology and allows the trainer to focus on restoring the normal loading capacity of the joint complex. This principle is also used in acute rehabilitation with careful attention given to loading and the ability of the structure to cope with this loading. The initial step in all rehabilitation programs is to reduce the loading to achieve a level in which the structure can cope, and then progressively increase the load so that the structure can adapt without further injury. If pain occurs it is always important to reduce the loading or range of motion.","GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae utilizes the above guidelines in its training program by ensuring that all exercises are performed pain-free, and strict exercise sequencing and loading guidelines are followed. At all times high quality and control of movement patterns are enforced through careful observation by the personal fitness trainer. With its sequential exercises, each program requires the joint complex to move through an array of movements without producing compensation movements.","In addition to focusing on the specific joint, the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program utilizes total body conditioning exercises to train a client's complete muscular system. These are performed in conjunction with the three-stage training exercises of the specific joint complex.","B. Local and Global Stability","The muscles and tendons that surround and maintain the structure and function of a joint are the key to its stability. Joint stability is comprised of the local and global muscle systems.","Local Muscle System","Providing support and control at a specific, individual joint, these muscles are primarily responsible for joint stabilization rather than joint movement and are usually deep and located close to the joint . Their anatomical positioning is often monoarticular (crossing one joint only) and is designed to increase joint stiffness and, hence, extrinsic mechanical stability. For example, biomechanically the transverse abdominis cannot contribute to extension, flexion or lateral flexion, but rather plays an important role in intersegmental stabilization by increasing stiffness of the spine. This is achieved by having a low contractile tone that is initiated prior to and maintained throughout the movement, regardless the direction of movement.","Global Muscle System","Providing movement at a specific joint or region, these muscles are primarily responsible for movement of the joint and for balancing the external load that is being applied. They are generally multi-joint muscles (capable of moving and supporting several joints), and are designed for complex movement function . Their long, usual fusiform shape and often remote location to the joint provide for greater biomechanical opportunities to produce movement. Two examples are the rectus abdominis, which provides movement of the spinal complex, and the pectoralis major, which is a prime mover for the shoulder.","Understanding the characteristics of the local and global muscle systems allows us to more clearly define how stability is achieved from a local and global perspective.","Local Stability","Local stability provides support and control at a specific joint. For example, it maintains the position of each vertebra against each other and increases the \u201cstiffness\u201d of the spinal column. Stiffness between two skeletal structures is the key to its stability, and is produced by the low contractile tone provided by the local muscle system. This \u201ctone\u201d provides intersegmental stabilization, functions as the foundation to all movements, and is essential for skeletal posture. Fortunately, this stiffness or tone can occur with even a minimal amount of contraction. Only 25% of maximum voluntary contraction will result in 80% of possible total stiffness. This is important to appreciate that in everyday movements, a minimal activation of the local muscles will achieve significant local stability.","Global Stability","Global stability incorporates a person's ability to move while being aware of his or her center of gravity in relation to the base of support and the existence of all external forces. One's ability to counteract these external forces, including gravity, while moving with control, is the key to global stability.","When a normal, healthy individual performs a functional movement there will be a contraction of the local muscle system prior the global ones. This sequence is important to ensure that the individual joint segments are stabilized first, therefore minimizing any additional joint movements beyond neutral. Each joint has a \u201cneutral\u201d range within which the joint can move without any structural consequences. A painful presentation may occur when this sequence of muscular contraction is reversed. For example, if at the initiation of a movement the global stabilizers contract prior to the local stabilizers, and this sequence occurs repeatedly over a period of time, it will produce excessive movement at the joint, which will result in greater friction and wear and tear at the joint site, producing pain. When this occurs the client requires therapeutic exercises, which focus on training the local muscle systems, in order to change the altered innervation pattern. Once this is achieved, focus can then be placed on training of the global muscle system, which occurs during a post-rehabilitation program. It is important to understand that by training the global muscle system, local stability may not be improved.","How to Recognize Possible Lack of Local Muscle Control","It is important for a personal fitness trainer to know when to refer a client back to a medical professional. The following criteria will assist in the identification of poor local muscle control.\n\n","Core stabilization has always been recognized as essential in functional movements. All skeletal muscles of the trunk and pelvic region are in some way responsible for the stabilization of the lower spine. To assist in understanding core stabilization and control, it is important to identify how spinal stability is possible.","Core Stability Defined","A simple definition of core stability is the ability to control the positioning of the spine while performing movement in the extremities (i.e. proximal stability with distal mobility). Controlling the spine involves the ability to control the shoulder girdle and pelvis, due to their anatomical relationship with the spine. Core stability, through control of the spine, is the result of properly recruiting both the local and global muscle systems. Hodges and Richardson discuss how the lumbar spine area is inherently unstable. In other words, the lumbar spine relies on the active support of its surrounding musculature. This active support comes from four mechanisms: tension from the thoracolumbar fascia, the intra-abdominal pressure mechanism, the role of the paraspinal muscles and the role of deep lumbar extensors.","The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) enhances posterior static and dynamic stability through its structural and muscular attachments. There are three layers of the fascia, each layer connecting muscles, and all layers feeding into the fascia of the spinal column. Increasing tension in the transversus abdominis (TVA), the internal obliques, and the rectus abdominis increases tension on the TLF. The increase in tension creates greater support for the spine and assists in equalizing pressures and forces on the spine. In addition, the increased tension of the TLF compresses the erector spinae and multifidus muscles, encouraging these to contract and resist spine flexion forces.","The lateral fibers of the TLF's middle layers blend with the fibers of the internal obliques and the TVA. Contraction of these muscles creates an increase in intra-abdominal pressures, which in turn increases the tension against the TLF. This mechanism is an important stabilizer during flexion and\/or lifting activities.","The paraspinal muscles (interspinalas and intertransversarii) provide an individual stabilizing effect on their adjacent vertebrae, acting in a similar way to ligaments. The deep lumbar muscle, the multifidus, has been shown to be active throughout a full range of motion of the lumbar spine and during movements of the lower and upper limbs. The paraspinals and deep lumbar muscles appear to work together to create stabilization for the lumbar spine against rotational and extension forces.","From the information above, it is clear that active support of the spine comes from the deep muscles of the trunk and spine. However, core stabilization is not only a result of which muscles are recruited, but also the sequencing and timing of their recruitment. Hodges and Richardson showed that the co-contraction of the transverse abdominis and multifidus muscles occurred prior to any movement of the limbs, and that the timing of coordination of these muscles was very significant. Of particular relevance to the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program, they also showed that back injury patients were unable to recruit their TVA and multifidus muscles early enough to stabilize the spine prior to movement. Hides, et al. also found that the multifidus muscle showed poor recruitment in back injury patients. It will be critical in the GRAVITYPost-rehab program to be aware of difficulties the back injury client may have related to core stabilization. If they have any problems\/pain during participation in the program, do not proceed with general core stability exercises but refer to a physical therapist.","Hodges & Richardson, 1996, demonstrated that back pain occurred when the contraction of the transverse abdominis contracted 40-120 m.sec. following deltoideus anterior activation.","The Functional Result of Core Stability","Core stabilization allows an individual to perform a movement while maintaining good postural alignment, particularly in the lumbar-pelvic region. Without this core stability and the resulting neutral posture, the participant's movement technique may be compromised. Aside from an increased risk of injury, the movement will not be as effective or efficient as needed for the desired results. This is of particular concern in the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae environment, where a client's ability to improve his or her muscle function is directly related to performing the movements correctly.","Cycle of Injury as it Relates to Core Stability","Without stability at the body's core, other muscular imbalances can occur. If core stability is not addressed before attempting to rectify the additional muscular imbalances, they will persist, which often leads to an increased risk of repeated injury or overload. Addressing core stability in the GRAVITYPost-Rehab\u00ae environment is essential for client outcomes and the prevention of future problems.","D. Neutral Pelvis and Lumbar Spine Positioning","The definition of \u201cneutral position of spine\u201d falls under different definitions, according to different people. For instance, one source may state that neutral spine is the midpoint between anterior pelvic tilt and posterior pelvic tilt. In this position the lumbar spine is considered to have a natural lordotic curvature and the sacral spine will maintain its natural kyphotic curvature (between flexion and extension). Others may state that neutral spine is the position in which the participant is pain-free. In GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae, the goal is to obtain and maintain a natural lordotic curve, however pain-free is the first objective and one should never move while experiencing pain.","Throughout all exercises it is important for the participant to be aware of and maintain a neutral and\/or pain-free lumbar spine. To find the appropriate lumbar spine positioning, GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae provides exercises that focus on tilting of the pelvic girdle in a supine position. The personal fitness trainer can assist in the participant's awareness of pelvic tilting by explaining that as the lumbar spine flattens out (flexion), the pelvis will tilt posteriorly, and alternatively, by increasing the lumbar curvature (extension), the pelvis will tilt anteriorly. Continuous cueing to maintain lumbar and pelvic position is important throughout all exercises.","Neutral positioning of the whole spinal complex is essential for successful core stability and exercise outcomes. The normal curvatures of the spine consist of anterior in the cervical section, posterior in the thoracic and anterior in the lumbar region.","Again a neutral spine can be defined as the place where the participant is pain-free. Note that the convexity of the curves can vary slightly from individual to individual, so it is important to recognize a genetically inherited curvature vs. poor posture and instability of the spine.","E. 3 Stage Approach to Training a Movement Dysfunction","GRAVITYPost-rehab is based on principles that are incorporated in rehabilitation within the physical therapy industry. These principles progress from formal motor skill training leading to gradual incorporation of skills into light functional tasks and progress to loaded functional tasks. Based on these principles, GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae approaches the training of a movement dysfunction in 3 stages:","Awareness","To improve joint stability and restore full functional range of motion, it is essential that the client develops a correct perception of isolated muscle action and joint position. To do so, specific exercises are designed to enhance and develop a person's awareness of the joint complex. The awareness stage focuses on improving proprioception and coordination of the joint and surrounding global muscle system. Be aware of fatigue due to intensity; focus is on proprioception and coordination (quality of movement).","Pre-Positioning","Following the achievement of joint complex awareness the next step is to progressively improve the function of the joint. To do so, specific exercises are designed to actively and passively position one section of a joint complex, preventing it from movement, while actively moving another. This occurs by isometrically contracting local muscle systems of a specific region while initiating functional movement with different levels of loading. The focus is on the quality and control of movement and the loading should be modified to achieve this.","Dynamic","The third stage is to allow the joint to progress into loaded functional tasks. These active movements of the joint complex through a pain-free range of motion focus on strength, endurance and appropriate range of motion. This final stage builds upon the cognitive control of the stabilizing muscle systems as well as the application of long-term functional behaviors. During this stage a greater focus can be given to intensity, however the quality and control of movement should never be compromised.","F. Total Body Conditioning","Each joint complex is a vital member of a complete skeletal structure. In order to maximize the effectiveness and function of a joint complex, it is important to consider that the body rarely functions in isolation and that most movements utilize an array of muscles and joints. Training the total body is essential in helping to strengthen and stabilize the other major joint complexes and prevent future compensatory movement patterns. Within the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program, exercises focusing on the other major joint complexes are an essential part of the training philosophy to maximize client outcomes. These additional exercises also provide the important principle of a recovery period for the targeted joint complex throughout the training. Each training session will incorporate three to four specific, targeted joint exercises intertwined with a complete set of total body conditioning exercises. The total body conditioning exercises minimize the involvement of the targeted joint while maximizing the benefits of resistance exercises on exercise device .","Total body conditioning will also assist in preventing future injuries by improving the body's overall muscle strength and joint range of motion. Following the program, the participant will have a greater awareness of his or her limitations and be able to appropriately modify movement behaviors to reduce the risk of injuries. The trainer will have the opportunity to promote the use of appropriate long-term functional movement behaviors, such as appropriate lifting and reaching techniques, to further assist the client's safe return to an active lifestyle.","G. Assessing Your Client","1. Medical Clearance","Prior to beginning a new exercise program, it is important that a complete medical clearance has been given by the client's physician. For the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae client who has been under the care of a physical therapist, it is recommended that the physical therapist also provides clearance. The trainer should have permission from the client to share program details as needed with the physical therapist and\/or physician.","2. Health and Lifestyle History","As with any personal training client, a Post-rehab\u00ae client's health and lifestyle history should be evaluated to provide a comprehensive understanding of past and present activities, medical concerns, health issues and lifestyle habits. Such information is essential for effective programming and to help prevent future health problems.","Many health clubs and trainers already use some type of standardized health history form, however it may be necessary to create an additional form to collect any information not covered in the standardized form.","3. Identifying Movement Dysfunction","Prior to beginning the GRAVITYPost-rehab program, the joint complex's limitations must be observed in order to determine the degree of movement limitation. The personal fitness trainer should determine limitations on range of motion and strength by understanding a specific joint complex's normal and acceptable range of motion and comparing it with the client's ability to move within that range. Often a comparative observation can be made to the range of motion and strength of the opposite joint when considering the knee and shoulder joint complexes.","To identify movement dysfunction, the trainer should address the following points with the client: What joint is involved? What movement is difficult? What is\/are your objective(s)? What has been your course of rehabilitation? Are you aware of any restrictions (as recommended by the physical therapist or physician)? Do you have any exercise guidelines given to you by your physical therapist or physician?","4. Initial Contraindications","Clients who experience any of the following during initial assessment or during any part of the program must be referred to their physical therapist or physician for further evaluation:\n\n","The following list outlines basic training principles that should be followed in the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program.","Warm Up and Cool Down","Ensure the client has performed an adequate warm-up prior to beginning the exercises. Emphasis should be placed on raising the core temperature of the body and preparing the muscular-skeletal system for the work to be performed. Specific focus should be given to the targeted joint complex ensuring that an initial light load is used. Begin all warm-up exercises with a low intensity. At the end of the session include a cool-down to help the body recover and return to its pre-exercise levels. Emphasis should be placed on stretching the muscles worked during the session.","Quality of Movement","The goal of GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae is to help clients regain functional range of motion and strength of a joint complex that has demonstrated a movement dysfunction. The movements required to perform the exercises listed are very specific and must be executed correctly in order to produce results. For quality control, the following should be considered:","Speed: Slow to fast\u2014Moving slowly allows more control both in the concentric and eccentric movement phases. As the client becomes more capable and proficient with a movement pattern, speed or tempo can increase.","Range of motion: To ensure a pain-free environment, progress from limited to full range of motion.","Difficulty of movement: Be aware that the more difficult the exercise, the more quickly fatigue sets in, thus making it more challenging for the client to maintain quality of movement. In the case of fatigue allow for greater rest periods and\/or reduce the load.","Signs of fatigue are: Loss of coordination, Loss of quality of movement, Decreased range of motion.","Lever: The length of the lever or distance between the resistance and the joint complex (axis) will often determine the amount of load at the joint. By reducing this distance, the torque at the joint will also be reduced, allowing for greater control and comfort.","Intensity: The higher the intensity and\/or load placed upon the joint complex, the more challenging it will be for the client to maintain quality of movement. Have the client work at a low intensity until quality of movement has been demonstrated, then progress with care.","Magnitude","When determining programming for the client, consider the following:","Load: Start with a low load while the client learns the movement pattern. Once adequate control and proper form have been established, increase the load by changing the incline level.","Repetitions: All exercises should be performed for 12-15 repetitions. For unilateral exercises, perform the exercise for 12-15 repetitions on each side.","Rest Period: To maximize the training effect, rest periods should vary depending upon the exercise intensity. With the GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae program, rest of targeted muscle groups is possible while performing the conditioning exercises. Length of rest period should be dependent on the fatigue level of the client.","Sets: It is recommended the client perform 2-4 sets of each GRAVITYPost-rehab exercise within a single training session. An exercise which proves to be difficult should be continued within a number of sessions until proficiency is achieved.","Modifications","If the client is unable to perform the movement pattern described in the exercise, modify the lever, load or position on the glideboard  to ensure success.","Progression","Within GRAVITYPost-rehab, progression is addressed in two ways: 1) within an individual exercise, the client may increase in load (incline) and 2) between exercises, having successfully completed an exercise the client will progress to the next exercise in the sequence. This progression may be within a stage (i.e. pre-positioning) or it may involve incorporating the first exercise from the next stage (i.e. dynamic). Once the criteria of proficiency are met for an exercise, the trainer could then take the exercise out of the program and replace it with the next exercise in the sequence for the following session. The trainer will continue to repeat an exercise until proficiency is achieved.","The following are indications that the proficiency in an exercise has been achieved and it is safe to progress the client and include the next exercise in the sequence:\n\n","In the event that the client completes an exercise with proficiency in a single session, he or she may progress to the next exercise in the sequence during the following session.","Breathing","The client should maintain normal breathing patterns while performing the exercises. Do not allow clients to hold their breath during any phase of the exercise.","Conditioning Outcomes","Following ACSM guidelines for specific training objectives will assist the trainer in achieving individual goals.","Symptoms","Throughout each exercise, respect must be given to client symptoms.","Pain: Regardless of the positions and actions described in the exercise templates, the client should always stay within a pain-free range of motion. In the event of pain, a decrease in the range of motion and\/or a reduction in load should eliminate this symptom. If pain persists the exercise should be avoided and medical advice sought.","Excessive heart rate and breathing: This typically indicates a load that is too high for the client and should be reduced. Clients who experience abnormal heart rate and breathing should cease exercising and seek medical advice.","Neurological: Numbness and tingling. A reassessment of positioning and movement pattern should occur, and if symptoms persist, cease the exercise and seek medical advice.","Training Contraindications","Clients who meet any of the following criteria during any part of the program must be referred to their physical therapist or physician for further evaluation:\n\n","Each GRAVITYPost-rehab\u00ae session should address both the specific exercises for the joint complex as well as the total body conditioning exercises listed for that joint. The client should progress through the stages in order (Awareness, Pre-positioning and Dynamic), and the specific joint exercises must be performed in the order listed in the manual. The conditioning exercises can be inserted throughout the session to build in rest periods for the targeted joint complex.","Scenario I","A new client continues to experience lower back pain at work. He has received physical therapy which has been successful however experiences some lingering pain. He was originally diagnosed with poor core stability and it was recommended that he focus on strengthening the thoracolumbar fascia. Below is an outline of an initial exercise session for the lumbar spine Awareness stage.","Scenario II","The client has mastered Awareness exercises # and #. Below is an outline of an exercise session, demonstrating how to progress the client into the Pre-positioning stage while continuing to complete the Awareness exercises.","Post-Rehab\u2122 Lumbar Spine Exercises","Post-Rehab\u2122 Exercises\u2014Section 1","Lumbar Spine Exercises","Awareness\n\n","Pre-Positioning\n\n","Dynamic\n\n","To improve joint stability and, correspondingly, pain-free functional movement, it is essential that the client develop a correct perception of isolated muscle action and joint position. To do so, specific exercises are designed to enhance and develop a person's awareness of the position of the joint. The Awareness stage focuses on improving proprioception and coordination of the joint and surrounding local muscle system. Be aware of fatigue due to intensity; focus is on proprioception and coordination (quality of movement), NOT strength or endurance training.","Specific Objectives","From performing the awareness exercises for the lumbar spine, the client should be able to find his or her neutral or pain-free position, which is typically the mid-range between flexion and extension.","Initially, clients should be cued to use their hands to detect lumbar position. As lumbar position awareness increases, the client should be able to perform the exercises without using the hands for detection. The trainer may monitor the individual's lumbar stability by placing his or her hand under the spine.","Special Considerations","If a client is unable to achieve and maintain a pain-free, neutral lumbar position, instruct him or her to stay in a position as close to neutral as possible, without pain. The goal should be to progress the lumbar spine to a pain-free and anatomical neutral position.","1 Pelvic Rocking","Joint Complex: Lumbar Spine; Stage: Awareness; Pulley Pin Placement: N\/A; Incline Guideline: 1; Starting Position: Upright Supine\u2014Straddle the glideboard , facing the tower.
