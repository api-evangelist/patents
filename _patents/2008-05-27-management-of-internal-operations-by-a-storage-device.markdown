title: Management of internal operations by a storage device
abstract: A method enables a storage device to autonomously (i.e., without intervention of a host device) determines whether an integral sequence of commands, which is related to one or more storage commands issued by the host device, is in a certain state (i.e., it is “active” or “inactive”) or is transitioning from “active” state to “inactive” state, or from “inactive” state to “active” state. Depending on the determined state or transition, the storage device determines whether to refrain from executing Extra-Sequence (“ESQ”) operations and permit executing Intra-Sequence (“ISQ”) operations, or vice versa.

This may detrimentally affect the performance of the storage device and the performance of the storage-host system as a whole.","The execution of some of the storage device's operations are to be avoided while an INSQ is executed (i.e., while the INSQ is \u201cactive\u201d, \u201cOn\u201d, or \u201cin progress\u201d), whereas some other storage device's operations may be beneficial or mandatory during the execution of the INSQ, as explained below. A sequence of commands that is not an INSQ is referred to herein as \u201csporadic sequence of commands\u201d. That is, by \u201csporadic sequence of commands\u201d is meant commands that are not considered by the storage device as part of a sequence of commands \u201cknown\u201d to the storage device, unlike INSQs that are known to the storage device by being defined.","A storage device in a computer system can be regarded as rendering a storage service and, therefore, the storage device is expected to provide a good quality of service (\u201cQoS\u201d) even if it performs background tasks and executes internal operations such as \u201chousekeeping\u201d operations that are required for the storage device's normal operation.","Depending on the context of service given by a computer system (e.g., playing back an audio file, capturing images, copying data file, etc.) an operation executable by the storage device as a \u201cbackground\u201d operation can belong to a first set of internal operations, which is referred to hereinafter as an Extra-sequence (\u201cESQ\u201d) operations group, or to a second set of internal operations, which is referred to hereinafter as an Intra-Sequence (\u201cISQ\u201d) operations group.","By \u201cESQ operation\u201d is meant herein a storage operation (e.g., static wear leveling) that should be avoided if an INSQ is in progress because the ESQ operation would have a detrimental effect on, or it would interfere with, or it would otherwise degrade, the performance of the storage device. For example, it would be beneficial not to execute static wear leveling operations while a music file is being played back from the storage device.","By \u201cISQ operation\u201d is meant herein a storage, or storage-related, operation that is allowed or permitted to be executed during the execution of an INSQ because it has a positive contribution on the storage device's overall operation, or at least it does not interfere with or otherwise negatively affect the execution of the INSQ. In some cases, such an ISQ operation would, if executed, significantly improve internal efficiency of the storage device itself or the efficiency of the involved storage system as a whole. Operations made in preparation for the next, or for an expected, command (e.g., caching the next data) are exemplary ISQ operations. Sometimes, ISQ operations are even desired because, as far as the Quality of Service (\u201cQoS\u201d) and the overall storage device's efficiency are concerned, they have a positive contribution.","In respect of storage devices, ESQ operations may include operations such as archiving cached data, static wear leveling, flash folding (also known in the field of flash memory devices as \u201cgarbage collection\u201d), ruggedization, and so on, which are known operations in the art of digital data storage management. ISQ operations may include: flash management operations; encryption\/decryption of outgoing\/incoming data; compression\/decompression of outgoing\/incoming data; anti-virus operation; defragmentation operation; ruggedization; backing up data; changing data format and so on, which are known operations in the art of digital data storage management. Thus, notably, whether a given operation is an ISQ or ESQ may depend on the operation (e.g., INSQ) in progress. The same operation may be an ISQ while one INSQ is occurring and an ESQ while another INSQ is occurring.","In order to improve the performance of storage devices (e.g., in terms of performance, power failure immunity, stable bit rate, etc.), execution of ESQ operations has to be coordinated with the execution of INSQ in such a way that ESQ operations are not executed while an INSQ is in progress. The reason for this is that executing ESQ operations while an INSQ is in progress can have an adverse impact on the storage device's performance, which may, for example, result in high latency, loss of data, or data corruption. ESQ operations have traditionally been initiated by host devices because of the presumption that only a host device can identify when an INSQ terminates and an ESQ operation can, therefore, safely be commenced.","In one prior art solution ESQ operations are allowed to be commenced by a storage device only after the device's host notifies the storage device that a current INSQ is terminating, or has terminated, and no new INSQ is scheduled for the time being, or for the next couple of seconds, for example. In other words, even though traditional storage devices are capable of initiating ESQ operations, they still need confirmation from their host device that they can do so. This constraint requires cooperation of the storage device's designer with the host device designer to allow the storage device's designer to schedule ESQ operations in such a way that they will not collide with an active host device's INSQ.","In another prior art solution ESQ operations are allowed to be initiated by a storage device autonomously, but they are not synchronized with the host device; i.e., ESQ operations are sometimes executed by the storage device at the wrong timing; i.e., at times when an INSQ is in progress and, therefore, should not be interfered with by ESQs.","It would therefore be beneficial for a storage device to be able to automatically identify, under the changing context of the service rendered by the involved storage system, if and when a storage background operation can be executed as originally planned or scheduled by the storage device, and if, when and which operations should be prevented, suspended or deferred until a currently executed INSQ is terminated, as well as if, when and which operations may or should be performed during INSQs execution.","The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated in conjunction with systems, tools, and methods, which are meant to be exemplary and illustrative but not limiting in scope.","According to the present disclosure a storage device autonomously detects, without intervention of a host device, if and when an INSQ is in a certain state (i.e., in \u201cactive\u201d state or in \u201cinactive\u201d state) or is changing its state from \u201cactive\u201d to \u201cinactive\u201d, or from \u201cinactive\u201d to \u201cactive\u201d. Depending on the current state of the INSQ, or on the transition thereof, the storage device avoids, suspends or refrains from executing ESQ operations or ISQ operations, or allows or permits these operations.","A method is provided for handling, by a storage device, internal operations of the storage device, the method including: (a) defining one or more INSQs of commands, each of the one or more integral sequences of commands being capable of being in an \u201cactive\u201d state and in an \u201cinactive\u201d state; (b) associating with each of the one or more integral sequences of commands a first set of internal operations (\u201cESQ\u201d) and a second set of internal operations (\u201cISQ\u201d), the first set of internal operations being operations that are not to be executed while the respective integral sequence of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, and the second set of internal operations being operations that are permitted to be executed while the respective integral sequence of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state; (c) receiving a command from a host device; (d) based on information derived from the received command, (and possibly from previously received commands) determining whether one of the one or more integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state; and (e) if the one of the one or more integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state the storage device refrains from executing any operation of the first set of internal operations associated with the respective integral sequence of commands.","If the one of the one or more integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state the storage device may permit execution of any operation of the second set of internal operations associated with the respective integral sequence of commands. If, however, the one of the one or more integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cinactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cactive\u201d state to the \u201cinactive\u201d state, the storage device permits execution of an operation of the first set of internal operations and refrains from executing any operation of the second set of internal operations associated with the respective integral sequence of commands.","The storage device may determine a transition of the one of the one or more integral sequences of commands from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state, and from the \u201cactive\u201d state to the \u201cinactive\u201d state, by determining whether the information derived from the command or commands received from the host device satisfy predefined Beginning-Of-Sequence (\u201cBOS\u201d) conditions or End-Of-Sequence (\u201cEOS\u201d) conditions, respectively. The storage device determines whether the information derived from the command(s) received from the host device satisfy the predefined BOS conditions or the EOS conditions by comparing values, or accumulated values, of dynamic parameters to predefined static parameters.","At least one of the one or more integral sequences of commands may be associated with playing back of multimedia content, or with capturing multimedia content or images, or with data synchronization, or with a boot command.","An operation of the first set, or of the second set, of internal operations may be a flash management operation; an encryption\/decryption operation for encrypting\/decrypting outgoing\/incoming data; a compression\/decompression operation for compressing\/decompressing outgoing\/incoming data; an anti-virus operation; a ruggedization operation; a defragmentation operation; a backing up operation for backing up data; and an operation involving changing data format. A flash management operation may be a garbage collection operation; an error correction operation; caching data operation for caching data into a fast flash storage area of the storage device; a flushing operation for flushing cached data; a low power mode operation; and a static wear leveling operation.","A storage device is also provided, which may be a flash memory device. The storage device may include a communication interface for receiving storage commands from a host device, and a mass storage area for holding (i) one or more predefined integral sequences, each of the one or more integral sequences of commands being capable of being in an \u201cactive\u201d state and in an \u201cinactive\u201d state and, associated with each of the one or more integral sequences of commands, (ii) a first set of internal operations (\u201cESQ\u201d) and a second set of internal operations (\u201cISQ\u201d), the first set of internal operations being operations that are not to be executed while the respective integral sequence of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, and the second set of internal operations being operations that are permitted to be executed while the respective integral sequence of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state.","The storage device also includes a controller that is adapted or configured (i) to received, via said communication interface, a command from the host device and, based on information derived from the received command, (and possibly from previously received commands) (ii) to determine whether one of the one or more integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state, or whether the one of the one or more integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cinactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cactive\u201d state to the \u201cinactive\u201d state.","Responsive to the one of the one or more integral sequences of commands being in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state, the controller refrains from executing any operation of the respective first set of internal operations. In addition to the controller refraining from executing any operation of the respective first set of internal operations the controller may permit execution of any operation of the second set of internal operations associated with the respective integral sequence of commands. If the one of the one or more integral sequences is in the \u201cinactive\u201d state, or it is transitioning from the \u201cactive\u201d state to the \u201cinactive\u201d state, the controller permits execution of any operation of the respective first set of internal operations.","The controller may determine a transition, or transitioning, of any of the one or more integral sequences from \u201cinactive\u201d state to \u201cactive\u201d state, and from \u201cactive\u201d state to \u201cinactive\u201d state, by assessing or determining whether the information derived from the command or commands received from the host device satisfy predefined BOS conditions or EOS conditions, respectively.","In addition to the exemplary aspects and embodiments described above, further aspects and embodiments will become apparent by reference to the figures and by study of the following detailed description.","It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Further, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate like, corresponding or analogous elements.","The claims below will be better understood by referring to the present detailed description of example embodiments of the invention.

If the INSQ is currently in the \u201cIntegral-sequence in progress\u201d  state and the storage device identifies an End-of-Sequence (EOS) that, as explained above, indicates that the INSQ now in the inactive state or it is transitioning from the active state to the inactive state, the storage device automatically switches  the integral-sequence's state from \u201cIntegral-sequence in progress\u201d  to \u201cIntegral-sequence not in progress\u201d .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"The following description refers to an exemplary INSQ in the INSQ table (referred to hereinafter as \u201cINSQ \u201d), but the same process is relevant to whatever FNSQ may be held in the INSQ table.

Therefore at step  the storage device suspends ESQ operations pertaining to the active \u201cINSQ \u201d, resumes, at step , ISQ operations that are related to the active INSQ , and looks for or waits, at step , until \u201cINSQ \u201d becomes inactive. The storage device determines that \u201cINSQ \u201d becomes inactive if an EOS is occurring for that INSQ, and EOS is determined as occurring if predefined criteria are satisfied.

A \u201cstatic parameter\u201d is effectively a criterion (e.g. threshold) which the storage device uses to determine if an INSQ \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d, or has changed between these two states. A \u201cdynamic parameter\u201d is effectively a value at a given point in time (e.g., upon receipt of a given command by the storage device) of a variable pertinent to an INSQ which the storage device checks against the static parameter to determine if the criterion represented by the static parameter has been satisfied. For example, if the host device is an MP3 player, the set of commands it sends to the storage device may be associated with playing a music file. A set of commands that are sent by the host device to the storage device may include one or more commands. Exemplary INSQs and related static parameters are shown in  and exemplary dynamic parameters related to the INSQs of  are shown in , both of which figures are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["40","40","40"]},"INSQ table  includes five exemplary fields for holding the following exemplary static parameters:\n\n","By way of example INSQ table  holds four exemplary Integral-sequences (INSQs) that are referred to in \u201cExample 1\u201d through \u201cExample 4\u201d, which are described below.","The first entry contains an exemplary INSQ called \u201cPlay MP3\u201d, which pertains to MP3 operations (i.e., the host device is assumed to be an MP3 music player).","An MP3 music player reads media content, which is compressed according to the MP3 data format, from a storage device and utilizes a decompression means (whether a software application or a hardware module) to convert (i.e., by decompressing) the compressed media content into raw data format that can be used (i.e., played back) by it. The MP3 player sends the raw data (i.e., the decompressed media content) to the speaker (i.e., the MP3 player \u201cplays back\u201d the media content). Because the MP3 data format requires that the MP3 file be played back at a rate that is specified by the MP3 standard, which is currently 16 kilobytes per second (KB\/sec), the MP3 player requests data from the storage device at the same data rate.","In this example the INSQ's BOS parameter is \u201cRegular average read rate that matches MP3 standard (16 KB\/s)\u201d, shown at , which means that the storage device monitors data-read requests that it receives from the MP3 player, and calculates the average rate at which the MP3 player reads the data to see whether the data-read requests are received at the specified rate (i.e., 16 KB\/s). Under normal data play back operation the storage device expects that rate to be 16 KB\/s, and as long as no data is read at that rate the storage device \u201cknows\u201d that the Play MP3 INSQ has not started yet. As explained above, it is not advisable to perform some internal operations in a storage device while the MP3 player is playing back media content. For example, performing wear leveling will severely degrade the quality of the played back audio if it is done during playback.","In the above-mentioned example the INSQ's BOS decision threshold for the \u201cRegular average read rate that matches MP3 standard (16 KB\/s)\u201d parameter may be, for example, \u201cAt least 2 seconds of regular data reading\u201d, shown at . This means that if data requests are received at the storage device at the above-mentioned rate (i.e., 16 KB\/s) and if that rate is maintained for at least 2 seconds, then the storage device assumes that a BOS is occurring or has occurred; i.e., this indicates to the storage device that the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is commencing or has commenced, or that the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is in progress. In such a case (i.e., the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is in progress), the storage device may execute ISQ operations but avoid executing ESQ operations that were predefined for the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ.","In the above-mentioned example the INSQ's EOS parameter is \u201cAverage read rate that does not match MP3 standard (16 KB\/s)\u201d, shown at , which means that the storage device can calculate the average rate at which data read requests are received from an MP3 player, to see whether it is the specified rate (i.e., 16 KB\/s). Under normal data play back operation the storage device expects that rate to be 16 KB\/s, and as long as data requests continue to be received at the storage device at that rate the storage device \u201cknows\u201d that the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is still in progress.","In the above-mentioned example the INSQ's EOS decision threshold value for the \u201cAverage read rate that does not match MP3 standard (16 KB\/s)\u201d parameter may be, for example, \u201cNot streaming at least 1 second\u201d, shown at . This means that if data requests cease to be received at the storage device at the above-mentioned rate (i.e., 16 KB\/s) for at least one second, this indicates to the storage device that an EOS is occurring or has occurred; i.e., this indicates to the storage device that the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is terminating or has terminated, or that the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is no longer in progress. The average read rate will deviate from the MP3 standard during pauses in playing an MP3 song or data, or after the entire MP3 file has been played back. In such a case (i.e., the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ is not in progress), the storage device allows executing ESQ operations that were predefined for the \u201cPlay MP3\u201d INSQ, or resuming execution thereof.","The second entry contains an exemplary INSQ called \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d, which pertains to digital camera operations (i.e., the host device is assumed to be a digital camera). For the sake of the example it is assumed that a digital camera captures four images per second (i.e., an image every 250 milliseconds), compresses each image and immediately sends one compressed image after another to the storage device for storage. Assuming that the average size of a compressed image is 2 megabytes (MB), the camera writes the image data into the storage device at a rate of 8 MB per second (MB\/sec). In order to evaluate the status of the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ the storage device monitors data-write requests that it receives from the digital camera, and calculates the average rate at which the digital camera writes the images' compressed data into its storage space in order to decide whether data is written at the expected average rate of 8 MB\/sec. If data is written at the expected average rate of 8 MB\/sec, or at a higher rate, this means that the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ has started or it is in progress. Therefore, in this example the INSQ's BOS parameter is \u201cFrequency of bursts writing at over 8 MB\/s\u201d. If the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ is in progress the storage device may execute ISQ operations but avoid executing ESQ operations that were predefined for the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ.","Digital cameras transfer images to the storage device they work with in data bursts, where each data burst represents one image. In this example the BOS threshold of the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ will be kept to a minimum of three data write bursts that arrive one after another with a maximum delay of one millisecond between each two consecutive data bursts. If three sequential data bursts are received at the storage device (each data burst at a rate of 8 MB\/sec) with a maximum delay of 1 millisecond, the storage device assumes that the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ is in progress. Accordingly, the INSQ's BOS threshold is \u201c3 bursts separated at less than 1 millisecond\u201d.","If the status of the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ is \u201cINSQ in progress\u201d, the storage device waits for an EOS indication because, as explained above, ESQ operations are allowed to be executed only after termination of the INSQ, which, in this example is the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ. In order to identify whether an EOS occurs, or has occurred, the storage device uses the INSQ's EOS threshold \u201cDelay of over 3 milliseconds between bursts\u201d. In order to identify the EOS of the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ the storage device monitors data write requests that are received from the digital camera and checks whether the data write requests are provided at an average write rate that differs from 8 MB\/sec, or whether there is a delay between two consecutive data bursts that exceeds three millisecond, which is the INSQ's EOS threshold in this example. If there is a delay that exceeds three milliseconds during which no data write requests are received at the expected rate (i.e., 8 MB\/sec) at the storage device, the storage device assumes that the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ is no longer in progress (i.e., the INSQ has terminated), which means that the storage device may allow ESQ operations, which were predefined for the \u201cCapture Multi-Shot Image\u201d INSQ, to be executed and suspended ESQ operations to be resumed.","The third entry contains an exemplary INSQ called \u201cUpdate Boot Image\u201d, which pertains to boot operations in a computer system. For the sake of the example it is assumed that the computer system updates a data file that is stored in sequential logical sectors starting from sector # (zero).

Referring again to , by updating the dynamic parameter(s) associated with the \u201cCapture Multishot Image\u201d INSQ and scrutinizing the corresponding threshold value(s) the storage device's controller \u201cknows\u201d whether the \u201cCapture Multishot Image\u201d INSQ is changing, or has changed, its state, from \u201cOn\u201d to \u201cOff\u201d or from \u201cOff\u201d to \u201cOn\u201d.","If the \u201cCapture Multishot Image\u201d INSQ is changing, or has changed, its state, from \u201cOn\u201d to \u201cOff\u201d, this means that ISQ operations are to be avoided or suspended and ESQ operations are allowed to be executed or their execution should be resumed. If the \u201cCapture Multishot Image\u201d INSQ is changing, or has changed, its state, from \u201cOff\u201d to \u201cOn\u201d, this means that ISQ operations should be allowed or resumed or executed and ESQ operations must be avoided or suspended. Accordingly, the storage device controller searches in ISQ\/ESQ lookup table  for the ISQ and ESQ operations relevant to the INSQ \u201cCapture Multishot Image\u201d. As mentioned above, ISQ operations  and ESQ  are associated with the \u201cCapture Multishot Image\u201d INSQ, the associations being respectively shown as dashed lines  and . ISQ operations  include ISQ operations designated as \u201cISQ-\u201d, \u201cISQ-\u201d, \u201cISQ-\u201d, \u201cISQ-\u201d, and \u201cISQ-\u201d. ISQ operation \u201cISQ-\u201d may be, for example, an operation, or a set of operations, involved, for example, in predicting and caching anticipated data. ESQ operations  include ESQ operations designated as \u201cESQ-\u201d, \u201cESQ-\u201d, \u201cESQ-\u201d, \u201cESQ-\u201d, and \u201cESQ-\u201d. ESQ operation \u201cESQ-\u201d may be, for example, an operation, or a set of operations, involved, for example, in static wear leveling. The type of the EOS and BOS parameters and their threshold values, and the type of ISQ and ESQ operations, are set or chosen for each predefined INSQ according to the type of the INSQ. The appropriate setting or choosing of these parameters, threshold values, and types of operations are known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1010","1020"]},"At step  the storage device receives a command from a host device, and at step  it is determined, based on information derived from the received command, and possibly from previously received commands, whether any one of the one or more defined integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state.","If the any one of the one or more defined integral sequences of commands is in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or is transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state (shown as \u201cY\u201d at step ), then, at step  any operation of the first set of internal operations (i.e., ESQ operations) defined for, and associated with, that active integral sequence of commands is refrained from being executed, or its execution is suspended, and, at step , operation or operations of the second set of internal operations (i.e., ISQ operations) associated with that active integral sequence of commands is\/are permitted to be executed if execution thereof has not yet started, or their execution is permitted to be continued if their execution was suspended. In some cases, it may even be highly recommended or desirable to execute certain operations that have some or a significant positive contribution to the efficiency of the storage device or to the storage system as a whole.","However, if the any one of the one or more defined integral sequences of commands is not in the \u201cactive\u201d state, or it is not transitioning from the \u201cinactive\u201d state to the \u201cactive\u201d state (shown as \u201cN\u201d at step ); i.e., the integral sequence is in the inactive state, then, at step  any operation of the second set of internal operations (ISQ) defined for, and associated with, the inactive integral sequence of commands is refrained from being executed, and, at step , operations of the first set of internal operations (ESQ) defined for, and associated with, that inactive integral sequence of commands are permitted to be executed. Regarding step , determination whether a certain INSQ is active or inactive is made after checking whether the current status of the INSQ is \u201cOn\u201d (or it's status is transitioning from \u201cOff\u201d to \u201cOn\u201d) or \u201cOff\u201d (or it's status is transitioning from \u201cOn\u201d to \u201cOff\u201d), as described in more detail in connection with , respectively.","At least one of the one or more defined integral sequences of commands may be associated with playing back of multimedia content, or with capturing multimedia content or images, or with data synchronization, or with a boot command.","Each of the first set (ESQ) and second set (ISQ) of internal operations defined for, and associated with, an INSQ may include any of the following operations: flash management operation; encryption\/decryption of outgoing\/incoming data; compression\/decompression of outgoing\/incoming data; anti-virus operation; defragmentation operation; backing up data; and changing data format. A flash management operation may involve: garbage collection; activating an error correction mechanism; caching data into a fast flash storage area of the storage device; flushing cached data; using low power mode; and static wear leveling.","In one example \u201clow-power mode\u201d operations can be allowed while an INSQ associated with playing back a music file is in progress (i.e., active). That is, if an MP3 player, an exemplary host device, plays back a music file, the storage device can use the \u201clow power mode\u201d while the storage device is receiving an INSQ (i.e., a series of commands) for playing back the music file. Because playing back a music file requires reading the music file at a constant bit rate of, about, around or near 16 KB\/sec., the low-power mode operation(s) may be allowed only if execution thereof does not detrimentally affect the specified bit rate (i.e., 16 KB\/sec.). An internal operation (ISQ) may be \u201callowed\u201d, \u201crecommended\u201d, or \u201cmandatory\u201d with respect to a given INSQ. In this example \u201clow power mode\u201d operations are \u201callowed\u201d, which means that executing or refraining from executing these operations, while an \u201cMP3 play\u201d INSQ is in progress, does not have much negative or positive contribution on the overall performance of the storage system as a whole.","In one example the storage device can use an error correction mechanism to enhance data reading reliability while a host device is reading the operating system's (\u201cOS's\u201d) bit image from the storage device. Reading the OS image may be defined as an INSQ, and error correction operations may be defined for the OS image reading INSQ. In this example \u201cOS image reading\u201d operations are \u201crecommended\u201d because, to the extent possible, it is recommended that actions to improve reliability of a data reading process be taken.","In one example the storage device can use data caching operations while a digital camera, an exemplary host device, is storing multi-shot pictures in the storage device. Storing multi-shot pictures in the storage device may be defined as an INSQ, and data caching operations may be defined for the multi-shot pictures storing INSQ. In this example \u201cdata caching\u201d operations are \u201cmandatory\u201d because the rate at which the digital camera transfers pictures to the storage device is higher than the speed at which the storage device can store the pictures.","Some operations are not recommended or should be avoided if an INSQ is in progress. In one example executing an anti-virus operation is not recommended while an MP3 player is playing back a music file because executing anti-virus operations under such circumstances might result in an audible hiccups-like interference. In one example executing a garbage collection operation must be avoided while a digital camera is storing multi-shot pictures in a storage device because executing garbage collection operations under such circumstances might result in lost or corrupted pictures.","It is noted that an internal operation can be permitted to be executed, or may be recommended or mandatory while some INSQs are in progress, whereas the same internal operation may have to be avoided or may be not recommended while some other INSQs are in progress. Therefore, such an internal operation may be simultaneously defined as an operation of a first set of internal operations (ESQ) that are defined for one INSQ, and as an operation of a second set of internal operations (ISQ) that are defined for another FNSQ.","For example, execution of an error correction operation is recommended for an INSQ that involves updating an OS bit image, but it must be avoided in cases where an INSQ involves playing back a music file, because executing error correction operations consume a considerable electrical power and computational resources.","In the description and claims of the present application, each of the verbs, \u201ccomprise\u201d, \u201cinclude\u201d and \u201chave\u201d, and conjugates thereof, are used to indicate that the object or objects of the verb are not necessarily a complete listing of members, components, elements, or parts of the subject or subjects of the verb.
