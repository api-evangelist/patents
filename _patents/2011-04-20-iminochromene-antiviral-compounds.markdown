The government has certain rights in the invention.","Compounds and methods disclosed herein are useful for treating viral infection in vertebrates, including RNA viral infections.","As a group, RNA viruses represent an enormous public health problem in the U.S. and worldwide. Well-known RNA viruses include influenza virus (including the avian and swine isolates), hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus, SARS-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).","More than 170 million people worldwide are infected by HCV, and 130 million of those are chronic carriers at risk of developing chronic liver diseases (cirrhosis, carcinoma, and liver failure). As such, HCV is responsible for two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world. Recent studies show that the death rate from HCV infection is rising due to the increasing age of chronically infected patients. Likewise seasonal flu infects 5-20% of the population resulting in 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths each year.","Compared to influenza and HCV, West Nile virus causes the lowest number of infections, 981 in the United States in 2010. Twenty percent of infected patients develop a severe form of the disease, resulting in a 4.5% mortality rate. Unlike influenza and HCV, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of West Nile virus infection, and it is a high-priority pathogen for drug development due to its potential as a bioterrorist agent.","Among the RNA viruses listed, vaccines exist only for influenza virus. Accordingly, drug therapy is essential to mitigate the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these viruses. Unfortunately, the number of antiviral drugs is limited, many are poorly effective, and nearly all are plagued by the rapid evolution of viral resistance and a limited spectrum of action. Moreover, treatments for acute influenza and HCV infections are only moderately effective. The standard of care for HCV infection, PEGylated interferon and ribavirin, is effective in only 50% of patients, and there are a number of dose-limiting side effects associated with the combined therapy. Both classes of acute influenza antivirals, adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors, are only effective within the first 48 hours after infection, thereby limiting the window of opportunity for treatment. High resistance to adamantanes already restricts their use, and massive stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors will eventually lead to overuse and the emergence of resistant strains of influenza.","Most drug development efforts against these viruses target viral proteins. This is a large part of the reason that current drugs are narrow in spectrum and subject to the emergence of viral resistance. Most RNA viruses have small genomes and many encode less than a dozen proteins. Viral targets are therefore limited. Based on the foregoing, there is an immense and unmet need for effective treatments against viral infections.","The compounds and methods disclosed herein shift the focus of viral drug development away from the targeting of viral proteins to the development of drugs that target and enhance the host's innate antiviral response. Such compounds and methods are likely to be more effective, less susceptible to the emergence of viral resistance, cause fewer side effects and be effective against a range of different viruses (1).","The RIG-I pathway is intimately involved in regulating the innate immune response to RNA virus infections. RIG-I agonists are expected to be useful for the treatment of many viruses including, without limitation, HCV, influenza, and West Nile virus. Accordingly, the present disclosure relates to compounds and methods for treating viral infection, including infection by RNA viruses, wherein the compounds can modulate the RIG-I pathway.","One

development of drugs that target and enhance the host (patient's) innate antiviral response. Such compounds and methods are likely to be more effective, less susceptible to the emergence of viral resistance, cause fewer side effects and be effective against a range of different viruses (1).","The RIG-I pathway is intimately involved in regulating the innate immune response to RNA virus infections. RIG-I is a cytosolic pathogen recognition receptor that is essential for triggering immunity to a wide range of RNA viruses (5-8). RIG-I is a double-stranded RNA helicase that binds to motifs within the RNA virus genome characterized by homopolymeric stretches of uridine or polymeric U\/A motifs (9). Binding to RNA induces a conformation change that relieves RIG-I signaling repression by an autologous repressor domain, thus allowing RIG-I to signal downstream through its tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) (4). RIG-I signaling is dependent upon its NTPase activity, but does not require the helicase domain (10, 11). RIG-I signaling is silent in resting cells, and the repressor domain serves as the on-off switch that governs signaling in response to virus infection (8).","RIG-I signaling is transduced through IPS-1 (also known as Cardif, MAVs, and VISA), an essential adaptor protein that resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane (12-15). IPS-1 recruits a macromolecular signaling complex that stimulates the downstream activation of IRF-3, a transcription factor that induces the expression of type I IFNs and virus-responsive genes that control infection (16). Compounds that trigger RIG-I signaling directly or through modulation of RIG-I pathway components, including IRF-3, present attractive therapeutic applications as antivirals or immune modulators.","A high-throughput screening approach was used to identify compounds that modulate the RIG-I pathway, a key regulator of the cellular innate immune response to RNA virus infection. In particular embodiments, validated RIG-I agonist lead compounds were demonstrated to specifically activate interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). In additional embodiments they exhibit one or more of the following: they induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), have low cytotoxicity in cell-based assays, are suitable for analog development and QSAR studies, have drug-like physiochemical properties, and have antiviral activity against influenza A virus and\/or hepatitis C virus (HCV). In certain embodiments, the compounds exhibit all of these characteristics.","As discussed below, these compounds represent a new class of potential antiviral therapeutics. Although the disclosure is not bound by a specific mechanism of action of the compounds in vivo, the compounds are selected for their modulation of the RIG-I pathway. In certain embodiments, the modulation is activation of the RIG-I pathway.

The compound media solution is removed from the plate and stored in a clean tissue culture dish. Cell monolayers are washed with PBS and HCV2a virus is added at the stated MOI. Virus is incubated for 2-4 hours and then removed, the monolayers are washed with PBS and the compound solutions are replaced into each well.","The cells are grown overnight and then cells are fixed and stained for HCV proteins. All buffers and reagents are used from the Cellomics staining kits described above. Primary serum PHS#72 is diluted 1:3,000 in wash buffer and incubated at room temperature 1 hour.

For optimization, a two-stage QSAR approach is used; starting with a small analog derivative set to define structural class followed by derivative expansion. Active analogs identified in the first stage will be used to define a subset of structural classes of interest for further optimization in stage 2.","Stage 2 will focus on creating structural diversity and evaluating core variants. Structural derivatives will be tested for biological activity in antiviral activity against HCV and influenza virus, and cytotoxicity in one or more cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Optimized molecules that show improved efficacy and low cytotoxicity will be further characterized by additional measures of in vitro toxicology and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME). Their mechanism of action and breadth of antiviral activity will also be studied.","Chemical design in QSAR studies. To design analog structures, we will analyze drug-like properties, metabolic lability, and toxic potential of the lead compounds. Drug-like properties, as measured by Lipinski's Rules (18), and related physiochemical properties are primary indicators of bioavailability. Structural features that suggest metabolic and toxicological liabilities may indicate limited stability, reduced half-life, reactive intermediates, or idiosyncratic toxicity and will therefore be removed. A 5- to 10-compound analog set is constructed to remove or alter chemically reactive or metabolically susceptible structural features, thereby developing a preliminary QSAR.","KIN700 compounds are tested for in vitro antiviral activity against HCV 2A and influenza A virus (A\/WSN\/33). Viral protein and RNA levels are assessed following drug treatment using the assays described above.","Following several iterative rounds of QSAR, KIN700 compounds are selected for characterization of their in vitro toxicological and ADMA properties and for further mechanistic study. The QSAR studies are designed to provide lead compounds with picomolar to nanomolar potency, which is adequate to support preclinical development.","In vitro pharmacology. In vitro pharmacology studies are performed to measure performance of the most promising analogs in one or more assays of intestinal permeability, metabolic stability and toxicity. Key in vitro characterization studies can include plasma protein binding; serum, plasma, and whole-blood stability in human and model organisms; intestinal permeability; intrinsic clearance; human Ether-\u00e0-go-go (hERG) channel inhibition; and genotoxicity.","For each analog, an HPLC- and\/or HPLC-mass spectrometry-based analytical method will be used to evaluate drug and metabolite concentrations in various test systems. Although the specific analytical method is optimized for each molecule, reverse-phase chromatography can be used alone or in combination with quadrupole mass spectrometry to characterize the identity and purity of several of the lead molecules. Initially, drug stability over time in increasing concentrations of serum, plasma, and whole blood from mammalian species (such as mouse, cynomolgus macaque, and human) will be evaluated by HPLC, and a half-life will be determined.","In some instances, prominent metabolites are characterized by mass spectrometry. Human plasma protein binding will be evaluated by partition analysis using equilibrium dialysis. For intestinal permeability modeling, apical-to-basolateral flux is assessed in the human epithelial cell line TC7. Hepatic clearance is estimated for a subset of the most promising analogs by measuring the rate of disappearance of the parent compound during incubation in human liver microsomes. As above, specific metabolites may be isolated and characterized.","In vitro toxicology. This description of toxicological assays is exemplary and not intended to be limiting. In vitro toxicology studies are performed to evaluate the potential cardiac and genetic toxicity of lead analogs. Automated patch-clamp can be used to assess the impact of each compound on hERG channel currents in a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line transgenically expressing the human Kv11.1 gene. Concentrations up to the lesser of 30 times the maximum serum concentration or the limit of solubility of each compound are evaluated in order to determine an IC50 for the molecule on the hERG channel. A subset of compounds is evaluated over a range of concentrations for their ability to induce mutation reversion in strains TA98 and TA100 or to promote micronucleus formation in CHO cells in culture.","Antiviral action in cell culture infection models. KIN700 compounds disclosed herein have efficient activity against HCV genotype 2a and influenza virus strain WSN. To further characterize the breadth of antiviral activity of optimized molecules, cell culture infection models are used to analyze different HCV genotypes and influenza virus strains. In addition, optimized compounds are tested for activity against West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging public health concern. The studies include treating cells with compound 2-12 h prior to infection or treating cells 8 h after infection (Table 3). Virus production and cellular ISG expression are assessed over a time course to analyze antiviral effects of representative compounds from lead structural classes. IFN\u03b2 treatment is used as a positive control.","Virus production is measured by focus-forming or plaque assay. In parallel experiments, viral RNA and cellular ISG expression are measured by qPCR and immunoblot analyses.
