{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION","REFERENCES"],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional application No. 60\/423,474, filed Nov. 4, 2002.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed, and used by or for the U.S. Government.","The present invention relates generally to interferometry and in particular to interferometers capable of single-exposure, no moving parts, non-scanning, polychromatic interferometery.","Conventional devices for producing interferograms have one or more moving parts, such as a mirror or other reflective element, and accumulate data from several measurements of electromagnetic radiation at a succession of different mirror positions. These devices are usually variants of the Michelson interferometer design, and the interferograms are recorded for a number of different positions of the moving mirror and analyzed for spectral content. The distance between mirror positions can be very small. For example, optical interferometry mirror movements can be 1 millionth of a meter or less. A high precision mechanism is therefore required to reposition the mirror and maintain its reflective surface in a plane that is normal to the direction of propagation of the sample input beam. Although construction of a Michelson-type interferometer is a major optomechanical challenge and good instruments can be quite expensive, the Michelson interferometer remains the most widely used instrument of its kind, and over the years, many variations have been designed. In particular, substantial effort has been devoted to the design of staging platforms, actuators, transducers, drive mechanisms, and the like, to improve positioning and control of the moving mirror.","Michelson-type interferometers are subject to misalignment and distortion from vibration, shock and environmental changes and must be field hardened for use outside a laboratory environment. For example, the Michelson-type interferometer in the Army's M21 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm is housed in an elaborate and costly vibration isolating, climate controlled enclosure. Michelson-type interferometers may also experience problems in applications where the input signal changes rapidly during the time the mirror takes to travel the distance needed for acquiring a complete interferogram. For example, an interferometer that is operating from a fast moving platform such as an airplane with a given field-of-view (FOV) can experience an input signal that changes more rapidly than the acquisition time of a complete interferogram. In this case, the \u201cscene\u201d or region of space being sampled within the instrument's FOV is not constant over the acquisition time, and the interferogram is thus composed of a mixture of data from several different scenes.","These and other problems are solved, at least in part, by embodiments of a single-exposure, no moving parts interferometer in accordance with the present invention.","In general, in one aspect, an embodiment of an interferometer in accordance with the present invention includes a source of electromagnetic energy directed along an initial beam path, a detector of electromagnetic energy, a beam splitter configured to split the beam of electromagnetic energy into segments including a reflected beam segment and a transmitted beam segment, a first reflective element fixed in position and configured to reflect the reflected beam segment back along a beam path normal to the initial beam path and through the beam splitter to the detector, a second reflective element fixed in position and configured to reflect the transmitted beam segment back in a direction parallel to the initial beam path in a plurality of sub-beams so that each of the plurality of sub-beams traverses a path that differs incrementally in phase from the path traversed by an adjacent sub-beam, whereupon the subbeams are combined interferometrically at the beam splitter with the beam segment reflected from the first reflective element to produce an interferogram at the detector.","In general, in another aspect, a method of interferometry in accordance with the present invention includes directing an input electromagnetic beam along an initial beam path, splitting the input electromagnetic beam with a beam splitter that provides a plurality of beam segments comprising a first beam segment directed along a beam path normal to the initial beam path and a second beam segment directed along a beam path parallel to the initial beam path, reflecting the first beam segment back along the beam path normal to the first electromagnetic beam and traversing the beam splitter to a detector, reflecting the second beam segment back along a beam path parallel to the initial beam path in a plurality of parallel sub-beams of successively increasing path lengths, reflecting the plurality of parallel sub-beams at the beam splitter along the beam path normal to the first electromagnetic beam, and detecting an interferometric relationship between the plurality of sub-beams of successively increasing path lengths and the first beam segment.","In general, in another aspect, an embodiment of an interferometer in accordance with the present invention includes a first prism that includes an input face normal to an input optical path, a reflective face normal to the input face, and a beamsplitter face opposite the input face and oriented at an acute angle with respect to the input optical path. In another aspect, the embodiment of an interferometer in accordance with the present invention further includes a second prism disposed with a beamsplitter face parallel and adjacent to the beamsplitter face of the first prism. The second prism further includes an output face normal to the input optical path and opposite the reflective face of the first prism, and a reflective face that includes a plurality of parallel reflective surfaces normal to the input optical path and configured to provide successively increasing path lengths in a direction parallel to the input optical path.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawing that forms a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention, as claimed, may be practiced. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. For example, while embodiments in accordance with the invention include optical interferometers employing optical elements such as optical mirrors, beamsplitters, and the like, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, embodiments in accordance with the invention also include interferometers for detecting and analyzing other ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio frequency, infrared, middle-infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray, and beyond.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","101","102","104","103","101","104","106","103","105","101","104","108","105","103","105","104","109","110"]},"The signal output by detector  is a function of the path difference between the fixed mirror  and moveable mirror . At a zero path difference the waves for all electromagnetic frequencies of the input beam will interact coherently. As the movable mirror  is scanned, each input wavelength will generate a series of transmission maxima.","In a conventional interferometer, path difference is adjusted by displacing an optical element in the path of one beam segment. For example, in the interferometer of , moving mirror  of  is moved back and forth along the path of transmitted beam segment  by a transport mechanism such as a staging platform, actuator, transducer, stepper motor or similar drive mechanism. Each displacement of moving mirror  corresponds to a twofold increase or decrease in the path difference between the transmitted beam segment  and the reflected beam segment .","Input beam  in the simplest case, is monochromatic collimated light. The intensity of the recombined beam  depends on the path difference traveled by the two beam segments  and . If the distance traveled by the two beam segments  and  is the same, or if the paths differ by an integer multiple of the wavelength of input beam , the beam segments will be in phase when they recombine at beamsplitter , and the intensity of the superposition of the two beams at detector  will be at a maximum. Displacing the moving mirror  changes the phase relationship of the beams being recombined. This phase difference results in an observable loss of amplitude in the recombined beam  relative to the input beam . Recording the changes in amplitude as the position of the moving mirror  is varied yields an interferogram which may then be analyzed to determine spectral content. An interferogram produced by interferometer  is thus composed of the intensity of the superposition of the two beams at detector  for each of the moving mirror  positions. Monochromatic light will have a single series of transmission maxima. Polychromatic light or other multiple frequency electromagnetic sources will have a different series of transmission maxima for each input wavelength present.","The number of displacements or steps of moving mirror  corresponds to the number of data points at the detector . In general, in order to resolve shorter input wavelengths, smaller and increasingly precise mirror movements are needed.","Referring now to , an interferometer  in accordance with the present invention includes an electromagnetic radiation source , preferably collimated, an optical beamsplitter , a fixed position reflector  and a detector . The foregoing elements perform like functions as like numbered elements of the conventional interferometer  of . Interferometer  however replaces the moving mirror  of  with a fixed position reflective element that advantageously transforms an incident beam into a series of parallel reflections of successively increasing path lengths. Because the reflective element is not moving the parallel reflections are provided continuously and essentially simultaneously.","The embodiment of  employs a staircase reflector  that provides a series of N reflective elements  having planar reflective surfaces  of width W normal to the direction of propagation of beam segment . The reflective surfaces  are spaced from neighboring reflective elements by a distance \u0394 in the direction of propagation of beam segment  so that the path length traversed by sub-beams reflected from successive reflective surfaces  of staircase reflector  are incremented by 2\u0394.","With the staircase reflector  in place, the cross-section (width) of transmitted beam segment  can be considered to be made of a series of smaller width sub-beams. Each of the sub-beams can be made to traverse successively increasing path lengths by retro-reflecting them on the stepped reflective surfaces  of the staircase reflector . Of course, each of these sub-beams must be superposed on a corresponding section from the unaltered beam retroreflected from reflector .","Thus, with staircase reflector , a complete interferogram can be produced spatially at detector . Because all the different relative phase differences between the two beam segments  and  are present at the same time, the scanning of an optical element such as a mirror is no longer required to acquire the interferogram.","Referring to , a one-piece, no moving parts, polychromatic interferometer  in accordance with the present invention is shown. Interferometer  is rugged and capable of acquiring an interferogram in one exposure. It includes two prisms  and , that are fused or \u201csandwiched\u201d into a beamsplitter . For infrared applications, the prisms of interferometer  may be constructed of zinc selenide (ZnSe), germanium (Ge), or other infrared transmitting material. Visible light applications will most likely use high quality quartz, BK7 glass or other similar visible light transmitting material. The top surface  of prism  includes a planar mirrored surface that is normal to the direction of propagation of incident beam  and functions as a fixed mirror of the interferometer  in a manner similar to the fixed reflector  of the interferometer  of . A staircase reflector  is provided on or adjacent to the surface of the second prism  opposite beamsplitter  and replaces the moving mirror  of the interferometer  of . Staircase reflector  includes a series of N equally sized planar reflective elements  of width W that are separated from neighboring reflective elements in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of beam segment  by a distance \u0394. Staircase reflector  may be blazed or micromachined into the surface of the second prism  or made from a suitable diffraction grating affixed to the surface.","The number of reflective \u201csteps\u201d provided by a staircase reflector according to the present invention will, in general, determine the number of sub-beams of successively increasing path lengths, and hence, the maximum number of data points in the interferogram. This is essentially equivalent to setting the number of data points taken along the path of the moving mirror  in the conventional step-scan Michelson interferometer . By increasing the number of staircase reflector steps and the distance spanned by the steps along the beam path, the resolution of an interferometer in accordance with the present invention may be increased.","In general, the resolution and frequency range that can be detected by an interferometer is affected by the overall path difference between the transmitted and reflected beams. The larger this difference, the better the resolution and the wider the frequency range. Referring to , the measure of the path differences for beam segments  and , is (SB\u2212SF), i=I,N, where the SBis the distance from beamsplitter  to the istep of staircase reflector  and SFis the vertical distance between the beamsplitter  and the fixed reflector .","The overall sensitivity of an interferometer in accordance with the present invention will be dependent on several factors. Quantum yield and noise characteristics of the detector, typically a focal plane array camera, are important considerations. In order for the detector to produce a suitable electronic signal above the background noise, a sufficient number of photons must strike the detector during the allotted exposure time.","Another factor affecting sensitivity and resolution is the degree of match in size between the widths of the sub-beams and the detector elements. For example, if the width W of the steps of staircase reflector  is larger than the width of the detector elements  in the detector , the intensity from a single path difference can spill over into the adjacent detector support framework and possibly even other detector elements. This can result is a loss in the number of photons detected and a cross-contamination of signals derived from different phases or path lengths. Thus, it is desirable to match as much as possible the widths of the subdivided beams to detector element widths or the widths of groups of adjacent detector elements.","A variety of techniques may be used to produce a staircase case reflector for embodiments of interferometers in accordance with the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, a suitable staircase reflector can be made by employing manufacturing techniques similar to techniques used in the production of planar reflection gratings. For example, a planar reflection grating that is \u201cblazed\u201d or ruled in a sawtooth pattern can be oriented to provide a staircase of planar reflective surfaces normal to and incrementally distant from an incident beam.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["412","412","420","415","415","422","416","414","420","415","424","422"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["412","420","418","420","422","318"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","502","104","106","110","508","509","508","508","508","508","105","103","105","509","508"]},"A prototype that illustrates, at least in part, the operation of an interferometer in accordance with the present invention was constructed of general research grade optical components in a laboratory. The interferometer was constructed on several precision motion stages, and employed two 2\u2033 diameter fixed position planar aluminum mirrors with 1\/10 wave surfaces, a cube beamsplitter antireflected coated for 400\u2013800 nm, and a green 0.5 mW HeNe laser operating at 534 nm which was beam expanded to approximately 20 nm. In this prototype the staircase reflector element was approximated by angling one of the fixed position planar mirrors so that reflections across the face of the mirror occurred at incremental path distances.","Shown in  is an image of an interferogram recorded with the aforementioned prototype interferometer according to the present invention. The interferogram was recorded using a monochromatic green HeNe laser source. For ease of viewing, the angle of the mirror was set so that only a few fringes of the interferogram  would be produced over the entire width of the beam. These fringes are easily observed and the intensity variations are representative of the expected sinusoidal wave.","As has been shown, embodiments in accordance with the present invention include an interferometer\/sensor that has no moving parts, can be constructed as a single solid element, and is able to acquire an interferogram in a single exposure using a focal plane array detector. Such interferometers are stable, rugged, relatively inexpensive to construct, and are expected to be less susceptible to mechanical failures than conventional step-scan Michelson interferometer designs.

Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications to the described embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention.
