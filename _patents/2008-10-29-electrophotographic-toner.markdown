example, developing latent images formed in electrophotography, electrostatic recording method, electrostatic printing method or the like, and a resin binder for use in such a toner.","In the recent years, with the advancement of speeding up of the machines and energy conservation, a toner having excellent low-temperature fixing ability is required. In view of the above, as a resin binder for use in a toner, a polycondensation resin in which an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol is used is proposed, in place of a conventionally used polycondensation resin obtainable from an aromatic polyhydric alcohol.","Patent Publication 1 discloses a toner for electrostatic image development, in which as a resin binder a polyester resin obtainable by reacting an alcohol component containing 1,3-propanediol and a specified other polyhydric alcohol as essential constituents, and a polybasic acid component is used, the toner having excellent fixing ability and offset resistance, showing stable charging behavior even when subjected to continuous printing, and having excellent durability so that an excellent high-quality image is obtained.","Patent Publication 2 discloses a polyester resin for a toner, in which a polyester resin obtainable from a polyol component containing 30 to 100% by mol of an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, at least a part of the aliphatic diol being 1,2-propylene glycol, is used, wherein a tetrahydrofuran-soluble component has a number-average molecular weight of from 1,000 to 9,500, for the purpose of providing a toner having excellent balance between low-temperature fixing ability and pulverizability, and excellent gloss after fusing.","For example, Patent Publication 3 discloses a toner for electrostatic image development wherein the polyester contains a high-softening point polyester having a softening point of from 120\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 C., and a low-softening point polyester having a softening point of from 75\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 C., each obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component consisting essentially of an aliphatic alcohol, and a carboxylic acid component, wherein a difference in the softening points between the high-softening point polyester and the low-softening point polyester is 10\u00b0 C. or more.","Patent Publication 4 discloses a method for producing a resin binder having excellent triboelectric charges and environmental stability of the image quality, favorable pulverizability and transparency, and being fixable at low temperatures, characterized by previously mixing (a) raw material monomer mixtures of two polymerization system each having independent reaction paths in a single reaction vessel, (b) a compound capable of reacting with the raw materials of both the two polymerization systems, and (c) a tricarboxylic or higher polycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, and concurrently carrying out the two polymerization reactions in the same reaction vessel.","In addition, Patent Publication 5 discloses a resin binder for a toner having excellent low-temperature fixing ability, environmental stability, and blocking resistance, the resin binder for a toner containing crystalline polyester and amorphous polyester resins, wherein the crystalline polyester is obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing 70% by mol or more of an aliphatic diol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, and a carboxylic acid component containing 70% by mol or more of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid compound.","As resin binders for a toner, styrene-acrylic resins, polyesters, epoxy resins and the like have been used, and polycondensation resins such as polyesters are beginning to be widely used because of their excellent low-temperature fixing ability. Patent Publication 6 makes various studies on catalyst usable in the production of a polyester.","Patent Publications 7 and 8 disclose the techniques of adding as a charge control agent a charge control resin (CCR) having excellent triboelectric property.","Patent Publication 9 discloses a toner for electrophotography containing toner particles and at least two kinds of external additives having specified average particle sizes, for the purpose of simultaneous improving transfer efficiency while maintaining high resolution and optical density, and stabilizing fluidity of the toner.","Conventionally, a styrene-acrylic resin or a polyester is known as a resin binder for a toner, and a toner containing a polyester is widely used because of its excellent durability and fixing ability. As the toner as described above, Patent Publication 10 discloses a polyester containing, as a carboxylic acid component, an alkylsuccinic acid and\/or alkenylsuccinic acid, having 10 or more carbon atoms, especially from the viewpoint of fixing ability, and a toner obtained by a melt-kneading pulverization method using the polyester as a resin binder. In addition, Patent Publication 11 discloses a toner for electrophotography, containing a resin binder containing a composite resin having a polycondensation resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit, the toner being obtained by melt-pulverization method, wherein the polycondensation resin unit has a constituting unit derived from a carboxylic acid component containing at least two kinds of alkylsuccinic acid, of which alkyl group is branched and has 9 to 14 carbon atoms.","On the other hand, in the recent years, with the pursuit of formation of high quality images, the development of a toner having a small particle size, the toner having excellent fixing ability is desired. However, in a case where a toner having a small particle size, the toner containing a resin binder containing a polyester as a main component, is produced by a melt-kneading and pulverization method, it is difficult to control the pulverization. In view of the above, for example, Patent Publication 12 discloses a method for producing a toner according to an emulsification-aggregation method, which is a wet production method, using a resin binder having a carboxyl group.","Patent Publication 13 discloses a polyester having excellent hydrolytic resistance usable in the production of a toner including the step of forming particles from raw material components containing a resin binder containing at least a polyester in an aqueous medium or a solution, the polyester being obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component containing at least one member selected from alkylsuccinic acids and alkenylsuccinic acids, and a polyester for use in a toner for electrophotography having excellent storage property and fixing ability, containing the above polyester.","Patent Publication 14 discloses, as an objective of providing a toner for electrophotography having excellent storage property and durability, a toner for electrophotography obtainable by a method including the step of forming particles from raw materials containing a resin binder and a polyolefin wax and\/or a paraffin wax, wherein the resin binder contains a resin obtainable from at least raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for an addition polymerization resin.\n\n","The present invention relates to:","[1] a resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography, containing a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing","an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto (an alcohol A), and","a carboxylic acid component,","wherein the alcohol A is contained in an amount of from 10 to 100% by mol, of the alcohol component;","[2] the resin binder according to the above [1], wherein the carboxylic acid component comprises at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids and alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids;","[3] a resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography, containing a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin, wherein the polycondensation resin is a resin obtainable by polycondensing","an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto (an alcohol A),","and a carboxylic acid component;","[4] the resin binder according to any one of the above [1] to [3], wherein the alcohol A upon the polycondensation of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is used in an amount of from 6 to 100 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component;\n\n[5] a resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography, containing an amorphous resin and a crystalline resin, wherein at least one of the resins of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin is a resin obtainable by polycondensing\n","an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto (an alcohol A), and","a carboxylic acid component;","[6] the resin binder according to the above [5], wherein the amorphous resin is one or more resins selected from the group consisting of","(a) a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids and alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids, and an alcohol component;

and\n\n[17] the resin binder according to any one of the above [13] to [16], wherein the alcohol component further contains an aliphatic diol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms other than the alcohol A.\n","The present invention relates to a toner for electrophotography having storage property, while satisfying excellent low-temperature fixing ability, and a resin binder for use in such a toner.","The toner for electrophotography of the present invention also exhibits an effect of showing excellent storage property, while satisfying excellent low-temperature fixing ability.","The polycondensation resin obtainable from an aliphatic alcohol has excellent low-temperature fixing ability but insufficient storage property. Especially, the toners are likely to suffer from not only heat generation in the machine but also temperature elevation in the container due to direct sunlight during the transportation, so that storage property is an essential property for toners. However, an increase in storage property would inevitably lead to the risk of low-temperature fixing ability, so that the development of a resin binder for use in a toner having excellent low-temperature fixing ability and storage property, which are counteractive properties.","A major feature of the resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography of the present invention resides in that the resin binder contains a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing, as raw material monomers,","an alcohol component containing at least an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto (an alcohol A); and","a carboxylic acid component.","The polycondensation resin obtained from the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol is likely to have a higher ester value, as compared to the case where the polycondensation resin is obtained from an aromatic polyhydric alcohol such as a generally used alkylene oxide of bisphenol A, so that the polycondensation resin is effective in improving low-temperature fixing ability from the viewpoint of affinity with paper. On the other hand, in a state where a molecular backbone is flexible, and the molecular weight is not likely to noticeably increased, it is difficult to increase a glass transition temperature, whereby leading to the lowering in storage property. In the present invention, however, it is made possible to improve low-temperature fixing ability without impairing storage property, by using an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above. One of the causes therefor is presumably due to the fact that an alkyl group bound to a secondary carbon with a hydroxyl group bound thereto leads to restrain a molecular motion, so that the resulting resin binder has a higher glass transition temperature, as compared to those resins having softening points of the same level.","The aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto (an alcohol A) includes 2,3-butanediol, 2,3-pentanediol, 2,4-pentanediol, 2,3-hexanediol, 3,4-hexanediol, 2,4-hexanediol, 2,5-hexanediol, and the like.","The alcohol A has preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably 4 to 5 carbon atoms, and even more preferably 4 carbon atoms, from the viewpoint of increasing an ester value and also increasing storage property as well as low-temperature fixing ability of the toner. In addition, an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having one or more sets of secondary carbon atoms, the secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto being adjacent to each other, is more preferred, from the viewpoint of making the backbone of the main chain of the resin rigid, thereby increasing storage property. From these viewpoints, an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having 4 to 8 carbon atoms, which has one or more sets of secondary carbon atoms, the secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto being adjacent to each other, such as 2,3-butanediol, 2,3-pentanediol, 2,3-hexanediol, or 3,4-hexanediol, is more preferred.","As the resin binder of the present invention, the following Embodiments I-1 to I-3 are provided.","Embodiment I-1: a resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography comprising a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing the alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component, wherein the alcohol A is contained in an amount of from 10 to 100% by mol of the alcohol component;\n\nEmbodiment I-2: a resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography comprising a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin, obtainable by polymerizing raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for the styrenic resin, wherein the polycondensation resin is a resin obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto (an alcohol A) and a carboxylic acid component; and\n\nEmbodiment I-3: a resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography containing an amorphous resin and a crystalline resin, wherein at least either one of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin is a resin obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component containing the alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component.\n","The alcohol A is contained in an amount of from 10 to 100% by mol, preferably from 12 to 80% by mol, and more preferably from 25 to 75% by mol, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.","In addition, the amount of the alcohol A used upon the polycondensation of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is preferably from 6 to 100 parts by weight, more preferably from 10 to 90 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 15 to 80 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component, which are the raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability, storage property and optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions of the toner.","In Embodiment I-1, it is preferable that the alcohol component further contains, other than the alcohol A, an aliphatic diol having 2 to 8 carbons atoms, and preferably 2 to 6 carbons atoms (an alcohol B), from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability of the toner. The alcohol B includes ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-butenediol, 1,3-butanediol, neopentyl glycol, and the like. Among them, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol and 1,3-propanediol are preferred, from the viewpoint of storage property of the toner.","The alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably from 0 to 90% by mol, more preferably from 0.5 to 90% by mol, even more preferably from 20 to 88% by mol, and still even more preferably from 25 to 75% by mol, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of increasing low-temperature fixing ability of the toner.","In addition, the alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably 10 mol or less, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mol, and more preferably from 0.3 to 3 mol, per one mol of the alcohol A, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.","The alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the alcohol B includes aromatic diols such as an alkylene oxide adduct of bisphenol represented by the formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0064"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"19.22mm","wi":"74.51mm","file":"US08841057-20140923-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein RO and OR are an oxyalkylene group, wherein R is an ethylene group and\/or a propylene group; and each of x and y is a positive number showing an average number of moles of alkylene oxide added, wherein an average number of the sum of x and y is preferably from 1 to 16, more preferably from 1 to 8, and even more preferably from 1.5 to 4, such as polyoxypropylene-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and polyoxyethylene-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane; trihydric or higher polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol; and the like.","The aromatic diol is contained in an amount of preferably 10% by mol or less, and more preferably 5% by mol or less, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability of the toner, and it is preferable that substantially no aromatic diol is used. Here, substantially no aromatic diol is used refers to an aromatic diol that is contained in an amount of 0% by mol, or if any, 1% by mol or less of the alcohol component.","In addition, it is preferable that the carboxylic acid component contains at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids and alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids, from the viewpoint of increasing low-temperature fixing ability and optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions. Here, the succinic acid derivative may be an anhydride or a lower alkyl ester having 1 to 3 carbon atoms of an alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acid or an alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acid.","Since a polycondensation resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has high hygroscopicity, the polycondensation resin is insufficient in optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions; meanwhile, by further using a succinic acid derivative having a long-chain hydrocarbon group, the succinic acid derivative having high hydrophobicity, together therewith as the carboxylic acid component, the lowering of optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions is also improved, while maintaining low-temperature fixing ability and storage property. The reason why the lowering of optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions is improved is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified mentioned structure above has an alkyl group at a terminal, so that hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed, and that at the same time a succinic acid derivative having a long-chain hydrocarbon group, the succinic acid derivative having high hydrophobicity is used, so that hygroscopicity is lowered.","The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group or the alkenyl group in the alkylsuccinic acid and the alkenylsuccinic acid is from 9 to 14, and preferably from 10 to 12, from the viewpoint of increasing low-temperature fixing ability, storage property and optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions of the toner. Those alkyl group and alkenyl group may be linear or branched, and those groups are preferably branched, from the viewpoint of increasing optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions.","Further, it is preferable that the succinic acid derivative is one comprising two or more members selected from the group consisting of alkylsuccinic acids having a branched alkyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms and alkenylsuccinic acids having a branched alkenyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms, from the viewpoint of increasing low-temperature fixing ability and optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions of the toner.

By using a resin having a higher softening point and a resin having a lower softening point in combination, the resulting toner has more excellent properties from the viewpoint mentioned above. Specifically, from the viewpoint mentioned above, it is preferable that the resin binder comprises a high-softening point resin and a low-softening point resin, the softening points of which have a difference of preferably 10\u00b0 C. or more, and more preferably from 20\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 C. The high-softening point resin has a softening point of preferably from 125\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 C., and more preferably from 130\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 C., and the low-softening point resin has a softening point of preferably from 90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 C., and more preferably from 90\u00b0 to 110\u00b0 C. The weight ratio of the high-softening point resin to the low-softening point resin, i.e. high-softening point resin\/low-softening point resin, is preferably from 1\/3 to 3\/1, and more preferably from 1\/2 to 2\/1.","In addition, the resin binder in Embodiment I-1 and Embodiment I-2 has a glass transition temperature of preferably from 45\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 C., more preferably from 50\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 58\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability, storage property and durability of the toner. The resin binder has an acid value of preferably from 1 to 90 mgKOH\/g, more preferably from 5 to 90 mgKOH\/g, and even more preferably from 5 to 88 mgKOH\/g, from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability and environmental stability of the toner.","A feature of the resin binder of Embodiment I-3 is that the resin binder contains an amorphous resin and a crystalline resin, and that an alcohol A is used as an alcohol component at least in either one of the resins. In general, a crystalline resin is effective for improving low-temperature fixing ability; meanwhile, when a crystalline resin is used together with an amorphous resin, storage property is likely to be lowered due to the compatibility therebetween. In Embodiment I-3, however, excellent low-temperature fixing ability is exhibited without impairing storage property of the toner. One of the factors therefor is presumably due to the fact that an alkyl group bound to the secondary carbon with a hydroxyl group bound thereto constrains molecular motion, so that excessive compatibility between the crystalline resin and the amorphous resin is controlled.","The crystallinity of the resin is expressed by a ratio of a softening point to a temperature of the maximum endothermic peak determined with a differential scanning calorimeter, i.e., a ratio expressed by softening point\/temperature of the maximum endothermic peak. Generally, when this value exceeds 1.4, the resin is amorphous; and when the value is less than 0.6, the resin is low in crystallinity and mostly amorphous. The crystallinity of the resin can be adjusted by the kinds of the raw material monomers and a ratio thereof, production conditions (for example, reaction temperature, reaction time, and cooling rate), and the like. In the present invention, the term \u201ccrystalline resin\u201d refers to a resin having a value of softening point\/temperature of the maximum endothermic peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak of from 0.6 to 1.4, and preferably from 0.8 to 1.2, and the term \u201camorphous resin\u201d refers to a resin having a value of softening point\/temperature of the maximum endothermic peak of more than 1.4, or less than 0.6, and preferably more than 1.4. Here, the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak refers to a temperature of the peak on the higher temperature side among endothermic peaks observed. When a difference between the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak and the softening point is within 20\u00b0 C., the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is defined as a melting point. When the difference between the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak and the softening point exceeds 20\u00b0 C., the peak is ascribed to a glass transition. Here, in Embodiment I-3, when simply referred to as a \u201cresin,\u201d it is intended to mean both the crystalline resin and the amorphous resin. Similarly, in Embodiment I-3, when simply referred to as a \u201cpolycondensation resin,\u201d it is intended to mean both the crystalline polycondensation resin and the amorphous polycondensation resin.","In Embodiment I-3, as mentioned above, at least either one of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin is a resin obtained from the alcohol A. It is preferable that both of the crystalline resin and the amorphous resin are a resin that contains a polycondensation resin obtained from the alcohol A, from the viewpoint of storage property of the toner. Here, the amorphous resin may be a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and an addition polymerization resin, as described later.","The alcohol A may be used at least in either one of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin as mentioned above. It is preferable that the alcohol A is used in the amorphous resin, from the viewpoint of storage property of the toner, and it is more preferable that the alcohol A is used in both of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin, from the viewpoint of storage property and low-temperature fixing ability of the toner.","A resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has a high ester value, so that the resin is likely to absorb water under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions, which in turn leads to insufficient triboelectric stability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions. Therefore, it is preferable that the amorphous resin is one or more resins selected from the group consisting of","(a) a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids and alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids, and an alcohol component, and\n\n(b) a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin,\n\nfrom the viewpoint of also having excellent triboelectric stability under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions. This is presumably due to the fact that the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal, hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed, and that at the same time the resin binder contains at least either one of a polycondensation resin obtained from a succinic acid derivative having hydrophobicity, or a composite resin containing the polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin having high hydrophobicity, so that the toner does not become hygroscopic even under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions, whereby excellent triboelectric stability can be maintained.\n","In Embodiment I-3, it is preferable that the crystalline resin is a polycondensation resin, and it is more preferable that the crystalline resin is a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A, and a carboxylic acid component. In addition, the amorphous resin is preferably one or more members selected from the group consisting of","(a) a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A, and a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids and alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids, and\n\n(b) a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A, and a carboxylic acid component, and a styrenic resin.\n","In addition, in Embodiment I-3, the amorphous resin is one or more members selected from the group consisting of","(a) a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids and alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acids, and an alcohol component, and\n\n(b) a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin.\n\nHere, as raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin usable in the composite resin, a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkylsuccinic acids and alkenylsuccinic acids may be used.\n","In addition, the amorphous resin may comprise two kinds (a) and (b) mentioned above. Here, the succinic acid derivative may be an anhydride or a lower alkyl ester having 1 to 3 carbon atoms of an alkyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acid and an alkenyl(9 to 14 carbon atoms)succinic acid.","Preferred embodiments of the resin binder usable in Embodiment I-3 of the present invention include the following 1 to 3:","Embodiment 1: An embodiment where","a crystalline resin is a

In general, a styrenic resin is mainly used as a charge control resin. When used together with a polycondensation resin, the styrenic resin has poor compatibility with a polycondensation resin such as a polyester, so that triboelectric chargeability of the toner is likely to be worsened due to dispersion failure. This is presumably due to the fact that since the alcohol A has an alkyl group adjacent to secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto, hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed, thereby resulting in high hydrophobicity, so that compatibility between a polycondensation resin and with a charge control resin comprising a styrenic resin is improved, thereby sufficiently exhibiting triboelectric chargeability of the charge control resin.","In the present invention, a styrenic resin to be contained as a charge control resin is preferably a quaternary ammonium salt group-containing styrenic resin, from the viewpoint of exhibiting positive chargeability of the toner, or a styrenic resin is preferably a sulfonic acid group-containing styrenic resin, from the viewpoint of exhibiting negative chargeability of the toner.","The quaternary ammonium salt group-containing styrenic resin is more preferably a quaternary ammonium salt group-containing styrene-acrylic resin obtained by the polymerization of a monomer mixture containing a monomer represented by the formula (IIIa):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0204","num":"0217"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"24.21mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08841057-20140923-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;","a monomer represented by the formula (IIIb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0219"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"13.72mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08841057-20140923-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and Ris an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms;","a monomer represented by the formula (IIIc):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0221"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"21.34mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08841057-20140923-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and each of Rand Ris an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms,","or a quaternary compound thereof.

By including a resin obtained by polycondensation of an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component, and at least one charge control agent selected from a metal compound of salicylic acid compound and a metal compound of benzilic acid compound as a charge control agent, an initial rise in triboelectric charging can be improved. The improvement is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal, so that hydrophilicity near the ester group is suppressed, thereby resulting in an increase in hydrophobicity and improvement in dispersibility of a charge control agent, which is a metal compound of a salicylic acid compound and a benzilic acid compound.","Therefore, it is preferable that the charge control agent contains at least one of a metal compound of a salicylic acid compound represented by the formula (IV):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0236"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"29.21mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08841057-20140923-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein each of R, R, and Ris independently a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched, alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or alkenyl group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms; A is chromium, zinc, calcium, zirconium or aluminum; p is an integer of 2 or more; and q is an integer of 1 or more; and","a metal compound of a benzilic acid compound, which is a compound represented by the formula (V):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0225","num":"0238"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"29.63mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08841057-20140923-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein B is boron or aluminum; s is an integer of 2 or more; and t is an integer of 1 or more,","from the viewpoint of an initial rise in triboelectric charging.","The metal compound of a salicylic acid compound represented by the formula (IV) may be either a metal salt or a metal complex.

One of the reasons is presumably due to the fact that the resin obtained from an alcohol A has a higher glass transition temperature, as compared to resins having similar softening points. Specifically, it is presumed that the embodiment of an external additive in the resin caused by a mechanical stress is reduced because of a high glass transition temperature owned by the resin, thereby improving transferability. Further, an external additive having an average particle size of 20 to 250 nm is used, so that transferability is markedly improved. It is considered that this is because a suitable spacer effect is exhibited between the toner and the machine.","The external additive has an average particle size of preferably from 20 to 250 nm, more preferably from 30 to 200 nm, and even more preferably from 35 to 90 nm, from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability, flowability, and transferability of the toner.","The external additive is preferably silica, and more preferably one which contains silica having a small specific gravity, from the viewpoint of preventing embedment.","The silica is preferably a hydrophobic silica that is hydrophobically treated, from the viewpoint of transferability of the toner.","It is preferable that the method of subjecting silica to a hydrophobic treatment includes the step of modifying of a silanol group on the surface of the silica particles with a hydrophobic group such as an alkylsilyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, for example, a methylsilyl group, a hexylsilyl group, or the like, or coating the surface with a hydrophobic resin.","The hydrophobically treating agent for hydrophobically treating the surface of silica particles is exemplified by organochlorosilane, organoalkoxysilane, organodisilazane, cyclic organopolysilazane, linear organopolysiloxane and the like, and specifically include hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDS), a silicone oil, octyltriethoxysilane (OTES), methyltriethoxysilane, and the like.

However, in the present invention, since an alcohol A is used, even when toner particles are formed in an aqueous medium, the lowering in molecular weights is suppressed, so that excellent storage property and hot offset resistance can be maintained. This is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal, so that the ester groups are protected, thereby improving hydrolytic resistance of the polycondensation resin and suppressing the lowering of molecular weights.","In Embodiment II-1, the resin binder contains a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component.","The alcohol A is contained in an amount of preferably from 10 to 100% by mol, more preferably from 12 to 80% by mol, and even more preferably from 25 to 75% by mol, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.","In addition, the amount of the alcohol A used upon the polycondensation of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is preferably from 6 to 100 parts by weight, more preferably from 10 to 90 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 15 to 80 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component, which are the raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability, storage property, and optical density under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions of the toner.","It is preferable that the alcohol component contains an alcohol B mentioned above, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability of the toner, in the same manner as in Embodiment I-1 for the resin binder mentioned above.","The alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably from 0 to 90% by mol, more preferably from 0.5 to 90% by mol, even more preferably from 20 to 88% by mol, and still even more preferably from 25 to 75% by mol, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of increasing the low-temperature fixing ability of the toner.","In addition, the alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably 10 mol or less, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mol, and more preferably from 0.3 to 3 mol, per one mol of the alcohol A, from the viewpoint of storage property and low-temperature fixing ability of the toner.","The alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the alcohol B includes the same alcohols as those in Embodiment I-1 for the resin binder mentioned above (paragraphs 0028 to 0030, and the like).","The aromatic diol is contained in an amount of preferably 10% by mol or less, and more preferably 5% by mol or less, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability of the toner, and it is preferable that substantially no aromatic diol is used.

The reason why the generation of background fogging is suppressed under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal, so that hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed, and that at the same time a succinic acid derivative having a long-chain hydrocarbon group having high hydrophobicity is used as a carboxylic acid component, so that hygroscopicity is lowered.","The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group or the alkenyl group in the alkylsuccinic acid and the alkenylsuccinic acid is from 9 to 14, and preferably from 10 to 12, from the viewpoint of increasing low-temperature fixing ability, storage property, and suppression of background fogging under high-temperature, high-humidity conditions of the toner.

The neutralizing agent includes an alkali metal of lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or the like; organic bases such as ammonia, trimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, triethanolamine, and tributylamine.","In addition, the dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder can be made into a dispersion, without using an organic solvent, as in the step (1\u2032).","The step (1\u2032) is a step of forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant.","According to the process of the step (1\u2032), a resin binder can be formed into fine particles even when water is used alone without using substantially any organic solvents.","In the step (1\u2032), a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin and a nonionic surfactant are mixed, whereby a dispersion can also be prepared without using an organic solvent. In this step, a viscosity of the mixture is lowered, so that a resin binder can be formed into fine particles. This is due to the fact that a nonionic surfactant is compatible to a resin binder and a viscosity of the mixture is lowered, which results in an apparent lowering of a softening point of the resin. Utilizing this phenomenon, an apparent softening point of a resin binder that is compatible with a nonionic surfactant can be lowered to a temperature of a boiling point of water or lower, so that a dispersion prepared by dispersing a resin binder can be obtained by adding water dropwise under a normal pressure, even with a resin binder having a melting point or softening point of 100\u00b0 C. or more for the resin alone. In this method, at least water and a nonionic surfactant would be needed, so that the method can be applied to a resin insoluble to an organic solvent, and that loads on the facilities for collecting an organic solvent and maintaining operating environments are unnecessary, and a specialized apparatus that is to be needed when utilizing a mechanical means is also unnecessary, thereby having an advantage that a resin dispersion can be produced economically.","The nonionic surfactant usable in the step (1\u2032) includes, for example, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers or polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether; polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate; polyoxyethylene fatty esters such as polyethylene glycol monolaurate, polyethylene glycol monostearate, polyethylene glycol monooleate; oxyethylene\/oxypropylene block copolymers, and the like. In addition, the nonionic surfactant may be used together with an anionic surfactant or a cationic surfactant.","It is preferable to select a nonionic surfactant which has excellent compatibility with a resin binder. In order to obtain a stable dispersion of a resin binder, the nonionic surfactant has an HLB of preferably from 12 to 20, and it is more preferable to use two or more members of nonionic surfactants having different HLB, depending on the members of the resin binders. For example, in a case where a resin has a high hydrophilicity, at least one member of a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of from 12 to 18 may be used. In a case of a resin having high hydrophobicity, it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant having a low HLB, for example, one having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so and a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB, for example, one having an HLB of 14 to 20, are used together, thereby adjusting a weighted average of HLB of both the nonionic surfactants to 12 to 20. In this case, it is presumed that primarily a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so can be made compatible with the resin, and that a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB can serve to stabilize the dispersion of the resin in water.","In addition, in a case where a colorant is used, it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant is adsorbed to the colorant. By adjusting the HLB of the nonionic surfactant to the range mentioned above, the nonionic surfactant is likely to adsorb to the surface of the colorant, whereby the nonionic surfactant can be stably present in the resin binder.","When a resin binder is formed into fine particles in water under a normal pressure, the nonionic surfactant has a cloud point of preferably from 70\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 C., and more preferably from 80\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 C.","The nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 5 parts by weight or more, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of lowering a melting point of the resin binder, and the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 80 parts by weight or less, from the viewpoint of controlling the nonionic surfactant remaining in the toner. Therefore, the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably from 5 to 80 parts by weight, more preferably from 10 to 70 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 20 to 60 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of satisfying both of these.","In the step (1\u2032), upon the formation of primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant, it is desirable that the temperature inside the system is kept within a temperature calculated from a cloud point of the nonionic surfactant plus or minus 10\u00b0 C., preferably plus or minus 8\u00b0 C., more preferably plus or minus 5\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of dispersibility of the nonionic surfactant and prevention of the lowering of dispersion efficiency.","In the step (1\u2032), for example, it is preferable that an aqueous medium (preferably deionized water or distilled water) is added dropwise to a system in a state where a mixture of a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is stirred and homogeneously mixed. In a case where a colorant is used, it is preferable that a resin binder containing a colorant being made compatible with a nonionic surfactant does not separate from water.","The aqueous medium in the step (1\u2032) is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 3,000 parts by weight, more preferably from 400 to 3,000 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 800 to 3,000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of obtaining homogeneous aggregated particles in the subsequent steps.","The particle size of the primary particles containing a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin can be controlled by an amount of the nonionic surfactant, an extent of stirring, a rate of adding water, or the like. In the step (1\u2032), the rate of adding an aqueous medium to a mixture containing at least a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is preferably from 0.1 to 50 g\/min, more preferably from 0.5 to 40 g\/min, and even more preferably from 1 to 30 g\/min, per 100 g of the mixture, from the viewpoint of obtaining homogenous primary particles.","In a case where a resin binder has an acidic group such as a carboxyl group or a sulfonate group, water may be added after a part or all of the resin binder is neutralized, or while neutralizing. In a case where a resin binder having an acidic group is used, in addition to the factors of the nonionic surfactant, self-emulsifiability would be a controlling factor for the particle size of the primary particles.","A dispersant can be used for the purposes of lowering a melt viscosity and a melting point of the resin binder, and improving dispersibility of the formed primary particles. The dispersant includes, for example, water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium polyacrylate, and sodium polymethacrylate; anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium octadecyl sulfate, sodium oleate, sodium laurate, and potassium stearate; cationic surfactants such as laurylamine acetate, stearylamine acetate, and lauryl trimethylammonium chloride; amphoteric surfactants such as lauryl dimethylamine oxide; and inorganic salts such as tricalcium phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and barium carbonate. The dispersant is used in an amount of preferably 20 parts by weight or less, more preferably 15 parts by weight or less, and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of emulsion stability and detergency.","The solid content of the dispersion of the primary particles containing a resin binder obtained in the step (1) or the step (1\u2032) (hereinafter also simply referred to as primary particles) is preferably from 7 to 50% by weight, and more preferably from 7 to 40% by weight, from the viewpoint of stability of the dispersion and handling property of the dispersion in the aggregating step. The solid content includes non-volatile components such as a resin and a nonionic surfactant.","The primary particles have an average particle size of preferably from 0.05 to 3 \u03bcm, more preferably from 0.05 to 1 \u03bcm, and even more preferably from 0.05 to 0.8 \u03bcm, from the viewpoint of homogeneously aggregating the primary particles in the subsequent steps. In the present invention, the average particle size of the primary particles refers to a volume-median particle size (D), which can be measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer or the like.","Subsequently, the step of aggregating and unifying the primary particles obtained in the step (1) or the step (1\u2032) (step (2)) will be explained.","In the step (2), the solid content of the system in the aggregating step of aggregating the primary particles obtained in the step (1) or the step (1\u2032) can be adjusted by adding water to a dispersion of a resin binder, and the solid content is preferably from 5 to 50% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 30% by weight, and even more preferably from 5 to 20% by weight, in order to cause homogeneous aggregation.","The pH inside the system in the aggregating step is preferably from 2 to 10, more preferably from 2 to 9, and even more preferably from 3 to 8, from the viewpoint of satisfying both dispersion stability of a mixed solution and aggregating property of the fine particles made of a resin binder or the like.","It is preferable that the temperature inside the system in the aggregating step is a temperature equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from a softening point of a resin binder minus 70\u00b0 C. or more and equal to or lower than a softening point, from the same viewpoint.","In addition, an additive such as a colorant or a charge control agent may be previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles, or each additive may be separately dispersed in a dispersion medium such as water to prepare a dispersion, and the dispersion is mixed with primary particle s, and subjected to the aggregating step. In a case where an additive is previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles, it is preferable that the resin binder and the additive are previously melt-kneaded. In the melt-kneading, it is preferable to use an open roller-type twin-screw kneader. The open-roller twin-screw kneader is a kneader containing two rollers arranged in parallel closely to each other, wherein a heating function or a cooling function can be provided by passing a heating medium through each roller. Therefore, the open-roller type twin-screw kneader contains a melt-kneading part that is open, and also is equipped with a heat roller and a cooling roller, so that the open-roller type twin-screw kneader can easily dissipate the kneading heat generated during the melt-kneading, which is different from twin-screw extruders conventionally used.","In the aggregating step, in order to effectively carry out the aggregation, an aggregating agent can be added. As the aggregating agent, a cationic surfactant in the form of a quaternary salt, polyethyleneimine, or the like may be used as an organic aggregating agent, and an inorganic metal salt, a divalent or higher polyvalent metal complex or the like may be used as an inorganic aggregating agent. The inorganic metal salt includes, for example, metal salts such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium nitrate, barium chloride, magnesium chloride, zinc chloride, aluminum chloride, and aluminum sulfate; and inorganic metal salt polymers such as poly(aluminum chloride), poly(aluminum hydroxide), and poly(calcium sulfide).","The amount of the aggregating agent used is preferably 30 parts by weight or less, more preferably 20 parts by weight or less, and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of the environmental resistance of the toner.","Subsequently, the aggregated particles containing at least a resin binder obtained in the above-mentioned aggregating step are heated to unify (unifying step).","The temperature inside the system in the unifying step is preferably equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder \u2212(minus) 50\u00b0 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder +(plus) 10\u00b0 C., more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 45\u00b0 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point plus 10\u00b0 C., and even more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 40\u00b0 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder plus 10\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of controlling particle sizes, particle size distribution, and shapes of the intended toner, and fusibility of the aggregate particles. In addition, it is preferable that the stirring rate is a rate at which the aggregate particles are not precipitated. In the present invention, in a case where two or more kinds of resins are used as a resin binder, a softening point of a mixed resin is regarded as a softening point of the resin binder.","The unified particles obtained in the step (2) are subjected through the steps such as liquid-solid separation step such as filtration, washing step, and drying step, whereby a toner can be obtained.","In the washing step, it is preferable that an acid is used for removing metal ions on the toner surface, in order to secure satisfactory triboelectric charging properties and reliability as a toner. Also, it is preferable that the added nonionic surfactant is completely removed by washing, and it is preferable that the washing is carried out with an aqueous solution at a temperature equal to or lower than the cloud point of the nonionic surfactant. The washing is carried out preferably plural times.","In addition, in the drying step, any methods such as vibration-type fluidizing drying method, spray-drying method, freeze-drying method, or flash jet method can be employed.","The toner has a volume-median particle size (D) preferably from 1 to 10 \u03bcm, more preferably from 2 to 8 \u03bcm, and even more preferably from 3 to 7 \u03bcm. Here, the volume-median particle size (D) as used herein means a particle size at 50% counting from smaller particle sizes in a cumulative volume frequency calculated in volume percentage.","An external additive may be added to the surface of the toner. The external additive includes fine inorganic particles of silica, alumina, titanium oxide, zirconia, tin oxide, zinc oxide, and the like, fine organic particles such as fine resin particles, and the like. The surface of these fine particles may be subjected to a hydrophobic treatment. It is preferable that the external additive is added in an amount of from 0.05 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of toner particles before subjection to a treatment with the external additive.","In Embodiment II-2, the resin binder contains a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin, obtainable from the polymerization of raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for a styrenic resin.","An alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component are used as the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin, and raw material monomers for a styrenic resin are used as the above-mentioned raw material monomers for the styrenic resin, whereby hydrolytic resistance of the polycondensation resin is even further improved. This is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure has an alkyl group at a terminal, and at the same time the styrenic resin has a high hydrophobicity, so the ester groups are protected, thereby improving hydrolytic resistance of the polycondensation resin and suppressing the lowering of molecular weight.","In addition, in a chemical toner for which an additive cannot be dispersed by applying a shearing force as in a kneading-pulverization method, durability is likely to be worsened due to dispersion failure of a releasing agent, or the like, but on the other hand durability is also improved. The reason why durability is improved is presumably due to the fact that alkyl groups are adjoined to the secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto, so that hydrophilicity near the ester group is suppressed, and that at the same time a hydrophobic styrenic resin is contained, so that dispersibility of an additive such as a releasing agent is improved.","The alcohol A is contained in an amount of preferably from 10 to 100% by mol, more preferably from 12 to 80% by mol, and even more preferably from 25 to 75% by mol, of the alcohol component of the polycondensation resin, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.","In addition, the amount of the alcohol A used upon the polycondensation of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is preferably from 6 to 100 parts by weight, more preferably from 10 to 90 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 15 to 80 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component, which are the raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.","It is preferable that the alcohol component contains the alcohol B mentioned above, from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability of the toner, in the same manner as in Embodiment I-1 for the above-mentioned resin binder.","The alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably from 0 to 90% by mol, more preferably from 0.5 to 90% by mol, even more preferably from 20 to 88% by mol, and still even more preferably from 25 to 75% by mol, of the alcohol component, from the viewpoint of increasing low-temperature fixing ability of the toner.","In addition, the alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably 10 mol or less, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mol, and more preferably from 0.3 to 3 mol per one mol of the alcohol A, from the viewpoint of storage property and low-temperature fixing ability of the toner.","The alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the alcohol B includes the same alcohols as those in Embodiment I-1 for the above-mentioned resin binder (paragraphs 0028 to 0031, and the like).","The carboxylic acid component of the polycondensation resin, the polycondensation reaction of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component, the raw material monomers for the styrenic resin and addition polymerization conditions therefor, and the method for producing a composite resin are the same as those in Embodiment I-2 for the above-mentioned resin binder (paragraphs 0082 to 0104, and the like).","The composite resin may be a mixture of a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin, preferably a resin obtainable by the polymerization raw materials for a polycondensation resin and raw materials for a styrenic resin, and it is more preferable that the composite resin is a hybrid resin obtainable from a dually reactive monomer, in addition to the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin, in the same manner as in Embodiment I-1, from the viewpoint of improving storage property, hot offset resistance, and durability of the toner.","The composite resin may be a resin obtainable by polymerizing raw material monomers in the presence of a wax.","The weight ratio of the polycondensation resin to the styrenic resin, in other words, a weight ratio of the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin to the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin, i.e. raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin\/raw material monomers for a styrenic resin, is preferably from 55\/45 to 95\/5, more preferably from 60\/40 to 95\/5, and even more preferably from 70\/30 to 90\/10, because it is preferable that a continuous phase comprises the polycondensation resin, and a dispersed phase comprises the styrenic resin.","The composite resin has a softening point of preferably from 90\u00b0 to 160\u00b0 C., more preferably from 95\u00b0 to 155\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 115\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability, storage property and durability of the toner. The composite resin has a glass transition temperature of preferably from 45\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 C., more preferably from 50\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 C., and even more preferably from 58\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of low-temperature fixing ability, storage property and durability of the toner. The composite resin has an acid value of preferably from 1 to 90 mg KOH\/g, more preferably from 5 to 90 mg KOH\/g, and even more preferably from 5 to 88 mg KOH\/g, from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability and environmental stability of the toner.","According to a method including the step of forming raw materials containing the above-mentioned composite resin as a resin binder into fine particles, a toner for electrophotography which is excellent in both low-temperature fixing ability and storage property, which are counteractive properties to each other, and also having excellent hot offset resistance and durability is obtained.","In the toner, a known resin binder other than the above-mentioned composite resin, for example, a resin including a polyester, a vinyl resin such as styrene-acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, a polycarbonate, or a polyurethane may be used together within the range that would not impair the effects of the present invention. The above-mentioned composite resin is contained in an amount of preferably 30% by weight or more, more preferably 50% by weight or more, even more preferably 70% by weight or more, even more preferably 80% by weight or more, even more preferably 90% by weight or more, and even more preferably essentially 100% by weight, of the entire resin binder.","The toner may further properly contain an additive such as a colorant, a releasing agent, a charge control agent, a magnetic powder, a fluidity improver, an electric conductivity modifier, an extender pigment, a reinforcing filler such as a fibrous material, an antioxidant, an anti-aging agent, or a cleanability improver, in the same manner as in Embodiment II-1.","The toner for electrophotography of Embodiment II-2 is not particularly limited in its production method, so long as the toner is obtained by a method including the step of forming raw materials containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium into fine particles, and a specific production method thereof is the same as those in Embodiment II-1.","The toner has a volume-median particle size (D) preferably from 1 to 10 \u03bcm, more preferably from 2 to 8 \u03bcm, and even more preferably from 3 to 7 \u03bcm.

Also, it can be seen that the toner of Comparative Example 12-2 containing the polyester in which an aromatic polyhydric alcohol is used without using alcohol A is deficient in all the properties, and that the toner of Comparative Example 12-3 containing the polyester in which an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol other than an alcohol A is used is deficient in properties other than low-temperature fixing ability, while having favorable low-temperature fixing ability.","According to the present invention, the toner for electrophotography of the present invention is suitably used in developing latent images formed in electrophotography, electrostatic recording method, electrostatic printing method or the like."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
