When assembled and\/or coupled together to form interface  (e.g., the connection surface  of the first portion  is bonded (e.g., oxide bonded) to the connection surface  of the second portion , or in other words, to, e.g., form a face-to-face bonded die), the first chain-structure portion  and the second chain-structure portion  of the first and second portions , , respectively, form the testing structure .

For example, the testing structure  may be rectangular in shape (e.g., with four side), circular in shape (e.g., a single circular side), etc. Further, for example, the shape of the testing structure  may not be describable by a particular shape (e.g., in the case where, for example, the structure is shaped to conform to a region that it extends around). Still further, in one or more embodiments, the testing structure  may only occupy a portion of the apparatus  to surround specific hermetically-sealed regions that may contain moisture sensitive circuitry (see, e.g., ).

Such chain-structure segments are described herein with further detail in reference to .","Further, the testing structure  includes at least one series circuit extending from a first end to a second end around the one or more hermetically-sealed regions  and formed at the interface  (see ) of the connection surface  of the first portion  and the connection surface  of the second portion.

In one or more embodiments, each of the first portion  and the second portion  includes a substrate provided from or as a part of a wafer (e.g., a portion of any size and shape of substrate usable in wafer scale fabrication processes, such as a circular silicon wafer, a glass substrate, etc.). In other words, multiple portions may be fabricated on a wafer (e.g., the first portions on a first wafer and the second portions on a second wafer). As such, the fabrication of each of the portions may be initiated with use of a wafer substrate (e.g., a semiconductor, conductor, or insulator substrate wafer). In one or more embodiments, the wafer substrate is a doped semiconductor wafer substrate (e.g., doped to either a bulk n-type or p-type wafer), such as those used as the base substrate for microelectronic devices (e.g., substrates built in and over using one or more microfabrication process steps such as doping, ion implantation, etching, deposition of various materials, and photolithographic patterning processes). In one or more embodiments, the semiconductor wafer is a silicon wafer. However, other available types of semiconductor wafers may be used, such as, for example, a gallium arsenide wafer, a germanium wafer, a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer, etc. Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the substrate may be formed of one or more materials other than semiconductor material, such as a glass substrate, wherein the substrate includes a metal film.

The one or more layers may include the one or more circuit devices  and\/or the first and the second chain-structure portions ,  forming the testing structure . Such layers are described herein with further detail in reference to .","The first portion  and the second portion  may further include one or more contact pads , , respectively, electrically coupled to the one or more circuit devices  using one or more interconnects ,  (represented schematically with dashed lines) and located at the connection surfaces , . When the first portion  is assembled with the second portion , the contact pads ,  are electrically coupled such that the one or more circuit devices  are electrically coupled. Further, although not depicted, the apparatus  (e.g., the first portion  and\/or the second portion ) may include one or more additional interconnects extending between the circuit devices  and an outer surface of the apparatus .","As described herein, one or both of the first portion  and the second portion  may define a cavity within which the one or more circuit devices  may be located. In this embodiment, the one or more circuit devices  may be directly electrically coupled to the one or more contacts pads ,  without the use of interconnects (e.g., interconnects , ). For example, at least in one embodiment, the second portion  defines a cavity extending into the connection surface . A circuit device  may be located within the cavity and electrically coupled to the contact pads  of the first portion .","At least in one embodiment, connection surface , which may be defined at least partly by one or more layers, may include oxide material. For example, such oxide material may be oxide material formed, deposited or grown as part of one or more processing steps (e.g., oxides such as BPSG, silicon oxide, native oxide, etc.).","The one or more circuit devices , the first and the second chain-structure portions , , the one or more interconnects , , and the one or more contact pads ,  may be formed using standard microelectronic fabrication processing techniques (e.g., such as etching of materials, deposition of materials, and photolithographic patterning process steps, etc.). Various portions of first and second portions ,  may be formed during the same or different processing steps. For example, a portion of an interconnect that may be used to provide a portion of first chain-structure portion  may be formed within layer used to provide a portion of the interconnect  or contact pad . The present disclosure is not limited to any particular processing, or timing or order, of such process steps. However, some types of processing and order thereof may be beneficial over other types.","To form the apparatus , the first portion  and the second portion  are coupled together. For example, in one or more embodiments, the connection surfaces ,  may be coupled (e.g., using plasma-enhanced bonding) together to assemble the apparatus  and to form interface . In one or more embodiments, bonding the first and second portions ,  together to assemble the apparatus  may be implemented using any wafer and\/or die bonding process (e.g., bonding a wafer including the first portions with a wafer including the second portions, which also refers to the bonding of an individual die to a full wafer and the bonding of an individual die to another individual die), such as chemical bonding processes (e.g., those using adhesion promoters, etc.), high temperature bonding processes (e.g., thermal fusion bonding, etc.), hydrogen bonding processes, anodic bonding processes, and oxide bonding processes (e.g., plasma enhanced bonding, etc.). For example, use of oxide bonding permits oxide surfaces (e.g., portions of the connection surfaces ,  of the first and second portions ,  including an oxide material, such as silicon oxide) to be bonded together. Further, for example, in one or more embodiments, the connection surfaces ,  may be chemical mechanically polished or planarized to expose any conductive portions thereof (e.g., the contact pads ,  at connection surfaces , ) to be exposed. For example, when the oxide portions and the conductive portions (e.g., the first chain-structure portion  or contact pads ) located at the connection surface  (e.g., a planar surface) are aligned with the oxide portions and the conductive portions (e.g., the first chain-structure portion  or contact pads ) located at the connection surface  (e.g., a planar surface), oxide bonding may be performed. For example, oxide bonding processes may form a bond between oxide portions of the connection surfaces ,  of the first and second portions ,  without the need for adhesives or other intermediate layers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","220","240","220","222","240","242","222","242"]},"The first portion  includes one or more layers  formed on the substrate  terminating at a substantially planar connection surface  that is orthogonal to axis .

Further, the one or more layers ,  of either portion ,  may include any number of layers desired for providing one or more electrical interconnects (although not shown) extending from the one or more circuit devices  to each other or to any location within or outside of the apparatus . Still further, as described herein, the one or more circuit devices  may be located in a cavity within either of the first portion  or second portion , and as such, the one or more layers ,  may not need to provide the one or more circuit devices but may still provide the one or more electrical interconnects.","The first portion  includes a first chain-structure portion  and the second portion  includes a second-chain-structure portion . When the first portion  and the second portion  are coupled as shown in , the first-chain-structure portion  and the second-chain-structure portion  form the testing structure  (e.g., the testing structure  forms a daisy chain strand connection that weaves between the two portions that are bonded together and is located at the interface to be tested). In this embodiment, the testing structure  includes one series circuit  extending from a first end  to a second end  around a hermetically-sealed region  and formed at an interface  (perpendicular to the axis ) of the connection surface  of the first portion  and the connection surface  of the second portion .","The interface  between the connection surfaces ,  of the first and second portions ,  may include bonded oxide portions in locations other than where conductive elements are located (e.g., such as connection pads ,  of the chain-structure portions ,  described below). For example, such bonded oxide portions may be formed if an oxide bonding process is used to couple the first and second portions , .","The one or more layers  of the first portion  include one or more chain-structure segments  that form the first chain-structure portion  and the one or more layers  of the second portion  also include one or more chain-structure segments  that the form the second chain-structure portion . Each of the one or more chain-structure segments  includes at least two connection pads  located (e.g., exposed) at the connection surface  and at least one electrical interconnect  (represented schematically by dashed lines) electrically coupling the at least two connection pads . Further, each of the one or more chain-structure segments  also includes at least two connection pads  located (e.g., exposed) at the connection surface  and an electrical interconnect  (represented schematically by dashed lines) electrically coupling the at least two connection pads .","When the first portion  is coupled to the second portion  (as shown), each connection pad  of the one or more chain-structure segments  of the first portion  is electrically coupled to a connection pad  of the one or more chain-structure segments  of the second portion  to form the testing structure . In this embodiment, the testing structure  forms a single series circuit  (e.g., a daisy-chain strand connection) extending from a first end  to a second end  around at least a portion of the hermetically-sealed region  and formed at an interface  of the connection surface  of the first portion  and the connection surface  of the second portion .

In one or more embodiments, the series circuits of the testing structures described herein may extend partially around and\/or completely around the hermetically-sealed regions and lie along a plane orthogonal to an axis (e.g., axis ). For example, in one embodiment, a series circuit of a testing structure may extend completely around a hermetically-sealed region such that the first end and the second of the series circuit are located next to each other (e.g., completing a loop). Further, in one or more embodiments, a testing structure may include two or more series circuits, each of the two or more series circuits extending partially around the different sides of the hermetically-sealed areas so as when utilized together completely surround the hermetically-sealed areas along a plane orthogonal to the axis (e.g., axis )\/For example, a testing structure may include four series circuits, each of the four series circuits extending along a single different side (i.e., a different side from the other series circuits) of a square hermetically-sealed area. In effect, the four series circuits form a testing structure extending completely around the square hermetically-sealed area.","In at least one embodiment, one or more chain-structure segments may form a testing structure (e.g., including at least one series circuit) within the one or more layers of a single portion so as to, e.g., confirm or validate hermeticity within the one or more layers.

As used herein, two or more circuits \u201cinterleaved with each other\u201d may be defined as having at least a portion of one of the two or more circuits located between a portion of another of the two more circuits. For example, every other connection pad and corresponding interconnect therebetween of each of the first and second portions ,  may form the first series circuit  while the other connection pads and interconnect therebetween of each of the first and second portions ,  form the second series circuit . In other words, the odd connection pads of the first and second portions ,  may form the first series circuit  and the even connection pads may form the second series circuit .","As described herein, the testing structure may include more than two series circuits interleaved with each other.
