{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a sonar system which utilizes a gaseous cavity to eliminate hydrodynamic noise associated with turbulent boundary layers and turbulent wakes. More specifically the present invention relates to a sonar system that can be utilized on a hydrofoil marine vessel.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Marine operators would like to operate high-frequency sonar systems from high speed surface craft. These craft can operate at speeds exceeding 30 knots, but they produce bubbly wakes (high frequency noise source), have noisy propulsors, and have noisy appendages. Sonar systems towed in or operating near their wakes are adversely affected by this generation of background noise, thus limiting their effective detection range.","A similar problem exists for very fast transport ships. Some futuristic concepts have been proposed which operate at speeds up to and exceeding 100 knots. The ability of these ships to maneuver at very high speeds is limited. Consequently, the ability to detect obstacles at significant range increases the ability of these craft to avoid collisions with marine mammals, mines, and debris.","Sonar systems towed at very high speeds are affected by several noise sources which may be controllable. The turbulent flow of water over the streamlined fairing of an array generates pressure fluctuations on the fairing. Both turbulent boundary layers and turbulent wakes contribute to this type of structural excitation. The pressure fluctuations can be experienced directly on the array when the flow over the array is turbulent, or indirectly as pressure fluctuations away from the sensor face are transmitted through the structure to the array. Fluctuating cavitation bubbles and collapsing vapor bubbles can also produce large structural excitations. The best way to minimize these types of hydrodynamic noise is to maintain laminar flow over the array face and to physically isolate the array face from portions of the structure experiencing large pressure fluctuations.","The vessel propulsion system produces a large amount of noise. Components of this noise include blade tonals, cavitation bubbles, and entrained air which produce noise that can propagate through the environment to the array. Similarly, breaking bow waves, hull slapping, ship machinery noise, and other ship related noise sources can reach the array through the environment. Isolating the array from these sources by eliminating the direct acoustic path between the source and the array would greatly improve the array performance.","A mechanical path from the noise source through the array supporting structure can create another acoustic problem for the array. However, mechanical isolation techniques are advanced and can minimize these effects.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sonar system having a forward looking sonar array which is isolated from own-ship and wake noise.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a sonar system which minimizes hydrodynamic noise resulting from turbulent pressure fluctuations.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a sonar system of the present invention in a high speed marine vessel.","The foregoing objects are attained by the sonar system of the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a sonar system broadly comprises a forward looking array which is embedded in a cavitator. The cavitator generates a gaseous cavity that minimizes hydrodynamic noise resulting from turbulent pressure fluctuations.","As incorporated with a marine vessel, the present invention broadly comprises a hull, a hydrofoil suspended beneath the hull by a strut, and means for generating a laminar flow over said hydrofoil and for creating a cavity. The laminar flow generating and cavity creating means is located at a leading edge area of the hydrofoil. The sonar array is embedded in the laminar flow generating and cavity creating means.","Other details of the array system for supercavitating hydrofoils of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.","A sonar array system for use on marine vessels having supercavitating hydrofoils is provided by the present invention. The sonar array system utilizes a gaseous cavity formed in the wake of a cavitator instrumented with forward looking sonar array elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","10","2","12","10","4","14"]},"In accordance with the present invention, a cavitator  is attached to the leading edge  of the front hydrofoil  and\/or the strut . Sonar arrays  are also positioned on the leading edge  of the front hydrofoil  and strut . The cavitators  cause a cavitation induced vapor bubble  to form in the wake of each cavitator . Sonar array  is positioned to be in liquid portion in front of the vapor bubble . Each cavitator  may be a simple flat plate arranged normal to the flow of water over the hydrofoil . Alternatively, each cavitator  may be shaped like a disc, a cone, or a hemisphere, or have a streamlined shape. Each cavitator  may be axisymmetric or largely two dimensional. Each cavitator  preferably is arranged to maintain a laminar flow over the entire surface of the hydrofoil  and\/or the surfaces of the strut  until the flow separates at the base of the respective hydrofoil and\/or strut.","The sonar array  may be formed by a plurality of sonar array elements incorporated or embedded into a front surface of the cavitator . A communication means (not shown) can transfer received acoustic signals from arrays  up through strut  to sonar equipment aboard vessel . Care must be taken to guarantee that the flow over the array face is laminar. If the flow becomes turbulent prior to separation, significant edge noise may be generated at the separation point of the array. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sonar array elements are forward looking sonar array elements. The sonar array elements are embedded with sufficient density and number to enable forward looking acoustic beams.","In accordance with the present invention, the hydrofoil  and the strut  are each provided with a ventilation system . Each ventilation system  has one or more discharge nozzles  for discharging a gas or vapor in a quantity sufficient to create a gaseous cavity. For example, as shown in , one or more nozzles  may be incorporated into an upper surface  of the hydrofoil . Further, as shown in , one or more nozzles  may be incorporated into each of two opposed strut surfaces  and . The ventilation system  further includes a source of gas or vapor (not shown) and suitable ducting (not shown) for delivering the gas or vapor from the source to each of the nozzles . This cavity envelops the supporting structure and all equipment downstream of each cavitator . By maintaining laminar flow over each sonar array  and eliminating all turbulent boundary layers and attached wakes, the hydrodynamic excitation is eliminated. A baffling effect is also realized by creating a vapor shield between each sonar array  and any acoustic sources aft of the array such as a ship propulsor.","The marine vessel  is preferably a high speed surface ship. The sonar system operation relies at least in part upon the ship speed to enable generation of the gaseous cavity. A ventilation system can also be used to enhance or form this cavity.","The support strut  is preferably a cavitating support strut. As shown in , the strut  may be streamlined to minimize drag and noise production. The shielding effects of the gas bubble and mechanical isolation reduce the impact of the strut generated noise. The support strut  contains ventilation ducting (not shown) and the signal and communication means (not shown) to each array . If desired, the strut  may be extendable to increase the stand-off between each array  and the hull  and to enable complete retraction of the system into the marine vessel . Any suitable means known in the art may be used to extend and\/or retract the strut .","As can be seen from the , to enable the formation of a suitable size cavity , gas is pumped through the nozzles  in the strut  to the area just aft of each cavitator . Gas injection increases the size of the gaseous sheet for a given size cavitator. Significant ventilation rates may be required to generate large cavities at modest ship speeds. Preferably, each cavity  is inflated to envelop the entire support strut  and hydrofoil . The gas bubble which is formed aft of each cavitator , as a result of the injected air, eliminates contact of turbulent flow with the structure containing the sonar array .","With the gaseous sheet created and mechanical isolation incorporated, the direct paths between the ship noise sources and each array  are reduced, especially sources aft of the array system. The noise produced by the cavity and each cavitator are minimal because the flow separating from each cavitator is laminar (no fluctuating edge forces) and the cavity closes as large gas bubbles.","The sonar array system of the present invention minimizes the effects of hydrodynamically excited noise and reduces the acoustic and structural path between significant own ship noise sources. This enables very high speed ship operations with low array noise.","If desired, the ship hull  can be partially wetted, using the hydrofoil lift to reduce the displaced volume of the vessel. Further, the pressure side of the hydrofoil can be fully instrumented to provide increased array area.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention an array system for supercavitating hydrofoils which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
