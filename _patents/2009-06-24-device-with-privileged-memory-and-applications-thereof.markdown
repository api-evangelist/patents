title: Device with privileged memory and applications thereof
abstract: A device includes a key store memory, a rule set memory, a plurality of cryptographic clients, and a key store arbitration module. The key store memory stores a plurality of cryptographic keys and the rule set memory stores a set of rules for accessing the cryptographic keys. A cryptographic client is operable to issue a request to access a cryptographic key(s) and, when access to the cryptographic key is granted, execute a cryptographic function regarding at least a portion of the cryptographic key to produce a cryptographic result. The key store arbitration module is operable to determine whether the request to access the cryptographic key is valid; when the request is valid, interpret the request to produce an interpreted request; access the rule set memory based on the interpreted request to retrieve a rule of the set of rules; and grant access to the cryptographic key in accordance with the rule.

No. 61\/094,541.","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","1. Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates to generally devices that include memory and more particularly to securing access to the memory within the device.","2. Description of Related Art","The desire to keep video content of DVD's (and\/or other copyrighted or proprietary information that is stored in a digital format) secure from unauthorized use (e.g., unauthorized copying, distribution, etc.) is driven by a sector of the population that places little to no value on the intellectual properties rights of others. As such, the battle between creating security systems for digital information and the hackers that attempt to break them continues.","This battle is intensifying with the integration of electronic device features being implemented on a single device (e.g., computer with DVD functionality) and is further intensified by video processing hardware being implemented as stand-alone system on a chip (SOC) devices. In many instances, the video processing hardware SOC uses an operating system that allows end users to write their own applications, which means that the user's application may share the same processors and memory space as the security system. This makes the security operations vulnerable. To reduce the vulnerability, video processing hardware needs to be constrained to performing only specific intended types of cryptographic operations.","In addition, video processing devices, which include the video processing hardware SOC, are embedded with licensed secret keys for compliance with one or more of a plurality of video application standards (e.g., BD, DTCP, CPRM, Cable Card, etc.). Typically, such a video application standard includes a revocation mechanism whereby, if a secret key value is made public, the security functions of the compromised devices are revoked and the devices are rendered inoperable. As such, it is highly desirable that the secret keys are stored in such a way that they are not accessible to the firmware of the device (in order to avoid revocation). This is typically done by storing the secret keys in a one-time programmable (OTP) memory.","While using OTP memory has become a primary mechanism for storing secret keys within video processing devices, it is not a failsafe approach. For example, a security issue arises when multiple cryptographic clients (e.g., a hardware block that performs a specific cryptographic algorithm such as RSA, TSD, 1394, DMA, etc . . . ) may issue read or write requests to the OTP memory asynchronously and that the requests are not atomic. In addition, as a result of granularity associated with OTP memory large key values are partitioned into smaller blocks, which have special read\/write rules that are imposed on every block. Thus, it becomes necessary to associate a macro level restriction on cryptographic clients down to every micro level block access performed by the client.","As a specific example, the RSA algorithm can perform a 2048 bit RSA operation, which requires 32 reads of 64 bit blocks from the key store to assemble the exponent. If a key is intended to be used as a 2048 bit exponent, then every 64 bit block read must be associated with the intended purpose of the key; i.e. blocks have to have an attribute indicating which cryptographic client is permitted to access a particular block associated with a larger key.","Another security problem is that cryptographic strength often relies on using large keys (e.g., up to 2048 bits for RSA or 256 bit for some AES modes). However, if the large key is used one 64 bit block at a time by a weaker cryptographic client, then large keys may be attacked 64 bits (or less) a time. Yet another way to attack large keys is to overwrite portions of the key with 0's, and then perform the intended operations, but with the remainder of the weakened key. Every time a portion of the key is decimated in this way, the remainder can be determined because portions of the key are now known.","Still further, some cryptographic clients have the ability to perform operation at various levels of strength; for example, the RSA can be configured for variable size modulus or 3DES can be degraded into a DES operation. This can be exploited by a hacker to perform weaker operations and thereby attack large keys with degraded operations. Even further, some cryptographic clients use control words (CWs) and initial vectors (IVs) within the security operations. The integrity of a security system may be attacked by using a CW as an IV in an operation where the clear text and the CW are known, which could be used to reveal the CW value.","Another important aspect of maintaining the integrity of cryptographic operations is controlling the destination of the cryptographic operation results. For example, content exported from the SOC poses a far greater risk than content which is retained within the SOC. Yet another mode of attack involves using a key, a CW or an IV to decrypt content instead of encrypting the content. For example the intention may be to encrypt content however a hacker may use a key store value to decrypt the content.","In addition to the threat of hackers, the security of the secure content information is at risk from unauthorized public disclosure. For example, if a disgruntled employee posts the algorithm and location of the keys on the Internet, the security of the algorithm is lost. As such, the risk to security systems is not just from outsider breaking the security of the algorithm, but also from an insider intentionally compromising the integrity of the security system.","Therefore, a need exists for a security device architecture that at least partially overcomes one or more of the above mentioned security issues.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26","24","26","28","30","10","24","26","24","26","28","30"]},"The processing module  may be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, micro-controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and\/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and\/or digital) based on hard coding of the circuitry and\/or operational instructions.

Further note that, the memory element stores, and the processing module executes, hard coded and\/or operational instructions corresponding to at least some of the steps and\/or functions illustrated in .","In an example of operation, one or more of the IO interfaces receives an instruction to display a video file.

Note that the one or more of the IO interfaces  and\/or  may receive the video file. The video file is encrypted using a particular encryption program and one or more cryptographic keys as prescribed by one or more video standards.","In this example, the processing module  coordinates the retrieval of the video file from the main memory , the hard disk and\/or flash memory , the IO interface  and\/or , and\/or other source. The encrypted video file may include video data, audio data, video graphics data and\/or any other type of data requiring security.

The most secure class allows access to the system memory (e.g., main memory  and\/or the hard disk and\/or flash memory ) and to IO devices via the IO interfaces  and ; allows access to the graphics memory  (e.g., frame buffer); and allows access to the secure memory location.

Note that the adjacent rule field more than 1 bit to indicate a range of adjacent locations (e.g., 5 bits to provide 32 adjacent locations). For example, instead of the result or an operation being permitted to be written to just the next (i.e. adjacent) location the rule has extra bits allocated that define the permission to write the result to the next N blocks (i.e. a plurality of adjacent locations).

For instance, the OTP block includes an indicator stored with certain of the Rules in the Rule Store to indicate whether that Rule is to be repeated to load it in other locations in the Key Store ladder. Once again, this obviates the requirement of having an OTP step for every location in the Key Store ladder.","In a further embodiment, an Encrypt\/Decrypt rule may be used. In particular, a pair of bits are added to each Rule which signify that the client can encrypt and decrypt (00), that the client can do one of encrypt and decrypt (1,0) and (0,1), and that the client can copy, but not encrypt or decrypt, the result to another location in the Key Store.","As may be used herein, the terms \u201csubstantially\u201d and \u201capproximately\u201d provides an industry-accepted tolerance for its corresponding term and\/or relativity between items. Such an industry-accepted tolerance ranges from less than one percent to fifty percent and corresponds to, but is not limited to, component values, integrated circuit process variations, temperature variations, rise and fall times, and\/or thermal noise. Such relativity between items ranges from a difference of a few percent to magnitude differences. As may also be used herein, the term(s) \u201ccoupled to\u201d and\/or \u201ccoupling\u201d includes direct coupling between items and\/or indirect coupling between items via an intervening item (e.g., an item includes, but is not limited to, a component, an element, a circuit, and\/or a module) where, for indirect coupling, the intervening item does not modify the information of a signal but may adjust its current level, voltage level, and\/or power level. As may further be used herein, inferred coupling (i.e., where one element is coupled to another element by inference) includes direct and indirect coupling between two items in the same manner as \u201ccoupled to\u201d. As may even further be used herein, the term \u201coperable to\u201d indicates that an item includes one or more of power connections, input(s), output(s), etc., to perform, when activated, one or more its corresponding functions and may further include inferred coupling to one or more other items. As may still further be used herein, the term \u201cassociated with\u201d, includes direct and\/or indirect coupling of separate items and\/or one item being embedded within another item. As may be used herein, the term \u201ccompares favorably\u201d, indicates that a comparison between two or more items, signals, etc., provides a desired relationship. For example, when the desired relationship is that signal  has a greater magnitude than signal , a favorable comparison may be achieved when the magnitude of signal  is greater than that of signal  or when the magnitude of signal  is less than that of signal .","The present invention has also been described above with the aid of method steps illustrating the performance of specified functions and relationships thereof. The boundaries and sequence of these functional building blocks and method steps have been arbitrarily defined herein for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries and sequences can be defined so long as the specified functions and relationships are appropriately performed. Any such alternate boundaries or sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention.","The present invention has been described above with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the performance of certain significant functions. The boundaries of these functional building blocks have been arbitrarily defined for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries could be defined as long as the certain significant functions are appropriately performed. Similarly, flow diagram blocks may also have been arbitrarily defined herein to illustrate certain significant functionality. To the extent used, the flow diagram block boundaries and sequence could have been defined otherwise and still perform the certain significant functionality. Such alternate definitions of both functional building blocks and flow diagram blocks and sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. One of average skill in the art will also recognize that the functional building blocks, and other illustrative blocks, modules and components herein, can be implemented as illustrated or by discrete components, application specific integrated circuits, processors executing appropriate software and the like or any combination thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 16"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
