{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of interest has been in user data privacy as users engage with other users, conduct various transactions or utilize different services via one or more communication networks. For example, many devices are equipped with various applications and sensors including cameras, microphones, positioning systems, gyroscopes and the like that enable them to detect the device location and position, acquire images and sound and other contextual data, which can be requested for sharing by other users and\/or service providers. Unfortunately, sharing user data with other users and\/or service providers may reveal personal information about the user that could compromise user privacy, user data and\/or jeopardize user anonymity. Further, other users and\/or service providers may send data to a user device which the user may wish not to accept.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for users to manage data sharing on a user device.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises determining one or more requests for a transmission or a reception of one or more data items at a device. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, a time delay in the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items. The method further comprises determining to monitor during the time delay for one or more inputs specifying at least one operation with respect to the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor; and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to determine one or more requests for a transmission or a reception of one or more data items at a device. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a time delay in the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items. The apparatus is further caused to determine to monitor during the time delay for one or more inputs specifying at least one operation with respect to the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause an apparatus to cause, at least in part, a time delay in the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items. The apparatus is further caused to determine to monitor during the time delay for one or more inputs specifying at least one operation with respect to the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for determining one or more requests for a transmission or a reception of one or more data items at a device. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, a time delay in the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items. The apparatus further comprises means for determining to monitor during the time delay for one or more inputs specifying at least one operation with respect to the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (or derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of the claim.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program are disclosed for users to manage data sharing on a user device. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term application programming interface (API) refers to a particular set of rules and specifications that a calling software application can follow to access and make use of the services and resources provided by the application, device, operating system, etc. Although various embodiments are described with respect to application programming interfaces (APIs), it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other protocols, instruction sets, rule bases, definitions, functions, libraries, object classes, data structures, procedure calls, web services and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Further, aside from the annoying aspects of tracking and\/or spam which may result, another concern is that criminals can access (e.g., unauthorized request, reception and\/or data mining of) identifying information which can cause serious harm to the user and\/or user device data, security, privacy integrity. Furthermore, as users often utilize different applications and\/or services (e.g., media player, internet browser, GPS, navigation, social networking and the like), these applications and\/or services collect, transmit and\/or share many different types of data related to the user and\/or user device. For examples, one or more applications and\/or services may determine data on one or more user activity; for example, what kind of music the user is interested in (e.g., buys, listens to, etc.), what websites the user visits, what keywords the user searches on, who are user's friends in social and\/or online services, and the like. As mentioned earlier, such applications and\/or services collect and\/or share user data when the user utilizes one or more of the applications and\/or services. However, information on the data collection and\/or the sharing are not clearly declared, shown and\/or explained to the user (e.g., risks, benefits, necessity, timing, source, destination\/termination point, etc.) and the user does not have a user friendly option for managing the collection and\/or sharing of the user data. In other cases, such data collection and\/or sharing can be performed as background processes that are not shown or indicated to the user. As result, a user may not be aware of when and to what extent applications are transmitting and\/or receiving information or data.","As a result, for example, such issues can affect the user and\/or the user experience by negatively impacting user trust in the applications and\/or the services (e.g., less trust when the user does not know exactly what user data are collected and\/or are to be shared with one or more unknown entities and for what purposes). Moreover, the user experience and\/or trust can be negatively impacted if the user cannot ascertain one or more risks and\/or benefits of allowing the collection and\/or the sharing of the user data. Conversely, collectors of the user data claim that the data can provide for improved e-commerce, user experience, customer service, products, services, and can result in further customized services and\/or products for a specific user or group of users. For example, a user requesting from a service provider for a listing for a coffee-shop near the user's current location can benefit if the service provider was able to substantially automatically (e.g., without user input) access, ascertain and\/or receive location information of the user (e.g., determine the location of the user), then the service provider could provide one or more coffee-shop location listings near the user's location without the user needing to determine\/input any user location information.","In some applications and\/or user devices, there are user\/data privacy policies\/filters, which apply one or more user and\/or predefined settings to the user and\/or user device data sharing. However, such implementations generally provide little or no visibility to the user as to what type of data are being collected, who\/what is the requesting source (e.g., an application, a service provider, a data mining application, etc.) and whom will the data be send to and\/or shared with. Some of the applications provide some notification to the user, but it can be encoded in some computer language unfamiliar to the user and\/or can be of such complexity that the user cannot readily ascertain its meaning and possible impacts on the user and\/or user device data.","In addition, privacy policies\/settings may be specific to an application, a group of applications, a service, a group of services, a device, a system, or a combination thereof. As one example, one privacy policy may be specific to one software application, while another privacy policy may be specific to another software application. As another example, a privacy policy may be specific to a group of services that are considered as advertising services. Also, as another example, there may be a privacy policy specific to a device with a GPS sensor and another privacy policy specific to a device without the GPS sensor such that the privacy policy may be different depending on the capability of the device. User settings related to privacy are potentially problematic in terms of user experience. This is because the user may not be aware of differences between applications (for example, several applications doing the same thing), plug-in architectures between applications (the privacy preferences of a plug-in would actually be preferences for the host applications) and different types of prompts and indications by different, potentially third party applications. With growth of online user activity and a growing combination of privacy and\/or security policies that a user may have to know about, understand, setup and monitor, it can be a daunting task for a user to continuously manage user and\/or user data privacy and sharing processes ongoing on a user device.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability for a user to manage data sharing on a user device. More specifically, the system  detects when a user device is receiving and\/or transmitting information and then introduces a time delay during which the user can take some action with respect to the information. For example, the information transmission or reception can be delayed to enable the user to identify the application, data, information, etc. that is being exchanged and then determine whether to allow the exchange to take place. In one embodiment, to assist the user in taking such action, the system  can render a user interface or user interface element (e.g., a timeline) that can illustrate the components (e.g., the originating application or node, the terminating application or node, the data items, etc.) involved in the exchange as well as some indicator to illustrate the progress of the time delay (e.g., an animated timeline, a timer, etc.). In this way, the system  can present the user with sufficient information to control or manage the information or data that is to be transmitted or received at the user device, thereby enhancing information privacy and\/or security.","According to one embodiment, the system  determines to present to and enable a user to manage one or more requests for sharing data associated with a user and\/or a user device UE  (e.g., transmit from and\/or receive at a user device) from one or more applications  and\/or one or more services , For example, an application  or a services  may request to retrieve data maintained in data storage  as associated with a user and\/or the user device UE , such that this data may be shared with one or more other applications, one or more other users, one or more other user devices (e.g., UE ) and\/or one or more services . The data may include various types of data including a user profile information, digital media in a user device, user calendar information, context information of the user, user location, web browsing history, social networking activities and contacts and etc. Also, one or more applications  and\/or one or more services  may request to acquire and share the data associated with a user and\/or a user device by way of one or more sensors  of the device. Further, the one or more applications  may request from and\/or send data to the one or more services , one or more other users and\/or one or more other sources available via communication network . Furthermore, the services platform , other network entities and\/or other users may request and\/or send data to the user device (e.g., targeted to the one or more applications  and\/or the user device UE ).","As shown in , the system  comprises user equipment (UEs) -(also collectively referred to as UEs or UE ) having connectivity to one or more service platforms -(also collectively referred to as services platform ) via a communication network . The services platform  include one or more services --, which can provide one or more services. Further, the UE  and the services platform  may also have connectivity to a third party policy provider . The services platform  may provide various services to the user device, including information processing services, data retrieval services and the like. By way of example, the services may be in the form of one or or more executable web services or network applications, which may be executed independently of or in connection with one or more applications  of the UE . The UE  may also include a data sharing manager  (e.g., respective data sharing managers -of the UEs -) (DSM ) that can communicate with the UE applications , the services platform , other user devices, the third party policy provider  and\/or other communication network  components. It is noted that in certain instances, the service platform  and third party policy provider  may be integrated. Also, the DSM  may be implemented as an independent module, within the UE , within the service platform , within the third party policy provider  and\/or within any other component connected via the communication network .","The DSM  may be utilized to enable a user to manage one or more data sharing requests from one or more applications, one or more services platforms  and\/or one or more other users. The one or more applications may be one of the UE applications , which may include various types of software application in the UE . By way of example, if the user device is the UE , the application that requests for the data may be the UE application or an application of another device such as the UE application of the UE . The service that requests for the data may include at least one of the services -in the services platform , which are accessible via the communication network . Further, the UE  may be connected to a sensor , which is used to collect various types of sensor data. The sensor may include a location sensor such as a global positioning system (GPS) device, a sound sensor, a speed sensor, a brightness sensor, etc. The UE  may also be connected to a data storage medium  (e.g., data storage media -) to store various types of data and applications, for example, sensor data, user data, privacy data, application data, executable applications, device data, network data, links to data stored remotely, and the like.","For example, the DSM  receives one or more requests (e.g., from one or more applications and\/or one or more services platforms ) when data is to be transmitted from and\/or received at the UE . Further, the DSM  determines one or more metadata related, at least in part, to the data, source of the one or more requests, destination (e.g., termination point) of the data, reasons for the one or more requests, one or more risks and\/or benefits for sharing the data and the like. Furthermore, the metadata is presented via a user interface on the UE  (e.g., one or more visual presentation renderings) to the user of the UE . Moreover, the DSM  is capable of providing for the user to perform, at least in part, one or more actions on the data to be transmitted from and\/or received at the UE .","In one embodiment, the DSM  determines one or more requests to transmit data (e.g., user data, application data, device data, etc.) from a user device (e.g., UE ) to one or more other user devices (e.g., UE ) and\/or to one or more service platforms . The one or more requests may be generated, at least in part, by the applications , one or more other user devices UE and\/or one or more service platforms . For example, one or more applications  (e.g., a navigation application) attempt to send one or more data items (e.g., user locations) to one or more services platforms  (e.g., a navigation service provider). Further, the DSM  determines one or more requests for transmission of the one or more data items. In another embodiment, one or more services platforms  (e.g., a search services provider) requests one or more data items (e.g., user profile) and one or more applications (e.g., user profile register) attempt to cause one or more transmissions of the data items wherein the DSM  determines the one or more transmission requests. In scenarios similar to the above scenarios, the DSM  may determine and present one or more metadata, one or more risks, one or more benefits, one or more indicators, one or more user actions and the like related to the one or more data items for sharing whereby","In another embodiment, the DSM  of UE  determines one or more requests to for the UE  to receive one or more data items (e.g., user data, application data, device data, service data, etc.) from one or more other user devices UE and\/or one or more services platforms , which may be in response to one or more requests for the UE  for one or more data items. For example, one or more services platform  (e.g., a navigation service provider) may attempt to send one or more data items (e.g., map information) to UE  wherein the DSM  determines one or more requests for reception of the one or more data items. In another embodiment, one or more other users and\/or user devices (e.g., a family member) may wish to send one or more data items (e.g., a music file, a picture, etc.) to the UE  wherein the DSM  determines the one or more reception requests. In scenarios similar to the above scenarios, the DSM  may determine and present one or more metadata, one or more risks, one or more benefits, one or more indicators, one or more user actions and the like related to the one or more data items for sharing.","Further, by employing the DSM  the user and\/or UE  may further ascertain value, necessity, source, reason, risk, benefit, terminating point (destination), intended use, and the like information related to sharing one or more data items via a user device UE . In one embodiment, the DSM  presents this information to the user via graphical renderings in a user interface of the UE . For example, the DSM  can visualize the information transfer process as a \u201cpipeline\u201d whereby information is animated to \u201cflow\u201d from originating applications or nodes to terminating applications or nodes. The rate of \u201cflow\u201d can be timed to correspond with a pre-configured time delay during which the user can act on the pending information transfer. It is contemplated that any visualization, animation, theme, graphics, etc. can be used to represent the information transfer and\/or its components. In one embodiment, if the user takes no action during the time delay, the system  can enable the information transfer to proceed. In other embodiments, the system  can cancel the transfer if no user action is taken. In another embodiment, the user can click or select renderings of data items of the information exchange to view additional information (e.g., identification of the item, risks, benefits, etc.), or take action (e.g., cancel, allow, introduce a further delay, etc.) with respect to the item.","In one embodiment, the system  determines an intended use of the data item to be shared by one or more applications and\/or services platform based on determined metadata and\/or privacy policy settings, data items associated therewith, local data or a combination thereof. For example, if the request for data items is to provide information in relation to an advertisement service (e.g., a cookie or tracking code), the DSM  may, at least in part, determine one or more risks associated with such data items and, for example, even restrict and\/or suggest to restrict access to the local data. This may be because the advertising service may be considered a stranger or an unknown service that the user does not feel comfortable sharing much of their information about; thus policy settings for this service could enforce restricted access, an error code, a message\/notification\/indicator prompting the user for action.","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , the privacy management platform , the service platform  and third party policy provider communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["109","109","201","203","205","207","209","211","213","215","201","109","217","115","115"],"i":["a","n. "]},"As mentioned, privacy policy data indicates specific privacy policy settings and what data is eligible for return in response to a request for local data by a particular application of the device (e.g., an API call). The local database may contain various local data, including that acquired by the device or that available for acquisition and storage to the database by way of one or more sensors -. In addition, the privacy policy object database may store the various objects as acquired via the data module  from a third party policy service provider . As mentioned previously, the objects may be associated with specific policies maintained in the policy database . The data defines various instructions for enabling visual, audible or other indicators to be executed by a device in response to a policy setting. By way of example, the policy execution rules  may designate or supply the graphic data, sound data, interface media resources, user interface code (like JavaScript or Qt Meta-Object Language (QML)), or a combination thereof required to implement a specific indicator at the user device.","It is noted, therefore, that the privacy policy data is associated with requisite data and\/or instructions (e.g., privacy policy objects data ) for affecting operation of the device (playing of a sound, presentment of an icon, etc.), responsive to a request for local data by an application.","In one embodiment, the alert module  receives notice of a request for data sharing by one or more applications, one or more other user devices and\/or one or more services platform . The one or more applications may be an application (e.g., UE application ) in the user device (e.g., UE ) or another device. The services platform may be any type of service, including social networking services, digital media services, etc. The requested data may include context data, user identity data, user profile data, etc. The requested data may also include media data in the user device. The context data may include location information, sensor data, user calendar data, time, weather, etc. The location information may also be the sensor data that is obtained via a location sensor such as the GPS device. Upon determining one or more requests, the alert module  notifies a data module  of the request. In certain embodiments, the alert module  is triggered when an application  or a service attempts to access a one or more data items -for further determining or generating local data ","The data module  retrieves data from the privacy policy database to determine a specified privacy setting or action to be taken. In addition, the data module  determines one or more privacy policy objects from the object database that are to be associated with the local data . It is noted also that the data module  also manages various types of data, as maintained in the various databases -, and also is capable of determining elements within a data. Based on the determined privacy action, the data module  alerts the enforcement module , which further initiates execution of the various other modules (e.g., communication module  or presentation module ) with respect to a request for data sharing. Initiation of the action associated with the privacy policy data , policy objects or local data is performed in connection with an enforcement module .","In one embodiment, the communication module  manages communication of data among the UE , other user devices, the services platform  and the third party policy provider . The communication module  also manages communication of signals (e.g., a request, a command) that are communicated among the UE , other user devices, the service platform  and the third party policy provider .","The communication module  may also be configured to generate a prompt of notification to the user regarding the specific privacy policy data , local data or a combination thereof. For example, the communication module  may process or facilitate processing of the one or more policy objects to cause the UE  to generate an on screen message, play an audio cue, display an icon, adapt a color, hue or transparency of information presented to the display of UE , or any other prompt in response to one or more requests for data sharing. Operating in connection with the enforcement module , the communication module can also be set to deny sharing of any data altogether and request an error code be returned by the communication module .","In certain embodiments, the presentation module  causes one or more presentations of one or more requests for sharing data. The presentation module , possibly in conjunction with one or more other UE  applications, construct and present, for example, a graphical flow of data being shared (e.g., transmitted and\/or received) via the UE . The presentation module  may also operate in connection with the communication module  to enable adjusting of how data is presented to the display with respect to amount of data being shared (e.g., transmitted and\/or received) such as to make it clear and understandable to the user. This may include adjusting the granularity or level of detail of information.","In one embodiment, the data module  may associate the shared data with content associated with one or more sources and\/or one or more destinations of the shared data. For example, if the shared data is related to location information of the user device, the source of the request for sharing the data (e.g., an advertising service) and the destination of the shared data (e.g., a merchant server) are indicated in the presentation to the user.","In one embodiment, the identity management module  determines and manages various identities including identities of users, identities of applications and application providers\/venders as well as identities of the devices (e.g., UE ). As such, the identity management module  determines identities of the applications, the services, devices, the users, the system, etc. such that appropriate privacy policy may be used depending on their identities. In addition, the identity management module can also keep tabs on which applications have requested privacy policy data , and use that information for impacting the user experience. This may include executing, at the user device, a sound to be played, icon to be generated, etc. per execution of the modules that perform these functions (e.g., communication module ).","In another embodiment, user input module  determines one or more inputs by the user related to the presentation of the information on data sharing. For example, the user can select, highlight and\/or touch (e.g., on a touch sensitive display) one or more presented icons\/indicators in order to view contextual information (e.g., source, destination, metadata, actual data, etc.) about the data targeted for sharing. In another example, the user may select one or more icons representing one or more data targeted for sharing and perform one or more actions on the data items (e.g., move along a time line, stop the progress, pause progress, cancel the sharing and the like).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 9","FIG. 1"],"b":"19"},"In step  of process , the data sharing manager (DSM)  determines one or more requests for a transmission or a reception of one or more data items at a device. In one embodiment, one or more requests may be initiated by one or more applications  (e.g., a map application, a search application, web browser, etc.) and\/or by one or more services platforms  (e.g., an e-commerce server, an advertising service, a coupon service, etc.) for the user and\/or the UE  to transmit one or more user data items. For example, a search application on UE  and\/or a service platform  providing search services may request user location information so that the search service can, at least in part, utilize the location information and return one or more relevant results. In another embodiment, one or more requests may be initiated by one or more applications  (e.g., a map application, a search application, web browser, etc.) and\/or by one or more services platforms  (e.g., an e-commerce server, an advertising service, a coupon service, etc.) for the UE  to receive one or more data items.

In one embodiment, the time delay is determined based, at least in part, on the type of the one or more data items, source of the one or more data items, destination of the one or more data items, whether the one or more data items are to be transmitted or are to be received by the UE , status of the one or more data items (e.g., urgent, important, low priority, etc.). For example, a data item to be transmitted by the UE  to a service platform  may need to be sent within 60 seconds in order for the data item to be useful and\/or utilized.","In step , the data sharing manager (DSM)  determines to monitor during the time delay for one or more inputs specifying at least one operation with respect to the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items. In one embodiment, a user may choose to take one or more actions on one or more data items, whether to be transmitted or received, before the transmission or reception of the data item. For example, a user may choose to delay, pause, stop, cancel the transmission or reception of one or more data items.","In step , the data sharing manager (DSM)  causes, at least in part, an initiation of the at least one operation to (1) alter the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items; (2) generate at least one notification with respect to the one or more data items, the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items, or a combination thereof; or (3) a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the DSM  and\/or one or more applications  can affect the transmission and\/or reception of one or more data items, for example, by delaying, pausing, stopping, cancelling, postponing, and the like, of the one or more data items. In another embodiment, one or more notifications can be presented to the user indicating one or more requests for transmission and\/or reception of one or more data items. The indicators can be represented by one or more different user interface elements such as an icon, a bubble, a message window and the like. Further, the indicators may be presented along a timeline showing a progress from one or more sources to one or more destinations. For example, a notification can indicate that an application on UE  is attempting to transmit its version status to a services platform  (e.g., a software vendor) and seek a possible update.","In another example, a social networking service is requesting to send one or more updates (e.g., contact updates) to one or more applications on the UE . The notification may include an icon, a sound, haptic feedback, a change in color of an icon, etc. Also, the DSM  may be configured to determine at least one source of the data item such that the notification is generated to represent that source. For example, if the data item is related to location of the user device (e.g., GPS sensor), then an icon representative of this source is presented at the UE  user interface. It is noted that presentation of the at least one notification is not limited to visual presentation to a display, but also includes the execution of a sound, activation of a light (e.g., flickering), performance of a vibratory movement of the device, or the like.","In step , the data sharing manager (DSM)  determines metadata associated with the one or more data items, the transmission or the reception of the one or more data items, or a combination thereof and  cause, at least in part, a presentation of the metadata in the at least one notification. In one embodiment, metadata may be associated and presented along with the one or more notifications, the one or more requests and the one or more data items which are to be transmitted and\/or received. For example, a notification can indicate to user on UE that a personal electronic business card is being requested by user and\/or UE . Further, the metadata can identify the user and\/or UE , whether the user and\/or UE are registered (e.g., in UE contact list) within the UE . In another example, a notification and associated metadata can indicate the transmission and\/or the reception medium (e.g., via a near filed communication (NFC) channel, via a cellular channel, via Bluetooth\u00ae, etc.).","Moreover, the metadata can include information indicating, at least in part, one or more potential benefits and\/or risks related to transmission and\/or reception of the one or more data items. For example, the metadata can indicate that sharing user location information can reveal (e.g., possible risk) user's location to other users and\/or service platforms while it can provide for a better search results (e.g., possible benefit). In another example, the metadata can indicate that sharing personal information (e.g., phone number, address, bank account information, credit card information, financial information, etc.) on a social networking site can be risky. In another example, the metadata can indicate that receiving one or more data items from a service platform  can update an old version of a software regularly utilized by the user (e.g., indicate the benefit for the user).","In step  of process  in , the data sharing manager (DSM)  causes, at least in part, a presentation of one or more renderings of the transmission or the reception of the data at the device, the time delay, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, indicators of and\/or progress of the transmission and\/or reception of the one or more data items are presented along a timeline. For example, one or more indicators (e.g., icons, bubbles, etc.) may show one or more requests for transmission and\/or reception of one or more data items. Further, the one or more indicators may be shown along a timeline, in a list, and or via other methods wherein the user can view and\/or interact with the one or more data item indicators (e.g., pause, stop, cancel, recall, etc.). In another embodiment, the presentation of the indicators and\/or metadata include, at least in part, information related to one or more sources and\/or or one or more terminating points for the one or more data items. For example, the presentation may indicate that a \u201cdata item \u201d has originated from application on the UE  and is intended to be transmitted to services platform . In another example, the presentation may indicate that a \u201cdata item \u201d has originated from services platform and is intended for application on the UE . In another embodiment, the one or more applications  and\/or the one or more services platform  include one or more cloud computing components.","In step , the data sharing manager (DSM)  determines to apply the at least one operation to one or more subsequent transmissions, one or more subsequent receptions, or a combination thereof of (1) the one or more data items; and\/or (2) one or more other data items that are at least substantially similar to the one or more data items. In one embodiment, the DSM  and\/or one or more applications  may create and\/or maintain one or more lists of one or more previous data items for sharing the and operations (e.g., allow, stop, pause, cancel, refuse, recall, etc.) associated with the transmission and\/or the reception of the one or more data items, which operations the UE  may apply to substantially similar one or more subsequent data item transmission and\/or reception. For example, if a user previously stopped transmission of one or more data items of type secret, then the UE  may stop transmission of one or more subsequent data items of type secret. In another example, if a user previously accepted from a services platform  an update to a browser application, then the UE  may accept reception of at least one subsequent such update from the services platform .","In step , the data sharing manager (DSM)  determines at least one data type of the one or more data items and determines a duration of the time delay based, at least in part, on the at least one data type. In one embodiment, data type may be identified as urgent, high priority, low priority, private, confidential, secret, essential, and the like. Further, the time delay (e.g., before a data item is transmitted and\/or received at UE ) may be based, at least in part, on the identified data type. For example, if the type is identified as low priority then a longer time delay may be assigned to it and may be placed in a lower priority in a list of data items to be acted upon by the user and\/or the UE . In another example, if a data item is of type urgent, then it may be assigned a shorter time delay and moved to the top of the list to be acted upon by the user and\/or the UE . In another example, if a data item is identified as secret and\/or essential, then the progress of the transmission and\/or the reception may be paused until the user and\/or the UE  has acted upon it (e.g., review and\/or approve to send or receive).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5D","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 5A"],"b":["501","101","503","505","507","509","511","1","1","511","505"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["520","523","527","521","525","521"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5C","b":["540","541","543","545","547","549","551","553"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5D","b":["560","101","561","1","563","567","565","565"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","601","603","1","605","607","609"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","701","703","705","707"]},"The processes described herein for managing data sharing may be advantageously implemented via software, hardware, firmware or a combination of software and\/or firmware and\/or hardware.

The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information, shifting positions of units of information, and combining two or more units of information, such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR, exclusive OR (XOR), and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions, such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor , such as a sequence of operation codes, constitute processor instructions, also called computer system instructions or, simply, computer instructions.

Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus  is a non-volatile (persistent) storage device , such as a magnetic disk, optical disk or flash card, for storing information, including instructions, that persists even when the computer system  is turned off or otherwise loses power.","Information, including instructions for managing data sharing, is provided to the bus  for use by the processor from an external input device , such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user, or a sensor.

In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments, a communication interface  is a cable modem that converts signals on bus  into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented.

The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like, or any combination thereof.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, any other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP .
