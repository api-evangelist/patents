Description of the Related Art","Known networks disadvantageously generally require a dedicated or central control node established apriori for managing resources in and access to the network, in addition to inflexible methods tied to the use of such an apriori infrastructure. IEEE 802.11 standard and many other standard Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) use Carrier Sense Multiple Access\/Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA) technology. The collision avoidance mechanism employed by CSMA\/CA adopts a random back-off period prior to each transmission. The random nature of the back-off reduces but does not eliminate the probability of collisions. In order to detect and recover from collisions, an acknowledgment mechanism must be used with each transmitted message; and for each retransmit attempt, the back-off period is randomly selected from an expanded contention time window using a binary exponential back-off scheme. Many published studies have shown that these random back-off and collision recovery schemes significantly compromise the performance of CSMA\/CA WLANs in terms of access delay, delay jitter, and network throughput particularly as the number of stations and offered load increases. There is a need to for a more flexible and self-forming network and methods associated therewith that avoid the aforementioned drawbacks.","Embodiments of the present invention present Decentralized Deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) Media Access Control (MAC) for CSMA\/CA Based Mobile Wireless LANs (DQMAC) (also referred to as D2MAC), a purely decentralized method to improve upon CSMA\/CA Medium Access Control systems. It allows any number of mobile stations to self-organize and collaborate in managing the resources of a common channel in order to support dynamic reservation of periodic Contention Free Periods (CFP) to provide deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) for admitted traffic. In this scheme, each CFP is assigned to a specific station and the channel bandwidth is partitioned into periodic non-contiguous contention and contention free periods, or time slots. In addition to supporting deterministic QoS, DQMAC contention free periods may be exploited by Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) routing protocols to improve TCP throughput over multi-hop connections and increase the capacity of these networks by reducing exposed node induced congestion, a known problem in CSMAICA based MANET.","An embodiment of the present invention includes a method of operating a decentralized ad-hoc wireless network including wireless stations, each of the wireless stations including a wireless transceiver configured to wirelessly communicate with each of the other wireless stations over a common wireless channel, comprising:","establishing, through wireless communication between the wireless stations, a common time reference among the wireless stations, which is used by the wireless stations to share access to the common wireless channel, the common time reference having a periodic superframe structure based on a repeating Scheduled Beacon Transmit Time (SBTT) interval, the SBTT interval including\n\n","granting access, using wireless communication between the wireless stations, to CPs in the SBTT interval to at least some of the wireless stations requesting access to the CPs; and","time-scheduling, using wireless communication between the wireless stations, the CFPs in the SBTT interval to at least some of the wireless stations requesting access to the CFPs.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes a network, comprising at least one Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), where an IBSS includes member wireless communication stations (WSs) that share access to a common wireless channel, the WSs including\n\n","Further embodiments, including related methods and systems, will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant arts having read the present application.","1. Introduction","IEEE 802.11 standard made Carrier Sense Multiple Access\/Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA) technology the preferred method for building Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). In particular, research and experiments for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) over the last several years has relied on simulation or wireless communication devices using IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA MAC. MANET protocols allow impromptu setup of wireless network between mobile devices without requiring setup of infrastructure equipment nor any human planning or intervention. Rapid advances in hardware allowed development of low cost computing, memory, and wireless communication chipsets which enabled low cost manufacture of very small battery operated computing devices such as PDAs, and tiny disposable sensors. Large number of these devices can now be spread over large and small areas, mounted on various types of autonomous air, ground and sea vehicles, embedded on many instruments, and carried by people. MANET technology is a key enabler for many promising military, medical, and civilian applications where the facility of computing resources, unattended sensors scattered in the environment, actuators, and autonomous devices and vehicles can be integrated to perform tasks and serve humans by reading and influencing the contextual state of the surrounding environment. MANET protocols allow setup of highly resilient wireless networks on moment notice any where in a cost effective manner. Unlike cellular and hotspots based wireless networks, where setting up the network requires considerable effort in planning and selecting the location of each infrastructure node, and where loss of any infrastructure node will annihilate the communication capability for all devices served by that node.","Mobility, limited stored energy, and common wireless communication impediments such as signal fading, noise interference, Multipath, and shadowing make design of MANET protocols challenging. Regardless of the application, MANET need bandwidth and energy efficient distributed algorithms to control and schedule nodes access to the shared wireless link and to determine network organization in a highly dynamic mobile environment. The Distributed Coordinator Function (DCF) described in IEEE 802.11 standard is based on the CSMA\/CA method allowing any number of mobile stations to contend for transmission to be able to share a common wireless communication medium. Before transmitting on the channel, CSMA\/CA devices ensure that the medium is idle using Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) circuit then each device backs-off from transmission for a duration locally selected from a random Contention Window (CW); the maximum possible duration of this back-off CW is 7 slot-times on first attempt to transmit a packet and grows exponentially on each subsequent retransmission attempt until it reaches 255 slot-times. CSMA\/CA MAC protocols, in general, are characterized by simplicity, fairness and adequacy in supporting best effort applications by giving equal access to all traffic originating from any station that shares the common wireless medium. CSMA\/CA is an adequate scheme where the traffic load is very low relative to channel capacity and where the number of stations competing for transmissions is small. Unfortunately, the random access delay and exponential back-off methods used in CSMA\/CA for collision avoidance and recovery are inadequate when the offered load approaches channel capacity and when many devices contend for transmission.","Increasingly multimedia and interactive real time traffic support is becoming an important requirement for many promising MANET applications. This delay sensitive traffic imposes strict low latency and minimum bandwidth constraints that can not be guaranteed by CSMA\/CA based MANET. There is considerable body of research work aimed at extending IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA MAC to provide improved QoS communication support. The proposed solutions in the surveyed QoS research can be classified into decentralized prioritized QoS solutions or parameterized QoS solutions. Prioritized QoS solutions offer differentiated QoS service among traffic flows without any assurances of specific QoS metrics. There are known approaches for prioritized QoS solutions that use decentralized stochastic priority based methods. Generally, these approaches support a limited set of traffic priorities and each message must be assigned to one of these priorities. These methods modify basic CSMA\/CA MAC in order to provide higher priority traffic precedence on transmission by reducing the deferral period and\/or back-off time window that a station must wait before transmitting in idle channel. These methods differentiate between the high priority and low priority traffic. However, these approaches are not adequate when different applications need specific data rates or minimum delay because it is not easy to translate these needs into the finite set of priority classes supported by these methods. In addition, the random nature of delay and potential of collisions remain an impediment to providing deterministic QoS guarantees. There are known approaches that can be classified as adaptive stochastic methods that use decentralized fair scheduling algorithms. One approach proposes adjusting the size of the random back-off period adaptively by measuring the actual throughput against the desired throughput for each traffic flow. The source node decreases the contention window size for flows that need to increase actual throughput. The contention window size increases when the throughput needs to decrease or when network overloaded condition is detected. Another approach improves on the previous method by supporting traffic priority concept and employing an adaptive random function in selecting the back-off period that takes into account the traffic class and the length of message to be transmitted. Shorter messages are transmitted faster than longer messages when both messages are of same class. Also, messages with higher class are transmitted before lower class messages when both messages have equal message length. The message class is determined by the desired rate and priority. High throughput and high priority messages are high class messages. Another approach proposes Distributed adaptive Deficit Round Robin (DDRR) fair scheduling scheme to provide fair bandwidth allocation mechanism capable of supporting the desired throughput for various traffic flows. The approaches utilize a Deficit Counter (DC) for each traffic flow and use an adaptive random formula to compute DDRR Deferral Period Inter-Frame Space (DPIF) that a station must wait before sending a message for that traffic flow. Another approach enhances this DDRR approach by including support for absolute throughput. This approach guarantees traffic flow absolute throughput when the total load in the network does not exceed the \u201cEffective\u201d channel capacity. Clearly, these adaptive fair scheduling schemes are more effective than the stochastic basic priority methods in their ability to support absolute throughput. Unfortunately, all these priority based and the fair-scheduling based decentralized schemes are not effective in preventing collision and can not provide deterministic delay guarantees for traffic flows due to the stochastic nature of the approach used to compute the delay required prior to each transmission. Moreover, all these approaches are contention based channel access methods that use a channel reservation duration field in the header of each MAC frame to inform all stations within reception range of the sender or receiver of the scheduled end time of current exchange where other senders may contend to start a new exchange. Any station that receives a message must start a countdown timer initialized to the value of the channel reservation duration field in header of the received message; the station should not attempt to send nor respond to any message addressed to it before this count down timer expires. This timer is reinitialized every time a new message addressed to other stations is received. CSMA\/CA contention access methods recommend sending a Request-To-Send (RTS) message first before sending long data message and then awaiting Clear-to-Send (CTS) message from the receiver in order to proceed with the data message; the channel reservation value in RTS header must include the time required to receive CTS plus the time required to send data and receive acknowledgment frame. RTS and CTS are very short messages; consequently, this method reduces the duration for detecting collisions which should reduce collision overhead than what would be possible when waiting for entire duration of long data message followed by an acknowledgment. The channel reservation field used in RTS\/CTS frames is an effective mechanism to protect senders and receivers from potential interference from \u201cHidden Nodes\u201d, a station is considered \u201cHidden Node\u201d whenever it is outside the transmission range of the sender, but within the transmission range of receiver. Collisions\/Interference will occur at the receiver, if any hidden node transmits while the sender is transmitting. When a sender is transmitting, hidden nodes can not use carrier sense to determine when the channel is idle, they must rely on virtual clear channel assessment using channel reservation period information received in header of CTS or Acknowledgment messages sent by the receiver. Unfortunately, it is known that this scheme reduces the effective throughput in multi-hop MANET due to the exposed node induced congestion problem. An exposed node is any station that is within interference range of the transmitting station but outside the sensing range of the receiver. Exposed nodes can use carrier sense to detect channel busy condition, and transmissions by exposed nodes should not cause interference at the receivers. A known analysis of IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA performance in MANET reveals these problems and concludes that CSMA\/CA is not an appropriate MAC for MANET. In particular, this study reveals that TCP performs poorly in CSMA\/CA based multi hop MANET. In conclusion, the random access delay inherent in the basic CSMA\/CA technology and all the proposed decentralized improvements is the main impediment for supporting deterministic QoS for delay intolerant traffic and introduces major challenges in improving spectrum utilization in MANET.","The parameterized solutions offer deterministic QoS guarantees with specific quantitative values for throughput, delay, and delay jitter bounds. IEEE 802.11 Point Coordination Function (PCF) and IEEE 802.11e HCCA are two examples of these parameterized QoS solutions. Centralized MAC schemes such as Point Coordination Function (PCF) specified in IEEE 802.11 standard and Hybrid Control Function (HCF) Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) specified in IEEE 802.11e are two representative examples of parameterized QoS solutions. These systems support Contention Free (CF) access method in order to provide deterministic QoS for delay intolerant applications. In these schemes, specific stations that request contention free access are polled at regular interval and allowed to transmit traffic. Unfortunately, these are centralized solutions designed for single hop infrastructure based wireless LANs. These systems require considerable effort in planning and selecting the proper sites for access points and require mobile stations to remain within coverage area of access points. Also, as we stated, loss of infrastructure node will impact all other stations operating in its coverage area. Currently, Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) are prevalent technologies for many MANET applications that require wireless communication with deterministic QoS characteristics. Unfortunately these technologies don't use the spectrum efficiently and require significant management and planning effort to partition spectrum and allocate bandwidth. Applications that generate asynchronous non real-time traffic bursts and also delay intolerant traffic such as voice calls are required to utilize multiple communication interfaces, one for each traffic type, which increase the size, weight, power, and cost of the hardware platforms for these applications.","In this report we describe a novel MAC solution for establishing wireless LAN capable of supporting contention and contention free access on the same channel. DQMAC is strictly decentralized solution to allow any number of mobile stations sharing a common wireless channel to collaborate in managing the channel resources. These stations will partition the channel bandwidth into non contiguous Contention Free Periods (CFP) and Contention Periods (CP). Each CFP is assigned exclusively for one station to transmit data to any station within range. Each CFP will occur at fixed periodic interval and transmission during CFP will not be preceded by random back-off period. Stations may contend to transmit data using CSMA\/CA method during any CP. DQMAC requires mobile stations managing the channel to maintain common state information regarding current allocation of channel resources in terms of duration and timing of each CFP and assignment to mobile station.","DQMAC contention free access support permits deterministic delay and bandwidth QoS guarantees. Its capability to support contention and contention free medium access on single channel improves spectrum utilization efficiency for distributed applications that need wireless communication support for best effort asynchronous short traffic bursts as well as real-time delay sensitive traffic. Moreover, the cost and weight of the hardware platform for these applications can be reduced because it is sufficient to support a single DQMAC transceiver instead of two; a dedicated channel and transceiver for contention based best effort traffic and a second dedicated transceiver and channel for delay sensitive traffic.","DQMAC technology enables establishment of scalable and resilient MANET which is an essential requirement for many promising military applications. In particular, at the battle front lines, rapid establishment of wireless communication between drones, commanders, sensors, and smart weapons at moment notice will require low cost and low weight communication gear capable of supporting delay-sensitive as well as large volume of best effort traffic. DQMAC based MANET can be formed at moment notice to allow front line commanders to use single communication interface to call dismounted warfighters, control weapons, and obtain integrated picture on ongoing battle using remote sensors. DQMAC single channel\/single transceiver for contention free and contention access makes efficient use of the spectrum and reduces the cost and weight of communication gear.","The same benefits are useful for many civilian applications. For example in recent years, many municipalities are planning to deploy IEEE 802.11 based wireless broadband service using a mesh network of hot spots located at light poles and rooftop of public building. Building an effective multi-hop backhaul network for the large number of access-points, hot spots, is complex and expensive component for these projects. DQMAC CFP support can be exploited by Access Points deployed in these municipal broadband wireless networks to establish an overlay back-hauling mesh network using same channel and transceiver that the access point uses to communicate with hosts in its coverage area.","Next section defines the acronyms used in this technical report.

DQMAC Supports deterministic QoS guarantees for Mobile Stations (MS) traffic for Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (CSMA\/CA) wireless network by introducing Contention Free Medium Access (CFMA) method. DQMAC supports CFMA by allowing Mobile Stations (MSs) to reserve periodic Contention Free Periods (CFPs) to use for data exchange with other MSs within their range.","DQMAC enables any number of MSs to partition the communication capacity of a common wireless channel into Contention Free Periods (CFPs) and Contention Periods (CPs). Each CFP is allocated to specific MS to transmit using contention free access method, while all MS will share the available CPs using CSMA\/CA fair and random contention access method. Any MS with an allocated CFP is guaranteed a specific minimum data rate, and specific maximum bounds on access delay and jitter for its outbound traffic. The following section describes DQMAC CPs and CFPs in more detail.","DQMAC decentralized algorithms and protocols are responsible of two main functions:\n\n","The DQMAC CRAM function handles assignment of CFP when a MS reserves it. CRAM function includes also the update and dissemination of a common resource allocation schedules for use by all MS that reside within Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) coverage and collaborate in management and allocation of its common wireless communication channel resources.","The DQMAC CAC function is a set of decentralized algorithms and protocols that direct when each MS is allowed to access the common medium and determine the access method that each MS should use to transmit when it is not prohibited from accessing the IBSS wireless medium.","3.1 Superframe and Extended Superframe Structures",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","1","3","1","2","102","102","1","2","102","102","1","2","1","4","104","102"],"sup":["2","2","2","2","2"]},"DQMAC limits the maximum duration of any CFP and the ratio of aggregate duration of CFPs to aggregate duration of CPs. In addition, internal algorithms and configuration recommendation avoid placing CFPs contiguously within its Superframe structure; instead it strives to extend the CP duration between the allocated CFPs and between beacon message and first and last CFP within an IBSS Superframe. These measures are designed to reduce probability of collisions during CPs, because firstly, as the CFP interval increase, other IBSS MSs that have messages to transmit will be required to wait for current CFP to expire, and as time elapses there will be greater likelihood of more stations with need to transmit and as the number of transmitters increase at end of CFP all these stations will contented for the channel and there will be greater likelihood of collisions. Secondly, extending aggregate CP duration provides all station with longer time period and more network capacity to transmit contention messages which reduces the likelihood of collisions.","Transmitting beacon message every SBTT interval will impose a significant energy cost on the IBSS station required to maintain the IBSS Superframe structure. Typically, this responsibility is relegated to infrastructure node in wireless LANs that include infrastructure nodes such as Access Point (AP), typically these nodes are connected to permanent power source. However, it is impractical to assume presence of mains powered infrastructure nodes in MANET where all nodes are mobile and these wireless networks are formed at moment notice without opportunity to plan. Several existing MANET approaches delegate this responsibility to specific IBSS node, cluster head or cluster lead. For example, the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC standard for wireless LANs uses a Coordinator station. These centralized approaches also place a heavy energy burden on specific mobile station. Loss of this special station will require other stations to elect another station to take responsibility of transmitting beacons to maintain the IBSS Superframe structure. On the other hand, DQMAC wireless LAN approach distributes consumption of Energy required to maintain its Superframe structure among multiple IBSS MSs. This allows stations with similar configuration and limited stored power to play an equal role in collaboration towards establishing an IBSS Superframe time reference which leads to longer operating duration for the collective MSs to accomplish mission without requiring any MS to have additional stored energy. As such, in DQMAC a set of IBSS stations collaborate in maintaining the IBSS Superframe structure by taking turns in transmitting the IBSS beacon at fixed SBTT interval. A common beacon schedule maintained and shared by several stations within an IBSS allows those stations to identify the MSs that will transmit scheduled Beacon messages and the order in which these MSs will transmit the beacon messages at each SBTT interval. The first entry in the IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS) will be the MAC address of the MS that established the IBSS, IBSS Initiator MS (IIMS). The remaining entries in the IBS are the MAC addresses of other MSs responsible for transmitting beacon messages for the IBSS. The MSs in the IBS are the stations responsible for performing CRAM function for the IBSS. DQMAC IBSS Extended Superframe Structure (IESS) consists of a sequence of SBTT periods and is delimited by beacon messages transmitted by the IIMS. The duration of DQMAC IESS is dependant on the number of entries in the IBS.  is an illustration of an example D2QMAC IESS . In , an IBSS includes CRAM stations MS- through MS-N-. CRAM stations MS- through MS-N- each transmit respective beacon messages B through BN- one after the other in round-robin fashion at the start of respective successive SBTT intervals, as depicted in , in accordance with the common IBS, which is transmitted as part of each of the beacon messages MS- through MS-N-. This process establishes and maintains a common time reference in the form of the Superframe.","DQMAC IESS provides a common reference to support power saving sleep\/awake scheduling. DQMAC allows MS that need to save energy, sensor nodes for example, to disable its receiver and sleep for extended duration. These nodes may select a specific SBTT periods within DQMAC IESS where it plans to be awake and ready to receive messages. A station operating in power save mode will send a message to all other stations that it expects to receive messages from identifying when it will be awake by listing the MAC addresses of the CRAM stations scheduled to transmit the beacon for SBTT periods where power saving station will be awake to monitor for any incoming messages. Any station with interest to send messages to sleeping station must wait for the proper SBTT interval within the DQMAC IESS when they expect that sleeping station to revert to listening mode.","In order to avoid collisions at SBTT interval, DQMAC MSs required to transmit scheduled beacon message must have identical copy of IBSS beacon schedule, IBS. A table listing the order in which IBSS stations will take turns in transmitting scheduled beacon message. This table can be statically configured in all MS that participate in CRAM function when DQMAC IBSS is setup to operate in pre-provisioned mode. Alternatively this table, the IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS), can be setup on-demand as MS stations join and leave an IBSS. The latter approach offers more flexibility and is supported when DQMAC IBSS is setup to operate in on-demand mode.","All IBSS MSs must be aware of current assignment of each CFP, its duration, and its time alignment within the IBSS Superframe structure. DQMAC stations transmitting beacon message must provide this CFP allocation information each time a beacon message is transmitted. Each Beacon message will include a CFP Allocation schedule which defines the timing, duration, and access right for each CFP. IBSS station will use the Beacon's CFP periods allocation information received within current SBTT interval, the Current Beacons CFP Schedules (CBCFPS), to determine when they are allowed to access the common channel. All IBSS stations that generate Beacon message must maintain a consistent CFP Allocation Schedule (CFPS). When DQMAC is used in pre-provisioned mode, the CFP Allocation Schedule will be manually configured in IBSS MSs listed in the IBS. When DQMAC on-demand mode of operation is utilized, then CFPS will be established at run time as MS reserve CF periods and will be maintained synchronized across IBSS MSs currently listed in the common IBS. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 provide additional details on DQMAC IBS and CFPS.","3.1.1 IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS)","IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS) is an ordered list of globally unique identifiers for MSs responsible for generating Beacon Messages at the Scheduled Beacon Transmit Time (SBTT). IBS elements consist of the MAC Address of these MSs. In DQMAC, MSs listed in IBS which are responsible for sending a scheduled Beacon Message every SBTT interval are the IBSS stations responsible for the common wireless Channel Resources Allocation and Management (CRAM) function. DQMAC does not require that all IBSS member stations to participate in management and control of access to the shared medium, CRAM function. However, DQMAC recommends higher number of participants in order to improve the system robustness and resiliency, and expand load sharing of CRAM energy consumption across larger number of stations.","Every MS listed in IBS is an IBSS CRAM station. The first entry in IBS is the station that established the IBSS, IBSS Initiator Mobile Station (IIMS). The MAC address of IIMS is used as DQMAC IBSS identifier (IBSSID) by setting the individual\/group bit of the IIMS MAC address to 0 and the Universal\/local bit to 1. The process ensures that each IBSS will have a universally unique identifier.","DQMAC it is important to maintain common version of IBS schedule across all stations responsible for IBSS CRAM function, stations listed in the IBS. Maintaining common IBS version across multiple stations is trivial when contents of IBS are pre-provisioned. In DQMAC pre-provisioned operational mode this information can be provisioned once and used by the stations thereafter without modifications in CRAM membership. However, DQMAC on-demand operational mode offers more flexibility to allow IBSS stations to better adapt to changes in network topology, mobility, and failures; In this mode new stations could join an existing IBSS, and station may leave their current IBSS; in addition, IBSS wireless LAN may split and merge. DQMAC employs several decentralized algorithms and protocol messages in order to maintain synchronization of IBS contents across all IBSS CRAM stations.","The following equation formally describes the DQMAC IBS content; in this equation, l is an ordered set of MAC addresses of CRAM stations representing the IBS that will be shared among CRAM MSs:\n\nl={s:s\u03b5IBSS and s is a CRAM MS}\u2003\u2003Equation 1\n","A common copy of l must be maintained by every station performing CRAM function. The first entry in the ordered set l, station (s), is MAC address of the station that initiated the IBSS, swill be followed by the MAC addresses of the CRAM stations that joined the IBSS in order of arrival. In this document will also use the symbol lto represent the Nmobile station that joined the IBSS; and lto represent the mobile station that initiated the IBSS, the IIMS. Note that in Pre-provisioned D2QMAC the size of the IBS and the contents of each entry will remain constant, however, the order of the CRAM stations within the IBS will change as these CRAM stations move in and out of their current IBSS coverage. When a CRAM station establishes a new IBSS, it must move its MAC address to be the first entry in the IBS, to become an IIMS; and if it merges with a dominant IBSS, the position of its MAC address will revert to the position stated in the received IBS within beacon of the dominant IBSS.","DQMAC beacon frames must include the current contents of IBS schedule. The contents of the IBS schedule listed in a beacon frame are based on the current local image of the IBS as perceived by the station that generated that beacon frame. Stations that receive a beacon frame will compare the contents of the IBS in the received frame, Current Beacon IBSS Beacon Schedule (CBIBS), against contents of their Local IBSS Beacon Schedule (LIBS). CRAM stations that detect difference between CBIBS and LIBS will update their LIBS content by applying an Ordered Set Union operation. A station that detects that CBIBS content is missing MAC addresses, will inform the station that generated the beacon message of these missing entries. This document shall cover the IBSS synchronization process in more detail. The following equation provides a formal description the process that will be applied by every CRAM station upon receiving a beacon message in order to maintain a common IBS schedule.\n\nl=\u222al\u222al\u2003\u2003Equation 2\n","Where lrepresents the set of all the received CBIBS by the nstation during current SBTT and lrepresents the nstation's LIBS","The following equation describes the information that will be sent to the station that generated the last beacon by a station that identified one or more missing and active elements in a received CBIBS.\n\nand and is the index of in }\u2003\u2003Equation 3\n","Where lis the beacon most recently received by the nstation and lis ordered set of missing MAC address of active station and its index in the LIBS.

Whenever there is a conflict in the order of elements between LIBS and CBIBS, DQMAC resolves the conflict by sorting the conflicting elements within the schedule in ascending order using reverse MAC address comparison function. The reverse MAC address compares MAC address value by reversing the order of the octets. This approach reduces the magnitude of vendor specific bits in MAC address. As such, MAC address with lower least significant octet value will be placed before MAC address with higher least significant octet value; and if these octets hold the same value then comparison is performed on next least significant octets. MAC addresses are guaranteed to be universally unique by IEEE Registration Authority that assigns organizations and companies a unique block of addresses, 24 bits Organization Unique identifier (OUI) or 12 bit Individual Address Block (IAB). Each organization producing the MAC devices then uses these blocks to assign each device universally unique MAC address.","3.1.2 Contention Free Periods Allocation Schedule (CFPS)","DQMAC CRAM stations share the responsibility of allocating Contention Free Periods (CFPs) to any MSs that request to reserve these periods. All stations performing CRAM function must use a common IBSS Contention Free Periods allocation Schedule (CFPS) to ensure that two CRAM stations will not assign CFPs with overlapping time periods. The common CFPS that will be shared across all CRAM stations consists of a set of Contention Free Period (CFP) triple, 3-tuple. Each CFP triple is represented by 10 octets and consists of <6 octets MAC Address, 2 octets period duration, 2 octets period offset from SBTT>. The CFPS is used to maintain a CF triple for each CF period that have been reserved and remain in use within the IBSS boundary. The 3-tuple entries in the CFPS will be placed in ascending order based on the SBTT-offset value in each triple. The following is a formal description of the contents of CFPS elements and rules that apply to each element.","Let the triple cfp=<S, d, o>\n\n","The MAC Address in the CF triple is the MAC address of the station that reserved the CFP. The period duration value in the CF triple is the number of Time Units (TU) allocated for the CFP. The period offset value is the number of TU between the start of the SBTT interval and start of the CFP period. The common CFPS provides CRAM stations with a current mapping of allocated communication bandwidth. Each DQMAC CRAM station is required to include in the beacon message the contents of its Local image of the CFPS (LCFPS). All IBSS MSs that receive beacon message are required to use the Current Beacon's CFPS (CBCFPS) information to determine when each station can use its CFP, when it can contend for channel access using CSMA\/CA scheme, and when it must defer the channel during CFPs reserved by other stations. Ideally, the contents of LCFPS should match the received CBCFBS. Unfortunately this can be guaranteed only in DQMAC pre-provisioned mode; where CFPS content are static and manually provisioned in all CRAM stations prior to activating the network. In this mode, a fixed set of CFPs are permanently assigned to specific MSs. In DQMAC on-demand mode, MS are required to reserve CFP from CRAM station and CRAM stations utilize DQMAC protocol and decentralized algorithm to assign CFP to the requesting MS and synchronize their local image of the new CFPS. DQMAC utilizes various decentralized algorithms and protocol messages to efficiently disseminate any change in CFPS to the maximum number of stations within IBSS coverage area. However, it is possible that CFPS changes may not reach all stations in timely fashion due to errors, mobility, or obstacles. DQMAC algorithms will help all MS to eventually converge on a common CFPS. In the mean time, DQMAC uses decentralized algorithm to allow any MS to gracefully cope with differences between its LCFPS and the received CBCFPS. The following equations provide formal description of the process that each MS must apply to determine when and how it can access the IBSS common channel based on the received CFBS received in beacon frames during the current SBTT interval (CBCFPSS) and its LCFBS.","Let\n\nR={CBCFPS}\n","Where\n\n","and\n\n","Let Bdenotes MS SContention Free Periods Schedule (CFPS) included in the currently transmitted scheduled beacon; As such, if during the current SBTT interval MS Stransmitted a scheduled beacon, then Bequals LCFBS; and if MS Swas not scheduled to transmit beacon message during current SBTT interval, then Bequals \u03c6.","Let Ddenotes the IBSS aggregate CRAM list of designated CFPs as perceived by SMS during the current IBSS Superframe interval, where\n\nD=\u222aR\u222aLCFPS\u2003\u2003Equation 6\n\nAnd let Arepresent the current consensus regarding IBSS CFPs list among the CRAM stations as perceived by MS Sduring the current IBSS Superframe interval, where\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0097"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["A","j"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"\u22c2","msub":{"mi":["R","j"]}},"mo":"\u22c2","msub":{"mi":["LCFPS","j"]}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["if","Bj"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03d5","or"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["R","j"]}},"mo":"\u2260","mi":"\u03d5"}],"mo":"="}}}]},"mo":"}"},{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["A","j"]},{"mi":["B","j"]}],"mo":"="},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["B","j"]}},{"mi":["\u03d5","and"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":["R","j"]}}],"mo":"\u2260"},"mo":"=","mi":"\u03d5"}],"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.1em","height":"1.1ex"}}},"mn":"7"}}]}}}}},"Then in DQMAC, a MS Sis allowed to perform contention free access during any period CFPin the set CFthat contains all CFP where MS Sj have Contention free access permission during the current SBTT interval.

As we have explained in previous sections, DQMAC IBSS Superframe Structure (ISS) is defined by the SBTT duration and delimited by scheduled beacon periods. We also explained that beacon frames will contain CFPS and IBS reflecting the local copy of these shared data as perceived by the station that generated the beacon; further, we showed how each station will use this beacon information along with its local version of the IBS and CFPS to determine when it is allowed to access the channel and how it should access the channel when allowed. While these measures are sufficient to avoid collisions when the IBS or the CFPS on one or more IBSS stations arc not synchronized with the current IBS and CFPS shared by the rest of the IBSS stations; these mechanisms should prevent collisions during scheduled beacon period and Contention Free periods provided that all IBSS stations are guaranteed to receive every beacon frame generated within the IBSS. Unfortunately, in mobile ad hoc networks, wireless communication between stations is not symmetric; a scheduled beacon message transmitted by one station may not be received by one or more hidden stations within the same IBSS. Further more, even when DQMAC is used in pre-provisioned mode and all stations are properly provisioned with identical IBS and CFBS, due to mobility, it is feasible for a set of MS to encounter another IBSS within its communication range and stations at both IBSS may experience inter-IBSS interference and collisions during a CFP when there conflict in CFP in the CFPS of these IBSSs. In order to mitigate this risk, DQMAC uses additional channel access methods to allow IBSS MSs to I-detect potential out-of-sync and IBSS overlap conditions, 2-minimize the impact of these conditions, and 3-facilitate recovery from these conditions.","DQMAC Superframe Structure allocates a dedicated period to transmit an IBSS Scheduled Beacon management frame. This period is dedicated to the CRAM station currently scheduled for beacon transmission according to the common IBS. Typically, one Beacon messages is transmitted during this period. DQMAC Superframe structure allocates a second dedicated period, the contended beacon recovery period, immediately following the scheduled beacon period. Both of these periods are allocated exclusively for transmission of IBSS beacon messages.  is an illustration of a Superframe  wherein there are depicted the aforementioned periods following the SBTT interval and other timing details that stations must adhere to before accessing the channel.

This design along with common CSMA\/CA contention access methods similar to IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA method imposes two strict timing constraints: The Short-inter-Frame Space (SIFS) period and the Slot-Time (\u0394T). Slot time is the minimum interval for collision avoidance, which is the minimum time delay from one station to trigger its MAC hardware to transmit a message until the MAC hardware at furthest receiver is able to detect the arrival of the first symbol for that message. Slot-Time must exceed the maximum propagation delay between two stations using the underlying physical channel maximum transmit power and the modulation scheme that results in highest SNR at furthest receiver. The SIFS is minimum time for MS transceiver operating in receive mode to transition to transmit mode upon arrival of last symbol of the message currently being received. IEEE 802.11 standard provides specification details for typical CSMA.CA access method and describes in detail how slot-time and Inter-Frame Space (IFS) duration are used. In addition, IEEE 802.11 specification covers how the DCF Inter-fame Space (DIFS) duration referenced in  is used prior to transmission using contention access method.","In DQMAC, different inter-frame space periods are used to defer access to the channel prior to transmission. Beacon Inter-frame Space (BIS) period is used before transmission of a beacon frame, Contention Free Inter-frame Space (CFIS) period is used before transmission of a contention free message, and Contention Inter-frame Space (CIS) period is used before transmission of a contention message. Since BIS is the shortest deferral period, a station transmitting a beacon frame will always gain access to the idle medium before any other station attempting to send a contention message or a contention free message. These strict timing rules along with Superframe structure are designed to eliminate collision probability between scheduled beacon messages and any contention or contention free message transmission attempt by any station that for any reason may not share the common SBTT time reference. Similarly, the shorter CFIS period protects contention free messages from potential collisions from attempt to send contention message on the idle channel by out-of-sync station that may not share the common IBS and CFIS for the IBSS; more these measures should reduce collisions from stations within inter-IBSS interference range but outside inter-IBSS beacon reception range. The following sections cover DQMAC access periods and define how these deferral periods are used prior to accessing the medium to send beacon frames, contention free messages and contention messages.","4.2 DQMAC Access Periods","This section covers all DQMAC access periods used within its Superframe structure. Each section describes when a station is permitted to access these periods, the access rules that a station must follow when using each period type. The following sections define the Channel Access Control (CAC) function rules that must be implemented by mobile stations supporting DQMAC.","4.2.1 Scheduled Beacon Period Access","IBSS CRAM stations maintain a periodic Superframe structure by transmitting a beacon frame every SBTT interval. Unlike IEEE802.11, In DQMAC there is no predefined beacons transmit times that include time  given a common 64-bit timer and TBTT period defined by the station that sent the very first beacon; instead in DQMAC, each beacon is sent at fixed SBTT interval relative to the most recently received scheduled beacon. At SBTT interval, the station currently scheduled to transmit the beacon according to the last received beacon and based on the contents of its local schedule must await a fixed deferral period, the Beacon Inter-frame Space period (BIS), where the medium should remain idle, then the station shall be allowed to transmit the scheduled beacon frame. The station may use its Clear Channel Assessment capability to verify that the channel is idle prior to starting the beacon transmission. However, a station scheduled to transmit a beacon must transmit that message within the scheduled beacon period. Any station currently sending data on the medium must plan to relinquish the channel at or before the IBSS SBTT interval. The Scheduled Beacon period is allocated exclusively for the station currently scheduled to transmit the beacon message. If this station moves away or lost, then the channel will remain idle for the duration of the scheduled beacon period. The scheduled beacon period must be sufficient to wait for BIS duration and transmit the longest possible beacon frame. If the scheduled station was not able to send its scheduled beacon within the scheduled beacon start time because the medium was busy, that station must compete to send a contended beacon once the medium is idle. Propagation Delay Guard Period (PDGP) is used to handle different perception of SBTT stat time among CRAM stations in order to accommodate variable propagation delay resulting from having multiple mobile stations originating beacon messages and time varying distance between the IBSS station that originates a beacon and receivers of this beacon; since CRAM stations are positioned at different location with the IBSS geospatial boundary, the position of CRAM station scheduled to send a beacon will vary from one SBTT interval to the next. Stations may observe that medium is busy when it should be idle for scheduled beacon interval, stations should expect the medium to become idle within the PDGP duration; This scheme insures that beacon delay jitter perceived by any station will not exceed the 2\u00d7 maximum channel propagation delay between any two stations within an IBSS maximum coverage.","4.2.2 Contended Beacon Period Access","A contended Beacon Period is dedicated also for transmitting a beacon message. This period immediately follows the scheduled beacon period in the DQMAC Superframe structure. The contended beacon period is necessary in order to ensure that at least one beacon frame is received by all stations within the IBSS every SBTT interval. A scheduled beacon message transmitted by one MS may not be received by all stations in the IBSS due to several reasons; for example, stations out side the range of the sending station, beacon collisions due to more than one station attempt to send a beacon message at the SBTT interval; this may be a result of station local copy of IBS is out of sync or due to coverage overlap between more than one IBSS that use the same channel and have their IBSS intervals setup with exact alignment.","After SBTT interval starts and upon end of its Scheduled beacon period, all CRAM stations that did not receive the scheduled beacon frame that should have been sent successfully must compete to send a beacon frame for their IBSS, these CRAM stations will use special CSMA\/CA access method when competing to send the contended beacon. CRAM station that missed the scheduled beacon will compute a Contended Beacon Deferral Period (CBDP) that the channel must remain idle before the station can transmit the IBSS contended beacon. This CBDP consists of BIS deferral period and a random Beacon Back-off Period (BBP). The BBP is determined locally using a random function to provide the number of slot-times that determine how long after BIS period elapse each station must back-off while the channel is idle before allowed to access the channel. A Beacon Back-off Period (BBP) will initialized by a random slot-time count value between 0 and Contention Window maximum (2\u00d7CWmin=14) or Size of IBS which ever is higher. All stations competing to transmit a beacon frame must monitor the medium activity and suspend their attempts to send a beacon upon reception of a contended beacon frame from any MS in their IBSS. Stations that don't receive a beacon frame will wait for BIS period to elapse and will continue to decrement their beacon back-off period timer while the channel is idle until these stations are able to send or receive a beacon frame. As such, within an IBSS geospatial area, there shall be at most one scheduled beacon transmission attempt and possibly one or more contended beacon transmissions.","4.2.3 Contention Period Access","Stations in DQMAC will use CSMA\/CA access technique similar to IEEE 802.11 DCF access method to contend for transmitting messages during any period that is not designated as scheduled beacon period, contended beacon period, nor contention free period.","In order to send a contention message, a station is required to verify that the medium is idle for a Contention Inter-frame Space (CIS) deferral period followed by a random contention back-off period, Contention window (CW). The CIS deferral period duration is the duration of BIS plus two slot-times, CIS=BIS+(2\u00d7\u0394T). The random Contention Back-off Period (CBP) value specifies the number of slot-times that a station must wait after BIS elapses while the channel is idle. The CBP will be initialized by a random value between 0 and Contention Window (CW), CW size is 7, CWmin, when a message is first scheduled for transmission using contention access. CBP value will not be initialized unless the message is sent and the station determines that the same message must be retransmitted because either the CTS frame was not received after the CTS frame was sent or because an ACK frame with not received after Data Frame was sent. In the second contention transmission attempt, the CBP should be initialized to a random value between 0 and CW size that is double the previous CW size, size of CWmin. This process will be repeated if the message needs to be retransmitted until CW size is 255, CWmax. DQMAC may use the same CSMA\/CA technique for IEEE 802.11 during contention periods, or any other CSMA\/CA random and fair access technique capable of avoiding starvation for all classes of traffic that contended for shared medium during any contention period within the Superframe structure.","All stations attempting to send a message during any contention period must verify that the total time required to defer access, plus maximum potential time required to back-off, plus the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) time to send all messages in an exchange during a contention period will be completed before arrival of Contention Free Period or the beginning of the IBSS Scheduled Beacon period demarking the start of the SBTT interval. This restriction applies also when transmitting a burst of message fragments, see IEEE 802.11 specification for message fragmentation and burst transmission mode details.","During Contention periods, stations are allowed to use Data\/ACK exchange sequence or RTS\/CTS\/Data\/ACK exchange sequence. As specified in IEEE802.11 specification, the size of the message and the value of the IEEE 802.11 dot11RTSThreshold configuration parameter will determine if CTS\/RTS should be used.","4.2.4 Contention Free Period Access","A Contention Free Period (CFP) is designated time duration within the DQMAC Superframe structure reserved for exclusive use of a specific IBSS station. During each SBTT period, a station is allowed to use its reserved CFP when the period is listed in its local copy of the CFPS and also in every CBCFPS received in a beacon message within the current SBTT interval. As formally described in CFj={CFPk: CFPk\u03b5Aj, Sj equals first element in CFPktriple} Equation 8; the contents of CBCFPS transmitted in every beacon message during an SBTT period provide IBSS stations permission to access their reserved CFPs during that SBTT interval. Upon arrival of SBTT interval, each station allowed to use its CFP must wait for the CFP time offset to elapse between the start of SBTT period and beginning of its CFP, at that time the station should have received all beacon messages for that SBTT period. At that point, the station must defer access for a Contention Free Inter-frame Space (CFIS) period then the station may start transmitting Contention Free data frame and wait for Ack frame.","Stations using CFP are not required to use CTS before sending data frame even when sending data frame that exceeds the IEEE 802.11 dot11RTSThreshotd configuration parameter. However, stations are allowed to use CTS\/RTS before sending a message to ensure that","the destination and all hidden nodes from the sending station are aware of CFP utilization.","A station may use its CFP to solicit traffic from other stations by sending unsolicited directed CTS to a specific IBSS station to poll it for information. A station that receives a directed CTS MAC frame during a CFP from the station that reserved the CFP will be allowed to respond by a data frame after SIFS period or an ACK frame if it has no data to send. A station during its CFP may also send a broadcast CTS and all stations that have messages pending for that station will be allowed to start a contention access procedure to start sending data to that station.","A station that reserved a CFP should use contention access during contention periods when attempting retransmission of unacknowledged data transmitted during the CFP; the station may use contention free access only when retransmission attempt NAV indicates that full exchange could be completed within the same CFP.","As described in Pj={CFPn: CFPn\u03b5Dj, Sj not equal first element in CFPn triple} Equation 9, any MS that receives Beacon messages within a SBTT period that results in denying contention free access to one or more CFP reserved by that MS may wait for the start of the CFP within that SBTT period and then use contention access method described in the previous section to send its data. In this situation, it is recommended for the MS to use RTS\/CTS frames before sending the data.","In DQMAC on-demand mode, any reserved CFP that remains idle for the entire duration of the CFP in MAXIMUM-inactive-CF-Periods consecutive Superframe periods will be reclaimed and considered contention period. The Period is considered active if any message is received from, or sent to the station during the reserved period; or if energy is detected by the physical layer during any time within the CFP.","5.

DQMAC introduced new management frames specifically to decentralized common channel resource control, allocation and management. These frames are used to disseminate common channel allocation schedules across all MS participating in IBSS CRAM function. The Beacon frame format accommodates new information elements to allow CRAM station to periodically share its current copy of common resource allocation schedules. CF-RSV-REQ and CF-RSV-RESP frames allow stations to perform channel resource allocation and disseminate updates to shared resource schedules. The IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame is used by CRAM station to resolve differences, out-of-sync, between stations with respect to the IBS and the CFPS. IBSS-JOIN-REQ and IBSS-JOIN-RESP frames enable stations to be able to participate in IBSS beacon transmission and CRAM function. The IBSS-Borders-Exposed-CFPS frame is sent by borders stations to disseminate to potential receivers at other IBSSs when their CFPs occur and when they are exposed to CFP traffic, Soliciting-CRAM-Stations is used by a station attempting to establish a new IBSS and CRAM-solicit-response frame is used to prevent a station residing within an existing IBSS from unnecessary creation of new IBSS. The RELEASE-CFP-REQ and the RELEASE=CFP-RESPONSE frames allow stations to explicitly release CFP previously allocated to them using the CF-RSV-REQ and CF-RSV-RESP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"All DQMAC, Management frames must be transmitted using basic rate and highest power to maximize the likelihood that these messages will be received by the maximum number of IBSS receivers.","In addition, DQMAC introduces modified CTS\/RTS frame formats for use during CFP. CTS and RTS may be used during a CFP to avoid immature reclaim of the CFP by CRAM stations. Use of RTS\/RTS control frames is recommended prior to sending DATA frame in a CFP. Using Basic rate and highest power when sending CFP RTS\/CTS frames expands the geospatial coverage of signals transmitted in CFPS which minimizes the probability of inappropriate designation of that the CFP as inactive by CRAM stations hidden from the station that reserved the CFP.","5.1 Beacon Frame","This management frame, Beacon frame, will have frame body contents consisting of the order list of fields described in the following table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0141"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"DQMAC Beacon Frame Body Contents"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Order","Information","Notes"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Time Stamp","Time Stamp representing current value of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"TSFTIMER.

This result in load sharing the energy consumed for processing and communication associated with supporting contention free reservation and access control for contention free periods which enables prolonged collaborative team missions without requiring any of the mobile stations to be capable of storing additional energy. DQMAC does not require that all IBSS MSs to participate in common channel resource management function; however, higher number of participants improves the system robustness, resiliency and results in shared energy consumption across larger number of stations for IBSS management overhead.","Stations participating in DQMAC common channel resource allocation and contention free access control functions are called IBSS Channel Resource Allocation Management (CRAM) Stations. IBSS CRAM stations are required to maintain a common copy of two lists: 1) IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS) and 2) Contention Free Periods Schedule (CFPS). The IBS lists all the CRAM stations and CFPS lists each CFP currently allocated to an IBSS MS.","IEEE 802.11 standard ad hoc DCF and many CSMA\/CA specifications do not include built in mechanisms that restrict the boundaries of the wireless LAN, IBSS. For example, all stations in IEEE 802.11 IBSS compete to send beacon message around the Target Beacon Transmit Time (TBTT), in fact several beacon instances could be transmitted by hidden terminals within an IBSS, and in IEEE 802.11 IBSS split and join events are transparent to IBSS member stations. DQMAC allows stations to automatically form an ad hoc IBSS network, but it includes mechanisms to allow these stations detect and dynamically adapt to changes to network topology as new MSs are introduced, leave, join an IBSS, and when the IBSS splits and merges.","DQMAC on-demand mode allows MS to reserve CFP when the station has prolonged need for deterministic communication service with specific quantitative QoS characteristics such as bit rate, delay, and delay jitter bounds. DQMAC IBSS MSs should able to detect and gracefully respond to network split and merge events that occur due to stations mobility. In order to able to perform these CRAM functions and respond to these events without use of centralized scheme, all IBSS CRAM stations must maintain a synchronized copy of IBS and CFPS schedules. This is a daunting task given that IBSS CRAM stations team membership is highly dynamic due to mobility, and given that connectivity between these CRAM MSs is intermittent due to time varying fading channels, obstacles, and range.","To be able to contain the complexity of this synchronization task, it is imperative to define reasonable geospatial boundaries for DQMAC IBSS where synchronization of IBS and CFPS must be maintained. Selection of very small IBSS where all members can communicate directly will simplify dissemination of updates to IBS and CFPS across all CRAM stations, however such an IBSS will suffer from highly dynamic team members as assumption for full and direct communication between all members is very restrictive and any station mobility will likely cause leave or split condition for one IBSS and join or merge condition for another IBSS. On the other hand, as we allow increasing number of hops between IBSS CRAM stations, the overhead cost required to disseminate changes across the IBSS will rise and will increase the potential for IBS and CFPS changes to be outdated in transit.","6.1 IBSS Boundaries","DQMAC defines the boundary of an IBSS to be all active CRAM stations that are first neighbors of that station that initiated this IBSS, one hop away from IIMS. As such, two hops are the maximum distance allowed between any two active CRAM stations in a DQMAC IBSS. This DQMAC IBSS boundary decision enables rapid and efficient dissemination of IBS and CFPS updates across the active CRAM stations in an IBSS, and without imposing fairly long duration before permitting new updates to CFPS or IBS to take place. Therefore the maximum communication range of the station that initiated the IBSS defines the IBSS CRAM boundaries, maximum communication range is defined by maximum distance that any IBSS CRAM station will be able to receive transmitted beacons from the IBSS initiator station. This IBSS network topology allows the IBSS initiator station, and all other active CRAM station within close proximity, to observe all events occurring at any region within their IBSS that impact the state of the shared IBS and CFPS schedules. As such, within an IBSS, the mobility of any MS and mobility of the MS that initiated that IBSS and the topological characteristic of the terrain where these stations reside will dictate when a MS is inside or outside the IBSS boundary.","The list of all IBSS active CRAM stations are called IBSS Scheduled Beacon Stations (IBS), This list must be an included set in the set of all IBSS member stations (set I) and can be formally described as an ordered set l, where\n\nl={s:s\u03b5IBSS, and s is a MS actively participating in IBSS CRAM function}\n","A common copy of l must be maintained by every station s that elects to participate in IBSS CRAM function. This ordered list l will have as its first entry the station (s) that initiated the IBSS, swill be followed by the stations that joined the IBSS and elected to actively participate in its CRAM function in order of arrival. IBSS Scheduled beacon transmission is based on the stations order in the ordered set l.","As such, in DQMAC IBSS CRAM active membership is governed by the following

DQMAC, a station can not establish an IBSS unless it is willing to participate in CRAM function. The station that establishes an IBSS is called the IBSS Initiator Mobile Station (IIMS). Unlike the IEEE 802.11 and other CSMA\/CA standards, in DQMAC a new IBSS must be formed and assigned a universally unique IBSS-ID, this requirement applies when MS is powered-up and no other station within its range has established an IBSS, also a new IBSS is formed as a result of IBSS split and one or more of the stations moves away from its IBSS or the IIMS moves away from them. As described earlier, the universally unique IBSS-ID is derived from the IIMS MAC address by setting the individual\/group bit of the IIMS MAC address to 0 and the Universal\/local bit to 1.","6.2 IBSS Resource Allocation and Management Function","Stations participating in IBSS Channel Resource Allocation Management (CRAM) function are responsible for controlling access to the shared channel resources by granting stations the right to access contention free period and identifying available contention periods within each SBTT period. As discussed earlier, in DQMAC the station that generates an IBSS beacon frame exerts significant influence on how the common channel can be accessed within the SBTT period where it sent a beacon. Depending on IBSS topology, it is possible within a DQMAC IBSS coverage area to observe one or more beacons; there should be one and only one scheduled beacon transmitted during the scheduled beacon period, and possibly zero, one or more beacons transmitted within the contended beacon period. One or more contended beacons will be sent within an SBTT interval if there were one or more hidden nodes from the CRAM station that sent the scheduled beacon for that SBTT; furthermore, it is possible that more than one contended beacon frame to be sent at the start of contended beacon period when two or more nodes that are hidden from each other are also hidden from the station that sent the scheduled beacon during that SBTT period. In general, however, there should be only one beacon transmitted within the IBSS during the SBTT period where the IIMS is the station that transmitted the scheduled beacon because all CRAM station should be first neighbors of IIMS and should receive its beacon frames; as such, when IIMS sends a scheduled beacon the contended beacon period should remain idle. DQMAC employs the contended beacons technique to ensure that at every SBTT interval at least one beacon frame can be received by all stations residing within the IBSS geospatial coverage. The CFPS information element in beacon frames contents influence access permission to the CFPs; while the IBS and the beacon-schedule-index information elements in beacon frames identify the current IBSS CRAM membership list and the CRAM station required to send the next scheduled beacon.","CRAM stations duties includes the definition of IBSS boundary and CRAM team members management activities which include the detection of CRAM station leave event that occur as result of station moves away from IBSS, station taken out of service voluntary or involuntarily, or obstruction appearance between this station. and the rest of the IBSS CRAM stations. Station leave event may result in establishment of a new IBSS. CRAM stations must be able to detect IBSS network split event; this will cause establishment of new IBSS when this event is detected. CRAM membership list is maintained in the shared IBS. CRAM stations must detect IBSS networks merge event and gracefully dissolve one IBSS into the dominant IBSS.","In on-demand DQMAC mode, IBSS CRAM stations are required to support CRAM join request from new stations volunteering to participate in the IBSS CRAM function. IBSS CRAM stations keep track of CRAM membership using a common IBS list. CRAM station that transmitted the Scheduled beacon within current SBTT interval is the only station empowered for the current SBTT period to accept or deny join request into the CRAM list. This responsibility is delegated in round robin fashion, as IBSS scheduled beacon will be transmitted according to order of the CRAM stations within the shared IBS list. CRAM stations are responsible for disseminating updates and maintaining synchronization of the IBS across all members of IBSS CRAM function.","In addition, in on-demand DQMAC mode, IBSS CRAM stations are responsible for applying admission control policies to accept or deny any CFP reservation request issued by any station within the IBSS coverage area. In particular, the CRAM station that transmitted the currently scheduled beacon. is the only station authorized to admit or deny any additional CFP. This authority is rotated as stations in the IBS take turn in sending the scheduled beacon every SBTT period. CRAM stations keep track of allocated CFP periods using a common CFPS list. Finally, CRAM stations are responsible for reclaiming CFP that are not utilized and designate its period as contention period.","6.2.1 Participation in IBSS Resource Allocation Function","DQMAC employs a distributed Finite State Machine (FSM) to perform dynamic team management task. This FSM must be implemented by all stations that wish to participate in DQMAC CRAM function. Upon power up, this CRAM dynamic team management FSM is responsible for channel scanning and either participation in existing IBSS or initiation of new IBSS. In addition, the FSM is responsible for processing join request, as well as detection and processing of IBSS leave, split, and merge events.","The DQMAC CRAM dynamic team management FSM consists of six states; IBSS-scanning, IBSS-established, IBSS-join-pending, IBSS-joined, IBSS-transitioning, and IBSS-borders. The next figure depicts the states, actions, and transitions of this finite state machine. An example FSM according to the present invention is depicted in , wherein the states, actions, and transitions of this finite state machine are depicted.","Upon MS power up, the MS enters the Scanning state where the station monitors a channel for duration equals to its configured minimumChannelScanDwellTime parameter. If the MS station does not detect any IBSS beacon message during this period, the MS should scan the next channel in its configured list of channels. If the station does not find any IBSS beacons in any of the channels, then a no-beacon-in-all-channels event is declared and the MS is required to establish an IBSS by sending a scheduled beacon and changing its state to the Established state. However, if the MS detects a beacon from a DQMAC IBSS, then the MS should join this IBSS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0027","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sup":"2"},"A station joins an IBSS by sending IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame to the station that transmitted the scheduled beacon during the current SBTT interval. A station should not attempt to participate in IBSS CRAM function unless it is direct neighbor of the IBSS initiator station, IIMS. As such, a station should not send IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame unless it was able to receive a beacon message transmitted by the IIMS. Upon transmitting the IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame, the MS station will set its state to Join-Pending State. The IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame shall be transmitted using contention access method during any contention period within the current SBTT interval. As such, the station sending the IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame does not need to have local copy of CFPS, instead it could use only the content CFPS received in beacon frames it was able to receive during the current SBTT interval to be able to identify the contention periods during the current SBTT interval. Upon arrival of the IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame at CRAM station that transmitted the scheduled beacon during current SBTT, then this station will examine the size of beacon-schedule table to determine if a new node could be added to the existing table, Local configuration of the IBSS may include policy limiting the maximum permitted size of Beacon schedule. If the configured policy does not prevent the station from joining the IBSS, then the station that sent the scheduled beacon must send an IBSS-Join-Response management frame with result field set to Accept to the joining station. IBSS-Join-response frame with result set to Accept should be sent to the joining station even if the joining station was already listed in the IBSS Beacon Schedule. The joining station shall remain in Join-Pending state, and will wait for next scheduled beacon. If during the next scheduled beacon frame contains an IBS element with the join station listed as an entry in that schedule, the joining station considers its attempt to join the IBSS CRAM function successful and transitions to the Joined state. DQMAC uses this three nodes exchange to extend the geospatial coverage of messages in join activity to allow the maximum number of stations participating in CRAM function to receive indication of IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS) changes; expanding the geospatial coverage of notification of IBS changes reduces the probability of out-of-sync condition in IBS among IBSS CRAM stations. Stations that receive one or more of the three messages exchanged during CRAM join process should be able to update their beacon schedule locally to remain in sync with IBSS global beacon schedule. CRAM station are aware of changes in IBSS Beacon Schedule (IBS) either by receiving the IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame sent by the joining station to the station that originated the current scheduled beacon, by receiving IBSS-Join-response management frame from the station that originated the current scheduled beacon, or through the contents of IBS in the beacon frame originated by the station that was scheduled to send the next beacon.  is an illustration of an example three nodes IBSS join exchange sequence in a typical deployment scenario.  illustrates the geospatial coverage for IBSS join exchange in this station deployment scenario and shows the number of stations that will be able to update its local beacon schedule upon receiving one of the three management frames involved in the join exchanged.","If the available resources or configured policy does not allow the requesting node to join the IBSS, then response message will include results field set to value other than accept, the value will define the rejection reason. Policy limiting the maximum size of IBSS CRAM stations and authentication failures are two examples of reasons for rejecting IBSS join request. All CRAM stations that received the IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame will evaluate the request locally and should be able to reach the same conclusion as the CRAM station that transmitted the scheduled beacon in the current SBTT which should prevent them from updating their local IBS even when they not in range to receive the IBSS-JOIN-RESP rejecting the request.","A joining station upon transmitting an IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame may not be able to receive IBSS-join-response, however this station may consider its join attempt successful upon receiving a scheduled beacon frame in the next SBTT interval with IBS information element reflecting an updated that includes the joining station; this should cause the joining station to continue the join process by transitioning to Joined state. As such, it is not necessary to retransmit IBSS-JOIN-REQ multiple times during a single SBTT period, the joining station should not assume loss of IBSS-JOIN-REQ frame; instead for efficient use of bandwidth, it is recommended that the joining station wait for the next scheduled beacon message and retry to join the IBSS if the subsequent beacon frames do not have the joining station listed in the IBS information element in the received beacon frames. Note that during each SBTT period the CRAM station that sent the scheduled beacon is the only station authorized to update the shared IBS; limiting changes of shared IBS to single station prevents any potential of simultaneous and incompatible changes in the IBS contents within the IBSS performed by two or more hidden CRAM stations that may generate contended beacons. Further more, a joining station is not required to re-attempt to join an IBSS, if it receives an IBSS-Join-Response frame with Accept result, and the next scheduled beacon frame did not arrive at the joining station at its period in next SBTT, however the joining station was able to receive a contended beacon instead during the next SBTT confirming the reservation process by listing the new station MAC address in the IBS, then the station should transition to Joined state. In addition, the joining station does not need to wait for next beacon when the beacon schedule, IBS, information element in the beacon frame body consists of one station only, the IIMS. In this case, the IBS size increases to two stations when IBSS-Join-Response frame with Accept result field is received at the joining node.","Similar to beacon frames, IBSS-Join-Req and IBSS-Join-Response frames must be sent using the basic Transmit rate and power that provides maximum range and highest SNR ratios for receivers in order to extend the coverage of these messages to maximum distance.","As a consequence of station mobility, distance between a CRAM station and the initiator of its IBSS may exceed one hop, that CRAM station will not be able to receive beacon frames from the IBSS initiator (IIMS), it may also seize to receive any beacon frames from all other IBSS CRAM stations. When a CRAM station does not receive the IBSS initiator scheduled beacon frames for maxScheduledIIMSmissCnt consecutive times, but continues to receive beacons from one or more other CRAM station in its IBSS, this condition should cause that station to declare border-region event which should cause it to abandon its role in managing the IBSS resources, CRAM function, by not sending beacon messages for the IBSS during scheduled or contended beacon periods and should transition from Joined into Borders state. A station in Scanning state that is able to receive Beacon frames from any IBSS CRAM station but is not able to receive the IIMS scheduled beacon frames for maxScheduledIIMSmissCnt consecutive SBTT intervals should declare border-region event and change its state from Scanning to Borders state.","Stations in Borders State are called IBSS border Stations. IBSS border stations should maintain local copy of IBS and CFPS based on received beacons from non IIMS stations in their IBSS. However, IBSS border stations should not transmit scheduled or contended beacon frames. MS Station in Joined state or IIMS in Established state shall transition to Borders state when they receive beacon messages from CRAM stations participating in a second dominant IBSS but don't receive the beacon frames of the IIMS for that dominate IBSS. These stations should declare border-region event because they have detected their presence in overlapping coverage region of their IBSS and another dominate IBSS. An IBSS border-station should remain in that state if it receives beacons from two IBSSs without being first neighbor of IIMS of overlapping dominant IBSS. A border station should abandon its Border state and transition to Joined or Established state if it has not received Beacon frames from any other Dominant IBSS for at least minMissedDominantBeacons Consecutive SBTT intervals while it is the IIMS station for its IBSS; or it is able receive Beacon frames from the dominant IIMS. A Dominant-Beacon-miss counter will be set to zero each time a dominant beacon is received and incremented each SBTT interval elapsed with receiving a beacon from a dominant IBSS.","When a station operating in Joined state does not receive consecutively at least maxIbssScheduledBeaconMissCnt beacon messages from its IBSS CRAM stations; and that station is currently scheduled to transmit the IBSS next scheduled beacon, or if that condition applies to a border-station; then that station has detected an IBSS leave or split event, and it should attempt to establish new IBSS by sending Soliciting-CRAM-Stations management frame during a contention period in its IBSS, the station should await a CRAM-solicit-response frame from any station currently actively participating in the IBSS CRAM function, stations operating in Joined or Established state. Once a response is successfully transmitted by one of the active CRAM stations; then all other CRAM stations that were able to receive that response frame and were contending to send a response should not send additional CRAM-Solicit-response frames. The response frame will include current image of IBSS beacon schedule and CF-periods schedule. If the response was not received within SBTT period, the station should transition from IBSS-joined state\/or borders state to transitioning state. During this state transition; the station establishing new IBSS must select a new time to mark the start of Superframe used as common time reference for the new IBSS. This time reference should be selected to coincide within a randomly selected contention period within the SBTT interval of the previous IBSS, where the selected contention period duration must be long enough to allow transmission of scheduled beacon and a contended beacon. The new SBTT scheduled beacon start time selected randomly to mark the start of the new IBSS Superframe structure will be used by the CRAM station establishing the new IBSS to identify when it will transmit the scheduled beacon frame for the new IBSS. This CRAM station that will establish a new IBSS will use its own MAC address as basis for new IBSS-ID by setting the individual\/group bit to zero and the universal\/local bit to 1. This CRAM station should wait for this randomly selected time to pass in order to start sending the beacon for its new IBSS.","It is important to maintain long duration contention periods between the IBSS reserved CF periods; in particular, the decentralized CFP allocation algorithm used by DQMAC CRAM station should ensure that duration of any contention period within an SBTT interval should not be shorter than the combined duration of scheduled beacon period and contended beacon period. Whenever CRAM stations assign CFP they should consider this constraint. When allocating new CFP, CRAM stations should identify the longest contention period in the IBSS time frame structure using the CFP offsets in the CFPS, and the CRAM station allocating a CFP should center the newly reserved CFP at the middle of that contention period, provided that the duration of the new contention periods before and after the newly allocated CFP remain longer than duration of both the scheduled beacon and the contended beacon periods.","As such, assuming that Orepresents the time offset between the start of SBTT period and the start of the iCFP in the IBSS CFPS,","For any two consecutive CF periods, i & k, in the IBSS CFPS where i<k, the following condition must be satisfied\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation 12\n","Where Tis duration of iCFP, Tis duration for scheduled beacon period, and Tis duration of contented beacon period.","When station in Transitioning state establishes a new IBSS, it will continue to use the elements in the IBS and the CFPS of its previous IBSS. However, the offset value for all the CF periods in the CFPS must be adjusted to new IBSS SBTT start time in order ensure that these periods still occur at the same periodic scheduled interval. The offset of these periods will be adjusted by computing new offset values based on the current timing of the start of the new IBSS Superframe. This is accomplished by computing timing offset between the start of the new IBSS Superframe that this IIMS has selected and the start of the original IBSS Superframe, then subtracting this computed timing offset value from the offset value of each CFP that was recorded in the CFPS of the original IBSS. Any negative CFP offset value will be adjusted by adding the SBTT interval to the negative offset in order determine its current offset relative to the start of the new Superframe for the new IBSS.","The following diagram depicts the transitioning of CF periods by the station establishing a new IBSS after leaving an established IBSS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0169","num":"0198"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Maintaining CF periods timing minimizes disruption of CF traffic upon IBSS initiator absence, reduces the negative impact of transient IBSS split and merge events on traffic transmitted during CF periods, and it also minimizes the probability of scheduled beacons collisions when two IBSSs overlap.","Any station in transitioning state that receives beacon message from an IBSS, or CRAM-Solicit-response frame, must abandon its attempt to establish new IBSS and transition to borders state instead. Stations in borders state, IBSS border-stations, should join the IBSS once a beacon from initiator station for that IBSS is received. No join process exchange is required if the MAC address of the IBSS-border-station was already listed in the new IBSS-beacon schedule. The station simply changes its state to Joined state and starts sending beacon at its scheduled time in the new IBSS. If the station MAC address was not already in the new IBSS beacon schedule announced in the initiator beacon, the station should send IBSS-RSV-REQ management frame and transition its state from Borders state to Join-Pending state. The station should complete the join process until it successfully reaches the Joined state.","Now if an IBSS border-station was able to receive beacons from more than one IBSS during one SBTT interval, the station should remain in borders state and should not attempt to join any IBSS until it is able to identify its dominating IBSS. An IBSS is considered a dominating IBSS whenever a CRAM station is able receive beacon frames from the initiator of that IBSS and not able to receive beacons from IIMS of any other adjacent IBSS. However, if the CRAM station is first neighbor and able to receive beacons of more than one IIMS that established the overlapping IBSSs, and if scheduled beacons are received regularly from these IIMS CRAM stations, a CRAM station operating in borders state should join a dominating IBSS; and in this that is the IBSS with lower ratio of missed scheduled beacons to IBSS-beacon-schedule-size.","Also, any station in Joined, Borders, Join-Pending, Established, or Transitioning state that discovers that it is first neighbor of IIMS of another dominating IBSS then it should abandon its IBSS and join the other IBSS; even if that station was either first neighbor of IIMS of its IBSS (Joined State) or it is the initiator of its IBSS (Transitioning state). An IBSS is considered dominating IBSS for a CRAM station whenever any of the following conditions is met:\n\n","This process allows DQMAC stations to gracefully handle IBSS join and merge conditions.","As we explained earlier, DQMAC also gracefully handles IBSS leave and IBSS split conditions; when the station that established an IBSS moves away from other stations participating in its IBSS, this IIMS station will not establish a new IBSS, instead all other stations that will miss the initiator scheduled beacons will transition to Borders state and will seize to send beacon messages upon detecting maxScheduledIIMSmissCnt consecutive missing beacon messages from the IBSS initiator station. The first station that transitions to Transitioning state shall become the IIMS for the new IBSS; this is the first IBSS station that detects at least maxIbssScheduledBeaconMissCnt consecutive missing scheduled beacon messages; this condition must occur because IBSS scheduled beacons will not be sent by all other stations that also transitioned to borders state in its IBSS when IIMS moves away. All other stations in Borders state should join the newly established IBSS and follow the new SBTT timing and adjust their local image of the IBSS beacon schedule and the CF periods schedule. These CRAM stations will join the new and dominant IBSS and will start transmitting beacons at the new scheduled time, these stations will find their MAC address already in that new IBSS beacon schedule. In addition, these stations will be able to continue sending their CF frames on their original scheduled CF periods without any jitter or delay because these CF periods should remain time aligned between previous and new IBSS.","6.2.2 CF Period Reservation Process","When operating in DQMAC on-demand mode, any station within the coverage area of an established IBSS may reserve a contention-free period, CFP, using DQMAC CFP reservation process. The reserving station must compute the Channel-Allocation-Vcctor (CAV), this is the time period that the station needs to reserve in order to be able to transmit acknowledged or unacknowledged contention free data frame in the reserved CFP. The reserving station in estimating the CAV duration should consider the full duration necessary to complete a nomial data exchange, i.e. include the time duration required to send CTS, RTS frames if they will ever be used before sending the data frame to any MS along with time required for ACK frame and also necessary Inter-Frame Space (IFS) durations required between RTS, CTS, DATA, and ACK frames. Once a CFP is reserved, the station should its CFP every SBTT interval to send data frames; it is not required to use CTS and RTS at every CFP, in fact a CFP may be used to send Multicast frame. In addition, it is not required to send frames to same destination station in all SBTT periods, nor it is required to send the same message length every SBTT period. As such reserved CFP should busy at start of its duration but becomes idle before the end of its duration; trailing end of CFP duration may be idle in some SBTT periods and could be utilized by other stations for contention traffic by stations that have received contention free frame and used its CAV in the frame header to identify when CFP exchange will terminate. Note that it is required in CAV calculation to assume that all frames transmitted during CFPs will be sent using the rate and power levels that provides the maximum range and highest SNR at receivers. This allows the duration period to be used to communicate at the same rate with any IBSS node irrespective of the distance between the source and destination nodes.","The CFP is an exclusive duration of time, Time Slot (TS), which occurs every beacon period, SBTT, at the same time offset from the start of the IBSS SBTT. CFP is allocated by IBSS CRAM station exclusively to the requesting station; once a CFP is allocated to a station, that station is the only station that can initiate any message exchange during that period.","CFP reservation should not be performed unless the reserving station expects to provide a consistent load of data with throughput, delay or delay jitter QoS constraints for extended time period, for example when a station supports multimedia applications that transmit constant traffic stream with very strict bandwidth and delay requirements. CF periods must be used in order to avoid DQMAC automatic reclaim process enforced by the IBSS CRAM stations required to detect each time a channel is idle for the entire duration of a CFP, and if the condition occurs during the same CFP in consecutive SBTT intervals exceeding the \u201cmaxCFPIdleCnt\u201d value configured for the IBSS then this is considered by these IBSS CRAM stations as an indicator that the station that that was assigned the CFP migrated away or powered down.","CFP reservation process used in DQMAC on-demand mode employs a three node exchange scheme to extend the geospatial coverage of the CFP reservation process. This approach strives to improve synchronization of CFPS across IBSS members by maximizing the number of IBSS stations that will be made aware of new CFP reservation request. CFP Reservation request frame should be sent only to station that transmitted the last scheduled beacon message in the current SBTT. CFP reservation request should not be sent to a CRAM station that sent contended beacon, and these CRAM stations shall not respond to the request if they receive it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0215"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"A station initiates a CFP reservation request by sending CF-RSV-REQ frame to the station that transmitted the scheduled beacon in the current SBTT period. This management frame must be sent using basic rate and power level that provides maximum coverage and highest SNR at receivers. The station that sent the last scheduled beacon frame for the IBSS will examine this request frame and responds by sending a CF-RSV-RSP frame that will include the CFP duration, and CFP offset information elements in its body indicating successful CFP reservation when the IBSS configured policy and current state of IBSS CFPS permit granting the requesting station a CFP. CFP request may be rejected if the maximum number of IBSS CF periods in the schedule has already been allocated. The CF-RSV-REQ frame may be rejected, if the ratio of total duration of reserved periods (P) to duration between scheduled beacon transmit period (SBTT) exceeds predetermined threshold (CFPS2SBTTratio=R), R<P\/SBTT. In addition, CF-RSV-REQ frame may be rejected, if the CF-RSV-REQ frame body includes an optional CF-desired-offset field that can't be fulfilled due to overlap with one of the currently allocated CFP in the CFPS. Also CF-RSV-REQ frame may be rejected, if the requested CFP duration exceeds the maximum allowed CFP duration; maximum allowed CFP is minimum time required to transfer max-MAC-frame size plus CTS, RTS, and ACK with three SIFS periods. And finally, as we explained earlier, CFP request may be rejected because a new CFP can not be placed within Contention period in the IBSS Superframe structure while maintaining each contention period durations long enough to accommodate schedule and contended periods should the IBSS needs to be split. Each IBSS will have its CFPS2SBTTratio (R) and Maximum size for CF Periods schedule announced in the \u201cCF Parameters\u201d information element in beacon frames.","All IBSS stations that receive CF-RSV-REQ management frame should process it similar to the station that transmitted the schedule beacon as described in the flowchart of . This will allow all IBSS stations to maintain synchronization of their local CFPS even when not all IBSS stations will be able to receive the response frame nor the next scheduled beacon frame.","Upon reception of CFP-RSVP-RESPONSE management frame by any IBSS MS that did not reserve that CFP, these MS should process the response management frame to maintain synchronization of their local CFPS. These MS should add new CFP to their local CFP as shown in the flowchart depicted in the flow chart of .","When a MS station operating in IBSS-Joined or IBSS-Established state detects that CFP was assigned to the MS that reserved it, but the CFP overlaps with one or more active CFP in the local CFPS, then the station should send IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame listing overlapping CF periods as missing CFP. Section 77.1 describes DQMAC use of IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame as an out of synchronization recovery mechanism.","A reserving station that received a response with reservation confirmation reflected by the CFP allocation information in the response will not assume successful reservation and will not be able to use this reserved CFP until it receives next scheduled beacon with CFPS information element that includes this new CFP triple with matching duration, offset, and MAC address values. The station should assume successful reservation upon receiving a successful response, only when the shared IBS consists of two members, the reserving station and the station that transmitted scheduled beacon; in addition, the reservation will be considered successful, if no beacon message was transmitted in next scheduled beacon transmission time (SBTT), and the reserving station succeeds in winning the contention for sending the beacon. Also, receiving a contended beacon with CFPS that includes the CFP triple is sufficient to indicate successful reservation; on the other hand, when receiving next beacons, contented and scheduled, with CFPS information element that does not include the CFP requested should cause the reserving station to assume unsuccessful reservation attempt; this station may retry the CFP reservation attempt again with the new station that transmitted the scheduled beacon in the current SBTT. If a station retries and succeeds in reserving CFP but later discovers that beacon frame was sent with CFPS JE that includes double allocation for the request period, the reserving station should use only one the reserved periods, and the other period should remain idle and will eventually be reclaimed by the IBSS CRAM stations.","Border stations that receive beacon messages from more than one IBSS should track overlapping region of contention periods in both IBSS, the station should use these regions to send contended messages. Also, IBSS-border stations that have reserved CFP(s) but find that any of their CFP is overlapping with CF period in the other IBSS should abandon this CFP and reserve an alternative CFP that avoids overlap with any other CFP in any of the IBSS(s) within its reception range. It should send the CF-RSV-REQ frame and setting desired offset information element value for each IBSS to ensure that it reserves CFP with proper alignment with already reserved CFPS on these adjacent IBSSs. And if border station has a reserved CFP in its IBSS and there is no conflict in its CFP alignment with all CFP(s) in the CFPS of the adjacent IBSS, then the border-station may reserve a CFP with specific offset from the other IBSS such that the reserved CFP coincides, starts and ends, with its already reserved CFP and will be allocated within a contention period within the SBTT interval of the adjacent IBSS.","6.2.3 CF Period Reclaim Process","DQMAC on-demand mode supports two methods to allow CRAM stations to reclaim bandwidth associated with a CFP when it is no longer used or needed by the MS that reserved it; these are the explicit CFP release method and the implicit CFP release method.","The explicit CFP release method allows a MS to declare to all other the IBSS stations that it is no longer needs a CFP that was previously allocated to it as indicated in the CFPS information element in the scheduled beacon transmitted during the current SBTT interval. When a station decides that it is no longer needs a CFP that has been allocated to it, it should remove that CFP from its local copy of the CFPS; then it should send RELEASE-CFP-REQ frame to the station that transmitted a scheduled beacon message. This process can be initiated when that station receives a scheduled beacon message with CFPS information element that includes a CFP allocated to it but it does not have that period in its local copy of CFPS and it does not intend to use that CFP in the near future. When RELEASE-CFP-REQ frame is received by the station that transmitted the Scheduled beacon during the current SBTT, that station should examine its CFPS in order to locate that CFP, the station should remove the CFP from its local CFPS and it should respond to that station that reserved to period and send the release request by sending RELEASE-CFP-CONFIRM if the CFP for the requesting station was located and removed. All IBSS stations that receive RELEASE-CFP-REQ or RELEASE-CFP-CONFIRM frames should remove the CFP form their local CFPS if it exists.","The implicit CFP release method is performed by all CRAM stations by reclaiming any CFP in the shared CFPS when that CFP is not used for more than maxCFPIdleCnt consecutive SBTT periods. This method allows CRAM stations to reclaim CFP bandwidth when station that reserved the CFP has moved away, powered down or failed. The CRAM station that does not detect activity during entire duration of a CFP for more than maxCFPIdleCnt consecutive SBTT periods should remove the CFP from its local copy of CFPS at that start of SBTT and before transmitting the scheduled beacon for that SBTT. CRAM stations that receive scheduled beacon that is missing CFP and find that they have not detect any activity during this duration of this CFP since the CFP was added to their CFPS should remove this CFP; however, if a CRAM station have detected activity during this CFP, then that station should send IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame to the station that sent the scheduled beacon to indicate to it that a CFP is missing from the CFPS. Next section will cover use of IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame use to handle CFPS partial sync condition within DQMAC IBSS.","7. Out-of-Sync Avoidance, Detection, and Mitigation Techniques","Maintaining common agreement on the current state of the IBS and CFPS across all IBSS stations is a prerequisite for decentralized coordinated contention free access control. DQMAC employs various techniques to ensure that changes to IBS and CFPS are controlled and disseminated to maximum number of IBSS station in efficient and effective manner. DQMAC limits changes in IBS and CFPS to single CRAM station during each SBTT interval to prevent incompatible concurrent changes by hidden stations within the IBSS; and DQMAC leverages the periodic beacon messages to confirm and disseminate changes in IBS or CFPS which eliminates the need for additional management messages. The periodic beacon messages are exploited to implement a three messages exchange procedure used to reserve CFP and during IBSS join process. This reduces the consumed bandwidth necessary to propagate changes to maximum number of IBSS stations.","These measures are designed to ensure that all IBSS stations will be able to maintain common agreement on the current state of the IBS and CFPS for their IBSS. Unfortunately, in the real world maintaining common agreement on current state of IBS and CFPS across IBSS stations is unattainable goal because of temporal imprecision in wireless communication. In general, wireless links are prone to failure and transmission errors. The mobility of the nodes further exasperates the volatility of the communication links. While the three-nodes exchanges employed by DQMAC will extend the dissemination region of messages that communicate changes in the shared state of the IBS & CFP; this technique does not guarantee that all IBSS stations will be able to receive any of the messages transmitted in a three-nodes exchange. For example, since it is permissible within an IBSS to have several CRAM stations that are not directly in range and required to participate in transmitting the IBSS scheduled beacon. These are considered hidden IBSS CRAM stations because they can't communicate directly. Any time one of these hidden CRAM stations sends a scheduled beacon, it may receive reservation or join request from any other IBSS station that was able to receive the scheduled beacon; however, this requesting IBSS station may also be hidden from one or more the other IBSS CRAM stations that were hidden from the CRAM station that sent the scheduled beacon during current SBTT; and as a result the first two messages in three-nodes exchange request updates the local image of IBSS schedule at the station that initiated the request and the station that transmitted the most recent scheduled beacon; then assuming that the next scheduled beacon is transmitted by a CRAM station that happen to be also within close proximity from both stations which implies that its beacon likely will not reach the other IBSS CRAM stations that were hidden from these three stations. As such, one or more hidden CRAM stations may not receive any of the messages in a three-nodes exchange. Now considering the wireless errors, and station mobility, this scenario could occur at any CRAM station. Subsequently, we conclude that mobility, errors, or hidden nodes phenomena common in wireless environment, may cause one or more stations to experience out-of-sync condition in its IBS or CFPS despite the three-nodes exchange scheme and other measures taken in DQMAC to maintain synchronization of IBSS beacon schedule and IBSS CF periods schedule across the IBSS stations. More over, a station may elect to sleep for short duration to save energy could become out of sync if updates occur while this node is in sleep mode.","DQMAC employ several scheme to rapidly recover and minimize the undesired side effects of IBSS out-of-sync condition. The beacon frames in DQMAC must include current state of IBS and CFPS as perceived by the station that transmitted the beacon. A scheduled Beacon frame must be sent every SBTT interval and potentially several contended beacons may also be sent during each SBTT interval. These beacon frames allow all IBSS stations that receive them to continually compare their local image of the IBS and CFPS against the IBS and CFPS as perceived by the stations that sent the beacon message. IBSS CRAM stations that detect mismatch in the IBS and CFPS will update their local image or inform the station that generated that beacon frame to allow it to update its IBS or CFPS using IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame; next sections describe this DQMAC decentralized out of synchronization recovery process in more details.","7.1 IBSS-OUT-SYNC Management Frame","DQMC detects IBS and CFPS out-of-sync condition among IBSS stations using the periodic beacon messages; and it utilizes the IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame to recover from out-of-sync among CRAM stations. The main goal of IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame is to notify the CRAM station that transmitted a beacon frame in the current SBTT interval of missing data in IBS or CFPS. The IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame generate will list missing contention free periods in the CFPS and missing CRAM stations entries in the announced IBS in the received beacon frame. Other IBSS stations able to receive that IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame will process this frame in order update their local copy of IBS and CFPS when necessary.","7.1.1 CFPS Out-of-Sync Detection and Recovery","Upon receiving a beacon frame, each MS must compare its local copy of CFPS against the CFPS in the received beacon. If the received beacon's CFPS contains CF periods that are not present in its local CFPS, then the MS should bring its local CFPS up to date by adding all those missing CF periods to its local CFPS. However, CFP addition is allowed only for each CF period that is not in local CFPS and not overlapping with any CF period in the local CFPS.

The IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame should identify all of these CFP that were missing in the received beacon.  is an exemplary flowchart of this decentralized CFPS synchronization process that must be implemented by every IBSS CRAM station.","If an IBSS MS receives a beacon frame and finds that (n) CFP in the beacon's CFPS overlaps with (m) CFP in the local CFPS, assuming that (n) and (m) are greater than one and m is greater than (n); then the MS should consider the all overlapping CF periods in its local CFPS as dominant CFPs and should treat them as missing CFPs for the station that generated the beacon during current SBTT interval, that should cause that CRAM station to issues an IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame that includes all these dominant CFPs that overlapped with the CFPs in the received beacon frame. However, if (n) was greater than (m), then the MS should consider the (n) CFPs received in the beacon as dominant CFPs. Consequently, the MS shall the replace the (m) CFPs in its local CFPS by the (n) dominant CFPs. Now, if (m) equal (n), the MS should identify the CFP with lowest MAC value by applying reverse MAC address comparison function on all the overlapping CFPs, and if the CFP with lowest MAC was already included in the MS local CFPS then the MS should consider the (m) CFPs in its local CFPS as dominant CFPs and should treat these CFPs as missing CFPs for the station that transmitted the beacon frame during current SBTT interval. Subsequently, this CRAM station shall transmit an IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame that includes (m) Missing-CF-Period lEs, one for each missing CFP. If the CFP with lowest MAC was not in the MS local CFPS, then the (n) overlapping CFPs in the received beacon are considered the dominant CFPs and should replace the (m) CFPs that overlapped with them in the LCFPS. Finally, if MS station detects that a CFP in the received beacon overlaps with one and only one CFP in its local CFPS; then this station must perform reverse compare operation of the MAC addresses, if the CFP in local CFPS is assigned to a station with smaller MAC address using reverse MAC octets compare, then station should consider the CFP in its local CFPS as dominant CFP; and should treat the CFP in its local CFPS as missing CFP that should be communicated to the station that issued the beacon frame during the current SBTT interval using the IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame. On the other hand, if the CFP within the CFPS in the received beacon is assigned to MS with smaller MAC address using reverse MAC address octets compare; then it should replace the CFP in the local CFPS. DQMAC uses reverse AMC address comparison function to identify dominant CFPs, and dominate IBSS, in order to resolve out-of-sync conditions and to identify surviving IBSS during merge and join events.","In order to reduce management overhead, any IBSS MS that detects that one or more of its reserved CFPs are missing from last scheduled beacon, it must attempt to update the CRAM station that issued the scheduled beacon during current SBTT by issuing CFP-RSV-REQ frames during current SBTT contention periods; however, if the MS receives IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE management frame that includes its missing CFPs before it was able to send CFP reservation request, then the MS should not attempt to reserve its CFPs again.","7.1.2 IBS Out-of-Sync Detection and Recovery",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0200","num":"0235"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"When local and received IBS schedules under comparison contains different CRAM stations entries at the end of the schedule or between the same station entries at each IBS then a conflicting out-of-sync condition is detected. If the IIMS is not the station the generated the beacon frame nor the station that received the beacon frame, then DQMAC requires that the CRAM station that detected the conflicting IBS out-sync-condition to combine all the entries with activity flag set found in local IBS and missing in the received IBS with conflicting CRAM entries found in the received IBS but missing from local IBS then sorts those conflicting entries using reverse MAC address comparison function. Then it should insert the sorted combination in the local IBS between the two common CRAM station entries where the conflicting out-of-sync is detected or at the end of IBS if the conflict was detected at end of IBS. Finally, the station should add after the sorted list all conflicting entries with activity flag clear found in local IBS and missing from received IBS. In addition, the CRAM station should include in IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE missing-beacon-station information element a list of all entries found in local IBS that have activity flag set and were missing and conflicting with contents of received IBS. The index of each missing-beacon-station will match the current index of that active CRAM station entry in the local IBS after the combine and sort operation is completed. Note that when a missing-beacon-station entry is added to a local IBS due to reception of IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame the activity flag for the inserted entry will be set. However, when a new entry is inserted in local IBS due to reception of beacon message then the inserted entry will have its activity flag cleared.","When IIMS is the station that transmitted the beacon message; then IIMS IBS contents shall override contents of any other CRAM station when conflicting IBS out-of-sync condition is detected. As such, no CRAM station will send to IIMS IBSS-SYNC-UPDATE frame with missing-beacon-station IEs unless these missing CRAM station are missing but not conflicting with other entries in IIMS IBS. When IIMS receives a beacon message with conflicting out-of-sync IBS entries relative to the IIMS local IBS, the IIMS will not change its IBS. As such, IIMS will not change its local IBS unless the received IBS contains a missing and non conflicting CRAM station entry.","Each CRAM station must detect when any other CRAM station in its IBSS is no longer present in the IBSS coverage in order to remove it from the IBS, the IBSS CRAM team list. Each CRAM station must monitor how often other CRAM station scheduled beacon message is not transmitted using inactivity-count attribute; and if the scheduled beacon frame was not received from a CRAM station for more than maxCRAMScheduledBeaconMissCnt consecutive extended Superframes then this CRAM station is considered absent from the IBSS coverage and shall be removed from the local IBS of the station that detected this condition.","7.2 Inter-IBSS Communication and Interference","DQMAC design incorporates techniques to minimize inter-IBSS induced collisions and interference; and supports MAC layer services to facilitate efficient inter-IBSS contention-free communication.","As we have described in section 6.2.1, a Border IBSS station is either a CRAM station that is two hops from IIMS or a CRAM station that is within one hop from the IIMS of its IBSS and currently receiving Beacon frames from another dominant IBSS but not the IIMS of the dominant IBSS. CRAM Border stations will not transmit scheduled nor contended Beacon frames until they are able to transition to Joined or established state. At every SBTT interval, IBSS MS use the CFPS received in Beacon frames and the contents of their local CFPS to be able to identify when they are permitted to transmit contention-free traffic and when they are exposed to contention-free traffic, blocked from transmission.","Beacon frames received by IBSS Border stations from their IBSS CRAM stations make them aware of when they will be exposed to contention-traffic originating from within their IBSS; and if Border stations receive Beacon frames from CRAM stations of another IBSS, then these Border station will also be able to determine when they are exposed to contention-free traffic originated from that IBSS. IBSS Border stations are required to maintain locally a Border Contention Free Periods Schedule (B-CFPS) by combining Contention-free periods from its IBSS with Contention Free Periods from the adjacent IBSSs. The start of the SBTT interval for the Border Station IBSS must be used as the time reference in computing the offset duration of each CFP entry in the B-CFPS. Moreover, when border station determines that CFP from one IBSS overlaps with another CFP in adjacent IBSS, the border station must combine these overlapping CF periods into one contiguous CFP entry in its local B-CFPS. As such, Border stations maintain a local B-CFPS by combining entries from their local CFPS and other CFPS received in beacon frames from one or more adjacent IBSS. The offset of CF periods from other IBSS is computed by calculating the offset between the start of their IBSS SBTT interval and the start of the received beacon message; note that any contended beacon contains information element that provides the offset between the start of the contended beacon frame and the start of the IBSS SBTT interval for that contended beacon. The B-SBTT allows Border stations to know when they should not transmit, blocked, in order to prevent interference with any contention free traffic transmitted by MS within their IBSS or at other adjacent IBSS. Also, the contents of the B-CFPS are useful for other MS that may need to communicate with a border station because it reveals when the border station is exposed to other traffic from any adjacent IBSS.","IBSS Border stations share their local B-CFPS with all MS within their range by contending to broadcast IBSS-Borders-Exposed-CFPS management frame during any contention period between any two consecutive CFP entries in their B-CFPS. The use of IBSS-Borders-Exposed-CFPS management frame is necessary because it is possible to have MS within range of IBSS border stations but since border stations are not allowed to send beacon frames, these MS adjacent to them will not be able to know when these Border stations will transmit contention free traffic nor when these border station are exposed to contention free traffic. To reduce management traffic overhead, once an IBSS-Borders-exposed-CFPS frame is received by any MS operating in Borders state within the same IBSS, then these border stations should not attempt to send a second IBSS-Borders-exposed-CFPS frame for MaxInterBordersExposedInterval which is a configurable count reflecting an integral multiple of SBTT period. Since all border stations compete to send IBSS-Borders-Exposed-CFPS frame, eventually, all border stations should be able to share their local B-CFPS with neighboring MS. Any MS that was able to receive IBSS-Borders-Exposed-CFPS frame from a border station should not send contention free traffic to that border station unless it is sent during a CFP allocated to the sender station as reflected in that border station B-CFPS; attempting to transmit during other periods may cause collisions and will not be acknowledged by the Border station because the Border station is blocked from transmitting. Further, a MS should not send contention traffic to border station except during contention periods as defined by offsets between start and end of CFP entries in the B-CFPS local to that Border station.","Border Station may yield the remaining duration of its reserved contention free period by sending unsolicited CTS frame to a specific station to poll it for any data ready to be sent to that border station. Alternatively, the border station may broadcast CTS to trigger any MS with pending traffic for the border station to immediately start contending to send data by selecting a random back-off period.","Border station should update their local B-CFPS every SBTT interval as they receive Beacon frames from their IBSS and other adjacent IBSSs. CRAM station operating in Border state should use their local B-CFPS instead of their local CFPS in order to identify when and how it should access the shared channel to transmit contention or contention free frames.","7.3 Control on Placement of Reserved CFP","When operating in DQMAC on-demand mode, any CRAM station may potentially experience out-of-sync condition in its local CFPS; DQMAC supports mechanism to allow a MS station to reserve a CFP with a specific time offset relative to the start of the SBTT interval. This enables a MS to update the contents of CFPS for CRAM station that sent a scheduled beacon message during current SBTT interval. DQMAC CFP-RSV-REQ frame includes Desired-Offset optional Information Element (IE) to allow any MS station when attempting to reserve a CFP to be able to dictate the offset of that period relative to the start of the SBTT interval. When a MS that reserved a CFP does not find one of its reserved CF-periods listed in the CFPS in a received scheduled beacon frame, and if the fill duration of that CFP is not overlapping with any CFP listed in the received CFPS, then that MS issues CFP-RSV-REQ to reserve that CFP again from the station that transmitted the last scheduled beacon frame, the CFP-RSV-REQ frame must include desired-offset (IE) to ensure that the assigned CFP will be at the same offset previously allocated by another CRAM station. That process should be used when a station receives CFP-RSV-RESP frame but subsequent beacon frames do not include the reserved period, or whenever any CRAM station with an out-of-sync CFPS sends a scheduled beacon frame with missing CFP that a MS station had successfully completed a three-node exchange to reserve it.","In addition, DQMAC support for reserving a CFP with explicit offset allows a Border station receiving scheduled beacon frames from more than one IBSS to be able to reserve an CFP from the second IBSS and use the desired-offset IE and duration IE in the CFP-RSV-REQ frame in order to time align the start of the newly reserved CFP from the second IBSS with a reserved CFP in its current IBSS. This allows border stations to protect traffic transmitted during CFP from interference from all stations in adjacent IBSSs. This is important because border stations do not send beacon messages and one or more MS in an adjacent IBSSs may not be able to receive beacon messages from its IBSS CRAM stations to be aware when it has an allocated CFP. When reserving a CFP from both IBSSs, the border stations should be able use that CFP to communicate with any MS within their range irrespective of which IBSS that MS is operating in.","In addition, when MS station needs to reserve a CFP without a need to request specific offset for the reserved CFP, DQMAC requires the reserving MS to include a Random time offset in the Local-Back-off-Interval IE within the CFP-RSV-REQ frame. This random period minimize the potential for undetectable traffic collisions when two different MS stations within an IBSS reserve CF periods from two different hidden CRAM stations where the CFPS changes from the first reservation is not fully propagated across the IBSS; this delay in CFPS update propagation may be result of communication errors, or MS mobility that cause temporary isolation of a subset of IBSS station. When subsequent reservations occur from CRAM stations scheduled to transmit beacons during temporary CFPS out-of-sync state will cause two overlapping CF periods to be allocated to two different MS within the same IBSS. When MS stations use their allocated period to transmit contention free traffic, this will cause collisions. The random back-off-interval computed locally using random function [R(0\u2212CWmin)] causes the reserving station to dictate a random number of slot-times to be added to the offset for the assigned CFP computed by DQMAC decentralized algorithm used uniformly in all CRAM stations. The summation of the random number of slots computed locally by the reserving MS to the optimal offset computed by CRAM station that sent the beacon should minimize the potential for the consecutive reservations to have the exact same offset from the start of SBTT. Thus, when a MS with smaller offset starts transmitting, the MS with longer offset will be able to detect the channel is busy and will not transmit its message in order to avoid collisions; instead this MS will wait for contention period to send its traffic; this MS will continue to use contention period to send its traffic until CFPS information is propagated across the IBSS and CFPS synchronization process resolves the conflict in these overlapping CF periods. As such, DQMAC employs several techniques to synchronize CFPS and to avoid collisions during CFP even when transient CFPS out-of-sync condition occurs within an IBSS.","7.4 D2QMAC Decentralized Channel Access Control","DQMAC employs decentralized Channel Access Control (CAC) algorithms to minimize collision potential during contention free periods when CFPS state is out-of-sync among one or more IBSS. During each SBTT interval, these CAC algorithms are employed locally by each IBSS MS to determine if that MS is permitted or denied the right to transmit contention free during any CFP. These CAC use the contents of the CFPS received during the SBTT along with contents of their local CFPS in order to determine when each IBSS MS is granted the right to transmit or is required to listen during each CFP. CFj={CFPk: CFPk \u03b5Aj, Sj equals first element in CFPk triple} Equation 8 shows clearly how the contents of received CFPS in beacon messages during an SBTT interval will directly influence and control access to the shared channel with respect to CFP allocation, offset and duration. Since out of synchronization of contents of CFPS in IBSS stations may cause collisions for contention free traffic; DQMC prevents potential of collisions whenever out-sync condition in CFPS occurs by allowing the CRAM stations that transmitted beacon frames to have clear influence and authority in controlling transmission during CFP for the SBTT interval that these CRAM stations sent beacon frames. Moreover, these decentralized CAC algorithm enable any MS that reside in overlapping coverage area to be able to avoid collisions with CF traffic originating from any MS within any of the IBSSs. The contents of MS station local CFPS also influence MS access to CFP along with received CFPS in beacon schedule. MS that receive more than one Beacon frame, scheduled beacon and contended beacon, and possible beacons from other IBSS, should use the intersection of its local. CFPS, and contents of several received CFPS in beacon frames as current CF periods access schedule for the current SBTT interval. The station that does not find its CFP in the intersection of CF-Periods schedule, and this CFP was not in conflict, i.e. it is not overlapping with one or more CFP reserved by other MS within its IBSS or another IBSS; then this MS is authorized to use the shared medium using contention access at the CFP duration if the station determines that the channel is idle after the CF deferral period elapses after the offset of that CFP. While this station is required to contend for the medium, this station contention transmission will have lower probability of collision because this MS should have precedence over all other stations because it is required to defer access for a shorter duration and is not required to add any back-off duration for contention window. When, more than one CFP have overlap; the station with shorter offset should be able to transmit first. However, if the overlapping CFPs have the exact offset value, then DQMAC uses reverse MAC address comparison function to determine MS with dominant CFP that will be authorized to use the CFP during current SBTT. As such, DQMAC decentralized CAC algorithms enable graceful mitigation of out-sync condition in CFPS between IBSS MSs until all these stations regain CFPS synchronization.","DQMAC decentralized Channel Access Control (CAC) algorithms allow IBSS CRAM stations to mitigate out-of-sync condition in the IBS. During each SBTT interval, the station that transmits beacon message has final authority with respect to which CRAM stations should transmit the next scheduled beacon; irrespective of the current contents of the local IBS in each CRAM station that received the beacon message. However, CRAM Stations must use reverse MAC address comparison function to resolve conflict regarding which CRAM station should send the next scheduled beacon frame for the IBSS whenever within single SBTT interval more than one beacon message is received with conflicting IBS contents impacting the next scheduled beacon MAC address. If these received beacon frames with conflicting IBS contents indicating more than one CRAM station to transmit next beacon frame, then the station with smaller MAC address using reverse MAC address comparison function should transmit the scheduled beacon and other stations with bigger MAC address should not send the scheduled beacon frame even if their local IBS indicates that they should send it. However, when IIMS is one of the stations that transmitted a beacon frame during current SBTT interval then IIMS IBS content will be used by all CRAM stations that received it to determine which CRAM station should send the next scheduled beacon for the IBSS. More over, when no beacon frames are received in a SBTT interval, then CRAM stations should use their local IBS to determine if they should send scheduled beacon frame at SBTT interval. Note that even if more than one CRAM station did assume that they are scheduled to send the next scheduled beacon and these stations attempt to transmit at the same time, other CRAM stations will not be able to receive any scheduled beacon but will be able to recover from this condition by contending to send contended beacon message.","7.5 Prioritized Deferral Periods","CAC employs different interframe space durations for Beacon transmission, CFP transmission, and contention transmission in order to avoid collisions in the shared channel even when for any reason one or more stations operating in geospatial region were not able to receive beacon messages and their local perception with respect to common shared channel allocation in regard to the timing of the start of the SBTT interval, and contents of their CFPS is different from another set of stations operating on the same geospatial region with a different IBSS SBTT start timing and CFPS assignments. DQMAC ensures that proper precedence is given to a CRAM station attempting to send beacon frame by assigning shorter beacon interframe space duration than CFP interframe space duration and Contention interframe duration. This will ensure that when medium is idle, the station that needs to send a beacon frame will be able to send this frame before other stations attempting to send CFP or contention frames. Beacon frame transmission will help other stations to resolve the undesired out-of-sync conditions among all stations sharing the common channel. Also, even in out-of-sync situation, if a station attempts to send a CFP frame assuming the all stations will be blocked, and if one or more stations attempt to contend to send frames on the idle channel because these stations were not able to receive CFPS in beacon frame to inform them that the channel is allocated for CFP transmission. The station sending a CFP frame should be able to starting sending its CFP frame and force the other stations contending to send a frame to suspend their attempt and await the channel to become idle; because the station sending CFP frame is required to wait for the shorter CFP interframe space interval before sending its CFP frame and the other stations contending to send contention frames are required to await and sense that the channel will remain idle for the longer contention interframe space duration. As such, delay intolerant CFP traffic shall not be impacted by contention traffic even when stations operating in a common channel and within same geospatial area have significant different prospective with respect to time reference and allocation of contention free periods.","8.
