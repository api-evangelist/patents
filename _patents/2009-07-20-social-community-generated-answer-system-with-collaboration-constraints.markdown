Technical Field","This disclosure relates to collaboration methods and systems that communicate across computer networks to obtain collaboration input from social networks.","2. Related Art","Obtaining useful information in a collaborative manner has only increased in difficulty despite tremendous increases in connectivity and the proliferation of portable communication devices. In today's competitive society, having in possession useful information at the right time and place is essential and is one of the keys to success in a competitive business environment. Furthermore, there is a significant need for obtaining useful information in purely social contexts as well, such as the need for friends to collaborate to determine when and where to meet.","Today, computer servers on the Internet implement powerful search engines that greatly improve upon prior manual information gathering processes. Anyone seeking information can enter a search query on a user interface provided on a device connected to the Internet. The search engines search for matches to the query and return the most relevant matches to the user interface. While Internet search engines greatly facilitate locating useful information, the searches were still limited to finding individual closest matches from a pre-existing pool of information.","Therefore, a need exists to address the problems noted above and others previously experienced.","Methods and systems for social network collaboration provide a more efficient and effective way of obtaining useful information. The methods and systems obtain a source collaboration message from a message source, and obtain inputs from members of a social network in response to the source collaboration message. Collaboration constraints are applied to the inputs, and the methods and systems aggregate the inputs to produce a single focused response. As a result, the methods and systems help obtain more relevant and accurate input on any particular subject raised by the message source by providing demand-driven, collaborative information production.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102"]},"Once the collaboration system receives the source collaboration message, the collaboration system searches through a Knowledge Base  to determine whether pre-existing responses to the source collaboration message () exist in the Knowledge Base . The Knowledge Base  may be implemented as a computer database or other data repository, and may store any information, including responses to other prior source collaboration messages. If the collaboration system finds a relevant response in the Knowledge Base , the collaboration system returns the response to the message source. The degree of relevancy of the response required for the collaboration system to return the response to the message source may be varied by the message source, the collaboration system, or by another entity. Despite how relevant the collaboration system considers the relevant response to be, the collaboration system may query for input from members of one or more social networks with respect to the source collaboration message.","Accordingly, whether or not the collaboration system finds a relevant response in the Knowledge Base  (), the collaboration system may transmit the source collaboration message to the network members of a social network selected by the message source (). The social network may be, for example, a group of friends, members of a contact list, members of a company department, or members of an on-line social community, such as the Facebook\u2122 community, Twitter\u2122 community, or other social community.","When the network members receive the source collaboration message, they may choose to provide input to the source collaboration message. As will be described in more detail below, the collaboration system imposes collaboration constraints on input from network members. For example, when the first network member responds with input on the source collaboration message, the collaboration system may limit the network member's input according to a collaboration constraint (). The collaboration constraint may be, for example, a maximum number of characters that the network member may provide for their response to the source collaboration message. In one implementation, the maximum number of characters is 250, but other implementations may set the maximum number of characters at another number, or apply different collaboration constraints additionally or alternatively. The collaboration system aggregates the input provided by the first network member into an aggregated collaboration response. Initially, the aggregated collaboration response may be blank or empty, and the first iteration of the aggregated collaboration response may include only the input from the first network member. In other implementations, the aggregated collaboration response may initially be pre-populated with any desired initial information, rather than begin as blank.","Once the first network member to respond has completed their input, subsequent network members may begin providing further input on the source collaboration message (). The collaboration system may also limit subsequent network members' inputs by one or more collaboration constraints. Subsequent network members may either validate the input provided by one or more prior network members, or improve the current version of the aggregated collaboration response by adding, deleting, or modifying all or part of the aggregated collaboration response. The collaboration system aggregates the inputs by each subsequent network member into the aggregated collaboration response. Accordingly, the aggregated collaboration response captures the net effect of the sequence of inputs by each network member.","The collaboration system may allow or disallow (e.g., based on a setting or preference entered by the message source) a network member to choose to re-transmit the source collaboration message, or the current aggregated collaboration response, to another social network. In other words, the collaboration system may allow any given network member to forward the source collaboration message or response to an additional social network. As a result, the members of multiple social networks may provide further input on the source collaboration message or the currently pending input on the source collaboration message. The system may also implement a privilege feature which allows a network member to forward the source collaboration message only to an authorized social network.","Once the network members have provided input on the source collaboration message, the aggregated collaboration response is returned to the message source. However, beforehand, the collaboration system may enforce one or more completion constraints on the source collaboration message. For example, a completion constraint may specify that a maximum or minimum number of network member inputs are required before returning the aggregated collaboration message, that at least a minimum time or no more than a maximum time (or both) is allowed for obtaining inputs from network members, or other collaboration constraint. The collaboration system may also index the aggregated collaboration response in the Knowledge Base  for future reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","202","204","206","120","202","208","206","210","200","289","299","210","210","200","289","299","289","299","210","210"]},"The system  receives and stores in the memory  a source collaboration message  obtained from a message source via a particular message source device (e.g., the message source ). The memory also includes an aggregated collaboration response  which will be returned to the message source after the system  has generated it based upon inputs received from the network members via network member devices .

The source message input field  may provide the local data store for a source message input field displayed on a message source device and may receive the source collaboration message  from the message source. The collaboration input field  may provide the local data store for inputs received from network member devices  and obtained through input fields displayed on the network member devices .","A first social network definition  is also stored in the memory . The first social network definition  contains a first social network identifier (ID)  and one or more network member identifiers (ID) . As described above, the system  may interact with additional social networks, such as the network represented by the second social network definition . The additional social network definitions may be social networks established, defined, or specified by any network member of a different social network.  shows an example in which the network member  of the first social network has specified that he or she is connected to a second social network, as defined by the second social network definition . The second social network definition  includes a second social network ID , and one or more network member identifiers (ID) .","The memory  also includes a collaboration program . The collaboration program  implements logic, (e.g., using as processor executable instructions), that when executed by the processor , causes the processor to carry out the social network collaboration processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","250","200","250","216","222","216","222","204","302","250","212","304","212","216","222","212","204","306"]},"Turning briefly to , that figure shows an example of a source message input interface  displayed on the message source device . The source message input interface  provides the interface through which the program  may receive the source collaboration message , the collaboration constraints , the completion constraints , or other information from the message source device . In the example shown in , the source message input interface  displays a prompt  for a source collaboration message, a source message input field  and an \u201cask\u201d button  which triggers the message source device to communicate the source collaboration information to the program .","The message source device may further display a completion constraint prompt  for a completion constraint, a completion constraint input field  through which the message source device may receive a completion constraint. In the example shown in , the completion constraint specifies that an answer must be returned no later than May 23 at 11 am. The message source device may also display a collaboration constraint prompt and collaboration constraint input field through which the collaboration program  may receive a collaboration constraint. Furthermore, the message source device may provide input fields through which the message source device specifies social network definitions for the program , such as the first and second social network definitions  and .","Referring back to , the program  subsequently searches through the knowledge base  for relevant information stored in the knowledge base that may be responsive to the source collaboration message  (). The knowledge base  may be a computer database or any other information repository in which information may be indexed and stored. If a suitable response is found in the knowledge base , the response is returned to the message source () (e.g., the message source device ). The criteria that define whether any one or more search results are deemed suitable may be hardcoded in the program , obtained as inputs from the message source, or may be established in other ways.","The program  may continue with community collaboration even after a suitable response is found. As examples, the program  may be preconfigured to always continue with submission of the source collaboration message to the social network, or the program  may query the message source device whether or not to proceed with submission to the social network. If the program  will not submit the source collaboration message, the program may prompt the message source for additional source collaboration messages. If a negative reply is received, the program  will finish. If a positive reply is received, the program  may return to (). The prompt for the reply may be made on the source message input interface  and the reply may be made by typing in the source message input field, clicking on a prompt, or in another manner.","If the program  does not find a suitable item of information in the knowledge base  or the program will otherwise submit the source collaboration message, then the program identifies the first social network definition  using the first social network ID  (). Once the first social network definition  is identified, the program  identifies the network members  of the first social network, to which the source collaboration message  is to be submitted (). The program  then transmits the source collaboration message to the network members  ().","As discussed above, the program  may receive the social network definition from the message source or the social network definitions may be predefined in the memory . In addition, the program  may allow the message source to utilize social network grouping methods such as the methods available on Facebook\u2122 Filters or Groups to indicate a subset of the entire available social network to which the source collaboration message  may be transmitted. In one embodiment, the program  may submit the source collaboration message  to the entire available social network by default, unless otherwise specified by the message source. In other words, the message source may specify to the program  to communicate the source collaboration message to selected individuals within the social network definition, rather than the entire social network.","The program  may further receive from the message source a privilege definition  defining the scope of social network to which the program may transmit the source collaboration message . The privilege definition  may also be predefined in the memory  by an organization to which the message source belongs. The organization may define the privilege definition  based on the identity of the message source, taking into account, for example, message source's title, length of time with the organization, and prior experience with the message source. For example, a chief executive officer (CEO) of an organization may be associated with a privilege definition  which allows the CEO to transmit a source collaboration message  to the entire organization, while a chief legal counsel may be associated with a privilege definition which allows the counsel to transmit a source collaboration message only to the legal department.","The program  may transmit the source collaboration message  to the network member  by transmitting the source collaboration message to a network member device  for that particular network member. In one embodiment, the program  may transmit the source collaboration message  to the network members  in a sequential manner, based on a predefined transmission algorithm. Factors that the transmission algorithm may use to determine the order in which the source collaboration message  is delivered may include, but are not limited to:","a. past likeliness to answer inquiries generally,","b. past likeliness to answer the particular message source,","c. probability that the network member has knowledge on the subject at hand,","d. presence; and","e. an explicit sequence as specified by the message source","The program  may determine factors a. and b. by consulting the knowledge base , which may store information regarding the network members  or  who have previously responded to source collaboration messages . The program  may determine the factor c. by searching an expert database which may be coupled to the system , which stores information relating to the network members' expertise. The program  may determine factor d. by reading a presence indicator which indicates whether or not network members are currently available. The indicator may be, for example, the on-\/off-line indicator implemented in presence systems such as Microsoft\u2122 Office Communicator\u2122. In one implementation, sequentially transmitting the message source , the logic that program  may implement may include transmitting the source collaboration message  to a network member, waiting until the network member has provided an input or until a predetermined condition is met, and transmitting the source collaboration message to the next network member.","In other embodiments, the program  may transmit the source collaboration message  in parallel (i.e., transmit the source collaboration message to multiple network members  at the same time). The program  may also receive inputs from the network members in a collaborative authoring manner, which may be near-real-time.","The program  may also lock the collaboration input field  so that only one network member may provide input at a time. In other words, once a network member begins the input process, the program  may prevent the collaboration input field  from receiving input from other network members. The program  may unlock the message and another network member may provide input after the previous network member has concluded the input process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","250","250","212","299","236"]},"As shown in the example in , the network member device  may display a network member device interface , including the source collaboration message , a message source identifier  identifying the message source, and a network member identifier , identifying the network member . The network member device  may receive an indication to provide input in response to the source collaboration message  from the network member  by providing, for example, a button  on which the network member may click. In case the program  transmits the source collaboration message to the network members sequentially, in the absence of network member's indication to provide input in response to the source collaboration message, the program  may wait until a predefined period of time elapses, and allow another network member to provide input. When the network member  provides an indication to provide input, the network member device  may display the collaboration input field  (). In case where the program  transmits the source collaboration message to the network members in parallel, the network member device  may not display the collaboration input field  and the program may prevent the network member from providing the input if another network member is currently providing input to the source collaboration message  (the collaboration input field  is \u201clocked\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["299","702","702","212","703","704","706","708","710","703","232","250","703","232","232","703","236","212","212","250","216","214","232","703","250","712","714","716","718"]},"If a network member desires to provide a text input, the network member may click on the \u201cimprove answer\u201d button , and the program  may receive input on the collaboration input field interface . The program  may also receive an indication of validation as an input from the network members . A network member may provide an indication of validation as a means to indicate approval of the current aggregated collaboration response . The network members  may \u201cvalidate\u201d the text inputs from previous network members (current aggregated collaboration response  which may be displayed on the collaboration input field interface ) by, for example, clicking on the \u201cvalidate answer\u201d button . The input interface  may further display the number of network members who have provided text input () and the number of network members who have validated the text inputs (). After the program  receives input (text input or indication of validation) from the network member, the program may aggregate the input into the aggregated collaboration response  when the network member indicates a desire to submit by, for example, clicking on the submit button . The input interface  may also display the collaboration constraint indicator  which reminds the network member of the collaboration constraint  that is in effect.","Referring back to , once the network member device  displays the input interface , the program  may receive an indication from the network member to transmit the source collaboration message  to a second social network. The program  may receive such indication, for example, when the network member  clicks on the \u201csend to friends\u201d button . After receiving the indication to transmit the source collaboration message  to the second social network, the program  identifies the second social network definition  based on the second social network ID  (). Once the second social network definition  is identified, the program  identifies the network members  of the second social network, to which the source collaboration message  is to be submitted (). The program  then transmits the source collaboration message  to the second network members  (). A network member device  may display the source collaboration message  transmitted to the network members .","The program  determines whether or not the completion constraint  is met. If the completion constraint  is not met, in one embodiment the program  further determines whether or not the network member providing the input is an initial network member providing the input. If the network member providing the input is an initial network member (e.g., no network member has provided an input in response to the source collaboration message  before), the program  locks the collaboration input field  so that only the initial network member may provide input to the collaboration input field  (). The program , as discussed above, may also assign a unique characteristic to each text input of the network member  or  made onto the collaboration input field  (). The program  may then obtain an initial text input on the collaboration input field  (), subject to the completion constraint . If the collaboration constraint  is violated, the program  causes the network member device  to display a warning to the initial network member, prompting the initial network member to provide an input conforming to the completion constraint (). When an input conforming to the completion constraint  and an indication of desire to submit the input is received, the program  unlocks the collaboration input field  so that other network members may provide further input responsive to the source collaboration message  (), and the input is aggregated into the aggregated collaboration response  (). In an embodiment of the system, each time new input is aggregated into the aggregated collaboration response , the program  may also store the aggregated collaboration response in an aggregated collaboration response (\u201cACR\u2019) history repository . The ACR history repository may be retained in the memory , the knowledge base , or other database, along with the network member ID of the network member who provided the latest input, a timestamp for the latest input, or other identifying data. Each time a new input is aggregated into the aggregated collaboration response , a new entry may be created and stored in the ACR history repository . Thus, the ACR history repository  may store a \u201csnapshot\u201d of each of the aggregated collaboration responses as it exists after each input by a network member is aggregated into the aggregated collaboration response . A \u201csnapshot\u201d may refer to the contents of the aggregated collaboration response at a certain point of time, or after a certain number of inputs have been received.","If the network member providing input in response to the source collaboration message  is not an initial network member (e.g. a network member has provided an input in response to the source collaboration message  before), the program  stores the aggregated collaboration response  onto the collaboration input field  and the network member device  displays its contents on the collaboration input field interface  (). The program  further assigns a unique characteristic to each text input of the network members  or  (). An input may be obtained from the network member (), subject to the completion constraint  that are active or selected by the message source. If the collaboration constraint  is violated, the network member device  displays a warning to the network member, prompting the network member to provide an input conforming to the completion constraint (). As with the initial network member, the input may be a text input made onto the collaboration input field  via the collaboration input field interface . However, in the case of a non-initial network member, as discussed above, the network member may also provide an indication of validation of the text input provided by previous network members (the text inputs are represented by the aggregated collaboration response  displayed on the collaboration input field interface ). The number of network members who have validated the aggregated collaboration response  may be stored in a validation count , which may be stored in the memory . In other embodiments the validation count  may be stored in the aggregated collaboration response . When the program  receives an input conforming to the completion constraint  and an indication of desire to submit, the program aggregates the input into the aggregated collaboration response  (). In one embodiment the validation count  is reset each time a new text input is aggregated into the aggregated collaboration response . A record of each aggregated collaboration response with the corresponding validation count may be stored in the memory .","Other embodiments are also possible, where the program  may lock\/unlock the collaboration input field  also for the non-initial network members, or the program may not lock the collaboration input field for both the initial and non-initial network members. In addition, a \u201ctext input\u201d may also include any non-validation type of input which adds, deletes or modifies the information already present in the aggregated collaboration response . In other implementations, the inputs gathered from the network members may include audio (e.g., spoken commentary), video, or other types of input.","After program  aggregates the inputs into the aggregated collaboration response , the program  may again determine whether or not a network member has selected to transmit the source collaboration message  to another social network and whether or not the completion constraint  is met. The program  may return the aggregated collaboration response  to the message source if the completion constraint  is met (). At the same time, or after the aggregated collaboration response  is returned to the message source, program  may store the aggregated collaboration response in the knowledge base  as discussed above (). The ACR history repository  may also be returned to the message source.","The program  may determine whether or not to store the aggregated collaboration response  in the knowledge base . Examples of how the program  may determine whether to store the aggregated collaboration response include, but are not limited to the following:","Asker's Privilege: In this case, the program  may receive an indication from the message source whether or not the aggregated collaboration response is to be stored in the knowledge base . This indication may be received in response to a prompt and input interface displayed on the source message input interface  at the time source collaboration message is received, or received on a prompt and input interface displayed on a message source interface  (as shown in , which will be explained in further detail below) after the aggregated collaboration response  is returned to the message source.","Community Privilege: In this case, the program  may store the aggregated collaboration response  in the knowledge base  whenever the validation count  is greater than a validation threshold. Validation threshold may be a predefined number which may be stored in the memory .","Hybrid Privilege (AND Boolean): In this case, the program  may store the aggregated collaboration response  in the knowledge base  if the validation count  is greater than the validation threshold and the program receives an indication from the message source to store the collaboration response in the knowledge base (Asker's Privilege AND Community Privilege is satisfied).","Hybrid Privilege (OR Boolean): In this case, the program  may store the aggregated collaboration response  in the knowledge base  either when the validation count  is greater than the validation threshold, or the program receives an indication from the message source to store the collaboration response in the knowledge base (Asker's Privilege OR Community Privilege is satisfied).","After returning the aggregated collaboration response the program  may allow the message source to revise the source collaboration message and\/or revise the completion constraint and re-transmit the source collaboration message to the network members for a responsive input. In addition, the program  may also allow the message source to review the snapshots of the aggregated collaboration response stored in the ACR history repository .

The logic may also be encoded in a signal that bears the logic as the signal propagates from a source to a destination.","In addition, the system  may be implemented as a particular machine. For example, the particular machine may include a CPU, GPU, and software library for carrying out the logic implemented in the collaboration program noted above. Thus, the particular machine may include a CPU, a GPU, and a memory that stores the collaboration program described above. Adding the collaboration program may include building function calls into applications from a software library that handle the receiving, storing, transmitting, determining, enforcing, and aggregating logic noted above or providing an API call wrapper and program logic to handle the processing noted above. However, the applications or execution environment of the applications may be extended in other ways to cause the interaction with collaboration program.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
