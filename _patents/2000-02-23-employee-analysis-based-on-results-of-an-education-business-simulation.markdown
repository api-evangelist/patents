Using this same data the Web-based training market will grow at a rate higher than 20% per year. During a similar timeframe, Training Magazine predicts that total U.S. training market will grow to approximately $72 billion by 2002. Web-based training currently represents a very small percent of overall training budgets in the U.S. (note: these are U.S. only statistics) and will continue growing at a healthy rate going forward.","When building a knowledge based system or expert system, at least two disciplines are necessary to properly construct the rules that drive the knowledge base, the discipline of the knowledge engineer and the knowledge of the expert. The domain expert has knowledge of the domain or field of use of the expert system. For example, the domain expert of an expert for instructing students in an automotive manufacturing facility might be a process control engineer while the domain expert for a medical instruction system might be a doctor or a nurse. The knowledge engineer is a person that understands the expert system and utilizes the expert's knowledge to create an application for the system. In many instances, the knowledge engineer and domain expert are separate people who have to collaborate to construct the expert system.","Typically, this collaboration takes the form of the knowledge engineer asking questions of the domain expert and incorporating the answers to these questions into the design of the system. This approach is labor intensive, slow and error prone. The coordination of the two separate disciplines may lead to problems. Although the knowledge engineer can transcribe input from the expert utilizing videotape, audio tape, text and other sources, efforts from people of both disciplines have to be expended. Further, if the knowledge engineer does not ask the right questions or asks the questions in an incorrect way, the information utilized to design the knowledge base could be incorrect. Feedback to the knowledge engineer from the expert system is often not available in prior art system until the construction is completed. With conventional system, there is a time consuming feedback loop that ties together various processes from knowledge acquisition to validation.","Educational systems utilizing an expert system component often suffer from a lack of motivational aspects that result in a user becoming bored or ceasing to complete a training program. Current training programs utilize static, hard-coded feedback with some linear video and graphics used to add visual appeal and illustrate concepts. These systems typically support one \u201ccorrect\u201d answer and navigation through the system is only supported through a single defined path which results in a two-dimensional generic interaction, with no business model support and a single feedback to the learner of correct or incorrect based on the selected response. Current tutorial systems do not architect real business simulations into the rules to provide a creative learning environment to a user.","Analyzing employees based on results of an education business simulation. A network is utilized to present a training simulation to a user such as an employee for achieving a training goal. Information is integrated into the training simulated utilizing the network that helps motivate achievement of the goal by the user. For example, integrated information may include information for helping the user develop skills for more efficiently achieving the goal. Progress of the user towards achieving the goal is measured utilizing the network. This progress measurement may include, for example, tracking skill areas that the user has difficulty mastering. For further motivating achievement of the goal, feedback is also provided to the user utilizing the network. There are three levels of feedback where each is progressively more detailed and is selected based on the number of mistakes made by the user. The user's progress towards the goal is subsequently reported to the employer of the user utilizing the network.","In an aspect of the present invention, the goal may be one of: (1) service excellence for teaching the user skills in handling a high percentage of customer calls correctly; (2) billing excellence for teaching the user skills for consistently making decision and taking actives that lead to correct customer bills; (3) sales and marketing excellence for teaching the user skills in increasing sales of products and services, (4) deregulation transition excellence for teaching the user skills for correctly responding in competitive scenarios, (5) commercial\/industrial excellence for teaching the user skills for increasing revenue, customer satisfaction, and retention, (6) credit and collections excellence for teaching the user skills that help increase revenue and decrease bad debts, and (7) back office excellence for teaching the user skills that increase throughput of back office work items. In another aspect of the present invention, the goal may include at least one business objective and at least one learning objective.","In an embodiment of the present invention, information indicative of the goal may be presented utilizing the network prior to the presenting of the training simulation. In another embodiment of the present invention, the measurement of the user's progress may be stored in a database utilizing the network sot that the measurement of the user's progress may be compared to a measurement of the progress of subsequent other users.","In an additional aspect of the present invention, the network may be a wide area network capable of communicating using TCP\/IP and IPX protocol. In yet a further aspect, the training simulation may be displayed in a browser such as an Internet browser like Microsoft's MS Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A representative hardware environment is depicted in , which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with one embodiment having a central processing unit , such as a microprocessor, and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in  includes a Random Access Memory (RAM) , Read Only Memory (ROM) , an I\/O adapter  for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units  to the bus , a user interface adapter  for connecting a keyboard , a mouse , a speaker , a microphone , and\/or other user interface devices such as a touch screen (not shown) to the bus , communication adapter  for connecting the workstation to a communication network (e.g., a data processing network) and a display adapter  for connecting the bus  to a display device .","The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT or WINDOWS\/95 Operating System (OS), the IBM OS\/2 operating system, the MOS, or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on other platforms and operating systems.","An embodiment of the present invention of the present invention is written using JAVA, C, and the C++ language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming (OOP) has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development, various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP.","OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects, including the steps of analyzing the problem, designing the system, and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures, it can be visualized as a self-sufficient component that does not require other additional structures, procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP, therefore, views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components, called objects, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data, structures, and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.","In general, OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run-time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects, which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint, from which many objects can be formed.","OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example, the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition-relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality, a piston engine comprises a piston, valves and many other components; the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.","OOP also allows creation of an object that \u201cdepends from\u201d another object. If there are two objects, one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic, then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine; its piston is made of ceramic. In this case, the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object, and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine \u201cdepends from\u201d the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.","When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine, it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However, the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics, which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics, but may have the same underlying functions associated with it (e.g., how many pistons in the engine, ignition sequences, lubrication, etc.). To access each of these functions in any piston engine object, a programmer would call the same functions with the same names, but each type of piston engine may have different\/overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.","With the concepts of composition-relationship, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact, our logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object-oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows:\n\n","With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters, OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality, whether that reality is a physical entity, a process, a system, or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything, the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.","If 90% of a new OOP software program consists of proven, existing components made from preexisting reusable objects, then only the remaining 10% of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90% already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects, the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10% of the program. As a result, OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other, previously built objects.","This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub-assemblies. OOP technology, therefore, makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components, which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.","Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition-relationship. With the advent of the C++ language, many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C++ is an OOP language that offers a fast, machine-executable code. Furthermore, C++ is suitable for both commercial-application and systems-programming projects. For now, C++ appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers, but there is a host of other OOP languages, such as Smalltalk, Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and Eiffel. Additionally, OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.","The benefits of object classes can be summarized, as follows:\n\n","Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex, more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus, windows, dialog boxes, and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.","Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming, the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks, but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish, and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks, calculating a mathematical table, or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.","The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user, rather than program logic, to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today, most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse, keyboard, and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer's code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead, a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users, the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless, individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks, and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it's called by the event loop. Application code still \u201csits on top of\u201d the system.","Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus, windows, and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together, programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently, they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.","Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However, because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows, supports copy and paste, and so on, the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control, and the programmer's code is called only when the framework needs it (e.g., to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure).","A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user (as is also true for event loop programs), but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways, as opposed to isolated programs, having custom code, being created over and over again for similar problems.","Thus, as is explained above, a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior (e.g., for menus and windows), and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.","There are three main differences between frameworks and class libraries:\n\n","Thus, through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks, significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. An embodiment of the present invention of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to implement documents on the Internet together with a general-purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners-Lee, D. Connoly, \u201cRFC 1866: Hypertext Markup Language\u20142.0\u201d (November 1995); and R. Fielding, H, Frystyk, T. Berners-Lee, J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul, \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol\u2014HTTP\/1.1: HTTP Working Group Internet Draft\u201d (May 2, 1996). HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879; 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).","To date, Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently, HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web-based solutions. However, HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas:\n\n","Sun Microsystem's Java language solves many of the client-side problems by:\n\n","With Java, developers can create robust User Interface (UI) components. Custom \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g., real-time stock tickers, animated icons, etc.) can be created, and client-side performance is improved. Unlike HTML, Java supports the notion of client-side validation, offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic, real-time Web pages can be created. Using the above-mentioned custom UI components, dynamic Web pages can also be created.","Sun's Java language has emerged as an industry-recognized language for \u201cprogramming the Internet.\u201d Sun defines Java as: \u201ca simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic, buzzword-compliant, general-purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform-independent Java applets.\u201d Java applets are small, specialized applications that comply with Sun's Java Application Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to add \u201cinteractive content\u201d to Web documents (e.g., simple animations, page adornments, basic games, etc.). Applets execute within a Java-compatible browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator) by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint, Java's core feature set is based on C++. Sun's Java literature states that Java is basically, \u201cC++ with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution.\u201d","Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies, to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation, 3-D virtual reality, video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards, work on multiple platforms, and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group's building blocks are called ActiveX Controls, small, fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language (HTML) pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C++, Borland Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and, in the future, Microsoft's development tool for Java, code named \u201cJakarta.\u201d ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework, allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.","Improving Employee Performance","Over the next decade, human performance will be the most important differentiator in a future world where access to technology, customers, and markets no longer provide significant entry barriers. As such, companies must link improvements in human performance to overall business performance, effectively \u201ccreating new business value through people.\u201d Improved human performance will result in better business performance.","A solution for improving human performance is training. For a training program to be an effective performance-based program, a number of elements are recommended:\n\n","There are many potential benefits from business offerings utilizing this model for training. A potential benefit includes making employees more successful at their jobs\u2014business simulations maximize retention & reinforcement of desired employee behaviors. A second potential benefit includes addressing high business impact skill areas\u2014regulated & retail energy suppliers\u2014areas of significant cost or customer service impact. A third potential benefit includes tailoring to each employer's specific business needs and objectives\u2014cost effective delivery through common business process & technology platform. A fourth potential benefit includes delivering training to the point of need\u2014Internet-based\u2014anytime, anywhere.","A fifth potential benefit includes developing content rapidly\u2014leverage platform\/training assets while facilitating client involvement\/approval. A sixth potential benefit includes improving management insight\u2014summary & detail reporting of utilization, certification, scoring, and feedback. A seventh potential benefit includes minimizing fixed training investment\u2014pay-per-use model\u2014costs are tied to training benefits (assessment). An eighth potential benefit includes making training more successful\u2014give training another toolset to address training requirements proactively.","Business simulations may serve as the basis for delivering such performance and provide a learning environment that enables participants to acquire technical and social skills better (i.e., with higher retention) and faster (i.e., less time to competence) by:roviding a goal, simulating the workplace (with a focus on application of knowledge and skills), providing a risk-free environment, allowing the learner to make mistakes, allowing the learner to set own pace, providing support\/resources\/expertise as needed, and allowing performance to confirm employee's competence.","In an illustrative embodiment of the present invention a customer service curriculum may be implemented to provide excellent customer service, decrease costs, and increase revenue through employee skills development.  illustrates a model for focusing the core principles  on various types of employees including new hire employees , current employees , specific targeted employees . One module that may be included in the customer service curriculum is a service excellence module for teaching employees to handle 99% of all call types correctly the first time, within AHT goals, while referring zero calls. In this module, the following sub-modules maybe included: (1) Resolve Billing Inquiries, (2) Effective High Bill Resolution, (3) Efficient Call Handling, (4) Proactive Customer Problem Solving, (5) Issue Change Meter Orders, (6) Issue New Service Requests, (7) The Benefits of EFT, (8) Maintain Account Information, (9) Issue Outages and Emergencies, (10) Issue Service Orders, and (11) Issue Connects\/Disconnects. Another module that may be included in the customer service curriculum is a billing excellence module for teaching employees to consistently make decisions and take actions that lead to correct customer bills. In this module, the following sub-modules may be included: (1) Resolve Billing Inquiries, (2) Adjustments: When are they appropriate, (3) Effective High Bill Resolution, (4) Initial Billing Issue Analysis, (5) Budget Billing: When, How, and Why?, (6) Issue Change Meter Orders, (7) Summary Billing as a Service, (8) Resolve Non-service Billing Issues, (9) Resolve Miscellaneous Order Issues, (10) The Benefits of EFT, and (11) Obligations: When are they appropriate.","A third module that may be included in the customer service curriculum is a sales and marketing excellence module for teaching employees skills for increasing sales of products and services. In this module, the following sub-modules may be included: (1) Effective Marketing and CRM, (2) Effective Cross-selling, (3) Know Your Customer, (4) Value-added Products and Services, (5) Billing-related Products and Services, (6) Efficiency Products and Services, and (7) Non-regulated Products and Services.","An additional module that may be included in the customer service curriculum is a deregulation transition excellence module for teaching employees skills for responding to competitive scenarios correctly 99% or the time. In this module, the following sub-modules may be included: (1) What is Deregulation, (2) Understanding the Energy Merchant's Role, (3) Understanding the Energy Merchant's Code of Conduct, (4) Understanding the ISO\/PX, (5) Effective Marketing and CRM, (6) Effective Cross-selling, (7) Understanding the Components of an Unbundled Bill, (8) Understanding Different Billing Models, (9) Electronic Communications: Understanding EDI, (10) Understanding Enrollment and Registration, (11) Understanding Exception Processing, and (12) Understanding Order Tracking.","A further module that may be included in the customer service curriculum is a commercial\/industrial excellence module for teaching employees how to increase revenue, customer satisfaction and retention. In this module, the following sub-modules may be included: (1) Effective Marketing and CRM, and (2) Effective Rate Selection and Calculation.","A credit and collections excellence module may also be included in the customer service curriculum for teaching employees skills for helping to increase revenue and to decrease bad debt. In this module, the following sub-modules may be included: (1) Understanding the Collections Process, (2) Extensions, Arrangements, and Agreements, and (3) Understanding Deposits, Returned Checks, and Bad Debt.","Yet another module that may be included in the customer service curriculum is a back office excellence module for teaching employees skills for increasing throughput of back office work items. In this module, the following sub-modules may be included: (1) Effective Service Order Dispatching and Completion, (2) Understanding Meter Reading and Reroutes, and (3) Resolve Miscellaneous Order Issues, (4) Efficient Work Item Management and Completion.","Sub-modules are designed to translate business objectives into learning objectives in order to achieve business benefits. As an illustrative example, for a high bill sub-module (in the billing excellence module) the business objective may be to improve the ability to effectively & consistently address high bill complaints. From this business objective, the derived learning objectives may include teaching employees skills for initial customer interaction responses, analyzing root cause of complaints, proper responses to complaints, and correct customer interaction styles. These learning objectives will help achieve business benefits such as increasing customer satisfaction through consistent customer interactions, reinforcing behaviors (selling, collections, etc) to meet business objectives, and reducing lost time\/effort resulting from resolution errors. As another illustrative example, in a no bill sub-module (again in the billing excellence module) the business objective may be to improve the identification and quick resolution of no billed accounts by employees. In such a sub-module, the learning objectives may include correctly identifying no bill accounts, quickly analyzing cause of no bill, identifying correct simple no bill fixes, and correctly referring difficult no bills. The potential business benefits from such a sub-module may include the increased ability of more employees to handle no bill accounts, the reduced total number of no bill accounts through increase in resolution, and the more efficiently handling of difficult no bill accounts.","In closer detail, the present invention provides for an Internet-based service that delivers high-impact training at the point of need on an anytime, anywhere basis. The present invention is based on the proven teaching concept that people \u201clearn best by doing\u201d. The present invention uses interactive multimedia technology to simulate real-world situations and to guide and advise employees as they respond to those situations. The present invention encourages learning by letting employees understand and meet performance goals, and giving them access to a wealth of information from video clips of expert advice to relevant background data to targeted learning resources. The simulation techniques used by the present invention allow employees to work at their own pace, and to learn and make mistakes in a realistic but risk-free environment.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the present invention provides employee development on a pay-per-employee basis. Once an employee is enrolled in a training module, he or she can use it over and over again to refresh or enhance their skills without additional cost. As employees complete the present invention scenarios, their progress is measured and captured. The data captured is reported to managers allowing them to gauge the effectiveness of training, to see which individuals are mastering skills, and to identify skill areas that are particularly difficult for employees in general.","The present invention development architecture allows for rapid customization of pre-defined business attributes to deliver learning modules. For example, when an employee accesses training in the present invention, he or she will receive training that teaches their company's desired behaviors using their company's specific business scenarios as exercises. This creates a learning context where employees can safely learn to apply new skills and reinforce behaviors in the manner of their company's specific culture and objectives.

All questions\/issues should be entered into the SME Log so that SMEs may review them either formally in interviews or informally, and log responses. If a question is answered during an interview that was not originally in the SME log, enter both the question and response after the interview. If maintained and used correctly, this log should be one of the most valuable resources used during the module design and development process.","Procedures:","When logging an issue, be sure to fill out the following:\n\n","When logging a response, be sure to fill out the following:\n\n","This test is designed to ensure that all components within the application are able to communicate with each other effectively. The Assembly Test was performed immediately after the Component Test. The development team members on both the functional and technical sides conducted this test on the pages they respectively developed. This was decided since the developer of the page is most familiar with the components and links they developed, and could therefore easily navigate through the application. Additionally, their familiarity with the individual pages allowed them to quickly identify whether or not anything was missing or malfunctioning more easily than someone who was unfamiliar with the page.","Component Test Approach","The component test was designed to ensure that all the components of each individual page of the application function correctly and as expected. This test was performed prior to all other tests so that a majority of the system bugs could be identified and fixed prior to the later sequences of testing. The development team members (on the functional and technical sides) were responsible for conducting this test since they were most familiar with the individual components they developed and could most easily navigate through the untested application efficiently.","Scripting","To test the Module as a \u2018day in the life\u2019, testers needed to work through the application as if they were users. In order to thoroughly and completely work through the application, testers used scripts. These scripts allowed the testers to complete the training module while simulating all the actions and procedures that the end-users may eventually execute, hopefully encountering any potential problems before the program actually went into production.","Product Test Approach","The Product test was designed to ensure that all pages and components of the application worked correctly and as expected. This test was performed in conjunction with all other tests (functional, performance, assembly, etc.). The component test ensures that each of the individual parts should already be tested and functioning correctly as stand-alone pieces of the whole. The product test then grouped all of these individual components together and allowed The development team to test the application as a whole before rollout to the end users.","Process for Fixing an Error (Functional & Technical)","The testing process uncovered a variety of errors within the execution of the application. Each of these errors had to be corrected before rollout to the end user. There were distinct processes and procedures in place to address issues as they came up, funnel them to the appropriate \u201cfixer\u201d, and retest the subject matter again once the error had been fixed. SIRs were filled out to log the error, and were then handed off to the point person to log the issue and assign it to be fixed. Once fixed, the subject was retested to identify that the error no longer existed.","Design and Build\u2014From a Functional Perspective","Training and Development Checklist","The purpose of this portion is to supply a list of items that the client Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) should use\/check off when reviewing the content of a given Module.

SME's at were consulted to provide information on the issues that the training should address. Since Module 2 was designed to replace existing Instructor-Led-Training, the concepts covered in that training were discussed. The Team and the SME's also decided which additional value-added subjects should be covered in Module 2 to increase the effectiveness of the training, and differentiate the module from its predecessor. The result of these discussions was a list of Learning Objectives, or general areas of subject matter, that guided further design and development of the module details.","Design of the Module","Following is a description of the design of Module 2. This will examine the design of the Activities and Exercises, which taken together compose the entirety of the complete module.","Design of Activities","The list of Learning Objectives was then examined to determine which objectives could be grouped together based on similarities. Once the objectives were qualitatively examined and groups were determined, each group formed the basis for a distinct Activity. In Module 2, three groups were determined. One which focused on Effective Customer Interaction, another for High Bill Analysis and Issue Identification, and the last for Problem Resolution. These groupings provided the basis for the three Activities, each with the name of the groups listed previously.

Both were involved to determine and verify that the grouping of Learning Objectives made sense and was logical. In addition, SME's and the Team discussed what types of exercises would best fit into each Activity to address each of the Learning Objectives.","Design of Exercises","Each of the Activities was further broken down into exercises, the number of which varied between each Activity. Each Activity consisted of two types of exercises: practice and assessed. The practice exercises were created to cover all of the learning objectives at least once, to give the user an opportunity to practice their skills in each area, and to learn new concepts. The assessed exercises were then prepared to actually measure the participant's understanding of the subject matter, and focused on each of the different learning objectives a minimum of one time.","Following is a list of the types of exercises that were deemed necessary to address all of the necessary Learning Objectives:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0246","num":"0618"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["High Bill Inquiries (Module 2)","Learning Objectives","Activity #"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Effective Customer Interaction","2 Practice Exercises","1"]},{"entry":[{},"2 Assessed"]},{"entry":[{},"Exercises"]},{"entry":["High Bill Analysis and Issue","1 Practice Exercise","2"]},{"entry":["Identification","3 Assessed"]},{"entry":[{},"Exercises"]},{"entry":["Problem Resolution","0 Practice Exercises","3"]},{"entry":[{},"5 Assessed"]},{"entry":[{},"Exercises"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The Team determined that participants in Module 2 should be allowed to practice their skills in the first two activities, but that all exercises in Activity 3 should be assessed. The reasoning behind this was that the Problem Resolution Activity built upon the previous two, and that completion of the prior activities provided sufficient knowledge for success in Activity 3. Therefore, the subject matter was introduced and assessed in the first Activities, while in Activity 3 it was simply assessed. SME's agreed that this was a legitimate format for success.","In the design of these exercises, the Content Developer came up with brief descriptions of activities they had in mind. These general scenarios and ideas were discussed with SME's during the beginning of the design phase to ensure that the plan was legitimate and useful. Team Leads were also responsible for reviewing the designs and providing feedback to the Content Developers.","Development of the Module","After the general outline of the Module is completed through the design phase, more specifics are added to bring the Module closer to completion. During development, content was updated with specifics in order to provide a working and more complete version for further review.","At critical times in the development process, SME's were involved to verify that the information developed was in line with what was needed. SME's were a good resource during development, but it was difficult at times to keep them on track with development review only. Although their design changes were sometimes valid, the development cycle had already begun. It was sometimes hard to focus them on the correct issues.","Development of Exercises","With the individual Activities already designed, fleshing out the subject matter in the exercises was the next step each Content Developer took. With the Learning Objectives in mind and the specific scenarios already reviewed, adding the details was the final step in the development of the exercises, and in turn the development of each activity as a whole.","These details included:\n\n","Once the development of the exercises was complete, the specifics were reviewed again by Team Leads and SME's.","Note: It is very important to have this review completed by all necessary people to ensure that surprises don't arise during the product test! Another hint is to compose all the content for the module in MS Word, as no spell-check or grammar-check exists in SQL Server or the Content Maintenance Tool.","Standards were also set to provide the Module with a standardized appearance. Although these standards were eventually implemented, it would be a good idea to come up with specific guidelines right from the beginning. When the standards were implemented, fewer changes were deemed necessary in follow-up work. For example, the following were a few of the ways that the Module appearance was standardized:","Bullet points were used in the Introduction and Feedback sections whenever possible Button names were referred to simply as the name on the button, stated in bold text Select (as opposed to click) was used to initiate user action on a button Module and Activity names were written in italic font.","It was also important to understand the flow of information through the module. Although this table was produced after development instead of during, it is probably a good idea to produce something similar to the table below to ensure all bases are covered. Development mistakes can arise from not introducing a topic before offering practice or assessed exercises.

A business simulation methodology that includes support for content acquisition, story line design, interaction design, feedback and coaching delivery, and content delivery is architected into the system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A large number of \u201cpre-designed\u201d learning interactions such as drag and drop association of information , situation assessment\/action planning, interviewing (one-on-one, one-to-many), presenting (to a group of experts\/executives), metering of performance (handle now, handle later), \u201ctime jumping\u201d for impact of decisions, competitive landscape shift (while \u201ctime jumping\u201d, competitors merge, customers are acquired, etc.) and video interviewing with automated note taking are also included in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Business simulation in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention delivers training curricula in an optimal manner. This is because such applications provide effective training that mirrors a student's actual work environment. The application of skills \u201con the job\u201d facilitates increased retention and higher overall job performance. While the results of such training applications are impressive, business simulations are very complex to design and build correctly. These simulations are characterized by a very open-ended environment, where students can go through the application along any number of paths, depending on their learning style and prior experiences\/knowledge.","A category of learning approaches called Learn by Doing, is commonly used as a solution to support the first phase (Learn) of the Workforce Performance Cycle. However, it can also be a solution to support the second phase (Perform) of the cycle to enable point of need learning during job performance. By adopting the approach presented, some of the benefits of a technology based approach for building business simulation solutions which create more repeatable, predictable projects resulting in more perceived and actual user value at a lower cost and in less time are highlighted.","Most corporate training programs today are misdirected because they have failed to focus properly on the purpose of their training. These programs have confused the memorization of facts with the ability to perform tasks; the knowing of \u201cthat\u201d with the knowing of \u201chow\u201d. By adopting the methods of traditional schools, businesses are teaching a wide breadth of disconnected, decontextualized facts and figures, when they should be focused on improved performance. How do you teach performance, when lectures, books, and tests inherently are designed around facts and figures? Throw away the lectures, books, and tests. The best way to prepare for high performance is to perform; experience is the best teacher! Most business leaders agree that workers become more effective the more time they spend in their jobs. The best approach for training novice employees, therefore, would be letting them learn on the job, acquiring skills in their actual work environment. The idea of learning-by-doing is not revolutionary, yet it is resisted in business and academia. Why is this so, if higher competence is universally desired?","Learners are reluctant to adopt learning-by-doing because they are frightened of failure. People work hard to avoid making mistakes in front of others. Business leaders are hesitant to implement learning-by-doing because novice failure may have dramatic safety, legal and financial implications. Imagine a novice pilot learning-by-doing as he accelerates a large jet plane down a runway; likewise, consider a new financial analyst learning-by-doing as he structures a multi-million dollar financial loan. Few employers are willing to endure such failures to have a more competent workforce.","The concerns of employee and employer can be relieved if the training (and accompanying failure) didn't occur in front of co-workers and clients, if it didn't jeopardize a multi-million dollar aircraft or a multi-million dollar deal. What if the training was performed privately, in a richly modeled simulation of the workers actual job? In a simulated environment, failure would result in dedicated instruction instead of embarrassment, injury, or monetary losses. Simulated environments provide a sense of liberation for exploration that does not exist in the real world. Knowing that the consequences of experimentation will unlikely be dire, learners are able to explore the \u201cwhat if . . . \u201d inherent in us all. In this way, the best way to prepare for high performance is to simulate actual performance. New media technologies utilizing multimedia provide the possibility to create such business simulation experiences.","Even if companies didn't make the mistake of focusing on \u201cwhat\u201d learning vs. \u201chow\u201d learning, they still tend to have the overly narrow view of education\/training as something that only occurs prior to workers being asked to actually perform their job. Learning is something that is constantly occurring, and doesn't cease once \u201creal work\u201d has begun. The closer new lessons occur in time with the application of those lessons, the greater the resultant learning. This fact helps to explain some of the reasoning behind the benefits of business simulation, described in the previous section. In those systems, all new lessons are taught in close relationship to their real world use; everything is in context and, most importantly, are presented at the appropriate time. But as the properly trained worker performs their job, the working environment changes. New demands occur, and new methods and rules are developed. As these events occur, there is a need for new support\/training that, in most cases, must wait to be addressed until the next \u201cpre-performance\u201d training session.","In these cases, the need (or demand) for additional training doesn't match the supply. This lag between a training need and the fulfilling lesson has a dramatic negative impact on productivity, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. Workers need to have the opportunity to learn while they are performing. Just as during pre-performance training, one powerful mechanism for identifying and correcting (simulated) performance problems is to have an expert available at all time to watch your actions and remediate when appropriate. This, obviously, is too costly and time intensive of an approach to be practical with actual experts. But what if workers had access to a support system that provided the majority of the benefits of a real expert, transparently integrated into their work environment? Such a system would provide advice at key moments in the work flow for problem resolution and\/or process improvement, tools to ease task completion, reference material of best practice knowledge, and point of need training courses. With a support system that proactively assists the worker in performance of their job tasks at a higher level of competency, productivity and customer satisfaction (both internal and external) would soar.","The key to such a support system is that it is seamlessly integrated into the business system that the knowledge worker uses to execute their job tasks. Workers don't need to go \u201coff-line\u201d or seek out cryptic information buried within paper manuals and binders for guidance or to find the answer to queries. All the support components are made available through the same applications the worker's use, at the point in which they need them, tailored to the individual to show \u201chow\u201d, not just \u201cwhat\u201d. Learning would be occurring all the time, with little distinction between performing and improving performance.","Establishing that training should focus on performance (how), rather than facts (what), and extending the model of learning to include assistance while performing, rather than only before performance, still leaves us dangerously exposed in preparing to compete in the new, chaotic economy. As was mentioned in the opening of this paper, the pace of change in business today is whiplash fast. Not only are new methods of doing business evolving every 18-24 months, new competitors emerge, dominate, and fade in time periods businesses used to take to perform demographic studies. Now more than ever, those who do not reinvent themselves on a regular basis will be fossilized by the pace of change.","Even the best pre-performance training and the most advanced performance support tools are destined to be outdated if there isn't a fresh supply of real-world requirements and lessons learned being fed back as inputs for the next go 'round. Innovation is a key step in the Workforce Performance Cycle. This step requires business to employ Stephen Covey's famous habit of \u201csharpening the saw\u201d, or \u201ctake time to be fast\u201d.","There is an untold wealth of information buried within the heads of business users responsible for implementing the steps outlined in their pre-performance training and performance support tools. No other group within an organization can more accurately assess the effectiveness of current methods, or project needed changes that will have dramatic future impact. This step of reflecting on the current and past state of affairs, uncovering new approaches by identifying what is working and what is not, and adapting accordingly for the future is the last phase of the learning\/performance cycle.","Innovation to fuel future training and performance support comes directly from the community most closely tied to task performance. Effective businesses need to develop and cultivate a mechanism for communication and collaboration among the experts in these communities to more efficiently benefit from their collective wisdom. In today's business, that which is evident to your business is evident to nearly all your competitors as well. The competitive advantage lies in uncovering that which is unexpected or not immediately apparent, adapting your business processes to exploit the discovery, and quickly, but effectively, educating your workforce on the new policies and procedures, all before the competition catches on or the market changes again.","This innovation process is the critical final step in continuous education of the most effective and up-to-date policies, procedures, and information. Without formalized innovation, companies not only risk being a step behind the ever advancing competition, but compound the problem by continuing to train their personnel with outdated strategies and information. One way to formalize this vital step in the Workforce Performance Cycle is to construct Virtual Learning Communities, where many \u2018experts\u2019 can share experiences, submit ideas for improvements, play out \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios, and contribute on complex problems that may be insurmountable without significant collaboration with others. Such Learning Communities could nurture up-to-date discussion of what is actually happening within a business, eliminating the traditional information-passing lag that plagues many business as new data travels through corporate hierarchies. This increased nimbleness would help organizations quickly address new competitive trends and outdated strategies, identify potential solutions, and implement improved processes in the form of updated training and performance support reference materials.","Currently, a typical BusSim engagement takes between one and two years to complete and requires a variety of both functional and technical skills.  depicts the timeline and relative resource requirements for each phase of development for a typical application development in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The chart clearly depicts the relationship between the large number of technical resources required for both the build and test phases of development. This is because the traditional development process used to build BusSim solutions reflects more of a \u201cone off\u201d philosophy, where development is done from scratch in a monolithic fashion, with little or no reuse from one application to the next. This lack of reuse makes this approach prohibitively expensive, as well as lengthy, for future BusSim projects.","The solution to this problem is to put tools in the hands of instructional designers that allows them to create their BusSim designs and implement them without the need for programmers to write code. And to put application architectures that integrate with the tools in the hands of developers, providing them with the ability to quickly deliver solutions for a number of different platforms. The reuse, then, comes in using the tools and architectures from one engagement to another. Both functional and technical resources carry with them the knowledge of how to use the technology, which also has an associated benefit of establishing a best-practice development methodology for BusSim engagements.","The tools and architectures described herein are part of a next-generation Business Simulation delivery framework that will reduce the total effort necessary to build solutions in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  depicts the potential savings in both functional and technical tasks in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Design Phase","In the Design Phase, instructional designers become oriented to the content area and begin to conceptualize an instructional approach. They familiarize themselves with the subject matter through reading materials and interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). They also identify learning objectives from key client contacts. Conceptual designs for student interactions and interface layouts also begin to emerge. After the conceptual designs have taken shape, Low-Fi user testing (a.k.a. Conference Room Piloting) is performed. Students interact with interface mock-ups while facilitators observe and record any issues. Finally, detailed designs are created that incorporate findings. These detailed designs are handed off to the development team for implementation.","The design phase has traditionally been fraught with several problems. Unlike a traditional business system, BusSim solutions are not rooted in tangible business processes, so requirements are difficult to identify in a concrete way. This leaves instructional designers with a \u2018blue sky\u2019 design problem. With few business-driven constraints on the solution, shallow expertise in the content area, and limited technical skills, instructional designers have little help in beginning a design. Typically, only experienced designers have been able to conjure interface, analysis, and feedback designs that meet the learning objectives yet remain technically feasible to implement. To compound the problem, BusSim solutions are very open ended in nature. The designer must anticipate a huge combination of student behavior to design feedback that is helpful and realistic.","Build Phase","During the build phase, the application development team uses the detailed designs to code the application. Coding tasks include the interfaces and widgets that the student interacts with. The interfaces can be made up of buttons, grids, check boxes, or any other screen controls that allow the student to view and manipulate his deliverables. The developer must also code logic that analyzes the student's work and provides feedback interactions. These interactions may take the form of text and\/or multimedia feedback from simulated team members, conversations with simulated team members, or direct manipulations of the student's work by simulated team members. In parallel with these coding efforts, graphics, videos, and audio are being created for use in the application. Managing the development of these assets have their own complications.","Risks in the build phase include misinterpretation of the designs. If the developer does not accurately understand the designer's intentions, the application will not function as desired. Also, coding these applications requires very skilled developers because the logic that analyzes the student's work and composes feedback is very complex.","Test Phase","The Test Phase, as the name implies, is for testing the application. Testing is performed to verify the application in three ways: first that the application functions properly (functional testing), second that the students understand the interface and can navigate effectively (usability testing), and third that the learning objectives are met (cognition testing). Functional testing of the application can be carried out by the development team or by a dedicated test team. If the application fails to function properly, it is debugged, fixed, recompiled and retested until its operation is satisfactory. Usability and cognition testing can only be carried out by test students who are unfamiliar with the application. If usability is unsatisfactory, parts of the interface and or feedback logic may need to be redesigned, recoded, and retested. If the learning objectives are not met, large parts of the application may need to be removed and completely redeveloped from a different perspective.","The test phase is typically where most of the difficulties in the BusSim development cycle are encountered. The process of discovering and fixing functional, usability, and cognition problems is a difficult process and not an exact science.","For functional testing, testers operate the application, either by following a test script or by acting spontaneously and documenting their actions as they go. When a problem or unexpected result is encountered, it too is documented. The application developer responsible for that part of the application then receives the documentation and attempts to duplicate the problem by repeating the tester's actions. When the problem is duplicated, the developer investigates further to find the cause and implement a fix. The developer once again repeats the tester's actions to verify that the fix solved the problem. Finally, all other test scripts must be rerun to verify that the fix did not have unintended consequences elsewhere in the application.","This process has inherent difficulty. If the tester is inaccurate in recording his actions, or the developer is inaccurate in repeating them, then the problem may never be duplicated and the defect never found. Furthermore, the problem may be dependent on some condition in the tester's environment that is not readily observable or is not even related to the application. This process has proven to be tedious, time-consuming, and of limited reliability.","For usability testing, test students operate the application as it will be operated in production. Ideally, their progress is only impeded by their lack of mastery of the content. As they gain proficiency, they are able to complete the activities and move on. As is often the case, however, they are impeded by unclear instructions, a non-intuitive interface, or other usability shortcomings. When these difficulties are encountered, the facilitators document the problems and student comments on what is needed to improve usability.","There are two major risks associated with usability testing. First, student action recording is not as rigorous because actual students are performing the testing, so functional problems that don't appear until now are difficult to reproduce. Second, resolutions to usability problems often involve significant modification to the application code and interface which requires repeating of portions of design, build, and test.","For cognition testing, students are surveyed and\/or tested to determine their level of understanding of the material. If results indicate that the learning objectives are not being adequately met, the design is reevaluated. Changes proposed to improve the cognition may include massive redesign and rebuilding.","Execution Phase","The Execution Phase refers to the steady state operation of the completed application in its production environment. For some clients, this involves phone support for students. Clients may also want the ability to track students' progress and control their progression through the course. Lastly, clients may want the ability to track issues so they may be considered for inclusion in course maintenance releases.","One of the key values of on-line courses is that they can be taken at a time, location, and pace that is convenient for the individual student. However, because students are not centrally located, support is not always readily available. For this reason it is often desirable to have phone support for students.","Clients may also desire to track students' progress, or control their advancement through the course. Under this strategy, after a student completes a section of the course, he will transfer his progress data to a processing center either electronically or by physically mailing a disk. There it can be analyzed to verify that he completed all required work satisfactorily. One difficulty commonly associated with student tracking is isolating the student data for analysis. It can be unwieldy to transmit all the course data, so it is often imperative to isolate the minimum data required to perform the necessary analysis of the student's progress.","A Delivery Framework for Business Simulation","As discussed earlier, the traditional development process used to build BusSim solutions reflects more of a \u201cone off\u201d philosophy, where development is done from scratch in a monolithic fashion, with little or no reuse from one application to the next. A better approach would be to focus on reducing the total effort required for development through reuse, which, in turn would decrease cost and development time.","The first step in considering reuse as an option is the identification of common aspects of the different BusSim applications that can be generalized to be useful in future applications. In examination of the elements that make up these applications, three common aspects emerge as integral parts of each:\n\n","Every BusSim application must have a mechanism for interaction with the student. The degree of complexity of each interface may vary, from the high interactivity of a high-fidelity real-time simulation task, to the less complex information delivery requirements of a business case background information task. Regardless of how sophisticated the User Interface (UI), it is a vital piece of making the underlying simulation and feedback logic useful to the end user.","Analysis","Every BusSim application does analysis on the data that defines the current state of the simulation many times throughout the execution of the application. This analysis is done either to determine what is happening in the simulation, or to perform additional calculations on the data which are then fed back into the simulation. For example, the analysis may be the recognition of any actions the student has taken on artifacts within the simulated environment (notebooks, number values, interviews conducted, etc.), or it may be the calculation of an ROI based on numbers the student has supplied.","Interpretation","Substantive, useful feedback is a critical piece of any BusSim application. It is the main mechanism to communicate if actions taken by the student are helping or hurting them meet their performance objectives. The interpretation piece of the set of proposed commonalties takes the results of any analysis performed and makes sense of it. It takes the non-biased view of the world that the Analysis portion delivers (i.e., \u201cDemand is up 3%\u201d) and places some evaluative context around it (i.e., \u201cDemand is below the expected 7%; you're in trouble!\u201d, or \u201cDemand has exceeded projections of 1.5%; Great job!\u201d).  illustrates commonalties in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Common Features of Business Simulation Applications","There are several approaches to capturing commonalties for reuse. Two of the more common approaches are framework-based and component-based. To help illustrate the differences between the two approaches, we will draw an analogy between building an application and building a house. One can construct a house from scratch, using the raw materials, 2\u00d74s, nails, paint, concrete, etc. One can also construct an application from scratch, using the raw materials of new designs and new code. The effort involved in both undertakings can be reduced through framework-based and\/or component-based reuse.","Framework-Based Reuse","Within the paradigm of framework-based reuse, a generic framework or architecture is constructed that contains commonalties. In the house analogy, one could purchase a prefabricated house framework consisting of floors, outside walls, bearing walls and a roof. The house can be customized by adding partition walls, wall-paper, woodwork, carpeting etc. Similarly, prefabricated application frameworks are available that contain baseline application structure and functionality. Individual applications are completed by adding specific functionality and customizing the look-and-feel. An example of a commonly used application framework is Microsoft Foundation Classes. It is a framework for developing Windows applications using C++. MFC supplies the base functionality of a windowing application and the developer completes the application by adding functionality within the framework. Framework-based reuse is best suited for capturing template-like features, for example user interface management, procedural object behaviors, and any other features that may require specialization.","Some benefits of using a framework include:\n\n","In the paradigm of component-based reuse, key functionality is encapsulated in a component. The component can then be reused in multiple applications. In the house analogy, components correspond to appliances such as dishwashers, refrigerators, microwaves, etc.","Similarly, many application components with pre-packaged functionality are available from a variety of vendors. An example of a popular component is a Data Grid. It is a component that can be integrated into an application to deliver the capability of viewing columnar data in a spreadsheet-like grid. Component-based reuse is best suited for capturing black-box-like features, for example text processing, data manipulation, or any other features that do not require specialization.","Some benefits of using components include:\n\n","Often, the best answer to achieving reuse is through a combination of framework-based and component-based techniques. A framework-based approach for building BusSim applications is appropriate for developing the user interface, handling user and system events, starting and stopping the application, and other application-specific and delivery platform-specific functions. A component-based approach is appropriate for black-box functionality. That is, functionality that can be used as-is with no specialization required.","In creating architectures to support BusSim application development, it is imperative that any assets remain as flexible and extensible as possible or reusability may be diminished. Therefore, we chose to implement the unique aspects of BusSim applications using a component approach rather than a framework approach. This decision is further supported by the following observations.\n\n","Based on these observations, we believe a combined framework\/component approach is optimal for achieving reuse.  illustrates a development architecture approach in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Delivery Framework for Business Simulation","This diagram illustrates an ideal solution where components are combined with an Application Framework and an Application Architecture to achieve maximum reuse and minimum custom development effort. The Application Architecture is added to provide communication support between the application interface and the components, and between the components. This solution has the following features:\n\n","The next section discusses each of these components in further detail.","The Business Simulation Toolset","We have clearly defined why a combined component\/framework approach is the best solution for delivering high-quality BusSim solutions at a lower cost. Given that there are a number of third party frameworks already on the market that provide delivery capability for a wide variety of platforms, the TEL project is focused on defining and developing a set of components that provide unique services for the development and delivery of BusSim solutions. These components along with a set of design and test workbenches are the tools used by instructional designers to support activities in the four phases of BusSim development. We call this suite of tools the Business Simulation Toolset. Following is a description of each of the components and workbenches of the toolset.","Components","A Component can be thought of as a black box that encapsulates the behavior and data necessary to support a related set of services. It exposes these services to the outside world through published interfaces. The published interface of a component allows you to understand what it does through the services it offers, but not how it does it. The complexity of its implementation is hidden from the user. The following are the key components of the BusSim Toolset.\n\n","The Domain Model component is the central component of the suite that facilitates communication of context data across the application and the other components. It is a modeling tool that can use industry-standard database such as Informix, Oracle, or Sybase to store its data.","A domain model is a representation of the objects in a simulation. The objects are such pseudo tangible things as a lever the student can pull, a form or notepad the student fills out, a character the student interacts with in a simulated meeting, etc. They can also be abstract objects such as the ROI for a particular investment, the number of times the student asked a particular question, etc. These objects are called entities. Some example entities include:\n\n","An entity can also contain other entities. For example, a personal bank account entity might contain an entity that represents a savings account. Every entity has a set of properties where each property in some way describes the entity. The set of properties owned by an entity, in essence, define the entity. Some example properties include:\n\n","The domain model is created by the instructional designer in a visual editing design tool called the Knowledge Workbench. The designer creates the objects of the domain model using generic entities and properties; that is, not having specific values associated with the entities and properties.","At runtime, an application's domain model is instantiated so that every entity and property is given a particular value that makes it unique. The result of a domain model instantiation is called the domain. The values of a domain's entities and properties can change throughout the course of the simulation based on student actions and updates from other components.  illustrates an instantiated domain model in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Example Domain","Creating a domain model in data rather than in code facilitates reuse of the components in multiple applications in multiple domains without code changes. For example, a typical application in the Financial Services domain would have to define classes in code such as \u2018Customer\u2019, \u2018Account\u2019, etc. An Insurance Domain application might have classes such as \u2018Customer\u2019, \u2018Incident\u2019, \u2018Prior Policy\u2019, etc. To be able to perform analysis on any of these classes, the analysis logic must be coded to recognize the classes. This requires all logic to be custom-coded for every application; an effort-intensive undertaking that demands a high degree of technical skill.","By modeling the domain in data using generic objects, we can build standard generic analysis capability that can be applied to the domain. This allows implementation of analysis logic with much less effort by people with a low degree of technical skill. Functional experts can create the objects of the domain and apply various types of analysis from a pallet. All of this is accomplished in a visual development environment that supports the designer with visual feedback and only allows valid designs to be created.","Profiling Component","In the simplest terms, the purpose of the Profiling Component is to analyze the current state of a domain and identify specific things that are true about that domain. This information is then passed to the Remediation Component which provides feedback to the student. The Profiling Component analyzes the domain by asking questions about the domain's state, akin to an investigator asking questions about a case. The questions that the Profiler asks are called profiles. For example, suppose there is a task about building a campfire and the student has just thrown a match on a pile of wood, but the fire didn't start. In order to give useful feedback to the student, a tutor would need to know things like: was the match lit?, was the wood wet?, was there kindling in the pile?, etc. These questions would be among the profiles that the Profiling Component would use to analyze the domain. The results of the analysis would then be passed off to the Remediation Component which would use this information to provide specific feedback to the student.","Specifically, a profile is a set of criteria that is matched against the domain. The purpose of a profile is to check whether the criteria defined by the profile is met in the domain. Using a visual editing tool, instructional designers create profiles to identify those things that are important to know about the domain for a given task. During execution of a BusSim application at the point that feedback is requested either by the student or pro-actively by the application, the set of profiles associated with the current task are evaluated to determine which ones are true. Example profiles include:\n\n","A profile is composed of two types of structures: characteristics and collective characteristics. A characteristic is a conditional (the if half of a rule) that identifies a subset of the domain that is important for determining what feedback to deliver to the student. Example characteristics include:\n\n","A characteristic's conditional uses one or more atomics as the operands to identify the subset of the domain that defines the characteristic. An atomic only makes reference to a single property of a single entity in the domain; thus the term atomic. Example atomics include:\n\n","A collective characteristic is a conditional that uses multiple characteristics and\/or other collective characteristics as its operands. Collective characteristics allow instructional designers to build richer expressions (i.e., ask more complex questions). Example collective characteristics include:\n\n","Once created, designers are able to reuse these elements within multiple expressions, which significantly eases the burden of creating additional profiles. When building a profile from its elements, atomics can be used by multiple characteristics, characteristics can be used by multiple collective characteristics and profiles, and collective characteristics can be used by multiple collective characteristics and profiles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0328","num":"0760"},"figref":"FIG. 9H"},"Example Profile for Insurance Underwriting","Transformation Component","Whereas the Profiling Component asks questions about the domain, the Transformation Component performs calculations on the domain and feeds the results back into the domain for further analysis by the Profiling Component. This facilitates the modeling of complex business systems that would otherwise be very difficult to implement as part of the application. Within the Analysis phase of the Interface\/Analysis\/Interpretation execution flow, the Transformation Component actually acts on the domain before the Profiling Component does its analysis. The Transformation Component acts as a shell that wraps one or more data modeling components for the purpose of integrating these components into a BusSim application. The Transformation Component facilitates the transfer of specific data from the domain to the data modeling component (inputs) for calculations to be performed on the data, as well as the transfer of the results of the calculations from the data modeling component back to the domain (outputs).  illustrates a transformation component in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","The data modeling components could be third party modeling environments such as spreadsheet-based modeling (e.g., Excel, Formula 1) or discrete time-based simulation modeling (e.g., PowerSim, VenSim). The components could also be custom built in C++, VB, Access, or any tool that is ODBC compliant to provide unique modeling environments. Using the Transformation Component to wrap a third party spreadsheet component provides an easy way of integrating into an application spreadsheet-based data analysis, created by such tools as Excel. The Transformation Component provides a shell for the spreadsheet so that it can look into the domain, pull out values needed as inputs, performs its calculations, and post outputs back to the domain.","For example, if the financial statements of a company are stored in the domain, the domain would hold the baseline data like how much cash the company has, what its assets and liabilities are, etc. The Transformation Component would be able to look at the data and calculate additional values like cash flow ratios, ROI or NPV of investments, or any other calculations to quantitatively analyze the financial health of the company. Depending on their complexity, these calculations could be performed by pre-existing spreadsheets that a client has already spent considerable time developing.","Remediation Component","The Remediation Component is an expert system that facilitates integration of intelligent feedback into BusSim applications. It has the following features:\n\n","The Remediation model consists of three primary objects:\n\n","Concepts are objects that represent real-world concepts that the user will be faced with in the interface. Concepts can be broken into sub-concepts, creating a hierarchical tree of concepts. This tree can be arbitrarily deep and wide to support rich concept modeling. Concepts can also own an arbitrary number of Coach Topics.","Coach Topics are objects that represent a discussion topic that may be appropriate for a concept. Coach Topics can own an arbitrary number of Coach Items.","Coach Items are items of feedback that may include text, audio, video, URL's, or updates to the Domain Model. Coach Items are owned by Coach Topics and are assembled by the Remediation Component algorithm.","Details of the Remediation Component algorithm for feedback is discussed in The Intelligent Coaching Agent Tool whitepaper and can be found on the Knowledge Exchange at the Technology Enabled Learning ETA Home Page.","Workbenches","The BusSim Toolset also includes a set of workbenches that are used by instructional designers to design and build BusSim applications. A workbench is a tool that facilitates visual editing or testing of the data that the BusSim Components use for determining an application's run-time behavior. The BusSim Toolset includes the following workbenches:","Knowledge Workbench","The Knowledge Workbench is a tool for the creation of domain, analysis and feedback data that is used by the BusSim Components. It has the following features:\n\n","The Simulated Student Test Workbench is a tool for the creation of data that simulates student's actions for testing BusSim Component behaviors. It has the following features:\n\n","The Regression Test Workbench is a tool for replaying and testing of student sessions to aid debugging. It has the following features:\n\n","The design phase of a BusSim application is streamlined by the use of the Knowledge Workbench. The Knowledge Workbench is a visual editor for configuring the objects of the component engines to control their runtime behavior. The components are based on proven algorithms that capture and implement best practices and provide a conceptual framework and methodology for instructional design.","In conceptual design, the workbench allows the designer to paint a model of the hierarchy of Concepts that the student will need to master in the activity. This helps the designer organize the content in a logical way. The visual representation of the Concepts helps to communicate ideas to other designers for review. The consistent look and feel of the workbench also contributes to a streamlined Quality Assurance process. In addition, standard documentation can be automatically generated for the entire design.","As the design phase progresses, the designer adds more detail to the design of the Concept hierarchy by painting in Coach Topics that the student may need feedback on. The designer can associate multiple feedback topics with each Concept. The designer also characterizes each topic as being Praise, Polish, Focus, Redirect or one of several other types of feedback that are consistent with a proven remediation methodology. The designer can then fill each topic with text, video war stories, Web page links, Authorware links, or any other media object that can be delivered to the student as part of the feedback topic.","As the designer's thoughts for the interface become clearer, she can begin to model the domain objects in the Knowledge Workbench. The student's world is constructed using objects in the Domain Model.","The designer again uses the Knowledge Workbench to configure objects in the Transformation Component. The Transformation Component is used to perform calculations or other analysis of the student's domain. Lastly, the designer uses the workbench to configure objects in the Profiling Component. The Profiling Component examines the student's domain, looking for conditions that indicate what feedback topics are appropriate for delivery.","More importantly, the Student Simulator Test Workbench allows the designer to exercise the designs. It allows the designer to manipulate the domain as if she were a student. The designer can interact with the simulated interface and invoke the component engines to see the feedback that the student would receive. This capability can also be utilized in a usability test such as a Conference Room Pilot. As the test student interacts with screen mock-ups, a facilitator can mimic his actions in the interface simulator and tell the student what the actual feedback will be. This results in much more rigorous testing prior to application construction. A big payoff is realized downstream in the form of reduced redesign after usability and cognition testing.","Throughout all these steps in the initial design, the workbench supports the design process by allowing the designer great flexibility within the framework of a proven methodology. This allows experienced users to design rich, realistic interactions, and inexperienced users to become competent in a shorter time by learning from the best practices embedded in the workbench. This greatly diminishes the \u2018blue sky\u2019 design problem. Also, since the designs can be tested prior to application construction, there is reduced rework after testing. Lastly, the visual knowledge representation enhances communication within the design team and greatly streamlines the QA process.","Build Phase","It is very clear how the tools support the Build Phase. The designs that the designer painted in the Knowledge Workbench drive the components at runtime. The application developer no longer has to write code that analyzes the student's work and provides feedback. The developer only has to build the interface and logic to report any student actions to the domain model. The components do the rest. What used to be the most difficult part of the build phase has been eliminated!","There is no chance for a developer to misinterpret the feedback designs because she never has to interpret them. In fact, the developer doesn't even have to know anything about the feedback behavior as long as she is familiar with the domain model. This also means the skill level required to develop the application can be greatly reduced. It's not hard to teach someone how to paint a screen in Visual Basic or Delphi and call API functions to notify the Domain Model of student actions.","In addition to the economies gained by the components, it is possible to use templates to further streamline design and development of commonly used interactions. We have created templates for several common interactions. For example, Journalizing of Transactions is an interaction that has appeared in several applications. We have built application and Knowledge Workbench templates for Journalization. All one must do to create a new Journalize task is to add graphics for new Transactions and fill in new data into placeholders in the Knowledge Workbench.","Test Phase","The toolset greatly reduces effort during functionality testing. The key driver of the effort reduction is that the components can automatically track the actions of the tester without the need to add code support in the application. Whenever the tester takes an action in the interface, it is reported to the domain model. From there it can be tracked in a database. Testers no longer need to write down their actions for use in debugging; they are automatically written to disk. There is also a feature for attaching comments to a tester's actions. When unexpected behavior is encountered, the tester can hit a control key sequence that pops up a dialog to record a description of the errant behavior.","Of far greater impact is the ability to replay the tester's actions automatically through the Regression Test Workbench. The designer does not need to spend hours trying to duplicate the error. She simply loads the tester's session into the Regression Test Workbench and replays it. In seconds the error is replicated and can be located and fixed using a variety of debugging utilities. After changes have been made, one more pass through the Regression Test Workbench verifies the fix.","The major difficulties of usability and cognition testing are also addressed by the toolset. First, since student tracking is no longer a manual activity, the precision of functional testing can also be applied to usability and cognition testing. Second, because of the increased rigor in the Conference Room Pilot, the risk of significant rework is greatly reduced.","Execution Phase","During the Execution Phase, the components are deployed to the student's platform. They provide simulated team member and feedback functionality with sub-second response time and error-free operation. If the client desires it, student tracking mechanisms can be deployed at runtime for evaluation and administration of students. This also enables the isolation of any defects that may have made it to production.","Scenarios for Using the Business Simulation Toolset","A good way to gain a better appreciation for how the BusSim Toolset can vastly improve the BusSim development effort is to walk through scenarios of how the tools would be used throughout the development lifecycle of a particular task in a BusSim application. For this purpose, we'll assume that the goal of the student in a specific task is to journalize invoice transactions, and that this task is within the broader context of learning the fundamentals of financial accounting. A cursory description of the task from the student's perspective will help set the context for the scenarios. Following the description are five scenarios which describe various activities in the development of this task. The figure below shows a screen shot of the task interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0357","num":"0814"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"In accordance with a preferred embodiment, an Intelligent Coaching Agent Tool (ICAT) was developed to standardize and simplify the creation and delivery of feedback in a highly complex and open-ended environment. Feedback from a coach or tutor is instrumental in guiding the learner through an application. Moreover, by diagnosing trouble areas and recommending specific actions based on predicted student understanding of the domain student comprehension of key concepts is increased. By writing rules and feedback that correspond to a proven feedback strategy, consistent feedback is delivered throughout the application, regardless of the interaction type or of the specific designer\/developer creating the feedback. The ICAT is packaged with a user-friendly workbench, so that it may be reused to increase productivity on projects requiring a similar rule-based data engine and repository.","Definition of ICAT In Accordance with an Embodiment of the Present Invention","The Intelligent Coaching Agent Tool (ICAT) is a suite of tools\u2014a database and a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) run-time engine\u2014used by designers to create and execute just-in-time feedback of Goal Based training. Designers write feedback and rules in the development tools. Once the feedback is set, the run-time engine monitors user actions, fires rules and composes feedback which describes the business deliverable.","I. The ICAT Remediation Model","The remediation model used within ICAT dynamically composes the most appropriate feedback to deliver to a student based on student's previous responses. The ICAT model is based on a theory of feedback which has been proven effective by pilot results and informal interviews. The model is embodied in the object model and algorithms of the ICAT. Because the model is built into the tools, all feedback created with the tool will conform to the model.","II. The Role of ICAT in Student Training","The ICAT plays two roles in student training. First, the ICAT is a teaching system, helping students to fully comprehend and apply information. Second, ICAT is a gatekeeper, ensuring that each student has mastered the material before moving on to additional information.","III. The Functional Definition of the ICAT","The ICAT is a self contained module, separate from the application. Separating the ICAT from the application allows other projects to use the ICAT and allows designers to test feedback before the application is complete. The ICAT Module is built on six processes which allow a student to interact effectively with the interface to compose and deliver the appropriate feedback for a student's mistakes.","IV. The ICAT Development Methodology for Creating Feedback","The ICAT development methodology is a seven step methodology for creating feedback. The methodology contains specific steps, general guidelines and lessons learned from the field. Using the methodology increases the effectiveness of the feedback to meet the educational requirements of the course.","V. Components","The processes each contain a knowledge model and some contain algorithms. Each process has specific knowledge architected into its design to enhance remediation and teaching.","VI. Testing Utilities, Reports and Methodology","There is a suite of testing tools for the ICAT. These tools allow designers and developers test all of their feedback and rules. In addition, the utilities let designers capture real time activities of students as they go through the course.","Expert Remediation Model Within the Tools","The tools and run-time engine in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention include expert knowledge of remediation. These objects include logic that analyzes a student's work to identify problem areas and deliver focused feedback. The designers need only instantiate the objects to put the tools to work. Embodying expert knowledge in the tools and engine ensures that each section of a course has the same effective feedback structure in place.","Any project which is creating a Goal-Based Scenario (GBS) business simulation or an Integrated Performance Support (IPS) system to help users understand and create business deliverables can profit from technology in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A GBS allows students to learn in a comprehensive simulated environment. Students work in a simulated environment to accomplish real world tasks, and when they make mistakes, remediation is provided to help identify and correct the mistakes. The hands-on experience of the simulated environment and the timely remediation account for the high retention rate from subjects presented utilizing a system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention can be used in conjunction with an IPS to help users develop deliverables. If a customer service representative (CSR) is completing a form while conducting a phone conversation, the ICAT can be used to observe how the task is completed to provide a live analysis of mistakes.","A file structure in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention provides a standard system environment for all applications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A development directory holds a plurality of sub-directories. The content in the documentation directory is part of a separate installation from the architecture. This is due to the size of the documentation directory. It does not require any support files, thus it may be placed on a LAN or on individual computers.","When the architecture is installed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the development directory has an _Arch, _Tools, _Utilities, Documentation, QED, and XDefault development directory. Each folder has its own directory structure that is inter-linked with the other directories. This structure must be maintained to assure consistency and compatibility between projects to clarify project differences, and architecture updates.","The _Arch directory stores many of the most common parts of the system architecture. These files generally do not change and can be reused in any area of the project. If there is common visual basic code for applications that will continuously be used in other applications, the files will be housed in a folder in this directory.","The sub-directories in the _Arch directory are broken into certain objects of the main project. Object in this case refers to parts of a project that are commonly referred to within the project. For example, modules and classes are defined here, and the directory is analogous to a library of functions, APIs, etc. . . . that do not change. For example the IcaObj directory stores code for the Intelligent Coaching Agent (ICA). The InBoxObj directory stores code for the InBox part of the project and so on. The file structure uses some primary object references as file directories. For example, the IcaObj directory is a component that contains primary objects for the ICA such as functional forms, modules and classes.","The BrowserObj directory contains modules, classes and forms related to the browser functionality in the architecture.","The HTMLGlossary directory contains code that is used for the HTML reference and glossary component of the architecture.","The IcaObj directory contains ICA functional code to be used in an application. This code is instantiated and enhanced in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","The InBoxObj directory contains code pertaining to the inbox functionality used within the architecture. Specifically, there are two major components in this architecture directory. There is a new .ocx control that was created to provide functionality for an inbox in the application. There is also code that provides support for a legacy inbox application. The PracticeObj directory contains code for the topics component of the architecture. The topics component can be implemented with the HTMLGlossary component as well.","The QmediaObj directory contains the components that are media related. An example is the QVIDctrl.cls. The QVIDctrl is the code that creates the links between QVID files in an application and the system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","The SimObj directory contains the Simulation Engine, a component of the application that notifies the tutor of inputs and outputs using a spreadsheet to facilitate communication.","The StaticObj directory holds any component that the application will use statically from the rest of the application. For example, the login form is kept in this folder and is used as a static object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","The SysDynObj directory contains the code that allows the Systems Dynamics Engine (Powersim) to pass values to the Simulation Engine and return the values to the tutor.","The VBObj directory contains common Visual Basic objects used in applications. For example the Now What, Visual Basic Reference forms, and specific message box components are stored in this folder.","The _Tools directory contains two main directories. They represent the two most used tools in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The two directories provide the code for the tools themselves. The reason for providing the code for these tools is to allow a developer to enhance certain parts of the tools to extend their ability. This is important for the current project development and also for the growth of the tools.","The Icautils directory contains a data, database, default, graphics, icadoc, and testdata directory. The purpose of all of these directories is to provide a secondary working directory for a developer to keep their testing environment of enhanced Icautils applications separate from the project application. It is built as a testbed for the tool only. No application specific work should be done here. The purpose of each of these directories will be explained in more depth in the project directory section. The TestData folder is unique to the _Tools\/ICAUtils directory. It contains test data for the regression bench among others components in ICAUtils.","The Utilities directory holds the available utilities that a Business Simulation project requires for optimal results. This is a repository for code and executable utilities that developers and designers may utilize and enhance in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Most of the utilities are small applications or tools that can be used in the production of simulations which comprise an executable and code to go with it for any enhancements or changes to the utility. If new utilities are created on a project or existing utilities are enhanced, it is important to notify the managers or developers in charge of keeping track of the Business Simulation assets. Any enhancements, changes or additions to the Business Simulation technology assets are important for future and existing projects.","A Documentation directory is used to store pertinent documentation. The documentation directory is structured as follows. Most of the directories are labeled after the specific information held within them. The following is a list of all the documentation directories and a description of what is contain in each.","Ref Website\u2014This directory contains The Business Simulation Reference website, which is a general reference for many things. If the website has not been set up for users on a LAN or website, all you need to do is go into the root directory of website and double click on index.htm. This is the main page for the site.","Components\u2014This directory contains any documentation on classes and modules that are used in the architecture. For example there are documents here on the ICAMeeting class, the Inbox class etc.","Database\u2014This directory contains any documents describing the databases that are included and used in the Architecture. For example the ICAObj overview doc contains a description of the model and each element in the database.","HTML Component\u2014This directory contains relevant documentation about the HTML part of the architecture.","Process Models\u2014This directory should contain the documents that describe the process of the application or related information.","ReferenceApp\u2014This directory contains documents with descriptions and views of the reference app. (QED) for explanation and documentation. Testing conditions are stored in the Testing directory.","Standards&Templates\u2014This directory contains any type of architecture relevant coding standard documents or templates that a developer is required to follow.","UserGuides\u2014This directory has 6 sub-directories. Each one of these sub-directories contains user guides for a given tool or component in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention which include user guides for the architecture, the Tutor Suite, ICA Utilities, the simulation Engine and the System Dynamics Engine. There is also a directory for other documentation that contains user guides for any other tools or code like third party controls etc.","WorkFlows\u2014This directory contains the WF_Develop.doc which includes the workflow documentation for an application.","The sample project directory, QED has the same structure that a real project would be designed after. The QED directory has all custom architecture code, databases, spreadsheets, and any other application specific files stored in it. The QED project directory stores a Design and SrcVB directory. The Design directory contains all relevant files for a designer. The SrcVB directory is used for a developer.","The root directory of the Design and SrcVB directory contain a few important files to note. Both have two .rtf files, a few log files and an .ini file. The .rtf files are the feedback that is output from the tutor, the logs are also output from the tutor and the .ini file is for ICAUtils initialization. The design directory has three subdirectories that contain a data directory, which stores .xls files, sim models, and any other important data like html and video. It also has a database directory that holds any relevant databases for development and application use. The last directory is the icadoc directory which includes all .tut files or .ica files, which are both created with the tutor.","The SrcVB directory stores all of the directories previously described. The reason for duplicating the data and database directories is to assure that a developer does not interfere with the designer's files. The developer tends to not do as much design work and can easily corrupt files. This duplication of directories provides a safer environment for the developer to test in. As was mentioned above, the developer tends to have a lot more to do with the application build than the design so there needs to be more content in the SrcVB directory. The SrcVB directory also contains an .exe and .vbp file which are created in a developers visual basic application.","The following are directories found in the SrcVB directory that are not found in the Design directory followed by a short definition:","The _CustomArch directory contains any application specific architecture. Look in the QED folder for an example.","The _CustomDistribution directory contains any files that need to be distributed with the application.","The Default directory contains any backup files that might need to be copied and reused later. Some files occasionally are corrupted and need to be replaced.","The Fonts directory contains application specific font libraries.","The Graphics directory contains any relevant graphics for the application.","The Help directory contains all files for a help reference layer in the application. This can be implemented in many ways but most commonly in an HTML form.","The Saved directory is for saved information that is produced by the application. This can be used for saving student information or saving temporary information for the application steps.","The StudentData directory is for storing any relevant student data, lists of students, their personal information or any relevant student data that needs to be saved.","XDefault Development:","The XDefault Development environment is used to provide a shell for any new project. A developer would rename this directory as an acronym of the project. QED is the default for the installation sample application. The XDefault development directory is a shell and serves as a building block for a startup project. A good idea is to use the QED sample application and build the XDefault Development project with the sample code in QED.","The last directory to be mentioned is the shared development directory which is placed on a LAN or central network area and is shared by all designers and developers of a project to assure that files in the project are up to date, managed properly and appropriately synchronized. There are many databases and files that will be shared in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. These files need to be shared and have a location that someone can edit without having to worry about merging files later. A source control program is used to restrict access to a file to one application at a time.","The ICAT has a model of remediation architected into the system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Feedback should help students complete tasks and learn the underlying concepts. To achieve this goal, the ICAT reviews student's work with the following objectives in mind.","Identify Student Misconceptions","Identifying that a student does not understand a topic and then clearly explaining it is the goal of human and computer tutors alike. Human tutors, however, have many more clues\u2014including facial expressions and body language\u2014to help them identify student misconceptions. The computer tutor is much more limited and can only view the outputs\u2014such as documents and reports\u2014the student produces. If a computer tutor is looking for a misunderstanding about debits and credits, the computer analyzes all the mistakes a student made concerning debits and credits and tries to identify what misunderstanding would account for this pattern of mistakes.","Identify what Students Should Fix","If the coach cannot diagnose a student's misconception, or cannot do it with 100% accuracy, the coach must at least tell the student what he did wrong so that he can correct it. If at all possible, the coach should identify groups or types of problems the student is making so that the student can generalize the solution and answer.","Prompt Students to Reflect on Mistakes","When identifying problems, the tutor needs to prompt the student to reflect on a problem and start to point the student towards the answer. The tutor should not tell the student the answer, but instead should attempt to provide an appropriate answer or give the student a question to think about.","Reinforce Correct Concepts and Ideas","Once a student has gotten the correct answer, it is important to reinforce the learning. Students may feel uncertain about their understanding even after he has gotten the answer correct. To reinforce the student's understanding of the concept and provide a confidence boost, the tutor should walk the student through the answer so that it is completely understood. These goals are not just the goals of a computer tutor, but they are the goals of a human tutor as well. All tutors must look at a student's work to help identify and correct errors as well as learn the material. One of the most difficult tasks facing a tutor is the difficult task of balancing the appropriate amount of assistance provided the student to complete the task with the requirement to help the student learn the material.","Model of Feedback","An embodiment of the present invention utilizes feedback to address the balancing task. The theory is centered on the idea of severity. Severe errors require severe feedback while mild errors require mild feedback. If a student writes a paper on the wrong subject, a human tutor will spend little time reviewing the paper, but instead, identify it as a serious mistake and ask the student to rewrite the paper. If the student simply misses one paragraph of the argument, then the tutor will focus the student on that paragraph. Finally, if the paper is correct except for a couple of spelling mistakes, the tutor will point out the specific mistakes and ask the student to correct them. The point is that because a tutor and a student do not want to waste each others' time, they will match the severity of the error with the severity of the feedback.","In the ICAT model of feedback, there are four levels of severity of error and four corresponding levels of feedback. The tutor goes through the student's work, identifies the severity of the error and then provides the corresponding level of feedback.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0415","num":"0872"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Educational Categories of Feedback"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"FEEDBACK"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["ERROR","Feedback"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Error Type","Description","Type","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["1.

The tutor will not allow students to proceed to the next section of the course until they have gotten the current section correct. To monitor student progress, the course has been broken into two components:","An activity is a business event, such as planning a company's financials or closing the books. Business events set the context of the course. Students learn the content so that they can complete the goals associates with each business event. The power of a GBS is in how it embeds the content a student needs to learn within the context of the business events.","A task is a business deliverable that must be completed as part of a business event. Example tasks include completing journal entries while closing the books. There may be many Tasks in an activity, just as there may be many deliverables required to react to a business event in the real world. Deliverables produced in this application include a break-even analysis, a transaction journal, a cost report, and a ratio analysis. The role of the tutor is to help the students complete the business deliverables associated with any business event. Students can always go backward, but they are limited from going forward, until the ICAT says that the business deliverable meets the required specifications. It is useful to think of the ICAT as a boss who reviews your work. The boss will not let you go on to the next task, or business deliverable, until you have correctly completed the current task. To help explain the concepts of an activity and task, here is a description of an ICAT implementation in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","A training application utilizing ICAT for a large product company is presented as an example.

An Analysis of Pro Form a Financial Statements","Students perform break-even analysis to determine which of twelve business strategies to pursue.","2. Journal Entries","Student journalize 20 of the transactions which occur in the third year of operations.","3. Summaries of Interviews with Employees about Operating Plan Variances","Students get behind the numbers and figure out what is driving the variances.","Design Scenario","This Scenario illustrates how the tools are used to support conceptual and detailed design of a BusSim application.  illustrates the steps of the first scenario in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The designer has gathered requirements and determined that to support the client's learning objectives, a task is required that teaches journalization skills. The designer begins the design first by learning about journalization herself, and then by using the Knowledge Workbench to sketch a hierarchy of the concepts she want the student to learn. At the most general level, she creates a root concept of \u2018Journalization\u2019. She refines this by defining sub-concepts of \u2018Cash related transactions\u2019, \u2018Expense related Transactions\u2019, and \u2018Expense on account transactions\u2019. These are each further refined to whatever level of depth is required to support the quality of the learning and the fidelity of the simulation.","The designer then designs the journalization interface. Since a great way to learn is by doing, she decides that the student should be asked to Journalize a set of transactions. She comes up with a set of twenty-two documents that typify those a finance professional might see on the job. They include the gamut of Asset, Expense, Liability and Equity, and Revenue transactions. Also included are some documents that are not supposed to be entered in the journal. These \u2018Distracters\u2019 are included because sometimes errant documents occur in real life. The designer then uses the Domain Model features in the Knowledge Workbench to paint a Journal. An entity is created in the Domain Model to represent each transaction and each source document.","Based on the twenty-two documents that the designer chose, she can anticipate errors that the student might make. For these errors, she creates topics of feedback and populates them with text. She also creates topics of feedback to tell the student when they have succeeded. Feedback Topics are created to handle a variety of situations that the student may cause.","The next step is to create profiles that the will trigger the topics in the concept tree (this task is not computational in nature, so the Transformation Component does not need to be configured). A profile resolves to true when its conditions are met by the student's work. Each profile that resolves to true triggers a topic.","To do some preliminary testing on the design, the designer invokes the Student Simulator Test Workbench. The designer can manipulate the Domain Model as if she were the student working in the interface. She drags accounts around to different transactions, indicating how she would like them journalized. She also enters the dollar amounts that she would like to debit or credit each account. She submits her actions to the component engines to see the feedback the student would get if he had performed the activity in the same way. All of this occurs in the test bench without an application interface.","The last step in this phase is low-fi user testing. A test student interacts with a PowerPoint slide or bitmap of the proposed application interface for the Journalization Task. A facilitator mimics his actions in the test bench and tells him what the feedback would be. This simplifies low-fi user testing and helps the designer to identify usability issues earlier in the design when they are much cheaper to resolve.","Build Scenario",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0448","num":"0905"},"figref":"FIGS. 23 and 24"},"A few passes through these steps will typically be required to get the application communicating correctly with the components. The debug utilities and Regression Test Workbench streamline the process. After the application interface and component communication are functioning as designed, the task is migrated to Usability testing.","Test Scenario","This scenario demonstrates the cycle that the team goes through to test the application. It specifically addresses usability testing, but it is easy to see how the tools also benefit functional and cognition testing. Again, we will use the Journalization Task as an example.  illustrates a test scenario in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The test students work through the journalization activity. One of the students has made it over half way through the task and has just attempted to journalize the sixteenth transaction. The student submits to the Financial Coach, but the feedback comes back blank. The student notifies the facilitator who right-clicks on the Financial Coach's face in the feedback window. A dialog pops up that shows this is the twenty-seventh submission and shows some other details about the submission. The facilitator (or even the student in recent efforts) enters a text description of the problem, and fills out some other fields to indicate the nature and severity of the problem. All the student's work and the feedback they got for the twenty-seven submissions is posted to the User Acceptance Test (UAT) archive database.","The instructional designer can review all the student histories in the UAT database and retrieve the session where the student in question attempted the Journalization Task. The designer then recreates the problem by replaying the student's twenty-seven submissions through the component engines using the Regression Test Workbench. The designer can then browse through each submission that the student made and view the work that the student did on the submission, the feedback the student got, and the facilitator comments, if any. Now the designer can use the debugging tools to determine the source of the problem. In a few minutes, she is able to determine that additional profiles and topics are needed to address the specific combinations of mistakes the student made. She uses the Knowledge Workbench to design the new profiles and topics. She also adds a placeholder and a script for a video war story that supports the learning under these circumstances. The designer saves the new design of the task and reruns the Regression Test Workbench on the student's session with the new task design. After she is satisfied that the new profiles, topics, and war stories are giving the desired coverage, she ships the new task design file to user testing and it's rolled out to all of the users.","This example illustrates how a high effort, uncertain process (that once took days) can be reduced to a few hours using the BusSim Toolset. Cycle time can be reduced dramatically, and complexity, risk and difficulty can be almost eliminated. It shows the sharp contrast with the traditional development approach where new designs and new code can have many unintended consequences that are difficult to test.","Execution Scenario: Student Administration",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0453","num":"0910"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},"As the student progresses through the course, his performance indicates that his proficiency is growing more rapidly in some areas than in others. Based on this finding, his curriculum is altered to give him additional Tasks that will help him master the content he is having trouble with. Also, Tasks may be removed where he has demonstrated proficiency. While the student is performing the work in the Tasks, every action he takes, the feedback he gets, and any other indicators of performance are tracked in the Student Tracking Database. Periodically, part or all of the tracked data are transmitted to a central location. The data can be used to verify that the student completed all of the work, and it can be further analyzed to measure his degree of mastery of the content.","Execution Scenario: Student Interaction",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0455","num":"0912"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},"As the student interacts with the interface, all actions are reported to and recorded in the Domain Model. The Domain Model has a meta-model describing a transaction, its data, and what information a journal entry contains. The actions of the student populates the entities in the domain model with the appropriate information. When the student is ready, he submits the work to a simulated team member for review. This submission triggers the Analysis-Interpretation cycle. The Transformation Component is invoked and performs additional calculations on the data in the Domain Model, perhaps determining that Debits and Credits are unbalanced for a given journal entry.","The Profiling Component can then perform rule-based pattern matching on the Domain Model, examining both the student actions and results of any Transformation Component analysis. Some of the profiles fire as they identify the mistakes and correct answers the student has given. Any profiles that fire activate topics in the Remediation Component. After the Profiling Component completes, the Remediation Component is invoked. The remediation algorithm searches the active topics in the tree of concepts to determine the best set of topics to deliver. This set may contain text, video, audio, URLs, even actions that manipulate the Domain Model. It is then assembled into prose-like paragraphs of text and media and presented to the student. The text feedback helps the student localize his journalization errors and understand why they are wrong and what is needed to correct the mistakes. The student is presented with the opportunity to view a video war story about the tax and legal consequences that arise from incorrect journalization. He is also presented with links to the reference materials that describe the fundamentals of journalization.","The Analysis-Interpretation cycle ends when any coach items that result in updates to the Domain Model have been posted and the interface is redrawn to represent the new domain data. In this case, the designer chose to highlight with a red check the transactions that the student journalized incorrectly.","III. The Functional Definition of the ICAT","This section describes the feedback processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

To gain a general understanding of the ICAT, read only the general descriptions. To understand the ICAT deeply, read this section and the detailed component section regarding knowledge models and algorithms. These processes and algorithms embody the feedback model in the ICAT. There are six main processes in the ICAT, described below and in more detail on the following pages.","Remediation Process Diagram",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0460","num":"0917"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["2702","2704","2706","2708","2710","2712"]},"1. Student Interacts with Interface to Create Business Deliverable","Description","The student completes the deliverables of the Task by interacting with the interface objects. These actions may be button clicks, dragging of text, selection of items from a list, etc. An example is the Journalization task shown below.  illustrates a display of journalization transactions in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. To interact with the display, the student must journalize the twenty-four transactions presented. To journalize a transaction, the student clicks the \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cprevious\u201d buttons to move between transactions. Once at a transaction, the student clicks and drags an account name from the chart of accounts\u2014which is split into Assets, Liabilities, Revenues and Expenses\u2014onto the debit or credit side of the journal entry. Once the journal entry has been made, the student must type in how much to debit or credit. Each one of these buttons, draggable items, and text fields are interface objects which can be manipulated.","Knowledge Model","Interface Objects","In any GBS Task, the student must manipulate controls on the application interface to complete the required deliverables.  illustrates the objects for the journalization task in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","The following abstract objects are used to model all the various types of interface interactions.","SourceItem","A SourceItem is an object the student uses to complete a task. In the journalization example, the student makes a debit and credit for each transaction. The student has a finite set of accounts with which to respond for each transaction. Each account that appears in the interface has a corresponding SourceItem object. In other words, the items the student can manipulate to complete the task (account names) are called SourceItems.","Source","A Source is an object that groups a set of SourceItem objects together. Source objects have a One-To-Many relationship with SourceItem objects. In the journalization example, there are four types of accounts: Assets, Liabilities and Equity, Revenues, and Expenses. Each Account is of one and only one of these types and thus appears only under the appropriate tab. For each of the Account type tabs, there is a corresponding Source Object.","Target","A Target is a fixed place where students place SourceItems to complete a task. In the journalization example, the student places accounts on two possible targets: debits and credits. The top two lines of the journal entry control are Debit targets and the bottom two lines are Credit targets. These two targets are specific to the twelfth transaction.","TargetPage","A TargetPage is an object that groups a set of Target objects together. TargetPage objects have a One-To-Many relationship with Target objects (just like the Source to SourceItem relationship). In the journalization example, there is one journal entry for each of the twenty-two transactions. For each journal entry there is a corresponding TargetPage object that contains the Debits Target and Credits Target for that journal entry.","2. Reporting Student Actions to the ICAT","Description","As the student manipulates the application interface, each action is reported to the ICAT. In order to tell the ICAT what actions were taken, the application calls to a database and asks for a specific interface control's ID. When the application has the ID of the target control and the SourceItem control, the application notifies the ICAT about the Target to SourceItem mapping. In other words, every time a student manipulates a source item and associates it with a target (e.g., dragging an account name to a debit line in the journal), the user action is recorded as a mapping of the source item to the target. This mapping is called a UserSourceItemTarget.  illustrates the mapping of a source item to a target item in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","3. Student Submits Deliverables to one Team Member","Description","When the student is ready, he submits his work to one of the simulated team members by clicking on the team member's icon. When the ICAT receives the student's work, it calculates how much of the work is correct by concept. Concepts in our journalization activity will include Debits, Credits, Asset Accounts, etc. For each of these concepts, the ICAT will review all student actions and determine how many of the student actions were correct. In order for the ICAT to understand which targets on the interface are associated with each concept, the targets are bundled into target groups and prioritized in a hierarchy.  illustrates target group bundles in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For each target group\u2014or concept, such as debit\u2014a number of aggregate values will be calculated. These aggregate values determine how many student actions were right, wrong or irrelevant.","Knowledge Model","TargetGroup","A TargetGroup object represents a concept being learned. It is a group of Target objects related on a conceptual level. The TargetGroup objects in a Task are arranged in a hierarchy related to the hierarchy of concepts the student must learn. By analyzing the student's responses to the Targets in a TargetGroup, the ICAT can determine how well a student knows the concept. By utilizing the conceptual hierarchy of TargetGroups the ICAT can determine the most appropriate remediation to deliver to help the student understand the concepts.","TargetGroup Hierarchy","The TargetGroup objects in a Task are arranged in a hierarchical tree structure to model the varying specificity of concepts and sub-concepts being learned in the Task. The designer defines the parent-child relationships between the TargetGroups to mimic the relationships of the real world concepts. This hierarchy is used in the determination of the most appropriate feedback to deliver. Concepts that are higher (more parent-like) in the TargetGroup structure are remediated before concepts that are modeled lower (children, grandchildren, etc.) in the tree.  illustrates a TargetGroup Hierarchy in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","In the journalization example, the main concept being taught is journalization. The concept of journalization can be divided into more specific sub-concepts, for example journalizing cash-for-expense transactions and journalizing expense-on-account transactions. These may further be divided as necessary. The designer teaches this conceptual knowledge to the ICAT by creating a TargetGroup called \u201cJournalizing Transactions\u201d with two child TargetGroups \u201cJournalizing Cash for Expense Transactions\u201d and \u201cJournalizing Expense On Account Transactions\u201d. The top-most TargetGroup in the Task, \u201cJournalizing Transactions\u201d contains all of the transactions in the Task. Child target groups will include just the first three transactions and transactions four to twenty.","Therefore when the when the ICAT determines how much of the task is correct, it will calculate values for the first three journal entries and the next sixteen. Calculating these two separate numbers will allow the ICAT to provide specific feedback about the first three and separate feedback about the next sixteen transactions. Here is a section of the target group hierarchy for the journalize task.  illustrates a small section the amount of feedback in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. By analyzing the responses to the targets in the each of the targetgroups, we can determine how many of the transactions the student has attempted, whether mistakes were made, what the mistakes were, etc. We can then assemble feedback that is very specific to the way the student completed the deliverables. By analyzing the student's responses to a group of conceptually related requests, we can determine the degree of success with which the student is learning the concept.","4. ICAT Analyzes Deliverables with Rules","Description","After the ICAT has calculated the aggregate values for the student's deliverables, it analyzes the deliverables by attempting to fire all of the Rules for that task. Rules that can fire, activate CoachTopics.  illustrates an analysis of rules in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","5. Select Appropriate Remediation Coach Topics","Description","Once all possible coach topics are activated, a feedback selection analyzes the active pieces of remediation within the concept hierarchy and selects the most appropriate for delivery. The selected pieces of feedback are then assembled into a cohesive paragraph of feedback and delivered to the student.  illustrates a feedback selection in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Feedback Selection Algorithm","After the ICAT has activated CoachTopics via Rule firings , the Feedback Selection Algorithm is used to determine the most appropriate set of CoachItems (specific pieces of feedback text associated with a CoachTopic) to deliver. The Algorithm accomplishes this by analyzing the concept hierarchy (TargetGroup tree), the active CoachTopics, and the usage history of the CoachItems. , B, C, D illustrate a flowchart of the feedback logic in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. There are five main areas to the feedback logic which execute sequentially as listed below. First , the algorithm looks through the target groups and looks for the top-most target group with an active coach topic in it. Second , the algorithm then looks to see if that top-most coach item is praise feedback. If it is praise feedback , then the student has correctly completed the business deliverable and the ICAT will stop and return that coach item . Third, if the feedback is not Praise , then the ICAT will look to see  if it is redirect, polish, mastermind or incomplete-stop . If it is any of these, then the algorithm will stop and return that feedback to the user . Fourth, if the feedback is focus , then the algorithm looks  to the children target groups and groups any active feedback in these target groups with the focus group header. Fifth, once the feedback has been gathered, then the substitution language is run  which replaces substitution variables with the proper names.","Once the ICAT has chosen the pieces of feedback to return, the feedback pieces are assembled into a paragraph. With the paragraph assembled, the ICAT goes through and replaces all variables. There are specific variables for SourceItems and Targets. Variables give feedback specificity. The feedback can point out which wrong SourceItems were placed on which Targets. It also provides hints by providing one or two SourceItems which are mapped to the Target.","IV. The ICAT Development Methodology for Creating Feedback","The Steps Involved in Creating Feedback","The goal of feedback is to help a student complete a business deliverable. The tutor needs to identify which concepts the student understands and which he does not. The tutor needs to tell the student about his problems and help him understand the concepts.","There are seven major steps involved in developing feedback for an application.\n\n","A feedback strategy is a loose set of questions which guide the designer as he creates rules and feedback. The strategy describes what the student should learn, how he will try and create the business deliverable and how an expert completes the deliverable. The goal of the application should be for the student to transition from the novice model to the expert model.","What Should the Student Know after Using the Application?","The first task a designer needs to complete is to define exactly what knowledge a student must learn by the end of the interaction. Should the student know specific pieces of knowledge, such as formulas? Or, should the student understand high level strategies and detailed business processes? This knowledge is the foundation of the feedback strategy. The tutor needs to identify if the student has used the knowledge correctly, or if there were mistakes. An example is the journal task. For this activity, students need to know the purpose of the journalizing activity, the specific accounts to debit\/credit, and how much to debit\/credit. A student's debit\/credit is not correct or incorrect in isolation, but correct and incorrect in connection with the dollars debited\/credited.","Because there are two different types of knowledge\u2014accounts to debit\/credit and amounts to debit\/credit\u2014the feedback needs to identify and provide appropriate feedback for both types of mistakes.","How will a Novice Try and Complete the Task?","Designers should start by defining how they believe a novice will try and complete the task. Which areas are hard and which are easy for the student. This novice view is the mental model a student will bring to the task and the feedback should help the student move to an expert view. Designers should pay special attention to characteristic mistakes they believe the student will make. Designers will want to create specific feedback for these mistakes. An example is mixing up expense accounts in the journal activity. Because students may mix up some of these accounts, the designer may need to write special feedback to help clear up any confusion.","How does an Expert Complete the Task?","This is the expert model of completing the task. The feedback should help students transition to this understanding of the domain. When creating feedback, a designer should incorporate key features of the expert model into the praise feedback he writes. When a student completes portion of the task, positive reinforcement should be provided which confirms to the student that he is doing the task correctly and can use the same process to complete the other tasks.","These four questions are not an outline for creating feedback; but they define what the feedback and the whole application needs to accomplish. The designer should make sure that the feedback evaluates all of the knowledge a student should learn. In addition, the feedback should be able to remediate any characteristic mistakes the designer feels the student will make. Finally, the designer should group feedback so that it returns feedback as if it were an expert. With these components identified, a designer is ready to start creating target group hierarchies.","Limit Errors Through Interface","When the designer defines a feedback strategy, the designer defines the skills he wants the student to learn and the mistakes he thinks the student will make. Not all of the mistakes need to be corrected with ICAT generated feedback, some can be limited with or remediated through the interface. Limiting mistakes with the interface simply means that the system pops-up a message as the student works, identifying a mistake. An example interface corrected error is in the journalization activity when the interface points out that debits do not equal credits. Here, this is a low level mistake which is more appropriate to remediate through the interface than through the ICAT. The application simply check to see if the debit number equal the credit number and if they do not then the system message is returned.  illustrates an example of separating out some mistakes for the interface to catch and others for the ICAT to catch has positive and negative impacts in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Positive","The most obvious reason for eliminating mistakes through the interface is that can be easier for the designer and developer to catch them at this level than to leave them for the ICAT.","Negative","The reason to avoid interface-driven feedback is that it splinters the feedback approach which can make the job of creating a coherent feedback approach more difficult.","Because there are positive and negative repercussions, designers need to select the when to remediate through the interface carefully. The criteria for making the decision is if the mistake is a low level data entry mistake or a high level intellectual mistake. If the mistake is a low level mistake, such as miss-typing data, it may be appropriate to remediate via the interface. If the designer decides to have the interface point out the mistakes, it should look as if the system generated the message. System generated messages are mechanical checks, requiring no complex reasoning. In contrast, complex reasoning, such as why a student chose a certain type of account to credit or debit should be remediated through the ICAT.","System Messages","It is very important that the student know what type of remediation he is going to get from each source of information. Interface based remediation should look and feel like system messages. They should use a different interface from the ICAT remediation and should have a different feel. In the journalization task described throughout this paper, there is a system message which states \u201cCredits do not equal debits.\u201d This message is delivered through a different interface and the blunt short sentence is unlike all other remediation.","The motivation for this is that low level data entry mistakes do not show misunderstanding but instead sloppy work. Sloppy-work mistakes do not require a great deal of reasoning about why they occurred instead, they simply need to be identified. High-level reasoning mistakes, however, do require a great deal of reasoning about why they occurred, and the ICAT provides tools, such as target groups, to help with complex reasoning. Target group hierarchies allow designers to group mistakes and concepts together and ensure that they are remediated at the most appropriate time (i.e., Hard concepts will be remediated before easy concepts). Timing and other types of human-like remediation require the ICAT; other low-level mistakes which do not require much reasoning include:","Incomplete","If the task requires a number of inputs, the interface can check that they have all been entered before allowing the student to proceed. By catching empty fields early in the process, the student may be saved the frustration of having to look through each entry to try and find the empty one.","Empty","A simple check for the system is to look and see if anything has been selected or entered. If nothing has been selected, it may be appropriate for the system to generate a message stating \u201cYou must complete X before proceeding\u201d.","Numbers not Matching","Another quick check is matching numbers. As in the journalization activity, is often useful to put a quick interface check in place to make sure numbers which must match do. Small data entry mistakes are often better remediated at the interface level than at the tutor or coach level (when they are not critical to the learning objectives of the course).","There are two main issues which must be remembered when using the interface to remediate errors. First, make sure the interface is remediating low level data entry errors. Second, make sure the feedback looks and feels different from the ICAT feedback. The interface feedback should look and feel like it is generated from the system while the ICAT feedback must look as if it were generated from an intelligent coach who is watching over the student as he works.","Creating the Target Group Hierarchy","Target groups are sets of targets which are evaluated as one. Returning to the severity principle of the feedback theory, it is clear that the tutor needs to identify how much of the activity the student does not understand. Is it a global problem and the student does not understand anything about the activity? Or, is it a local problem and the student simply is confused over one concept? Using the feedback algorithm described earlier, the tutor will return the highest target group in which there is feedback. This algorithm requires that the designer start with large target groups and make sub-groups which are children of the larger groups. The ICAT allows students to group targets in more than one category. Therefore a debit target for transaction thirteen can be in a target group for transaction thirteen entries as well as a target group about debits and a target group which includes all source documents. Target should be grouped with four key ideas in mind. Target groups are grouped according to:\n\n","The most important issue when creating target groups is to create them along the concepts students need to know to achieve the goal. Grouping targets into groups which are analogous to the concepts a student needs to know, allows the tutor to review the concepts and see which concepts confuse the student. As a first step, a designer should identify in an unstructured manner all of the concepts in the domain. This first pass will be a large list which includes concepts at a variety of granularities, from small specific concepts to broad general concepts. These concepts are most likely directly related to the learning objectives of the course.","With all of the concepts defined, designers need to identify all of the targets which are in each target group. Some targets will be in more than one target group. When a target is in more than one target group, it means that there is some type of relationship such as a child relationship or a part to whole relationship. The point is not to create a structured list of concepts but a comprehensive list. Structuring them into a hierarchy will be the second step of the process.","In the journalization activity, the largest concept is the recording a transaction. Other important ideas are debits and credits. Debit and credit targets, however, are included in the overall transaction target group which means that it is either a part-whole relationship or a child relationship.  is a block diagram of the hierarchical relationship of a transaction in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Concepts Taught: Part-Whole Concepts","With all of the target groups laid out, the designer needs to identify the relationships between concepts. One type of relationship is the part-whole relationship. Part-whole relationships\u2014as the name denotes\u2014identified which sub-components make up larger concepts. Identifying these relationships is important because the tutor will want to see if the student does not understand the whole concept or just one part. If there are no major errors in the concept as a whole, then the tutor will look to see if the student made any major errors in one part of the concept.","Example:","In the journalizing activity, there will be a target group called transaction. In transaction, there are two parts: debits and credits. When the tutor reviews the student's work, if there are no problems with the target group transactions, then the tutor will go to the next level and look for errors in the target group debits and credits. Because debits and credits are included in an overall transaction, there is a part-whole relationship to the concept transaction.","Concept Taught: Child Concepts","In addition to part-whole relationships, designers need to identify child-parent relationships. In contrast to part-whole relationships, child-parent relationships define instances of abstract concepts. An example is \u201cThe dictionary is a book\u201d. \u201cDictionary\u201d is a child concept to \u201cbook\u201d. The \u201cdictionary\u201d concept has all of the attributes of the \u201cbook\u201d concept, and it is an instance of the concept which means that it contains extra attributes. Students may understand the concept in general but may be confused about a particular instance.","Example:","In the journalization activity, the concept transaction can be broken down into two sections: the debit and the credit. And each of those can be specialized into specialization categories, such as a credit to \u201cAccounts payable\u201d. Students may not be confused about debits but the instance \u201cAccounts Payable\u201d.","Interface Constraints","Interface Constraint: Business Deliverable","When creating target group hierarchies, designers need to consider the type of deliverable the student is creating. For each of the sections of the deliverable, the designer needs to create a target group. The target groups should contain an orderly structure, such as moving from top to bottom. Reviewing the deliverable in the order it is created structures the critique so that students know where to look next, after receiving feedback. In the current Intelligent Tutoring Agent, this structuring of feedback around the student-created deliverable can be accomplished in two ways. First, the designer can make every section of the deliverable a target. In addition, the designer can make some sections targets and some modifying attributes. Modifying attributes can be remediated on specifically, or in conjunction with the target.","In the journalization activity, the sections of the product\u2014the journal entry\u2014mirrors the concepts involved\u2014debits and credits. But there are a few extra items on the journal which are (in most cases) not involved in the main concepts being taught, and these are the dollar amounts to be journalized. The dollar amounts which are journalized are associated with the journal entry as an attribute. Attributes modify the source item (account name), which makes it possible to tell if the source item is correct alone or with the attribute attached. As a designer, feedback should be created which takes all of this into account. Students should be told if they have the journal entry correct and the amount wrong, or if they have the whole thing wrong.","Interface Constraint: Screen Space","Many times one concept will span many sections of the interface. It is important to group the target groups so that they are interface specific. Therefore, even though one product may span multiple interfaces, the target groups should be centered around the interfaces so that the students receive feedback only about what they can see.","In the journalization activity, the sections of the deliverable\u2014the collection of journal entries in the ledger\u2014span many separate interfaces. Each source document must be seen individually. Therefore, some target groups are organized across all source documents\u2014such as all debits\u2014and others are specific to the individual source documents\u2014such as that source document's debits. The target group's hierarchy must include a section for across source documents\u2014across interfaces\u2014and those within one source document\u2014one interface.","Information Overload","As with any real-life tutor, you do not want to give too much information for the student to digest at once. If there are twenty-five problems, the tutor should not give feedback about all errors simultaneously. Instead, the tutor should give feedback about just two or three things which the student can correct before asking for more feedback.","In the journalization activity, there are a limited number of targets on the interface at one time\u2014one debit and one credit. But if it were the whole General Ledger, it could have too many pieces of feedback for the student to digest at once and could overwhelm the student. In this case, the designer should scale the feedback so that just a handful come back at once. This is best done by having small target groups defined, but can also be done by identifying to the tutor how many different pieces of remediation are appropriate to deliver at one time.","Positive Reinforcement","In addition to creating target groups which are small in size, designers may want to create target groups which evaluate the first few steps a student makes. These early target groups will allow the student to see if he is on track and understand the goal of the interaction. This is, in general, a good remediation strategy, but may not be relevant in all learning situations.","In the journalization activity, there are twenty source documents to journalize. Students should NOT be encouraged to ask for feedback at every step, but when they have completed all of their work. This will ensure that students try and learn all of the information first and not rely completely on the hints of the tutor. But, target groups defined for just the first three entries allow for feedback and hints to be provided at the onset of the task, diminishing once these entries are correct.","Sequencing the Target Group Hierarchy","For feedback to be as effective as possible, it needs to provide the right information at the right time. If feedback is given too early, it is confusing; if feedback is given too late it is frustrating. In the ICAT, feedback is returned according to Target Groups. The tutor will look at the highest target group, if there is no feedback in that target group, the tutor will look at the children target groups in order of priority.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0514","num":"0982"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 39"]},"Positive Reinforcement First","Designers should identify the first few components a student will try and complete first and sequences them first. This target group will evaluate just the first few moves a student makes and will tell him how he is doing and how to apply the knowledge gained from the first few steps to the rest of the work he has to do.","In the journalization activity, students need to have reinforcement that they are on the right track before trying all of the journal entries. Therefore, the first three are grouped together and students can feedback on how they completed this sub-group before having to complete the rest. Completing this subsection gives students the positive reinforcement they need to complete the rest.","Easy Before Hard","If all of the target groups are of equivalent size, designers need to sequence easier concepts before more complicated concepts. By placing easier concepts first, a student will gain confidence in their understanding of the domain and in their ability to complete the deliverable. In addition, most complicated concepts are built on easier ones so that presenting easier concepts first will allow the student to gain the experience they need to complete the most complicated concepts. In the journalization activity, two legged journal entries are inherently easier than three legged and four legged journal entries. Therefore when a designer must sequence target groups of equal size, the designer should sequence the two legged journal entries before the three and four legged entries.","First Things First","Besides sequencing easier concepts before hard concepts, another strategy is to sequence target groups in order that they need to be completed. If completing one section of the deliverable is a prerequisite for completing another section of the deliverable, it makes sense to sequence those targets first. In the journalization activity, a source document needs to be journalized in terms of the account name and in terms of the dollar amount. However, the account name must be identified before the amount is entered. It makes no difference whether the dollar figure of the account is right or wrong, until the student has the correct account name.","Writing Feedback","Creating and structuring target group hierarchies determines what is evaluated and the order the feedback is returned. Once the hierarchy has been created and structured, designers need to write feedback which will help the student complete his goal. Going back to the goals of the tutor as educator, feedback needs to accomplish the following goals:\n\n","These goals can be thought of in two sections. The first two are evaluative and the second two are instructive. Evaluation and instruction are two of the three main components of a piece of feedback text. The third component is Scope. These three components are described in more detailed below, beginning with Scope, as it is generally the first portion of a piece of feedback text.","What the Feedback is Evaluating (Scope)","The most important information feedback provides a student is what the tutor is reviewing. In most instances, the student will have completed lots of different actions before asking the tutor to review his work. Because the student has completed a lot of different actions, the tutor first needs to describe what portion of the activity or deliverable is being reviewed. There are generally three ways to scope what the tutor is reviewing.","All Work","The tutor is looking at everything the student did. Some instances when feedback should look at everything the student has done are praise level feedback and redirect level feedback. I looked at all of the journal entries and there are problems in many of them. Why don't you . . .","A Localized Area of Work","The tutor is looking at a subset of work the student completed. The greatest use of localized scoping if focus feedback. The feedback is focusing the student on one area of difficulty and asking him to correct it. I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, and here are the first three problems I found. The first . . .","A Specific Problem or Error","The tutor is focusing on one error and\/or problem and helping the student understand that error. Specific problem scoping is good for classic mistakes a student may make and the designer may want to remediate. In the first journal entry, you incorrectly debited Accounts Payable. Review that transaction . . .","How the Student Did (Evaluation)","The second section of the feedback text should describe how the student did. This is where the severity principle is applied and the feedback is either redirect, focus, polish or praise.","Redirect","Redirect feedback is appropriate for very severe errors: severe mistake sand misconceptions. This degree of severity can be assessed aggregately by recognizing there are problems throughout the student's work or it can be done specifically by recognizing some basic items are incorrect.","Example:","I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, and there are problems in most of them. Why don't you . . . I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, and you have made some basic mistakes with debits and credits. Why don't you . . .","Focus","Focus feedback is appropriate for localized mistakes or misconceptions. Focus level mistakes can be identified aggregately by identifying an area in which there are a number of mistakes or specifically by identifying that some of the building block ideas are wrong.","Example:","I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, and there are problems in many of the debits. Why don't you . . .","I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, I see problems when transactions are \u201con account\u201d. Why don't you . . .","Polish","Polish level feedback is for syntactic problems. Student understand the main ideas and have no local problems. There may be just one or two mistakes the student has made. Polish feedback should specify where the mistake is.","Example:","I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, and the third journal entry has the debit incorrect. Why don't you . . .","Praise","Praise level feedback is reserved for instances of \u201ccorrectness\u201d; the deliverable is correct and ready to be used in the business.","Example:","I am looking at the first five journal entries you made, and they are all correct. remember . . .","Mastermind","Mastermind feedback is reserved for instances where the student is not trying to learn a topic but trying to cheat his way through by repeatedly asking for feedback. The feedback needs to be written so that the student recognizes that the tutor wants more work completed before providing feedback.","Example:","You have not changed much of your work since the last time you asked me to review it. Review . . .","Incomplete","Incomplete feedback is reserved for instances where the student has not completed all of the required work. It should be remembered that sometimes it is desired to give substantive feedback before everything is complete so the student learns the process and concepts before trying to complete the whole deliverable.","Example:","You have not done all of your work. I would like you to try completing all journal entries before asking for my review.","What the Student Should Do Next (Instruction)","The final piece of information the student needs is what to do next. The student knows what the tutor reviewed and knows how he performed. The only thing the student does not know is what to do next. The type of instruction does not have to correspond with the severity of the error. The instructions can be mixed and matched with the type of error. Some of the actions a student could be asked to perform are as follows.","Review the General Concept","If the tutor recognizes that there are many errors throughout the deliverable, the tutor may suggest that the student go through a review of the supporting materials provided to gain an understanding of the ideas and skills needed to complete the task.","Example:","There are problems in many journal entries, why don't you review how to journalize transactions and then review your journal entries.","Review a Section of the Student's Work","If the student has many errors in one section, then the tutor may suggest that the student go and review that section of their work.","Example:","There are problems in the first five journal entries, why don't you review them.","Review Work with a Hint","If there is a certain idea or concept which the tutor believes the student does not understand, then the tutor may give a hint in the form of a question or statement for the student to think about before trying to fix the problems.","Example:","There are problems in the first five journal entries. It looks like you have made some errors with the expense debits. Remember that expenses are not capitalized. Why don't you review the first five journal entries looking for journal entries which contained incorrect debits to expense accounts.","Review Work Looking for Type of Error","If there is a specific type of error that the student has made throughout his work, then the tutor may tell the student the specific type of error and ask him to go through his work correcting this error.","Example:","There are problems in the first five journal entries. You have switched all of your journal entries on account debits. Why don't you go and fix them.","Review Work Looking for Specific Error","If there is a specific error that the student has committed, the tutor may tell the student the specific error committed and where the error is.","Example:","There is a problem with your third journal entry. The debit should not be \u201cAccounts Payable.\u201d","Review work because it is correct and the student will want to use this analysis technique in the future.","Example:","Your first three journal entries are correct. Remember that the major distinction between paying for something \u201cOn Account\u201d or in cash. This is a distinction you will need to make in the future.","Do More Work","If it can be determined that the student is simply asking for feedback to \u201cCheat\u201d his way through the course, feedback should be provided to tell the student that he needs to try and correct many more entries before receiving substantive feedback.","Example:","You have not changed much of your work since the last time you asked me to review it. Please review all of your journal entries and correct many of them.","Complete Your Work","When it can be determined that all of the work which should be complete is not, the feedback needs to tell the student to complete the work required.","Example:","You have not completed all of your work. I would like you to try completing all journal entries before asking for my review.","Writing Levels of Feedback","Even with effective feedback, students will often make the same types of mistakes again or in different situations. The question is what to tell the student the second time he makes the same or similar mistakes. We assume that telling the student the same thing over and over is not the right answer. Therefore instead of telling the student the same thing, the feedback cycles to a lower, or secondary, level. At this time, we believe that three levels of feedback is appropriate for most instances. If the target group is particularly complex, however, additional levels of feedback may be required.","First Level of Feedback","The first level of feedback should focus more on telling the student what is wrong and letting the student try and figure it out on his own. Therefore using the paradigm described above, the student should be told what the tutor is reviewing, how he did and asked to retry it or referred to some reference which could be used to find the answer.","Example:","There are problems in many journal entries. Why don't you review how to journalize transactions and then review your work.","Second Level of Feedback","The second level of feedback should give hints and provide pieces of the puzzle. I can be assumed that students cannot figure out the problem on their own and need some help. It is appropriate at this point to ask the student to review their work with a specific hint in mind or with a question to think about. Also, if there are specific points in the reference system to review, this is the time to provide them.","Example:","There are problems in the first five journal entries. It looks like you have made some errors with expense debits. Remember that expenses are not capitalized. Why don't you review the first five journal entries looking for journal entries which contain incorrect debits to expense accounts.","Third Level of Feedback","The third level of feedback is appropriate for examples. Use the parameter substitution language to insert an example of an error they made into the feedback. Walk the student through the thought process he should use to solve the problem and provide and example of how they did the work right and how they did the work wrong.","Example:","There are problems in many of your journal entries. It looks like you have made some errors distinguishing between \u201con account\u201d and \u201ccash\u201d credits. In particular, you characterized journal entry #12 as a cash purchase when in fact it is an \u201con account\u201d purchase. Remember bills which are not paid immediately are paid on account.","Writing Rules","With the hierarchies created and sequenced and the feedback written, the designer is ready to write rules. Rules fire the particular pieces of feedback the student reads. To write effective rules, designers must realize the piece of feedback and the rule are one and the same. The only difference is the language used. The feedback is written in English and the rules are written as patterns.","Example Rule:","If the student has attempted all of the first three journal entries And they all contain at least one mistake Then provide feedback \u201cIn the first three journal entries you have made at least one mistake in each. Why don't you review them and see if you can find the mistakes.\u201d","In the above example, the rules has two conditions (attempt all three journal entries and have at least one mistake in each). The feedback is an explicit statement of that rule. The feedback states \u201cIn the first three journal entries you have made at least one mistake in each. Why don't you review them and see if you can find any mistakes.\u201d","The rule and the feedback are exactly the same. Keeping the rules and the feedback tightly linked ensures that the student receives the highest quality feedback. The feedback exactly explains the problem the rules found. If the feedback is more vague than the rule, then the students will not understand the exact nature of the problem. The feedback will simply hint at it. If the feedback is more specific than the rule, students will become confused. The student may not have made the specific error the feedback is referring to under the umbrella rule.","Types of Rules","Because the rules need to map to the feedback, there will be six types of rules associated with the six types of feedback: Praise, Polish, Focus, and Redirect, along with Mastermind and Incomplete.","Praise","Praise rules need to look for one hundred percent correct and NO errors. If the rule does not explicitly look for no errors, the rule will also fire when the student has all of the right answers but also some of the wrong ones.","If 100% of the targets in the first three journal entries are correct And they all contain no mistakes Then provide praise feedback.","Praise rules can be applied in many places other than the highest task level. Praise rules can fire for instances where a student got an item right. In general, these rules should be written for any instance which poses a difficult problem and a student may need reinforcement as to how to complete the process and complete the deliverable.","Polish","Polish rules need to fire when almost everything in the target group is correct and the student is making small and insignificant mistakes.","If 80%-99% of the targets in the first three journal entries are correct And the first three journal entries have been tried Then provide polish feedback.","This polish rule shows two things. First, the rule is scoped so that it will not fire when any of the first three journal entries have not been attempted. In addition, the rule will not fire if all of the journal entries are 100% correct. With these boundaries in place the rule will only fire when the student has attempted all of the first three journal entries and they are 80%-99% correct. Note: The determination of the exact percentages which must be correct to receive \u201cpolish\u201d versus \u201cfocus\u201d or \u201credirect\u201d feedback will be determined by the designer, and are most likely specific to the particular task being completed.","Focus","Focus rules are the most common type of rule. Focus rules should fire when the student knows enough to complete the task but not enough to get the task correct.","If 40%-79% of the targets in the first three journal entries are correct And the first three journal entries have been tried Then provide focus feedback.","This focus rule also shows scoping. The rules are scoped to fire between 40% and 79%. Below 40% is redirect and above 79% is polish. The rule also fires only when all of the required work has been attempted.","Redirect","Redirect rules should fire when it is clear that the student does not have a good understanding of how to complete the task. This is evidenced by a significant number of errors found in the student's work.","If less than 40% of the first three journal entries are correct And the first three journal entries have been tried. Then provide redirect feedback.","This redirect rule is to catch those who are truly lost. If the student has tried to complete all of the work, and they are less than 40% correct, then they need a great deal of help to continue the task.","Mastermind","Mastermind rules need to track down situations when the student is simply trying to cheat his way through the application.","If less than 40% of the first three journal entries are correct And the student has made only one change twice in a row. Then provide mastermind feedback.","This mastermind rule catches those who are making one change, asking for feedback over and over. One thing to keep in mind is that as a student gets towards praise they need to make small changes and then ask for feedback. To allow this, the above rule is scoped so that if the student has more than 40% of the work right the rule will not fire.","Incomplete","In many activities the student should try and complete most if not all of the work before asking for feedback. One of the goals of many training applications is to mimic the real world, and it is rare for an employee to ask for a review after every little step they complete. Most employers want to see a significant amount of work done before asking for a review.","If all of journal entries have NOT been tried, Then provide incomplete feedback.","Forcing a student to attempt all of his work first will require him to gain confidence in his ability to complete the work. Therefore, incomplete rules should be used after baby-step feedback so that students feel that they have the tools and ability to complete the whole task before asking for feedback.","Principles of Rule Design","There are a couple of general rules which make rule creation and maintenance easier.","Use Percentages Whenever Possible","It may seem easier at the time to write rules which look for specific numbers of right and wrong items. But when a rule is written which looks for a specific number, it means that if the data ever changes, you will need to get back into that rule and tweak it so that it still fires at the right time. It is far better to write percentage rules which fire whenever a certain percentage of work is either right or wrong. Then if the data ever changes and more right answers are added or some removed, then the rules may not need to be rewritten.","Scope the Rules as Tightly as Possible","As stated previously, it is very important to make the rules mirror the written feedback. If the feedback is vaguer than the rule, then the students will not understand the exact nature of the problem. The feedback will simply hint at it. If the feedback is more specific than the rule, students will become confused.

idea is for the designer to model the task that he wants a student to accomplish using an Excel spreadsheet. Then, have an algorithm or engine that reads all the significant cells of the spreadsheet and notifies the Intelligent Coaching Agent with the appropriate information (SourceItemID, TargetID and Attribute). This way, the spreadsheet acts as a central repository for student data, contains most of the calculations required for the task and in conjunction with the engine handles all the communication with the ICA. The task is self contained in the spreadsheet, therefore the designers no longer need a graphical user interface to functionally test their designs (smart spreadsheet).  is a block diagram illustrating how the simulation engine is architected into an embodiment of the present invention of the invention.","Once the model and feedback for it are completely tested by designers, developers can incorporate the spreadsheet in a graphical user interface, e.g., Visual Basic as a development platform. The simulation spreadsheet is usually invisible and populated using functions provided by the engine. It is very important that all modifications that the ICA needs to know about go through the engine because only the engine knows how to call the ICA. This significantly reduced the skill level required from programmers, and greatly reduced the time required to program each task. In addition, the end-product was less prone to bugs, because the tutor management was centralized. If there was a tutor problem, we only had to check on section of code.

The object includes logic that controls the time periods as well as read and write parameters to the system dynamics model.

The system dynamics object allows for the system dynamics models to execute one step at a time, all at once, or any fixed number of time periods.","When the system dynamics model runs, each step of the parameter input and parameter output data is written to a \u2018backup\u2019 sheet for two reasons. First, the range of data that is received over time (the model playing multiple times) can be used to create trend graphs or used to calculate statistical values. Second, the system dynamics model can be restarted and this audit trail of data can be transmitted into the model up to a specific point in time.

The application stores all of the ICAT submissions in a student table, which can then be passed back to the ICAT after changes have been made.  illustrates a Feedback Reviewer display in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A user first selects a saved student profile by positioning the cursor over and clicking the Student combo box . This action invokes logic which then populates any tasks that the student performed in the Task list . By selecting a task, all of the submissions that the student performed populate the submission table .","To view a submission, click on the submission in the submission table . This will populate all of the Targets, SourceItems and Attributes submitted at that time in the submission data table . Also, any comments added by the tester in the application will appear in the Tester Comment Field  as well as the feedback received for that submission . To resubmit this data to the ICAT, click on the Load Archive button . This action loads the SourceItems, Targets and Attributes from the Submission Data  into the ICAT. Then, this data can be replayed one step at a time by clicking the Replay button  or all of the data for all submissions can be replayed by clicking on the Replay All button . After this data is replayed, the Current Feedback field  is populated with the feedback received. Any comments can be added to the Fixer Comments field . This utility efficiently facilitates student submissions transmission to the ICAT without recreating the work. ICAT rules can be configured and then the submissions can be replayed to test the associated changes.","The following example is provided to step through the process for using the ICA Utilities:","Objective:","The objective here is to create a task where users will journalize an invoice and receive feedback on their work.","Step 1) Configure the ICAT:","After planning the task, the designer should add all relevant information to the ICAT such as the SourceItems (Accounts), Targets (Invoices), Attributes (Amounts to Journalize) and any Rules they wish to create. For this example, the correct answer is created in the ICAT (Debit Machinery for $1,000 and credit Accounts Payable for $1,000) along with some basic rules and feedback.","Step 2) Create the Simulation Model:","The tables below represent the model for the example simulation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0737","num":"1379"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Accounts","SourceItem "]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Accounts Payable","1"]},{"entry":[{},"Accounts Receivable","2"]},{"entry":[{},"Cash","3"]},{"entry":[{},"Machinery","4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0738","num":"1380"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00031","num":"00031"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Invoice 1"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Wills Machinery "]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Two pressing machines were"]},{"entry":[{},"purchased on account for $1,000."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0739","num":"1381"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00032","num":"00032"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Account",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SID","Amount "]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Debit",{},"DR_AMOUNT"]},{"entry":[{},"Credit",{},"CR_AMOUNT"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The three tabular displays appearing above show an invoice associated with the purchase of two machines on account. We also see the SourceItemIDs for the possible accounts (these were configured in the ICAT). In the simulation model, defined names were given for the Amount fields in both the Debit (DR_AMOUNT) and Credit (CR_AMOUNT) fields. The SourceItemID field is created to the left of the attribute field and the attribute field always has the defined name. This is because the simulation engine finds the Defined Name and gets the attribute from there. Then, it looks to the left of the defined name to find the SourceItemID.","Step 3) Configure the Inputs, Outputs and Lists","For this example, only 2 inputs are needed and they are the debit and credit entry for the invoice. In the Object editor, create a path to be used to pass the inputs to the ICAT. Then, configure the inputs using the DR_AMOUNT and CR_AMOUNT defined names and the Target defined in the ICAT.  is an object editor display that illustrates the use of references in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The reference  is used in the defined name (DR_AMOUNT), the Input is Tutor aware  and will be mapped to TargetID  (created in the ICAT to distinguish the debit for this invoice). The credit input is created in the same way.","Step 4) Test the Feedback in the Simulation Workbench","Designers can open the Simulation Workbench and load the model that was created in Step 2. Then, different SourceItemIDs for the accounts and the amounts can be changed in the model. During this time, designers can Load and Run the Simulation to see the feedback. One example entails the step of putting the Machinery SourceItemID (4) in the Debit SID field, 1,000 in the Debit Amount field, Accounts Payable SourceItemID (1) in the Credit SID field and 1,000 in the Credit Amount field to see if they get praise by the Coach.","Step 5) View and Debug Errors","After submitting multiple times to the ICAT, a designer can view what was passed to the tutor by viewing the logs in the log viewer. If there was an error, such as the correct answers being put in but incorrect feedback showing, these logs would prove helpful in tracking down the problem. Designers can also look in the Object Viewer to see the actual ICAT configuration.","The combination of the Log Viewer and ICAT Viewer will help the designer in testing and finding any problems in their feedback.","Step 6) Making Changes are Fixing Errors","Once the problems have been tracked down (Step 5), a designer can make the appropriate changes in the ICAT. From the ICA Doc Maker utility, a new ICA Doc can be made and then retested all over again.","Step 7) Building the Task","After the task has been designed and feedback created, the coder can use the ControlSourceItem object in the Object Editor utility to map the SourceItemIDs to specific accounts. Therefore, when a user drags an account from the chart of accounts, the application retrieves that SourceItemID from the ControlSourceItem list and then passes it to the Simulation Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0747","num":"1389"},"figref":"FIG. 75","b":["7500","7510","7520"]},"The next step entails designing the tutor approach. First, at function block , the expert metrics are identified for home buying metrics. These include the ratio of a person's salary to their home loan payment+assessment, new payment\/rent, five year gain, % down, scenario assumptions regarding market and real estate appreciation. Then, at function block  the relative weights for each metric are established and the rule structures are established that identify an appropriate conclusion to reach. For example, praise would entail a message saying home is a good buy, polish would entail a message that the home may be a good buy, but several risks should be addressed, focus parent would entail a message that the home is not a good buy due to the following indicators, and list the indicators suggesting that the home is not a good buy. Finally, a redirect message would be: are you kidding, the inputs are entirely unrealistic.","Function block  creates the focus child feedback based on a prioritization of key metrics such as the break even is too long, and the appreciation isn't high enough to justify the estimated foregone stock market appreciation, or there is not enough money down to grow equity in a short period of time. Finally, as function block  suggests, the feedback is tested with sample scenario data and a user test model is created to capture user questions at interaction points of relevance, questions are attached to the tutor regression database, and the feedback is fixed and tested in the regression workbench.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
