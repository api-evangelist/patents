title: Developing apparatus and image forming apparatus using progressive wave electric field transport
abstract: On surfaces of insulating layers and of a transportation member , a protective layer having a volume resistivity of 10Ω·cm to 10Ω·cm is so laminated that a sum of thickness of the insulating layers and is less than intervals between adjacent ones of progressive wave generating electrodes . With this arrangement, it is ensured that a progressive wave electric field generated by the progressive wave generating electrodes is exposed beyond a surface of the transportation member . Even if developer T and the transportation member contact each other, a surface potential of the transportation member is not changed. Moreover, firm adhering of the toner T to the surface of the transportation member is prevented. It is therefore possible to certainly transport the developer T to a development position always stably.

The developing apparatus is so arranged that an electrostatic latent image formed on an image supporting body is visualized by using developer. The present invention especially relates to a developing apparatus so arranged that developer is transported to a development position on an image supporting body by using a progressive wave electric field, and relates to an image forming apparatus using the developing apparatus.","The present invention relates to a developing apparatus used in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus. The developing apparatus is so arranged that an electrostatic latent image formed on an image supporting body is visualized by using developer. The present invention especially relates to a developing apparatus so arranged that developer is transported to a development position on an image supporting body by using a progressive wave electric field.","Among developing apparatuses used in image forming apparatuses, such as copying apparatuses and printers, that perform electrophotographic image forming, some developing apparatuses are so arranged that a developer supporting body, which supplies developer to an image supporting body, is positioned so as not to contact a surface of the image supporting body. Well-known methods employed in such developing apparatuses are a powder cloud method, a jumping method, and an electric field curtain (progressive wave electric field) method. The electric field curtain method is employed in a developing apparatus disclosed in Japanese Publication for Unexamined Patent Application, Tokukaihei No. 9-68864 (Publication Date: Mar. 11, 1997) (U.S. Pat. No. 2,836,537), for example. In the developing apparatus, an insulating layer is laminated on a substrate made of metal or resin. In the insulating layer, plural sets of electrodes are disposed in series. Each set includes three electrodes. The electrodes generate an electric field curtain effect by using a progressive wave electric field. The electrodes function as transportation means. The transportation means constitutes a transportation path. Via the transportation path, developer is transported from a developing tank to a development position in proximity with an image supporting body, and transported back to the developing tank.","However, with the conventional progressive wave electric field method, the developing apparatus has the following problems. When electrically charged developer is transported to the transportation path, which is provided with the transportation means including the substrate and the insulating layer, secondary electric charge occurs between the developer and the insulating layer of the substrate. This changes a surface potential of the insulating layer. As a result, transportation of the developer is destabilized, for example, because the developer firmly adheres onto a surface of the transportation means. Moreover, when the surface potential of the insulating layer is changed, there is also a change in a developing potential, which is a potential difference between the image supporting body and the transportation means in a developing step. As a result, a stable state of development cannot be maintained.","The present invention also relates to a developing apparatus that develops, by using developer and the like, an electrostatic latent image formed on a latent image supporting body (image supporting body), and relates to an image forming apparatus including the developing apparatus. The present invention especially relates to a developing apparatus and an image forming apparatus that use a mechanism (electric field curtain) with which the developer is transported by using a progressive wave electric field.","The electrostatic latent image is not limited to an electrostatic latent image formed by writing optical information onto an image supporting body electrically charged with a predetermined charge. The electrostatic latent image may be formed, by a method such as an ion flow method, directly on a dielectric material. Alternatively, the electrostatic latent image may be directly formed by a method such as a toner jet method, in which (i) an arbitrary voltage is applied to an electrode having a plurality of openings, so as to form a latent image in the air, and (ii) the developer is sprayed on a recording medium.","Among developing apparatuses used in image forming apparatuses, such as copying apparatuses, printers, and facsimiles, in which photoelectric image forming is performed, attention is currently paid to such developing apparatuses that use a non-contact method. In the non-contact method, development is performed in such a manner that the developer supporting body contacts the image supporting body. Examples of the non-contact method are the powder cloud method, the jumping method, and the electric field curtain (progressive wave electric field) method.","As described in, for example, Japanese Publication for Unexamined Patent Application, Tokukaihei No. 9-68864, means for generating an electric field curtain includes (i) a supporting substrate made of metal or resin, and (ii) an insulating layer laminated on the supporting substrate. In the insulating layer, plural sets of electrodes are disposed in series. The electrodes generate an electric field curtain effect. Each set of the electrodes includes three electrodes. When multiphase voltages are applied to the electrodes, a progressive wave electric field is formed. By using the progressive wave electric field, developer is transported on a surface of developer transportation member.","Incidentally, for developing apparatuses using a progressive wave electric field, it is necessary to appropriately select (i) a pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes of a developer transportation member and (ii) a driving frequency of the progressive wave electric field, so as to transport the developer efficiently and stably.","Specifically, if the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes is wide, a long time (transport time) is required for the developer to move between adjacent ones of the electrodes, although field intensity is high. It is therefore necessary to apply low-frequency voltages to the electrodes, so that an amount of the developer transported per unit time is maximized at a low frequency. On the other hand, if the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes is narrow, only a short time is required for the developer to move between adjacent ones of the electrodes, although the field intensity is low. It is therefore necessary to apply high-frequency voltages to the electrodes, so that the amount of the developer transported per unit time is maximized at a high frequency.","Thus, depending on whether the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes is wide or narrow, the amount of the developer transported per unit time significantly varies in a frequency band of the voltages applied to the electrodes. Therefore, unless an appropriate developer transportation condition is selected, it is impossible to transport the developer efficiently on the developer transportation means by using the progressive wave electric field.","Moreover, under the following conditions, developing apparatuses using a progressive wave electric field is susceptible to spatial and temporal distribution of a potential generated by the voltages applied to the electrodes: (i) a progressive wave electric field is generated on the surface (developer transportation surface) of the developer transportation member, that is, different voltages are applied to the electrodes, and (ii) a supporting surface (front surface) of the image supporting body, such as a photosensitive body, is right above or in close proximity with the surface of the developer transportation member after the image supporting body has moved in a perimeter direction. Therefore, when the supporting surface of the image supporting body is in close proximity with the surface of the developer transportation member, there is a possibility that periodical change in density is caused because of (i) the frequency of the voltages applied to the electrodes, (ii) the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes, and (3) a peripheral velocity of the image supporting body, as shown in FIGS. () and (), when the electrostatic latent image on the supporting surface of the image supporting body is developed.","In order to transport the developer on the surface of the developer transportation member, the progressive wave electric field needs to have certain intensity. The field intensity is influenced by the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes, and by a potential difference between adjacent ones of the electrodes. This is because, in order to attain progressive wave electric field intensity necessary for transporting the developer, the potential difference between adjacent ones of the electrodes needs to be larger as the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes becomes wider. Here, a state of the developer transported by the progressive wave electric field is as follows. The developer is in a cloud-like state while being transported by the progressive wave electric field. When the developer is in the cloud-like state, a height of the developer from the surface of the developer transportation member becomes higher if the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes becomes wider. If the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes is wide, the potential difference between adjacent ones of the electrodes needs to be large, so as to attain a desired progressive wave electric field. Therefore, energy of movement (energy of movement qV where q is charge of the developer, and V is the potential difference) given to the developer becomes large. This causes collisions of the developer with the developer itself, and increases a transportation speed of the developer. In this way, the developer in the cloud-like state is laminated on the surface of the developer transportation member due to, for example, deflection of a spraying path caused by an influence of air resistance. As a result, the height of the developer tends to become higher. Therefore, if the supporting surface of the image supporting body is completely soaked into the developer that is in the cloud-like state, so-called blotching is caused. Blotching is a phenomenon in which the developer adheres to a non-developing area of the supporting surface. The non-developing area is an area to which adhesion of the developer is not intended.","As described above, in image forming apparatuses such as copying apparatuses and printers employing an electrophotographic method, developing apparatuses employing a non-contact method are often used. In the non-contact method, the developer is transported to a vicinity of the image supporting body, and the developer is sprayed on an electrostatic latent image on the image supporting body, so that the electrostatic latent image is developed. Examples of the non-contact method are the powder cloud method, the jumping method, and the electric field curtain (progressive wave electric field) method.","A method using a progressive wave electric field is described in Tokukaihei 9-68864, for example. In this method, there are provided (i) a transportation path through which developer is transported from a developer containing section to an image supporting body, (ii) a collecting path through which unnecessary developer that did not adhere to the image supporting body is collected, and (iii) a developing electrode, which is directed downward and which is provided in proximity with one end of the transportation path so as to face the image supporting body.","The transportation path has a large number of electrodes embedded therein. To the electrodes, multiphase alternating voltages are applied, so as to generate a progressive wave electric field. By using the progressive wave electric field, the developer on the transportation path is transported to the image supporting body. When the developer is transported to the vicinity of the image supporting body, the developer is sprayed on the image supporting body due to charge of the electrostatic latent image of the image supporting body and due to the field generated by the developing electrode. Then, the developer adheres to the electrostatic latent image. In this way, the electrostatic latent image on the image supporting body is developed. The developer that did not adhere to the electrostatic latent image falls into the collecting path, and is collected through the collecting path into the developer containing section.","In such a developing apparatus, no mechanical power is used for transporting the developer. Instead, only the multiphase alternating voltages are applied to the electrodes of the transportation path. Therefore, it is possible to simplify an arrangement of the apparatus, and to miniaturize the apparatus.","Incidentally, in a method using a progressive wave electric field, distribution of toner in the transportation path is uneven in a traveling direction. Therefore, periodical density unevenness of the toner is caused. This is due to a frequency of the multiphase alternating current applied to the electrodes of the transportation path. If a toner image is formed by adhering the toner to the electrostatic latent image on the image supporting body while the uneven density of the toner on the transportation path moves in parallel with the electrostatic latent image in such a manner as to face the electrostatic latent image, the uneven density of the toner is directly reflected in the toner image.","However, in the foregoing conventional developing apparatus, despite the fact that (i) a traveling direction of the developer is a rotation movement direction of the image supporting body, and (ii) the toner having the uneven density on the transportation path faces the electrostatic latent image on the image supporting body and moves in parallel with the electrostatic latent image, no measure has been taken to suppress an influence of the density unevenness of the toner.","The present invention was made to solve the problems above. An object of the present invention is to provide a developing apparatus capable of (i) suppressing a variation of a surface potential of an insulating layer of transportation means at a time of transportation of developer, so as to prevent firm adhering of the developer to a surface of the transportation means, thereby transporting the developer to a development position always stably, and (ii) suppressing a variation of a developing potential between an image supporting body and the transportation means in a developing step, so as to attain an always stable state of development.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a developing apparatus in which (i) a pitch between adjacent ones of electrodes and (ii) a frequency of voltages applied are regulated, so that developer is transported efficiently on the developer transportation means by using progressive wave electric field, and to provide an image forming apparatus including the developing apparatus.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a developing apparatus capable of (i) developing an image of uniform density on an image supporting body, and (ii) performing excellent image forming with little blotching, and to provide an image forming apparatus including the developing apparatus.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a developing apparatus in which an electrostatic latent image can be developed evenly because density unevenness of toner does not have much influence on the electrostatic latent image although toner is transported by using a progressive wave electric field, and to provide an image forming apparatus including the developing apparatus.","To attain the objects above, the developing apparatus of the present invention has the following arrangements:","(1) In a developing apparatus in which an electrostatic latent image on a surface of an image supporting body is visualized by transporting developer to a development position by using a progressive wave electric field generated at transportation means, the transportation means includes: an insulating layer that covers a circumferential surface of progressive wave generating electrodes provided on a surface of a substrate; and a protective layer that protects a contact surface that contacts the developer, the insulating layer and the protective layer being laminated in this order; and a volume resistivity of the protective layer is lower than a volume resistivity of the insulating layer.","According to this arrangement, the protective layer is provided on a front surface of the insulating layer that covers the circumferential surface of the progressive wave generating electrodes on the substrate of the transportation means. The developer transported by the transportation means contacts the protective layer whose volume resistivity is lower than the volume resistivity of the insulating layer. Therefore, when the developer electrically charged in advance is transported by the transportation means, the surface potential of the transportation means is not varied significantly, even if secondary electric charge occurs between the developer and the transportation means.","(2) The volume resistivity of the protective layer is 10\u03a9\u00b7cm to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. It is more preferable that the volume resistivity is 10\u03a9\u00b7cm to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm.","According to this arrangement, the volume resistivity of the protective layer, which contacts the developer on the transportation member, is 10\u03a9\u00b7cm to \u03a9\u00b7cm. That is, the volume resistivity of the protective layer is set to such a value that, unlike a value that is (i) lower than approximately 10\u03a9\u00b7cm, which is necessary for the insulating layer so as to maintain insulation among the electrodes, and that is (ii) \u03a9\u00b7cm or lower, a transportation property and developing efficiency are not deteriorated by firm adhering, to the surface, of the developer melted by heat generated by the contact between the protective layer and the developer. Moreover, unlike cases in which the volume resistivity is lower, the transportation property is not deteriorated by an insufficient exposure, in which the electric field generated by the progressive wave generating electrodes is not sufficiently exposed beyond the protective layer.","(3) The protective layer is grounded.","According to this arrangement, the protective layer, which contacts the developer on the transportation means, is grounded. Therefore, even if secondary electric charge occurs between the protective layer and the developer, the surface potential of the protective layer is kept constant. This ensures that the developer does not firmly adhere onto the surface of the protective layer, and a development voltage between the image supporting body and the protective layer is not varied. As a result, the transportation property and the state of development are kept constant.","(4) In the transportation means,\n\n+<\n\nwhere a is thickness of the protective layer, a is thickness of the insulating layer, and b is a distance between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes.\n","According to this arrangement, the distance between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes is longer than a sum of the thickness of the protective layer and the thickness of the insulating layer. Therefore, it is ensured that a part of the electric field generated by the progressive wave generating electrodes is exposed beyond the protective layer. As a result, the transportation property does not deteriorate.","According to the present invention, the following effects can be attained.","(1) When the developer electrically charged in advance is transported by the transportation means, the surface potential of the transportation means is not varied significantly even if secondary electric charge occurs between the protective layer and the developer. This makes it possible to certainly transport the developer on the surface of the transportation means, and to attain an always stable state of development. This effect is brought about by providing the protective layer on the front surface of the insulating layer that covers the circumferential surface of the progressive wave generating electrodes on the surface of the substrate of the transportation means, and by causing the developer, which is transported by the transportation means, to contact the protective layer whose volume resistivity is lower than the volume resistivity of the insulating layer.","(2) The transportation property is not deteriorated by an insufficient exposure, in which the electric field generated by the progressive wave generating electrodes is not sufficiently exposed beyond the protective layer. This makes it possible to certainly transport the developer on the surface of the transportation means, and to attain an always stable state of development. This effect is brought about by setting the volume resistivity of the protective layer, which contacts the developer on the transportation means, to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm to 10\u03a9\u00b7cm. In this way, the volume resistivity of the protective layer is set to such a value that, unlike a value that is (i) lower than required for the insulating layer so as to maintain insulation among the electrodes, and that is (ii) 10\u03a9\u00b7cm or lower, the transportation property and the developing efficiency are not deteriorated by firm adhering, to the surface, of the developer melted by heat generated by the contact between the protective layer and the developer.","(3) The surface potential of the protective layer can be kept constant more certainly, even if secondary electric charge occurs between the protective layer and the developer. This makes it possible to prevent (i) firm adhering of the developer onto the surface of the protective layer, and (ii) a variation of the development voltage between the protective layer and the image supporting body. As a result, it is possible to transport the developer in a more stable state on the surface of the transportation means. This effect is brought about by grounding the protective layer, which contacts the developer on the transportation means.","(4) It is ensured that a part of the electric field generated by the progressive wave generating electrodes is exposed beyond the protective layer. This makes it possible to more certainly prevent deterioration of the transportation property of the developer, so that the developer can be transported in a more stable state. This effect is brought about by setting the distance between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generation electrodes to be longer than the sum of the thickness of the protective layer and the thickness of the insulating layer.","Moreover, to attain the object above, a developing apparatus of the present invention is based on a premise that the developing apparatus includes developer transportation means provided at a development area that faces an image supporting body that supports on a surface thereof an electrostatic latent image, the developer transportation means transporting developer by using a progressive wave electric field generated by applying multiphase voltages to a plurality of electrodes so provided in a substrate that there are predetermined intervals between adjacent ones of the electrodes. It is so arranged that a pitch \u03bb (m) between adjacent ones of the electrodes, and a frequency f (Hz) of the voltages applied to the electrodes satisfy\n\n0.10.5.\n","With this arrangement, transportation of the developer does not fail to catch up with a switching cycle of the voltages applied, and an amount of the developer transported does not decrease because the number of transportation of the developer per unit time does not decrease. Moreover, the developer does not firmly adhere onto the developer transportation means. Therefore, it is possible to stably transport a large amount of the developer per unit time in a stable region in which a change in the frequency of the line voltage and the variation of the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes do not have much influence, that is, to transport the developer efficiently by using the progressive wave electric field on the developer transportation means.","Here, if an absolute value of a specific charge q\/m, which is a charge amount of the developer, is within a range of\n\n5 \u03bcC\/g to 100 \u03bcC\/g,\n\nthe charge amount of the developer does not become excessively small. This makes it possible to move the developer smoothly between adjacent ones of the electrodes, thereby increasing the amount of the developer transported. Moreover, even if the developer scatters in a region in which the progressive wave electric field is weak on the developer transportation means, it is possible to control scattering of the developer by using a force of the electric field, because the charge amount of the developer is not excessively small.\n","Moreover, the charge amount of the developer is not excessively large. Therefore, the developer is transported even at a relatively high frequency. Here, once the developer adheres to the surface of the developer transportation means for some reason, mirror-image-induced firm adhering of the developer is likely to occur on its low-frequency side, and on its high-frequency side beyond a peak. However, because a variation, with respect to values of (\u03bb\u00d7f), of the amount of the developer transported does not have a salient peak, mirror-image-induced firm adhering of the developer is prevented, so that the developer is transported stably.","Moreover, if (i) the transportation means includes a high-resistance layer provided in a range from a surface of each electrode to the surface on which the developer is transported, and (ii) the frequency f (Hz) of the voltages applied to the electrodes, and a volume resistivity \u03c1 (\u03a9\u00d7m) of the high-resistance layer satisfy\n\n10,\n\ncharge of the developer caused by the contact between the developer and the developer transportation means is suppressed when the developer is transported on the developer transportation means. With this arrangement, the amount of the developer transported is not decreased by decrease, especially at a low frequency, of field intensity of the progressive wave electric field. Therefore, it is possible to transport the developer efficiently on the developer transportation means.\n","In particular, if the volume resistivity \u03c1 (\u03a9\u00d7m) of the high-resistance layer satisfies\n\n\u03c1>10,\n\nthe progressive wave electric field is sufficiently generated on the developer transportation means. As a result, it is possible to transport the developer more efficiently.\n","Furthermore, if the developing apparatus is used in an image forming apparatus, it is possible to provide an image forming apparatus that can transport the developer efficiently by using a progressive wave electric field in a stable region in which (i) the change in the frequency caused by the line voltage, and (ii) the variation of the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes do not have much influence.","As described above, by setting the pitch \u03bb (m) between adjacent ones of the electrodes, and the frequency f (Hz) of the voltages applied to the electrodes to satisfy\n\n0.10.5,\n\nit is possible to transport the developer efficiently on the developer transportation means by using the progressive wave electric field, without causing firm adhering of a large amount of the developer per unit time.\n","Here, by setting the absolute value of the specific charge q\/m, which is the charge amount of the developer, within the range of\n\n5 \u03bcC\/g to 100 \u03bcC\/g,\n\nit is possible to move the developer smoothly between adjacent ones of the electrodes, thereby increasing the amount of the developer transported. Moreover, it is possible to control the scattering of the developer. Furthermore, the variation of the amount of the developer transported, with respect to values of (\u03bb\u00d7f), does not have a salient peak. Therefore, mirror-image induced firm adhering of the developer is prevented, so that the developer is transported stably.\n","By setting the volume resistivity \u03c1 (\u03a9\u00d7m) of the high-resistance layer and the frequency f (Hz) of the voltages applied as to satisfy\n\n10,\n\nthe amount of the developer transported is not decreased by decrease, especially at a low frequency, of the electric field intensity of the progressive wave electric field. Therefore, it is possible to transport the developer efficiently on the developer transportation means.\n","In particular, by setting the volume resistivity \u03c1 (\u03a9\u00d7m) of the high-resistance layer to satisfy\n\n\u03c1>10,\n\nthe progressive wave electric field is sufficiently generated on the developer transportation means. As a result, it is possible to transport the developer more efficiently.\n","Furthermore, by using the developing apparatus in an image forming apparatus, it is possible to provide an image forming apparatus that can transport the developer efficiently by using the progressive wave electric field in the stable region in which (i) the change in the frequency caused by the line voltage, and (ii) the variation of the pitch between adjacent ones of the electrodes do not have much influence.","To attain the foregoing object, a developing apparatus of the present invention includes developer transportation member, which is (i) provided at a development area that faces an image supporting body that supports, on a surface thereof, an electrostatic latent image, and (ii) made by coating, with a surface protective layer, a plurality of electrodes so provided in a substrate that there are predetermined intervals between adjacent ones of the electrodes, the developing apparatus transporting, on the developer transportation member, developer by using a progressive wave electric field generated by applying multiphase voltages to the plurality of electrodes, a gap d, in meter, between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body and a pitch \u03bb, in meter, between adjacent ones of the electrodes satisfy\n\nd>\u03bb.\n","In this arrangement, the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body is wider than the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes. Under such a condition, a supporting surface of the image supporting body is hardly influenced, at a position right above or in close proximity with the surface of the developer transportation member, by spatial and temporal distribution of the potential, even while the progressive wave electric field is generated on the surface of the developer transportation member, that is, while different voltages are respectively applied to the progressive wave generating electrodes. Therefore, the potential distribution between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes is hardly reflected at the supporting surface of the image supporting member that is in close proximity with the surface of the developer transportation member. As a result, temporal and spatial uniformity is maintained. This makes it possible to reduce, in performing developing, an influence of unevenness in the potential distribution between adjacent ones of the electrodes, so as to develop an image having a uniform density on the surface of the image supporting body. Moreover, it is possible to perform excellent image forming because problems such as blotching, in which the developer adheres to a non-developing area on the supporting surface, can be prevented.","Here, if a peripheral velocity vp (mm\/sec) of the image supporting body, a latent image writing resolution R (dot\/mm) in a perimeter direction of the image supporting body, and the frequency f (Hz) of the voltages applied to the electrodes, are set to satisfy\n\n\n\nthe voltages applied to the progressive wave generating electrodes have such a frequency that is lower than a spatial frequency vp\u00d7R (dot\/sec) of the electrostatic latent image on the supporting surface of the image supporting body.\n","This setting is made in light of the following problems. If the spatial frequency of the electrostatic latent image on the supporting surface of the image supporting body is higher than the frequency of the progressive wave electric field, states of development are different per plural pixels on the supporting surface of the image supporting body, between a case in which the voltages applied to the progressive wave generating electrodes are maximum, and a case in which the voltages applied to the progressive wave generating electrodes are minimum. As a result, unevenness in development density is caused. On the other hand, if the frequency of the voltages applied to the electrodes is higher than the spatial frequency, each pixel on the supporting surface is developed by experiencing the voltage of a maximum value and the voltage of a minimum value. Although this eliminates the unevenness in development density among the pixels, the costs for the power source are increased.","In this respect, if (i) the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body and (ii) the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes, are set to satisfy\n\nd>\u03bb,\n\nthe supporting surface of the image supporting body that is in close proximity with the surface of the developer transportation member. Therefore, by applying, to the electrodes, the voltages having the frequency f lower than the spatial frequency vp\u00d7R of the electrostatic latent image on the supporting surface of the image supporting body, it is possible to perform excellent image forming with no unevenness in development density. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the costs for the power source, thereby attaining a reasonable price.\n","In order to prevent unnecessary developer from adhering to a non-image area (non electrostatic latent image part) and from scattering in the apparatus, it is necessary to return the unnecessary developer onto the developer transportation member. Here, the unnecessary developer is the developer that did not contribute to development of the electrostatic latent image on the supporting surface when the developer in a cloud-like state was transported by the progressive wave electric field and reached a vicinity of the image supporting member. If an average value V (V) of the voltages applied to the electrodes, a charge potential V (V) of a non-image area of the image supporting body, and the gap d (m) between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body, are set to satisfy\n\n|\/10,\n\nstrength of an effect of returning the unnecessary developer is decided. In other words, decided is strength of an effect by which the unnecessary developer is returned to the toner transportation member by a force applied in a direction in which the developer is returned to the developer transportation member, the force being given by the electric field between the non-image area of the image supporting body and the developer transportation member. Here, an important factor (the strength of the effect by which the unnecessary developer is returned to the developer transportation member) is a quotient of (i) an absolute value of a difference between the charge potential V in the non-image area of the image supporting body and the average value V of the voltages applied to the electrodes, by (ii) the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body. By setting the quotient to be larger than 10, it is possible to perform excellent image forming with no blotching.\n","If the interval \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes is set to\n\n100 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm,\n\nthe interval \u03bb is optimized, without becoming excessively narrow or excessively wide.\n","If the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes is narrower than 100 \u03bcm, there is a possibility that the electrodes are not formed properly when the developer transportation member is manufactured, thereby resulting in leakage between adjacent ones of the electrodes. On the other hand, if the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes is wider than 1000 \u03bcm, it is necessary to apply high voltages so that the progressive wave electric field becomes strong enough to transport the developer. As a result, there is a possibility that costs for the power source are increased, and unnecessary noise is caused by vibration of the developer transportation member. However, by setting the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes to 100 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm, it is possible (i) to prevent the leakage between adjacent ones of the electrodes, (ii) to reduce the costs for the power source, and (iii) to reduce the noise caused by the vibration of the developer transportation member.","If the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body is set to\n\n0.1 mm to 10 mm,\n\nthe gap d is optimized, without becoming excessively narrow or excessively wide.\n","If the gap between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body is narrower than 0.1 mm, blotching, that is, adhesion of the developer to the non-developing area, is likely to occur, and the image forming becomes unstable because the strength of the developing electric field is significantly changed even by a slight inaccuracy of the gap. On the other hand, if the gap between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body is wider than 10 mm, the charge potential needs to be high, so as to attain the field intensity necessary to return the unnecessary developer to the developer transportation member. This increases a load applied to the image supporting body, thereby causing deterioration of the image supporting body. However, by setting the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body to 0.1 mm to 10 mm, it is possible to perform the image forming smoothly, because blotching of the image supporting body can be prevented, and because the developing field intensity is stabilized. Moreover, it is possible to lower the charge potential of the image supporting body, so that the load applied to the image supporting body is decreased. As a result, deterioration of the image supporting body is prevented.","Furthermore, by using the developing apparatus in an image forming apparatus, it is possible to provide an image forming apparatus that can develop, on the image supporting surface of the image supporting body, an image having uniform density, and that can perform excellent image forming with little blotching.","As described above, by setting the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body to be wider than the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes, the influence of unevenness in the potential distribution between adjacent ones of the electrodes is reduced in performing developing. Therefore, it is possible to develop an image having uniform density on the image supporting body, and to prevent blotching of the image supporting body. As a result, it is possible to perform excellent image forming.","Here, by applying, to the electrodes, voltages of such a frequency that is lower than a product of (i) the peripheral velocity vp of the image supporting body and (ii) the latent image writing resolution R of the image supporting body, it is possible to eliminate the influence of the potential distribution between adjacent ones of the electrodes, under the condition in which the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body is wider than the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes. This makes it possible to perform excellent image forming with no unevenness in development density, and to reduce the costs for the power source, thereby attaining a lower price.","Moreover, by setting, to be larger than 10, the quotient of (i) the absolute value of the difference between the average value V of the voltages applied to the electrodes and a charge potential V (V) in the non-image area of the image supporting body, by (ii) the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body, it is possible to decide the strength of the effect by which the unnecessary toner, which did not contribute to developing the electrostatic latent image on the supporting surface, is returned to the developer transportation member. Therefore, it is possible to perform excellent image forming with no blotching.","Moreover, by setting the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes to 100 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm, it is possible (i) to prevent the leakage between adjacent ones of the electrodes, (ii) to reduce the cost for the power source, and (iii) to reduce the noise caused by the vibration of the developer transportation member.","By setting the gap d between the developer transportation member and the image supporting body to 0.1 mm to 10 mm, it is possible to prevent blotching of the image supporting body and to stabilize the developing electric field intensity, so that the image forming can be performed smoothly.

Therefore, distribution of the toner in the transportation path is uneven in a traveling direction, in accordance with the frequency of the multiphase voltages applied to the electrodes of the transportation path. This causes periodical density unevenness of the toner. However, by setting the traveling direction of the developer to be opposite to the rotative direction of the image supporting body as in the present invention, the developer on the transportation path and the electrostatic latent image on the image supporting body pass each other, so that the toner can be supplied to any part of the electrostatic latent image from a broad range in the transportation path. Because of this, the density unevenness of the toner disappears in a process of supplying the toner from the transportation path to the image supporting body. Therefore, the density unevenness of the toner does not appear on the image supporting body. In contrast, if the traveling direction of the developer is the same as the rotative direction of the image supporting body as in the conventional apparatuses, the toner that is on the transportation path and that has uneven density faces the electrostatic latent image on the image supporting body, and moves in parallel with the electrostatic latent image. As a result, the uneven density of the toner is directly reflected in the toner image on the image supporting body.","Moreover, in the present invention, it is so arranged that 10\u2266\u03bb\u00d7f\u2266800, where \u03bb, in micrometer, is an interval between adjacent ones of the electrodes provided in a row; and f, in kirohertz, is a frequency.","By thus setting the interval \u03bb and the frequency f, it is possible to suppress the density unevenness of the toner, and to transport the toner stably via the transportation path. As a result, quality of the toner image obtained by developing the electrostatic latent image is stabilized. If the interval \u03bb and the frequency f are set to satisfy \u03bb\u00d7f>800, the frequency is so high as compared with the interval \u03bb that the progressive wave electric field is switched before the toner is transported over the electrodes. Therefore, much of the toner moves in an opposite direction, without following the progressive wave electric field. As a result, the density unevenness of the toner becomes significant, thereby increasing the density unevenness of the toner image. Moreover, if the interval \u03bb and the frequency f are set to satisfy \u03bb\u00d7f<10, the amount of the toner transported is drastically decreased.","Furthermore, an image forming apparatus of the present invention includes the developing apparatus.","In such an image forming apparatus, if the traveling direction of the developer is set to be opposite to the rotative direction of the image supporting body, the density unevenness of the toner disappears in the process of supplying the toner from the transportation path to the image supporting body. As a result, the density unevenness of the toner does not appear on the image supporting body.","As described above, according to the present invention, the traveling direction of the developer is opposite to the rotative direction of the image supporting body.

On the other hand, if the pitch \u03bb between adjacent ones of the electrodes is wider than 1000 \u03bcm, it is necessary to apply high voltages in order to cause the progressive wave electric field to be strong enough to transport the toner T. As a result, there is a possibility that costs for the power source are increased, and unnecessary noise is caused by vibration of the toner transportation member . However, by setting the pitch \u03bb of adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes to 120 \u03bcm, 250 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm, it is possible to prevent the leakage between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes , to reduce the costs for the power source, and to reduce the noise caused by the vibration of the toner transportation member .","Furthermore, because the gap d between the toner transportation member  and the photosensitive drum  is within a range of 300 \u03bcm to 2000 \u03bcm, the pitch \u03bb of adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes is set optimally, without becoming excessively wide or narrow.","If the gap between the toner transportation member and the photosensitive drum  is excessively narrow, blotching, in which the developer adheres to the non-developing area, is likely to occur, and the image forming becomes unstable because the strength of the developing electric field is significantly changed even by a slight inaccuracy of the gap. On the other hand, if the gap between the toner transportation member and the photosensitive drum  is excessively wide, the charge potential needs to be high, so as to attain the field intensity necessary to return the unnecessary toner to the toner transportation member . This increases a load applied to the photosensitive drum , thereby causing deterioration of the photosensitive drum . However, by setting the gap d between the toner transportation member  and the photosensitive drum  to 300 \u03bcm to 2000 \u03bcm, it is possible to prevent blotching of the photosensitive drum  and to stabilize the developing field intensity, so that the image forming can be performed smoothly. Moreover, it is possible to lower the charge potential of the photosensitive drum  so as to decrease the load applied to the photosensitive drum , thereby preventing deterioration of the photosensitive drum .","As shown in , a peripheral velocity vp (mm\/s) of the photosensitive drum , a latent image writing resolution R (dot\/mm) in the perimeter direction of the photosensitive drum , and the frequency f (Hz) of the voltages applied to the progressive wave generating electrodes satisfy\n\n\n","This setting is based on an analysis of periodical density unevenness under different magnitude relationships between (i) a spatial frequency vp\u00d7R (dot\/sec) of the electrostatic latent image on the surface of the photosensitive drum , and (ii) the frequency f of the voltages applied, and under different (a) frequencies f of the voltages applied, (b) image resolutions R, and (c) peripheral velocities vp of the photosensitive drum , as shown in FIG. .

The exposing apparatus includes a semiconductor laser, a light-emitting diode, and the like. The transferring apparatus includes a corona transferrer, a transferring roller, a transferring brush, or the like.","The developing apparatus  of the present embodiment includes a developing tank , a toner transportation path , a supplying roller , a mixing paddle , a collecting roller , and the like. The developing apparatus  contains the toner. The toner transportation path  generates a progressive wave electric field, so as to transport the toner. The supplying roller  supplies the toner from the developing tank  to the toner transportation path . The mixing paddle  stirs the toner in the developing tank , and moves the toner to the supplying roller . The collecting roller  collects the toner from the toner transportation path  into the developing tank .","The developing tank  has an opening facing a lateral portion of the photosensitive drum . To the opening , a supporting body  having a semicylindrical shape is fixed. The toner transportation path  is fixed on a circumferential surface of the supporting body . Thus, the opening of the developing tank  is blocked by the toner transportation path . Inside of this is a storage for the toner. Note that a position of the developing tank  with respect to the photosensitive drum  may be varied.","At a lower portion of a rim of the opening , a holding section  is provided. The holding section  has a sloped surface directed toward the photosensitive drum . The toner is held by the sloped surface. The toner adheres to the toner transportation path  after electrically charged by the supplying roller , and supplied to the toner transportation path . At this time, the toner having insufficient amount of electric charge drops out of the toner transportation path . The holding section  is provided to receive the toner, so as to prevent the toner from scattering.","The supplying roller  is made of sponge-type urethane foam, for example. The supplying roller  is provided along a lower end of the toner transportation path , and is rotatably supported. By being driven by a motor or the like (not shown), the supplying roller  rotates in a counterclockwise direction, and supplies the toner to the toner transportation path . In supplying the toner, the supplying roller  regulates, while charging the toner, thickness of the toner that adheres to a surface protective layer  of the toner transportation path . The supplying roller  is in contact with the protective layer  of the toner transportation path  in an abrading manner, and also in contact with a bottom surface of the developing tank  in an abrading manner, so as to collect the toner held by the sloped surface of the holding section , and to prevent the toner from leaking from the developing tank .

The collecting roller  is provided along an upper surface of the toner transportation path , and is rotatably supported. By being driven by a motor or a like (not shown), the collecting roller  rotates in the counterclockwise direction. The collecting roller  is in contact with the surface protective layer  of the toner transportation path  in an abrading manner. The collecting roller  removes the remaining potential from the surface protective layer , scraps the toner off the surface protective layer  so as to clean the surface protective layer , and collects the toner into the developing layer .","For example, as shown in , the toner transportation path  is structured as follows: (i) On a substrate , which is made of polyimide or the like, and is approximately 25 \u03bcm in thickness, a generating electrode body (EPC belt)  is provided; and (ii) On the generating electrode body , an insulating layer  and the surface protective layer , which are made of polyimide or the like, and are approximately 25 \u03bcm in thickness, are laminated.","The surface protective layer  covers and protects that side of the toner transportation path  which faces the photosensitive drum . This prevents, from being electrically charged, the substrate , the insulating layer  and the like, which are in the toner transportation path , and prevents firm adhering of the toner. The surface protective layer  is made of (i) an organic insulating material such as polyimide, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), poly (ethylene tetrafluoride), poly (ethylene-propylene fluoride), or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), or (ii) a material in which a carbon black or ionic conductive material is dispersed in or evenly mixed with a rubber material such as silicon, isoprene, or butadiene.","The generating electrode body (EPC belt)  includes a plurality of progressive wave generating electrodes  made of copper foil of approximately 18 \u03bcm in thickness, and insulating layers . The progressive wave generating electrodes  are embedded in the insulating layers . There are predetermined intervals between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes .","The insulating layer  and the insulating layers  may be made of different materials or the same material. For example, both the insulating layer  and the insulating layers  are made of polyimide.","The toner transportation path  is so thin and elastic that it is possible to bent the toner transportation path  along an outer circumferential surface of the supporting body  having the cylindrical shape, so as to attach the toner transportation path  to the outer circumferential surface.","For example, the progressive wave generating electrodes  of the toner transportation path  are approximately 40 \u03bcm to 250 \u03bcm in width, and are so disposed parallel to each other that there are intervals of 50 dpi to 300 dpi (approximately 500 \u03bcm to approximately 85 \u03bcm) between adjacent ones of the electrodes. The progressive wave generating electrodes  are provided from the lower end to the upper end of the toner transportation path . The progressive wave generating electrodes  are divided into plural sets, each set including three or four of the progressive wave generating electrodes .","The progressive wave generating electrodes  of each set receive multiphase alternating voltages from an alternating voltage source . For example, if each set includes four progressive wave generating electrodes , and four alternating voltages having different phases are applied to the set, four alternating voltages V to V  shown in  are applied to the four progressive wave generating electrodes , respectively. This generates a progressive wave electric field. Because the progressive wave generating electrodes  are provided from the lower end to the upper end of the toner transportation path , the progressive wave electric field is generated from the lower end to the upper end of the toner transportation path . The progressive wave electric field transports the toner in a direction of arrow C from the lower end to the upper end of the toner transportation path .","For example, the four alternating voltages are set to 100V to 3 kV, so that no dielectric breakdown occurs between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes . A frequency of the four alternating voltages is set to 20 Hz to 10 kHz. The alternating voltages and the frequency of the four alternating voltages are set appropriately in accordance with a shape of the progressive wave generating electrodes , a transportation speed of the toner, properties of the toner, and the like.","As described above, the supplying roller  supplies the toner from the developing tank  to the toner transportation path . The progressive wave electric field transports the toner from the lower end to the upper end of the toner transportation path . Then, the collecting roller  collects the toner from the toner transportation path  into the developing tank . Meanwhile, between the photosensitive drum  and the toner transportation path , a bias direct current that generates a developing electric field is applied by a direct current power source . In a development area A where the photosensitive drum  and the toner transportation path  are close to each other as shown in , the developing electric field causes the toner T to be sprayed from the toner transportation path  onto the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum . Thus, the toner T adheres to the electrostatic latent image, thereby forming a toner image.","Incidentally, when the toner is transported on the toner transportation path  by the progressive wave electric field, periodical density unevenness of the toner is caused, in accordance with the frequency of the four alternating voltages applied to the progressive wave generating electrodes . However, in the image forming apparatus of the present embodiment, the photosensitive drum  is rotated in the direction of arrow B, and the toner is transported in the direction of arrow C on the toner transportation path . In other words, the rotative direction of the photosensitive drum  and the traveling direction of the toner are opposite. With this setting, the toner on the toner transportation path  and the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum  pass each other, so that the toner can be supplied to any part of the electrostatic latent image from a broad range in the toner transportation path . Because of this, the density unevenness of the toner disappears in a process of supplying the toner from the toner transportation path  to the photosensitive drum . Therefore, the density unevenness of the toner does not appear in the electrostatic latent image. This makes it possible to develop the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum  uniformly.","In the present embodiment, the interval \u03bb (\u03bcm) between adjacent ones of the progressive wave generating electrodes , and the frequency f (kHz) of the multiphase alternating voltages are set to satisfy 10\u2266\u03bb\u00d7f\u2266800. This makes it possible to suppress the density unevenness of the toner, and to transport the toner stably on the toner transportation path . As a result, it is possible to stabilize quality of the toner image formed by developing the electrostatic latent image.","FIG. () shows a result of an experiment in which a value of \u03bb\u00d7f is changed appropriately, and with respect to each value of \u03bb\u00d7f, a transportation state and the density unevenness of the toner are judged, and a total evaluation level is decided. The experiment is conducted with respect to a case in which the rotative direction of the photosensitive drum  and the traveling direction of the toner are opposite, and a case in which the rotative direction of the photosensitive drum  and the transportation traveling direction of the toner are the same. FIG. () shows conditions of the experiment.","FIGS. (), (), and () show the density unevenness on the photosensitive drum . In FIG. (), density is uniform among dots, and a result of evaluation on the density unevenness is A (very good). In FIG. (), density unevenness is caused slightly, and a result of evaluation on the density unevenness is \u2018B\u2019 (good). In FIG. (), density unevenness is caused significantly, and a result of evaluation on density unevenness is \u2018C\u2019 (bad).","As is obvious from , in the case in which the rotative direction of the photosensitive drum  and the traveling direction of the toner are opposite, the transportation state and the density unevenness are good under a setting of 10\u2266\u03bb\u00d7f\u2266800. On the other hand, if the interval \u03bb and the frequency f are set to satisfy \u03bb\u00d7f>800, the frequency is so high as compared with the interval \u03bb, that the progressive wave electric field is switched before the toner is transported over the progressive wave generating electrodes . Therefore, much of the toner moves in an opposite direction, without following the progressive wave electric field. As a result, the density unevenness of the toner becomes significant, thereby increasing the density unevenness in the toner image. Moreover, if the interval \u03bb and the frequency f are set to satisfy \u03bb\u00d7f<10, an amount of the toner T transported is drastically decreased.","If the rotative direction of the photosensitive drum  and the traveling direction of the toner are the same, as in conventional arrangements, \u03bb\u00d7f needs to be very high; otherwise, the density unevenness cannot be reduced. As a result, a good transportation state and density unevenness cannot be attained at the same time.","Note that the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment; the present invention may be varied in many ways. For example, the present invention may be carried out by using a photosensitive belt, instead of the photosensitive drum. The toner transportation path may be modified appropriately in accordance with a shape of a photosensitive body. Moreover, it is not necessary to ensure that the photosensitive body and the toner transportation path do not contact each other. Effects of the present invention can be attained even if the photosensitive body and the toner transportation path contact each other.","In the foregoing embodiment, the surface protective layer  is integrated with the toner transportation path . However, a separately provided surface protective layer may be moved along the toner transportation path. For example, as shown in , it may be so arranged that a surface protective layer A (i) has a shape of an endless belt, (ii) hangs on a driving roller  and a driven roller , and (iii) moves in the traveling direction of the toner when the driving roller  rotates in the counterclockwise direction. Use of such a surface protective layer A having a shape of an endless belt makes it possible to clean the surface protective layer A sufficiently by using a blade , so that always a refreshed part of the surface protective layer A faces the photosensitive drum .","Moreover, the surface protective layer A is in close contact with the surface of the toner transportation path A. This ensures that the surface protective layer A is not distanced from the progressive wave generating electrodes . As a result, intensity of the progressive wave electric field on the surface protective layer A is maintained, so that an excellent transportation property of the toner is maintained.","Moreover, the surface protective layer A is moved in the traveling direction of the toner at a speed sufficiently lower than the transportation speed of the toner. If the surface protective layer A is moved at a speed higher than the transportation speed of the toner, the density unevenness of the toner is caused. For example, if the surface protective layer A is moved at a high speed, airflow is caused on the surface of the surface protective layer A. The airflow unfixes the toner (toner in a cloud-like state), thereby causing the density unevenness of the toner. Therefore, the surface protective layer needs to be moved in such a speed that is equivalent to zero when compared with the transportation speed of the toner. For example, the surface protective layer A is moved at such a speed that is approximately {fraction (1\/10)} to {fraction (1\/100)} of the transportation speed of the toner. For example, the transportation speed of the toner is measured by a method in which the toner on the transportation path is detected by two infrared sensors, and time required for arrival of the toner is measured. Alternatively, the transportation speed of the toner is measured by a method using a high-speed video camera (IS&Ts NIP15: 1999 International Conference on Digital Technologies p.262-265 \u201cAspects of Toner Transport on a Traveling Device\u201d).","The specific embodiments and examples in the \u201cBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\u201d section are described only for clarifying technical contents of the present invention. Therefore, the scope of the present invention must not be interpreted as being limited to these specific examples. The present invention may be modified in many ways within the scope of the spirit of the present invention and the following claims.","The present invention relates to an electrophotographic developing apparatus, in which an electrostatic latent image formed on an image supporting body is developed by using developer, and relates to an image forming apparatus using the developing apparatus.
