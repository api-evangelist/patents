abstract: An approach is provided for providing privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. A cognitive radio privacy platform receives a request, from a device, for performing one or more operations on cognitive radio information stored in at least one information space. The cognitive radio privacy platform also determines one or more privacy policies associated with the device, the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, the at least one information space, or a combination thereof. The cognitive radio privacy platform further processes and/or facilitates a processing of the one or more privacy policies to determine an availability, a restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information. The cognitive radio privacy platform also causes, at least in part, the performing of the one or more operations based, at least in part, on the availability, the restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Mobile devices with various methods of connectivity are now for many people becoming the primary gateway to the internet and also a major storage point for personal information. This is in addition to the normal range of personal computers and furthermore sensor devices plus internet based providers. Combining these devices together and lately the applications and the information stored by those applications is a major challenge of interoperability. This can be achieved through numerous, individual and personal information spaces in which persons, groups of persons, etc. can place, share, interact and manipulate (or program devices to automatically perform the planning, interaction and manipulation of) webs of information with their own locally agreed semantics without necessarily conforming to an unobtainable, global whole.","Furthermore, in addition to information, the information spaces may be combined with webs of shared and interactive computations or computation spaces so that the devices having connectivity to the computation spaces can have the information in the information space manipulated within the computation space environment and the results delivered to the device, rather than the whole process being performed locally in the device. It is noted that such computation spaces may consist of connectivity between devices, from devices to network infrastructure, to distributed information spaces so that computations can be executed where enough computational elements are available. These combined information spaces and computation spaces often referred to as computation clouds, are extensions of the \u2018Giant Global Graph\u2019 in which one can apply semantics and reasoning at a local level.","Networks composed of mobile and immobile devices associated with the wide spectrum of distributed information and computation spaces communicate with each other via methods of connectivity based on various paradigms of communication (or radio) such as, for example, cognitive radio wave, telephony, fiber optics, orbiting satellites, the Internet, etc. A recent development in radio communication technology referred to as \u201ccognitive radio\u201d provides a paradigm for wireless communication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its transmission or reception parameters to communicate efficiently while avoiding interference with other users, either licensed or unlicensed. In one embodiment, this alteration of parameters is based, at least in part, on the active monitoring of several factors in the external and internal radio environment, such as radio frequency spectrum, user behavior and network state. By way of example, cognitive radio can provide many advantages over traditional radio communication paradigms, for example, by (1) enabling use of all available frequencies leading to efficient use of the radio spectrum, (2) providing each user with the optimal connectivity for the use and the occasion, (3) providing easy access control and identification management, (4) providing new levels of interaction among various radio types, etc. Because of the benefits of cognitive radio, many network managers may opt for using cognitive radio as their preferred way of communication. However, in order to be able to benefit from the advantages of cognitive radio, the users may need to share information about themselves with radio management systems so that the management systems can match user needs with available connectivity. On the other hand, the radio management systems may need to exchange user information with other local or global databases. As a result, user information may be shared and distributed in a wide network of service providers.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for providing privacy in cognitive radio information sharing.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises receiving a request, from a device, for performing one or more operations on cognitive radio information stored in at least one information space. The method also comprises determining one or more privacy policies associated with the device, the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, the at least one information space, or a combination thereof. The method further comprises processing and\/or facilitating a processing of the one or more privacy policies to determine an availability, a restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, the performing of the one or more operations based, at least in part, on the availability, the restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to receive a request, from a device, for performing one or more operations on cognitive radio information stored in at least one information space. The apparatus is also caused to determine one or more privacy policies associated with the device, the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, the at least one information space, a cognitive radio infrastructure, a cloud computing element, or a combination thereof. The apparatus is further caused to process and\/or facilitate a processing of the one or more privacy policies to determine an availability, a restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, the performing of the one or more operations based, at least in part, on the availability, the restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to receive a request, from a device, for performing one or more operations on cognitive radio information stored in at least one information space. The apparatus is also caused to determine one or more privacy policies associated with the device, the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, the at least one information space, a cognitive radio infrastructure, a cloud computing element, or a combination thereof. The apparatus is further caused to process and\/or facilitate a processing of the one or more privacy policies to determine an availability, a restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, the performing of the one or more operations based, at least in part, on the availability, a restriction, or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for receiving a request, from a device, for performing one or more operations on cognitive radio information stored in at least one information space. The apparatus also comprises means for determining one or more privacy policies associated with the device, the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, the at least one information space, a cognitive radio infrastructure, a cloud computing element, or a combination thereof.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for providing privacy in cognitive radio information sharing are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In one embodiment, cognitive radio may provide the possibility to multiply the current network speeds and\/or capacity. For example, cognitive radio technology can be configured to understand the language of any radio protocol. This characteristic of the cognitive radio, combined with new simple radios embedded in any object, can provide interaction between any physical objects. This can also provide solutions for communication between people using communication devices with different setups, such as for example, different languages and cultures, etc.","For example, at a big event such as a concert or a sports event the local network may get overloaded. Based on the current spectrum usage limitations, the provided capacity may not be enough for all the users. In one embodiment, cognitive radio technology can use all available frequencies and connectivity methods. It can quickly adapt to the unusual situation and ensure proper operation of the networks. The devices can connect not only through the network cells, but also by forming spontaneous networks. This enables many more users to transmit information such as, for example, messages, phone calls, real time video streams, etc.","Furthermore, the cognitive connectivity and radio communication paradigm generally provides and\/or relies on location dependent information on available bandwidth, rules, and tuning setups associated with a communication network. Accordingly, a cognitive radio enabled system often is equipped with one or more centralized databases in addition to local coexistence management for every device to interact and request operational parameters. More specifically, cognitive radio enabled devices can request and\/or inform their (spectrum) findings to the cognitive radio database and local coexistence management, and in return receive settings and other response information to configure devices and utilize settings correctly at certain locations, which are under certain regulations. These interactions often involve sharing and\/or distributing cognitive radio information among participating devices. In addition, a cognitive enabled device should provide information to the coexistence manager in order for the coexistence manager to be able to provide a proper type of available connectivity to the device using the provided information. The coexistence manager may also exchange the information regarding individual devices with other (e.g., global) databases. Therefore, there is a need for an approach for enforcing privacy on the shared information in a cognitive radio connectivity environment.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to provide privacy in cognitive radio information sharing.","The cloud computing environments provide aggregated sets of information (information spaces) and computations (computation spaces) from different sources. This multi-sourcing is very flexible since it accounts and relies on the observation that the same piece of information or computation can come from different sources. In one embodiment, information and computations within the cloud are represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), OWL (Web Ontology Language), FOAF (Friend of a Friend ontology), rule sets in RuleML (Rule Markup Language), etc. Furthermore, as used herein, RDF refers to a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information and computations that is implemented in web resources; using a variety of syntax formats.","The basic concept of information space technology provides access to distributed information for various devices within the scope of the cloud, in such a way that the distributed nature of the information is hidden from users and it appears to a user as if all the information exist on the same device. The information spaces also enable a user to have control over information distribution by transferring information between devices that the user has access to. For example, a user may want to transfer information among work devices, home devices, and portable devices, other private and public devices, etc. Furthermore, as computing environments become more and more personalized as well as localized, the need for more sophisticated sharing mechanisms between information spaces increases. For example, users may tend to own more than one mobile devices and using them for various purposes such as, a work phone, a personal phone, a media player, a browser, etc. These sharing mechanisms while at the outset appear to be simple union and partitioning of the information proved more difficult because of the internal interactions of the information and the semantic structures governing that information. For example, operations such as split (dividing an information space into two or more smaller information spaces), merge (joining two or more information spaces into larger information spaces), projection (extracting information from an information space), injection (adding information to an existing information space), etc. facilitate sharing information among devices.","In one embodiment, cognitive radio enabled communication networks interact with the information spaces of a cloud environment, create mappings between related architectures, find commonalities in order to determine how cognitive radio can fit into wireless mobile environments (e.g., via platform application programming interfaces (APIs) such as core APIs and\/or mobile functionality specific APIs, wherein platform APIs add mobile device features to the standard application development platforms).","In one embodiment, a distributed information space is constituted by different namespaces, wherein a namespace is an abstract environment holding logical groupings of unique identifiers associated with the information space content. In this embodiment, the information associated with cognitive radio (e.g. cognitive radio parameters) may be stored in different namespaces associated with distributed information spaces and the namespaces within the distributed information spaces are accessible to one or more cognitive radio enabled devices so that the cognitive radio enabled devices can use the stored parameters for communication within the wireless environment.","In one embodiment, integrated services and architectures enable the cognitive radio communication networks and other systems such as distributed information spaces and communication spaces in a cloud environment to communicate with each other via a common language. In this way, information spaces or cloud entities can be considered as aggregated information sets from different sources. In one embodiment, this multi-sourcing provides considerable flexibility by enabling the same piece of information to come from different sources.","It is noted that cognitive radio may use any available radio spectrum. For example, in the United States, cognitive radio devices include TV band devices (TVBDs) that can use available TV white space spectrum (or the unused TV spectrum) for communications. To facilitate such use, a cognitive radio database can be created to record uses or applications of the TV white space to ensure that cognitive radio uses do not interfere with other uses of the same radio frequencies (e.g., for TV broadcasts, etc.) In other words, the application of cognitive radio technology to white spaces may provide intelligent combination of the white spaces with other licensed and unlicensed bands to increase total system capacity and reliability. However, since a cognitive radio database may contain sensitive and private information, ensuring the privacy of the database content and prevention of unauthorized access to the information is an important issue. In order to provide efficiency, flexibility and scalability to the users, a cognitive radio system should also provide privacy services and integrate privacy enabler and filtering architectures to offer cognitive connectivity with other existing systems. Additionally, privacy functionality should be integrated into the cognitive radio database, into different places in the cognitive radio TV white space, other local domain systems, Radio Frequency (RF) memory tag systems, or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, a device can access the cognitive connectivity white space database architecture and other cognitive connectivity information via the distributed information spaces and communication spaces in a cloud environment. Therefore, cloud environment as a communication standard can be also utilized for exchange of cognitive connectivity information among devices.","In one embodiment, the cognitive connectivity and radio provide location dependent information on available bandwidth, rules, and tuning setup. Cognitive radio has access to centralized databases and local coexistence management for every device to interact and request operational parameters. However, certain information may be more sensitive (e.g. with privacy aspects assigned). When exchanging such private information to devices, a privacy enabler functions as a gatekeeper between the information requesting component and other components of the cognitive radio environment and filters the sensitive information. Additionally, there can exist privacy databases, accessible via the cloud, which control privacy in environments such as social networks, etc. The privacy control can be done based on requester's ID, credentials and location data, etc.","As shown in , the system  comprises sets -of user equipments (UEs) -having connectivity to the cognitive radio privacy platform  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UEs -are any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UEs -can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","In one embodiment, the cognitive radio privacy platform  controls the one or more central databases associated with the cognitive radio information, which may need secure privacy and privacy enabling systems. Additionally, cloud environment (or element of the cloud computing environment) is capable of communicating with the cognitive radio under the control of the cognitive radio privacy platform  (e.g., a regional cognitive radio infrastructure) and therefore seamless privacy enforcement in cognitive radio communication can be provided. Furthermore, the cognitive radio architecture can be extended to use the policy ontology associated with the communication network, while taking into account essential cognitive radio capabilities and which can provide additions to the policy language. On the other hand, cloud privacy ontology can be extended to accommodate privacy requirements of the cognitive radio and other local environments.","It is noted that in order to enforce privacy, the user or the information requesting agent should be identified. Typically, the requesting agent can be identified as a person or an entity who is logged into the system with identifiers such as user name, etc. The identifier is used by the privacy enabler to select the policies in much the same way as access control would work. This identifier can be a large structure containing other credentials, security keys, location, actual identity of the user, identity of the device, etc.","In one embodiment, the identity of an information requester (e.g. a user) may be validated via a social network (e.g. a friend) for example another user can validate that the information requesting user is a friend and therefore is allowed to receive less filtered data. In other embodiments, privacy may be globally enforced. The privacy regulation can be parameterized over a user ID, a device ID or location ID., etc. Furthermore, privacy policies can be developed by any entity within an end-to-end environment, for example, system operators, government, trusted third parties, etc.","In one embodiment, the privacy of the information in a cognitive radio information sharing environment can be provided in an ad-hoc mesh network. An ad-hoc mesh network is, for instance, a serverless device-to-device network (e.g., a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET)) created using short-range radio technology (e.g., wireless local area network (WLAN) or Bluetooth\u00ae). Alternatively, ad-hoc mesh networks may be created using close proximity radio technology for very short distances such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Near Field Communication (NFC), RF memory tag systems, etc. A close proximity network can be part of a bigger ad-hoc mesh network, the last centimeter distances from cognitive mobile reader\/writer device to the RF memory tag or other peer devices. Within the ad-hoc mesh network, each wireless device -may be mobile and is within communication range of any number of other wireless devices -. Accordingly, the set of wireless devices -that is within communication range of any a particular wireless device  is transient and can change as the wireless devices -move from location to location.","In one embodiment, policies (e.g. privacy policies) can be presented in a direct way, wherein the user of a user equipment (UE) -can have direct control over policies using a User Interface (UI) on the UE -(traditional approach). In other embodiments, the policies can be implicitly enforced behind the scene, wherein the UEs can interact implicitly, for example via a contact list.","In one embodiment, the privacy enabling is applied to cognitive radio specific systems architecture or infrastructure (e.g. white space), ad-hoc mesh networks, distributed information architectures (e.g. clouds), etc. The privacy enabler can utilize cognitive radio capabilities, which can provide additions to policy languages.","In one embodiment, the cognitive radio database can be integrated with privacy database (e.g. central database) which can control privacy of the cognitive radio database and access privacy to and\/or from the database. Alternatively, the privacy database can be distributed with equivalent privacy enabler to cognitive radio white space architecture blocks and to different places in cognitive radio white space such as, for example, TV Band Devices (TVBD), Coexistence Enablers (CE), Coexistence Managers (CM), Coexistence Discovery and Information Servers (CDIS), remote CMs, etc.","In other embodiments, the cognitive radio spectrum and device settings can be locally put under selected privacy policies, cloud or ad-hoc mesh network environments can provide privacy enabler interaction means, and the combination of these privacy enforcements can provide agreed upon privacy enabler options for different ranges of local and distributed communications. As a result, a privacy hierarchy can be integrated into the cognitive radio system.","By way of example, the UEs -, and the cognitive radio privacy platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","203","205","207","209","211"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 13"],"b":"300"},"In one embodiment, per step  of flowchart  in , the cognitive radio privacy platform  receives a request, from a UE -, for performing one or more operations on cognitive radio information stored in at least one information space -(e.g. cognitive radio database). The query analyzer  analyzes the request for determining one or more elements of the cognitive radio data that the operation performance is requested for.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the policy finder  determines one or more privacy policies associated with entities such as the requesting UE -, the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, the at least one information space -, a cognitive radio infrastructure (e.g., the cognitive radio privacy platform ), a cloud computing environment or element, or a combination thereof. The policy finder  may check a privacy policy database, which can be stored in information spaces -, in a storage , or a combination thereof, for privacy policies. The policy finder  may also determine the privacy policies from one or more local privacy stores, one or more remote privacy stores, or a combination thereof. It is noted that there can be a many to many relationship between the entities and privacy policies. This means that each policy may apply to one or more entities, while each entity may have one or more policies applied to it. If neither the privacy policy database nor the storage  contain any policies concerning some or all the entities, the absence of policies may be interpreted as an indication that there are no restriction on accessing the cognitive radio data by any user, device, etc. The storage  may be used as cache wherein the policy information extracted from the privacy policy database is temporarily stored (for example for a certain period of time) and any reference to those extracted policies during the certain period of time can be made via storage  without a need for accessing the privacy policy database, given that the content of the privacy policy database has not been modified since the last access or in other words the content of storage  is current and up to date. Following the extraction of policies related to the entities from the privacy policy database, the policy finder  may insert or update the content of the storage  accordingly.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the mechanism determination module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the one or more privacy policies to determine one or more mechanisms for the enforcement of the one or more privacy policies. The mechanisms may include, at least in part, one or more encryption mechanisms, one or more filtering mechanisms, one or more anonymization mechanisms, or a combination thereof, wherein encryption method has a direct link to security capabilities of cognitive radio information. Filtering process may exclude some cognitive radio information from the set of information that is going to be accessed, in order to produce a new set that its privacy requirements would match with the privacy capabilities of the requesting environment. The anonymization process may make the cognitive radio information untraceable, for example by removing the sensitive information that may also reveal information ownerships. It is noted that various privacy policies belong to one or a combination of these main mechanisms. In one embodiment, the mechanism determination module  determines the one or more mechanisms based, at least in part, on the computational architecture. It is noted that various components and levels of the architecture may have different rules that require enforcement of specific mechanisms.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the capabilities\/parameters determination module  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of the one or more privacy policies to determine one or more capabilities of the UE -, one or more other UEs -sharing the cognitive radio information, or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, per the capabilities\/parameters determination module  processes and\/or facilitates processing of the at least one accessed information spaces -to determine one or more capabilities of the one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -, wherein an operation of at least one of the one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -is based, at least in part, on the one or more capabilities.","In one embodiment, the device capabilities\/parameters determination module , verifies whether device capabilities may be extracted from any external data sources associated with clouds -. For example, the capabilities of the cognitive radio enabled UEs -may be extracted from the WURFL database, since the cognitive radio structure may utilize services provided by external sources, such as the Wireless Universal Resource File (WURFL). In this embodiment, the capabilities\/parameters determination module  may extract information associated with cognitive radio capabilities of UEs -from the WURFL, per step  of , and translate the extracted information into the cognitive radio specific expressions. Subsequently, the extracted capabilities may be stored in storage , in cloud -or a combination thereof and utilized for the operation of UEs -based on the cognitive radio paradigm.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the capabilities\/parameters determination module  determines one or more cognitive radio parameters associated with the UE -, the one or more other UEs -, or a combination thereof. The cognitive radio parameters may include, at least in part, one or more locations, one or more regulations, one or more frequencies, or a combination thereof for communicating among one or more radio devices (e.g. UEs -) at the one or more locations. The parameters may also include available bandwidth at each specific location, rules and regulations that govern bandwidth use by various devices (e.g. restrictions, usage plans, privileges, etc.) at the location, etc.","In one embodiment, the cognitive radio parameters may provide guidelines and methods for determining other cognitive radio parameters. For example, processing of the one or more cognitive radio parameters can determine a sniffing method, an interrogation method, or a combination thereof for determining one or more other cognitive radio parameters associated with the one or more locations, one or more other locations, or a combination thereof.","It is noted that sniffing (e.g. radio sensing) may include interception and logging of traffic passing over a network (e.g. WURFL traffic, traffic over the TV white space, etc.) in order to capture the cognitive radio parameters. The captured parameters can then be analyzed and translated into cognitive radio specific expressions. Alternatively, or additionally, the cognitive radio privacy platform  may use interrogation methods for cognitive radio parameter interaction, wherein interrogation involves collection of knowledge about occupied channels (e.g. channel numbers, users identities, etc.), informing other entities of the knowledge, providing protocols for negotiation with other entities and negotiating with other entities via certain rules, configurations, etc.","In one embodiment, the capabilities\/parameters determination module  stores the one or more cognitive radio parameters in at least one information space -, storage , or a combination thereof, wherein the parameters can be accessible to one or more cognitive radio enabled UEs -","In one embodiment, per step  of , the capabilities\/parameters determination module  causes, at least in part, a designation of one or more privacy zones among the UE -, the one or more other UEs -, or a combination thereof. A privacy zone is dependent on cognitive radio location parameter and whether the cognitive radio allows computational support to apply certain computational level in a specific privacy case. For example, a country-specific privacy may restrict certain cognitive radio privacy enabler functionalities to invalidate particular cognitive radio parameter visibility at one or more zones, or locations. It is noted that the one or more privacy zones can based, at least in part, on the one or more cognitive radio parameters that were determined per step  of .","In one embodiment, per step  of , the capabilities\/parameters determination module  determines social networking information associated with the UE -, the one or more other UEs -, or a combination thereof. For example, if the requester is \u201ca friend of me\u201d, based on a social network information, the privacy settings are verified and validated against the privacy settings in the privacy database, to check whether the requester is allowed to access \u201cmy social network data\u201d. A friend logs in to system with an ID and by providing credentials and location information in the cognitive radio environment.","In one embodiment, per step  of , the policy application module  causes, at least in part, a signing of the one or more operations, the cognitive radio information, or a combination thereof based, at least in part, on the one or more privacy policies.

As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. For example, in wireless handheld devices, such as mobile telephones like cell phones, the communications interface  includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments, the communications interface  enables connection to the communication network  for providing privacy in cognitive radio information sharing to the UEs -","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing information to processor , including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to computer-readable storage medium (e.g., non-volatile media, volatile media), and transmission media. Non-transitory media, such as non-volatile media, include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include, for example, dynamic memory . Transmission media include, for example, twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and carrier waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves. Signals include man-made transient variations in amplitude, frequency, phase, polarization or other physical properties transmitted through the transmission media. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, an EEPROM, a flash memory, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read. The term computer-readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer-readable medium except transmission media.","Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer-readable storage media and special purpose hardware, such as ASIC .","Network link  typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .","A computer called a server host  connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server host  hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display . It is contemplated that the components of system  can be deployed in various configurations within other computer systems, e.g., host  and server .","At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system  for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more processor instructions contained in memory . Such instructions, also called computer instructions, software and program code, may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium such as storage device  or network link . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform one or more of the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hardware, such as ASIC , may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software, unless otherwise explicitly stated herein.","The signals transmitted over network link  and other networks through communications interface , carry information to and from computer system . Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server host  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in memory  or in storage device  or any other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0166"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"],"b":["1300","1300","1300","1300","1300","1300"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor .

A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like, or any combination thereof.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, any other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU)  which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to provide privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, magnetic disk storage, flash memory storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
