title: Adaptive phase noise cancellation for fractional-N phase locked loop
abstract: An embodiment of the invention is a circuit for adaptive phase noise cancellation for a fractional-N PLL. A preferred embodiment employs a split loop filter architecture. Two loop filter halves separately drive half-sized parallel varactors in a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and also drive a differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit, e.g., a differential-input integrator in a least mean squared (LMS) feedback loop. The output of the differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit controls the gain matching of a phase noise cancellation path to minimize phase noise arising from quantization error associated with the sequence of divider modulus values in the fractional-N PLL. The two varactor capacitances add together in the VCO tank, so the VCO frequency depends on the common-mode loop filter voltage and is relatively insensitive to differential-mode voltage. In contrast, the differential integrator operates on the differential-mode voltage from the two loop filter halves but attenuates their common-mode voltage.

Unfortunately, y[n] is is restricted to integer values because the divider  is only able to count integer VCO cycles. To circumvent this limitation, the \u0394\u03a3 modulator  generates a sequence of integer values that average to \u03b1. The sequence can be written as y[n]=a+e[n], where e[n] is zero-mean quantization noise.

For example, in a properly dithered second-order \u0394\u03a3 modulator, e[n] has a power spectral density (PSD) equal to that of discrete-time white noise with variance 1\/12 passed through a high pass filter. In the example embodiment that uses a 2order delta sigma modulator, the high pass filter has a transfer function (1\u2212z). It follows from (1) that this causes Q[n] to have a PSD equal to that of discrete-time white noise with variance (TI)\/12 passed through a highpass filter with transfer function 1\u2212z. Hence, the PSD of Q[n] has a zero at DC and rises at 6 dB per octave in frequency until nearly half the reference frequency. Provided the bandwidth of the PLL is very narrow, most of the power in Q[n] is suppressed by the PLL so it has only a small effect on the overall PLL phase noise. However, as the PLL bandwidth is increased, less of the power in Q[n] is suppressed by the PLL, so its contribution to the PLL phase noise becomes more dominant. Thus, there is a fundamental bandwidth versus phase noise tradeoff in conventional \u0394\u03a3 fractional-N PLLs.","Phase noise cancelling \u0394\u03a3 fractional-N PLLs attempt to circumvent this tradeoff by cancelling the quantization noise prior to the loop filter, thereby eliminating the need for narrow-band filtering by the PLL to suppress the quantization noise.  shows an example, wherein the idea is to add a phase noise cancellation path ,  to a conventional \u0394\u03a3 fractional-N PLL.

Specifically, the charge pump pulses have a fixed amplitude and variable widths, whereas the DAC pulses have a fixed width and variable amplitudes. Unfortunately, this discrepancy is dictated by circuit limitations; as of the time of the invention it has not been practical to generate the timing signals needed to implement width-modulated DAC pulses that have sufficient accuracy. The result of the discrepancy is illustrated in  for the ideal matching case of \u03b2=0. The component of v(t) corresponding to quantization noise indeed goes to zero between DAC and charge pump pulses, but the cancellation is imperfect during the DAC and charge pump pulses. Thus, even if |\u03b2| is made negligibly small, the quantization noise cancellation is imperfect in practice. Fortunately, the resulting phase noise is typically very small provided Tis relatively small and the DAC pulses are timed so as to overlap the charge pump pulses as much as possible. Alternatively, a sampled loop filter configuration can be used to address the problem as described in S. E. Meninger and M. H.

This allows the loop filter to be integrated on-chip, reduces sensitivity to VCO pulling and noise, better attenuates in-band VCO noise, and makes direct digital frequency modulation practical in wireless applications such as GSM and Bluetooth. However, good phase noise cancellation requires good matching of the cancellation and signal paths, and the matching precision required for a given level of performance increases dramatically as the reference frequency is decreased.","Example PLLs with phase noise cancellation based on passive matching have required reference frequencies of 35 MHz, 48 MHz, and 50 MHz to achieve 15 dB, 20 dB, and 29 dB of phase noise cancellation, respectively.

It can be shown that the resulting system implements an approximate version of the sign-error LMS algorithm described above. Although the feedback loop can be made to work properly, a practical problem arises because of the DC component in v(t). The DC component is necessary because it sets the frequency of the VCO, and the range of values it can take on as a function of the desired output frequency tends to be large. The problem is that the DC component gets multiplied by sgn{e[n]} and then fed back through an integrator  to control the DAC gain. If the feedback loop bandwidth is not sufficiently small, the resulting modulation of the DAC gain severely degrades the phase noise performance of the PLL. Unfortunately, as demonstrated via simulation results shown in , the PSD of sgn{e[n]}tends to have large spurious tones. See, S. Pamarti, L. Jansson, I. Galton, \u201cA Wideband 2.4 GHz \u0394\u03a3 Fractional-N PLL with 1 Mb\/s in-loop Modulation,\u201d -. Vol. 39, No. 1, pp. 49-62, January 2004 and K. Wang, A. Swaminathan, I. Galton, \u201cSpurious tone suppression techniques applied to a wide-bandwidth 2.4 GHz Fractional-N PLL,\u201d IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 43, no 12, December 2008. The tones arise from the strong non-linearity imposed by the sgn{ }function, even when the \u0394\u03a3 modulator's quantization noise is free of spurious tones. The tone frequencies are multiples of \u03b1f, so they decrease with the fractional frequency value, \u03b1. Therefore, the LMS feedback loop bandwidth must be made very small to sufficiently attenuate the tones, and this results in very slow adaptive calibration settling. For example, the settling time has been reported in M. Gupta and B. S. Song, \u201cA 1.8 GHz Spur Cancelled Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizer with LMS based DAC Gain Calibration.\u201d -. Vol. 41, No. 12, pp. 2842-851, December 2006 to be approximately 1 second.","An embodiment of the invention is a circuit for adaptive phase noise cancellation for a fractional-N PLL.

Circuits of preferred embodiments can yield lower power consumption, greater is design flexibility and enable on-chip passive-loop filter halves, thus saving pin count.","An experimental integrated circuit (IC) that implements an embodiment of the invention was fabricated and measurements from it indicate that its adaptive calibration causes it to achieve 33 dB of phase noise cancellation in a PLL, with a settling time of 35 \u03bcs despite its low reference frequency of 12 MHz. Methods of the invention are capable of providing better performance than the experimental fabrication, as the experimental fabrication reached a noise floor set by other circuit components. Current state of the art in PLLs with passive matching phase noise cancellation have required reference frequencies of 35 MHz, 48 MHz and 50 MHz to achieve 15 dB, 20 dB and 29 dB of phase noise cancellation, respectively, as discussed in the background. The experimental IC that implements an embodiment of the invention but does not achieve the full phase noise cancellation made possible by the invention still is believed to provide a new standard with the 33 dB of noise cancellation with a reference frequency of only 12 MHz, an achievement that is not believed to have been achieved previously for this class of circuits.","Preferred embodiments of the invention are discussed below with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic representations, which will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows.","The core of the adaptive calibration of the invention is shown in . Two loop filter halves , separately drive half-sized parallel varactors in the VCO and also drive a differential integrator , which serves as a differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit in the LMS feedback loop. The two varactor capacitances add together in the VCO tank, so the VCO frequency depends on the common-mode loop filter voltage and is relatively insensitive to differential-mode voltage. In contrast, the differential integrator  operates on the differential-mode voltage from the two loop filter halves but attenuates their common-mode voltage. Since the differential-mode voltage is DC-free, the problem mentioned with respect to the prior art adaptive calibration technique above is avoided. Multiplication by sgn{e[n]} is achieved by steering the DAC  and charge pump  current to the top loop filter whenever sgn{e[n]}=1 and to the bottom loop filter whenever sgn{e[n]}=\u22121 via switch , which thereby controls gain matching of the phase noise cancellation path defined by the LMS feedback loop. The path defined by  presents an alternative, where the gain of charge pump  is controlled instead of the gain of the current DAC . In either case, as seen in  the dynamics of the LMS calibration loop are determined by a differential-mode half circuit , and those of the PLL are determined by common-mode half circuit .","The operation of the LMS calibration loop can be seen from the differential-mode half circuit in . The current steering operation effectively multiplies the charge pump and DAC pulses each reference period by sgn{e[n]}. The two pulses are then filtered and integrated as shown in the figure to generate a current, \u0394I, which is used to adjust the bias current, and therefore the gain, of the DAC. Since the charge pump and DAC pulses are multiplied by sgn{e[n]}prior to filtering, the system implements the true sign-error LMS algorithm described above. By avoiding the DC offset problem, the signal that gets integrated by the LMS feedback loop does not contain a term proportional to sgn{e[n]}. Therefore, the LMS feedback loop bandwidth can be relatively large without significantly degrading the PLL's phase noise performance.","The dynamics of the PLL are implied by the common-mode half circuit shown in , which is equivalent to the core of a conventional phase noise cancelling PLL. To the extent that the two loop filter half circuits and the two varactor halves are matched, respectively, the current steering operation controlled by sgn{e[n]}has no affect the common-mode half circuit. Although mismatches between the two loop filter halves and between the two varactor halves do cause some degradation of the PLL's phase noise in practice, simulation and measurement results indicate that the phase noise resulting from such mismatches is well below that caused by other noise sources in the PLL. Furthermore, careful analysis and simulation indicate that even high levels of differential-mode to common-mode and common-mode to differential-mode conversion do not cause the PLL or the LMS feedback loop to become unstable.","Overview","A block diagram of the experimental IC is shown in . With the exception of 12 MHz reference frequency crystal , all blocks shown in the figure are integrated on a single chip, as well as a 3-wire digital interface to control the IC, a VCO output buffer and a buffer connected between the VCO and the divider.","The IC is implemented in the TSMC 0.18 \u03bcm single poly, six metal CMOS technology with thin top metal, metal-insulator-metal (MiM) capacitor, poly resistor, and deep n-well process options. All circuitry is operated from a 1.8V supply, and electro-static discharge (ESD) protection circuitry is included for all the pads. Separate deep n-wells and supply domains are used to help provide isolation.","Divider and DAC Pulse Timing","The divider core consists of seven stages of divide-by-two pulse-swallowing blocks -as shown in . The two highest frequency blocks and are implemented with current-mode logic (CML) and the remaining five blocks -are implemented with CMOS logic with conversion circuits ,  handling CMOS\/CML conversion. The output of the divider core is resynchronized to the output of the first CML block to remove jitter from the last six pulse-swallowing blocks, and to reduce modulus-dependent divider delays, i.e., differences between the ideal and actual times of the divider's output edges that depend on N+y[n]. The purpose of the two flip-flops ,  that are clocked by the outputs of the second and third pulse-swallowing blocks, respectively, is to avoid race conditions in the resynchronization circuitry. In addition to v(t), the divider generates enable signals for the charge pump dynamic bias and DAC circuits.","The use of fixed-width DAC pulses to cancel the quantization noise in fixed-amplitude charge pump pulses causes imperfect cancellation while the pulses are active. Most prior published phase noise cancelling \u0394\u03a3 fractional-N PLLs align the rising edge of each DAC pulse with a rising edge of v(t) as shown in . To the extent that the DAC and charge pump pulses do not overlap, the loop filter is disturbed significantly before the charge delivered by the two pulses cancel each other. For example, if the charge pump pulse occurs before the DAC pulse as shown in , the entire charge pump pulse is injected into the loop filter before its charge is cancelled by the DAC pulse. This disturbs v(t) and contributes to the overall PLL phase noise more than would occur if the charge pump and DAC pulses were timed to overlap each other as shown in .","Simulated PSDs of the PLL phase noise caused by the disturbance of v(t) during the charge pump and DAC pulses for the two cases shown in  are shown in , respectively. As indicated by the simulation results, the timing modification implemented in the invention relative to typical previous designs discussed in the background significantly reduces the phase noise resulting from the inherent mismatch between the amplitude modulated DAC pulses and the width-modulated charge pump pulses.","Cancellation Path Circuitry","The architecture of the 10-bit current-steering DAC  is shown in . The DAC consists of a segmented dynamic element matching (DEM) encoder  followed by two banks of 26 weighted, return-to-zero, one-bit current DACs , . The outputs of the one-bit current DACs in each bank are connected to one of the two loop filter halves. Alternatively, the  split architecture is applicable to the charge pump , in which case the banks and are separately enabled charge pump banks. During each reference period, one or the other of the two banks of one-bit current DACs is enabled depending upon the sign of sgn{e[n]}. This alternate enablement of the DAC banks and (or of charge pump banks) implements the function of the current steering switch  shown in  for the current pulses from the 10-bit DAC. In each of the DAC banks , there are 16 one-bit current DACs with a weight of 32 LSBs, and five pairs of one-bit current DACs with weights of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 LSBs, respectively.","As seen in , each one-bit current DAC consists of two resistively degenerated current sources , that are enabled in a manner similar to that of the charge pump. Large devices are used to minimize mismatches. Unfortunately, this causes the channel charge contained in M, M, Mand Mto be large relative to the charge in the current pulse from the one-bit DAC. When the current source is switched off, this unwanted channel charge is injected into the loop filter . To mitigate this problem, transistors Mand Mare used to short the source and gate of Mand of Mat the end of each DAC current pulse. This causes most of the channel charge to be injected into the DAC bias line  instead of the loop filter . The resulting disturbance of the DAC bias occurs at the end of the DAC current pulse, and the bias voltages have enough time to settle to their correct values prior to the next pulse, at which time Mand Mare opened.","The purpose of the DEM encoder  is to prevent amplitude and transient errors arising from component mismatches among the one-bit current DACs from introducing harmonic distortion. The details of the DEM encoder are shown in . Its architecture and functionality are similar to those of the DEM encoder presented, K-L Chan and I. Galton, \u201cA 14b 100 MS\/s DAC with fully segmented dynamic element matching,\u201d -, pp. 390-391, February 2006.","Although e[n] is an 18-bit digital number as shown in , it is requantized to 10-bits to reduce the required precision of the DAC. An 8-bit pseudo-random sequence is added to the least-significant bits of e[n], and the result is truncated to 10-bits to ensure that the requantization process does not introduce harmonic distortion.","Charge Pump Noise Issues in Wide Bandwidth PLLs","The average current consumed by a charge pump output stage is very low, because the charge pump is only on for a small portion of each reference period. However, in most designs the charge pump bias generator is left on. Had this been done on the IC, the charge pump would have consumed an average current of just over 10 mA which is more than 50% of the current consumed by all the other circuit blocks in the PLL combined.","Instead, current is saved by powering up most of the circuitry in the charge pump bias generator for only \u215b of each reference period just before the charge pump output stage is turned on. The dynamic biasing idea was proposed in J. Lee, S-O Lee. M. Yoh, I. Ryu and B-H Park. \u201cA 13 mW 2 GHz\/520 MHz Dual-Band Frequency Synthesizer for PCS Applications.\u201d , vol. 39, no. 1, pp. 8-13, July 2001 without a description of the circuit details. The circuit used to implement dynamic biasing in the preferred experimental IC is shown in . On average, the dynamic biasing circuit reduces the average current consumption of the charge pump by almost 8 mA.","The PFD is identical to that described in S. Pamarti, L. Jansson. I. Galton. \u201cA wideband 2.4 GHz \u0394\u03a3 fractional-N PLL with 1 Mb\/s in-loop modulation,\u201d -, vol. 39, no. 1, pp. 49-62, January 2004. It generates signals U, D, U, and Dwhich control the two charge pump output stages , shown in . Together, the PFD and charge is pump realize a linearization scheme that reduces errors from mismatches between the positive and negative charge pump currents.","Other Circuitry","The VCO is a negative-gCMOS LC oscillator with a differential spiral inductor stacked in metal layers 5 and 6. As described above, it is modified relative to a conventional VCO in that it has two half-sized parallel varactors instead of a single varactor. The nominally equal MOS varactors provide tuning over a 0.6V-1.2V range with a nominal Kof 60 MHz\/V from each input. Coarse digital tuning is provided by switching MIM capacitors of 20 fF and 80 fF into the VCO tank. This allows the VCO to operate over the full 2.4 GHz ISM band, See, e.g., S. T. Lee, S. J. Fang, D. J. Allstot, A. Bellaouar. A. R. Fridi, and P. A. Fontaine, \u201cA Quad-Band GSM-GPRS transmitter with digital auto-calibration,\u201d -, vol. 39, no. 12, pp. 2200-2214, December 2004. Two buffers are AC coupled to the VCO, and separately drive the divider and an off-chip 50\u03a9 load.","The fully integrated loop filter consists of two 5 k\u03a9 polysilicon resistors, two 18 pF MiM capacitors, and two 282 pF pMOS capacitors. Coarse digital tuning is provided to account for process variations. A folded cascode, single-stage OTA followed by a simple voltage to current converter is used in the LMS feedback loop.","A photograph of the IC die is shown in . The die measures 2.2 mm by 2.2 mm including ESD devices and pads. The IC was tested in a 32 pin QFN package.","The current consumption of the PLL circuitry in the IC is 20.9 mA with the dynamic charge pump bias technique enabled. When the dynamic charge pump bias technique is disabled, the total current consumption increases by 8 mA although neither the phase noise or spurious performance change measurably. Therefore, all of the measured results described below were obtained with the dynamic charge pump bias technique enabled.","The IC was tested at 1 MHz frequency steps from 2.4 to 2.48 GHz. Table 1 summarizes the worst-case performance of the IC over these frequencies with the adaptive phase noise cancellation technique enabled and disabled. The measured loop bandwidth was 730 kHz in all cases. The worst case spot phase noise with the adaptive phase noise cancellation technique enabled is \u2212101 dBc\/Hz and \u2212124 dBc\/Hz at 100 kHz and 3 MHz offsets respectively, with no significant variation over the tested frequencies. Table 2 summarizes the performance of the PLL compared with relevant prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIGS. 14 and 15","FIG. 14"]},"The output of the calibration loop's OTA optionally can be connected to an output pin through a MOS transistor switch for calibration settling time measurements. A representative waveform from this pin measured as the calibration loop settled is shown in  and indicates a settling time of 35 \u03bcs. Several such measurements were made for different PLL output frequencies. The results show that the settling time does not vary significantly as a function of the PLL's output
