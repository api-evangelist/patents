title: Query translation quality confidence
abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer program products, for generating visual media search results are provided. A first search query in a first language and a second search query in a different second language are received. The first search query is a translation of the second search query into the second language. A quality of results statistic for the second search query is obtained. A final search query is created using the first search query, the second search query, and the quality of results statistic. The final search query is sent to a search engine and a final group of visual media search results responsive to the final search query are received from the search engine, where visual media search results in the final group that are responsive to the second visual media search query are assigned a ranking based in part on the quality of result statistic.

No. 61\/178,784, filed May 15, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to combining search results responsive to a visual media search query and a translation of the query.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},"In , the visual media search query is \u201c\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1\u201d . \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1 is the Greek word for skier. In response to receipt of the visual media search query, a search is performed, one matching result  is identified, and this one matching result  is presented to the user through the user interface.","In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the following. A first visual media search query and a second visual media search query are received. The first visual media search query is in a first language and the second visual media search query is in a different second language. The first visual media search query is a translation of the second visual media search query into the second language. A quality of results statistic for the second visual media search query is obtained. A final visual media search query is created using the first visual media search query, the second visual media search query, and the quality of results statistic. The final visual media search query is sent to a search engine and a final group of one or more visual media search results responsive to the final visual media search query are received from the search engine. The visual media search results in the final group that are responsive to the second visual media search query are assigned a ranking based in part on the quality of results statistic. Other implementations of this invention include corresponding systems, apparatus, computer program products, and computer readable media.","These and other implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The quality of results statistic can be a click through rate for queries similar to the second query. The quality of results statistic can be a click through rate for the second query. The quality of results statistic can reflect a dwell time associated with search results selected by users after submitting a query identical to the second visual media search query.","Creating a final visual media search query using the first visual media search query and the second visual media search query can further comprise associating the second visual media search query with one of a plurality of confidence bins based on the quality of results statistic. The visual media search results in the final group of search results that are responsive to the second visual media search query can be assigned a ranking based in part on the confidence bin.","The final group of visual media search results can be presented.","Visual media can be an image, a video, an image embedded in a file, or a video embedded in a file.","Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. A higher quality of visual media search results can be presented to a user. A broader group of visual media search results can be presented to the user. A group of visual media search results that are more responsive to the user's intended search can be presented to the user. Search results relevant to a local concept can be returned even if the user searches in a language different from the local language.","The details of one or more implementations of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","The small group of search results shown in  can be disappointing to a user. There are many reasons a group of search results can be small, including an unusual topic or a misspelled search query. However, in many cases, the group of search results is small because of the language the user is searching in. Some concepts are more popular in certain languages. For example when discussing the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Calif., people are more likely to use English than Dutch, because the Golden Gate Bridge is a United States' landmark, and the English phrase is how the bridge is named in the United States. If a user has entered a search query in a natural language where the search query is not a popular concept, few results may be returned. This is true even though the search query concept may be very popular in other natural languages and, if the user entered a visual media search query in one of those other languages, he or she would be presented with a larger number of search results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["114","116"]},"In some implementations, two queries must be identical to be considered similar. In alternative implementations, the queries do not have to be identical to be considered similar. For example, the query in the search history and the query  can be sufficiently similar when they have the same meaning, despite small differences in spelling, small differences in word order, the use of abbreviations, the use of synonyms, or the use of stop words (e.g., known terms that do not contribute to the topicality of the query such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d). Other common measures of similarity can also be used, for example, using the edit distance for the two queries.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistic for a translated query is the click through rate of the translated query. The click through rate is calculated by taking the number of times users selected a search result after submitting a query similar to the translated query and dividing that by the total number of times the query was submitted by the population of users. Other quality of results statistics are possible, for example, the total number of times a user selected a search result. The quality of results statistic can also further reflect the dwell time associated with one or more of the search results corresponding to the query in the search history. Dwell time is the amount of time a user spends viewing a search result. Dwell time can be a continuous number, such as the number of seconds a user spends viewing a search result, or it can be a discrete interval, for example \u201cshort clicks\u201d corresponding to clicks of less than thirty seconds, \u201cmedium clicks\u201d corresponding to clicks of more than thirty seconds but less than one minute, and \u201clong clicks\u201d corresponding to clicks of more than one minute. In some implementations, a longer dwell time of one or more results is associated with a higher quality of results statistic. The quality of results statistic is higher because users found the results with a longer dwell time useful enough to view for a longer period of time. In , the user has entered the visual media search query \u201c\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1\u201d , meaning skier in Greek. A search is performed using both the Greek \u201c\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9{acute over (\u03b5)}\u03c1\u201d and the English \u201cskier.\u201d The results of this search 114-118 are assigned a ranking based on the quality of results statistic for the query \u201cskier.\u201d The result is a more robust group of search results. The result from   is again presented, but it is proceeded by an additional result in English  and followed by an additional result in English .","Augmenting a visual media search query with its translation into a different relevant language can thus increase the number of search results returned to a user. Two languages can be different when they are distinct languages, for example, English and French, or when they are different dialects of the same language. Using a quality of results statistic that estimates the relevance of a translated query helps ensure that the additional search results will be useful to the user. Because visual media typically involves image and video content which conveys information independent of language, the user is likely less concerned with the language of the search result and more concerned with the content of the visual media. Therefore, visual media search queries are an especially fruitful area for query translation. However, similar techniques could be used in any other type of search, for example, documents searches.","Visual media is not limited to images. For example, visual media can include video, images embedded in an electronic file, video embedded in an electronic file, and interactive media such as javascript or actionscript games. Visual media does not necessarily correspond to an electronic file. Visual media can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the visual media in question, or in multiple coordinated files. Moreover, visual media can be stored in memory without first having been stored in a file.","The search query does not have to be received from a user; instead, it can be received from any source, including, for example, a computer or a process on a computer. The search query does not have to be received through a search engine user interface, but can be received through any interface where a user or a process is able to send a search query. The translation does not have to be received from a user; instead, it can be received from any source, including, for example, a computer or a process on a computer.","Presenting search results is not limited to causing visual media to be presented to the user. Presenting search results can include, for example, displaying search results on a display device, transmitting search results to a user's computer for presentation to the user, transmitting search results to another device, transmitting sounds corresponding to the search results, providing haptic feedback corresponding to the search results, or transmitting signals comprising haptic feedback corresponding to the search results to a user's computer for presentation to the user. Other methods of presenting search results are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In , a query  and a set of search histories  are provided to a quality of results statistic obtainer . The quality of results statistic obtainer  uses the query  and the set of search histories  to determine a quality of results statistic  corresponding to the query .","In various implementations, the search query  is a visual media search query. However, the search query  can be any type of search query.","In various implementations, the set of search histories  contains one or more user search histories. A user search history stores a sequence of search queries submitted by a user or a computer or a process. A user search history can also store information regarding how many or which results responsive to a search query were selected by a user and how long each selected search result was viewed. The search queries in the search history can be visual media search queries or any other type of search query, for example a document search query. Multiple types of search queries can be included in the search history. User search histories may also store additional information, such as the IP address of the user. User search histories can be created based on information sent from a user's computer to a search engine. User search histories are a convenient way to store user search history information. However, other formats for organizing and storing the user search history information captured by a user search history can also be used.","In various implementations, when the quality of results statistic obtainer  receives the query  and the search histories , it identifies entries  from the search histories  corresponding to queries that are sufficiently similar to the query . In some implementations, the query in the search history must be identical to the query . In alternative implementations, the query in the search history does not have to be identical to the query . For example, the query in the search history and the query  can be sufficiently similar when they have the same meaning, despite small differences in spelling, small differences in word order, the use of abbreviations, the use of equivalent slang words, or different inclusion of articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe.\u201d","Some of the entries from the search histories correspond to situations where a user selected a search result after submitting a query sufficiently similar to the query . These entries are underlined in , for example, . Some of the entries from the search histories correspond to situations where a user did not select any search results after submitting a query sufficiently similar to the query . These entries are not underlined in , for example, .","In some implementations the quality of results statistic is a value from 0 to 1 that corresponds to the click through rate of the query. The click through rate is the number of times users selected a search result after submitting a query sufficiently similar to the translated query, divided by the total number of times the query was submitted by the population of users. For example, in , the query \u201ctoretta di inclinzione famosa di Pisa\u201d was submitted fourteen times in the set of user search histories . Nine of those times, a user selected a result after submitting the query. Thus, the click through rate is determined by dividing 9 by 14, resulting in a click through rate of approximately 0.643.","The quality of results statistic can be calculated in other ways, for example, by aggregating the total number of results selected by users after submitting a query, or considering the dwell time for each selected result.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is further refined by, for example considering the popularity of the query, where the popularity of the query is the percentage of queries in the search histories that are sufficiently similar to the query. A query with a high popularity can be assigned a higher quality of results statistic for various reasons. For example, a high popularity indicates that the query is commonly used, and thus likely a common way of describing a concept in the language of the query. In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is further refined by considering an overall estimate of the quality of search results for the translated query based on the content of each result responsive to a given query and its surrounding text.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistic for a given query is calculated as needed. In some implementations, the quality of results statistic for a given query is calculated in advance and stored, for example, in a database that associates a given query with its quality of results statistic. In some implementations, when a quality of results statistic is calculated as needed, it is then stored for later use, for example, in a database that associates a given query with its quality of results statistic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In , a search query , its translation  into another language, here, Italian, and a quality of results statistic for the translation  are provided to a query generator .","The translation  can be from a number of sources. In some implementations, the translation  is received from the user submitting the query. In some implementations, the translation  is received from a person other than the user submitting the query. In some implementations the translation  is received from a process or a computer. In some implementations, the translation  is received from a translation dictionary. In some implementations, the translation  is determined using the techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/481,448, for \u201cQuery Translation Using Bilingual Search Refinements,\u201d incorporated by reference. In some implementations, the translation is into a language determined by the process described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/481,454, for \u201cSelecting Relevant Languages for Query Translation,\u201d incorporated by reference.","In various implementations, the quality of results statistic  is the click through rate of the translated query . In some implementations the quality of results statistic is calculated using the method described above in regard to . In some implementations, the quality of results statistic has already been determined and is obtained from, for example, a database associating a given query with its quality of results statistic.","In various implementations, the query generator  combines the query  and its translation  into a final query  that specifies a search for both queries taking into account the quality of results statistic for the translated query . For example, the query can assign a score to each result of the query, where the score is the score of the result under the translated query multiplied by the quality of results statistic plus the score of the document under the original query. The final query is then passed to a results generator  that generates the group of search results .","In various implementations, the quality of results statistic  of the translated query  is used directly in the final query . In some implementations, the quality of results statistic  of the translated query  is used by the query generator  to determine additional information corresponding to the quality of result statistic of the translated query . In these implementations, the additional information is used by the query generator  instead of or in addition to the actual quality of results statistic . In some implementations, the additional information is the output of a function that takes the quality of results statistic as an input and returns a confidence value. In some implementations, the function is continuous. In some implementations, the function is discrete. In some implementations, the additional information is a confidence bin. For example, four bins can be identified, one corresponding to quality of results statistics between 0 and 0.25 (\u201cvery low confidence\u201d), one corresponding to quality of results statistics between 0.25 and 0.5 (\u201clow confidence\u201d), one corresponding to quality of results statistics between 0.5 and 0.75 (\u201cmedium confidence\u201d), and one corresponding to quality of results statistics between 0.75 and 1 (\u201chigh confidence\u201d). The quality of results statistic  of the translated query  is scaled from 0 to 1, by, for example, dividing by the highest possible quality of result statistic. The scaled quality of results statistic is then associated with its corresponding bin. The bin information is then used by the query generator . Alternative ways of using confidence bins are possible. For example, any number of confidence bins can be used. The bins can be based on any range of scores, not just scores from 0 to 1. Alternative techniques of scaling the quality of results statistic  of the translation  are possible, for example, using a logarithmic scale. The quality of results statistic  of the translated query  does not have to be scaled. Alternative types of information corresponding to the quality of results statistic  of the translated query  are possible.","In various implementations, the results generator  applies the final search query  to one or more corpora of documents, resulting in a group of search results . The group of search results may include search results in the language of the visual media search query, e.g. Result A , and may also include search results in the language of the translation, e.g. Result  . For example, in , Results A, B, C, and D correspond to results with Portuguese phrases (responsive to \u201ctone inclinada famosa de Pisa\u201d ) and Results , , and  correspond to results with Italian phrases (responsive to \u201ctoretta di inclinzione famosa di Pisa\u201d ). Results can include phrases in more than one language. In some implementations, a result with a phrase satisfying the search query or its translation is included in the group of search results even if the rest of the document is in a different language. The search results can be generated from the final query  in a number of ways.","In some implementations, the results generator runs a search corresponding to the final query , using a search engine backend . The search engine backend  identifies a group of search results. Some of the identified search results satisfy the part of the final query  corresponding to the original query . Some of the identified search results satisfy the part of the final query  corresponding to the translation . Some of the identified search results satisfy both parts of the final query. Each search result has a score that measures its relevance to the query. In some implementations, the results generator or the search engine backend adjusts the scores based in part on the quality of results statistic . The quality of results statistic  of the translated query  can be used to adjust the scores, for example, by increasing or decreasing certain scores, to reflect the quality of results statistic  of the translated query . For example, in some implementations if the quality of results statistic for the translation is low, the scores of the search results corresponding to the translation are reduced. The results generator or the search engine backend ranks the search results based on their scores.","Other methods of generating a group of results responsive to a query and its translation taking into account a quality of results statistic for the translated query are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"In step , a first visual media search query and a second visual media search query are received (e.g., by a search engine provider), where the first visual media search query is a translation of the second visual media search query. A visual media search query is a word or words defining a search for visual media. Various methods of receiving a search query are possible. For example, in various implementations, the first visual media search query is received from a user's computer through a web interface. The web interface can be, for example, a webpage, run by a search engine provider, that receives search queries from a user and presents results and other information relevant to the search query to the user. In alternative implementations, the visual media search query is received from a process running on a computer of the search engine or a computer of a third party. Various methods of receiving a second visual media search query that is a translation of the first visual media search query are possible. For example, in various implementations, the translation is received from a process running on a computer of the search engine or a computer of a third party. In alternative implementations, the translation is received from a user's computer through a web interface.","In step , a quality of results statistic is obtained for the second visual media search query. The quality of results statistic is an estimate of the expected relevance of results responsive to the second visual media search query. An example technique for obtaining a quality of results statistic is discussed above in regard to .","In various implementations, the quality of results statistic for the visual media search query is the click through rate of the search query: the number of times users selected a search result after submitting a query similar to the translated query, divided by the total number of times a query similar to the translated query was submitted by the population of users. The click through rate can be limited to a click through rate for a particular population of users, for example, users who submit queries from a location where the language of the translated query is frequently used. Using a language can include, for example, speaking the language or submitting queries in the language. A location of a user submitting a search query can be determined, for example, by examining country specific domains or user-specified preferences. A country specific domain is specified by characters at the end of a web address used by the user to access the search system. For example, a web address ending in \u201c.uk\u201d corresponds to a United Kingdom specific domain. A web address ending in \u201c.bg\u201d corresponds to a Bulgarian specific domain. A web address is a string of characters used to identify a web page. User-specified preferences are, for example, a setting specified by a user which identifies the user's country. For example, a user searching from Spain might specify his country as Spain. Additional techniques for determining the location of a user can also be used, for example, examining the IP address corresponding to a computer from which the user submitted the query. An IP address is a logical address identifying a computer on a network. The IP address can be used to determine the user's location by, for example, looking the IP address up in a database that associates IP addresses with a service provider and identifying the location of the service provider. Other geolocation techniques using IP addresses are possible. The click through rate can also be limited to a particular time period, for example, the click through rate for queries received over the last six months, or the click through rate for queries received from Jan. 1, 2005 to Mar. 23, 2007.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is further based on an estimate of the dwell time associated with one or more search results selected by users after submitting a query similar to the translated query. In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is further refined by, for example considering the popularity of the translated query, where the popularity of the translated query is the percentage of queries in the search histories that are sufficiently similar to the translated query.

User search history information can be stored, for example, as a user search history. In some implementations, user search histories are generated by the user's computer. In some implementations, user search histories are generated by a search engine provider that receives one or more search queries from a user. In some implementations, user search histories are generated by a third party that aggregates user search information to generate user search histories. Other possible structures for storing user search history are possible, including, for example, storing individual pieces of user search history information.","In some implementations, the user search history information is stored, for example on one or more machine readable storage devices. The user search history information does not have to be in a contiguous section on a machine readable storage device, nor does the user search history information have to be completely stored on the same machine readable storage device.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is calculated in real-time as queries are received from users and users select results. In these implementations, queries received from a user, and results selected by the user, are monitored and a quality of results statistic is calculated immediately. In some implementations, calculating the quality of results statistic immediately includes starting with an initial quality of results statistic and updating it as user queries and selections are received.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistics are pre-calculated and stored for later use, for example, in a relational database that associates a given query with its quality of results statistic. In these implementations, a quality of results statistic is obtained by retrieving the stored quality of results statistic corresponding to a given query. In some implementations, the quality of results statistics are calculated as they are needed to estimate the relevance of the translated query. In some implementations, the quality of results statistics calculated as they are needed are stored for later use much as the quality of results statistics calculated in advance are stored for later use.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistics are provided by a third party and the quality of results statistic corresponding to a given query is the quality of results statistic provided by the third party.","In implementations where quality of results statistics are stored for later use, the quality of results statistics are stored, for example on one or more machine readable storage devices.

In some implementations the results generator process  and the search engine backend  are separate processes. Running a process includes, for example, calling a copy of the process, providing system resources to the process, and communicating with the process through a hardware or software interface. A hardware or software interface is an interface that allows processes to communicate with each other or with system hardware, for example, a system bus or commands specified in an application programming interface.

Other methods of presenting search results are possible.","In some implementations, the server  stores one or more quality of results statistics corresponding to a translation of one or more visual media search queries. In some implementations, the quality of results statistics are stored on a computer readable medium . In some implementations, the quality of results statistics are stored on one or more additional devices , for example, a hard drive. In some implementations, a representation of the quality of results statistic is stored instead of or in addition to the quality of results statistic itself. In some implementations, a database is stored. The database associates a given translation of a query with its corresponding quality of result statistic, allowing the server to quickly access a quality of result statistic associated with a query in the database.","In some implementations, the server  stores user search history information as one or more user search histories or in another form. In some implementations, the user search history information is stored on a computer readable medium . In some implementations, the user search history information is stored on one or more additional devices , for example, a hard drive. In some implementations, a representation of the user search history information is stored instead of or in addition to the user search history information itself.","The server  also has hardware or firmware devices including one or more processors , one or more additional devices , computer readable medium , and one or more user interface devices . User interface devices  include, for example, a display, a camera, a speaker, a microphone, or a haptic feedback device.","The server  uses its communication interface  to communicate with a plurality of client computers , , and  through a network .","A plurality of client computers  and  are connected to the server  through the network . These client computers  and  are data processing apparatus. Users use these client computers  and  to submit search queries through the network  to the server , for example, through a web-browser run on the client computer, for example, Firefox\u2122, available from the Mozilla Project in Mountain View, Calif. The submitted search queries can be any type of search query, including visual media search queries and document search queries. Users submit queries to the server  during a session. In some implementations, users receive search results from the server  on their respective computers  and . In these implementations, when a user uses their computer to select a search result to view, information regarding the user selection is sent to the server  from the user's computer  or  through the network . In some implementations the information regarding the user selection also includes how long the user viewed the selection.","In various implementations, a user search history corresponding to information sent from the user's computer is created. The user search history stores the sequence of queries submitted by the user and which results were selected after a search was submitted. The user search history may also include additional information such as how long each selected result was viewed. In some implementations, the user search history is stored on the client computer  or  (whichever one was used to submit the queries), for example on a computer readable medium or an external device such as a hard drive. In these implementations, the quality of results statistic obtainer process  can access the user search histories through the network  to obtain a quality of results statistic for a translated query. In alternative implementations, the user search history is stored on the server  while or after search queries are received from a user. The information stored in the user search history does not have to be stored as a user search history, but can be stored in any manner. In some implementations, the user search history information is stored in a form other than a user search history.","User  runs a client computer  that is a data processing apparatus. User  uses their computer  to submit a visual media search query through the network  to the server , for example, through a web-browser. User  also uses their computer to view search results responsive to the visual media search query he or she submitted. These search results are transmitted by the server  to the user's computer  through the network . The user's computer may present the search results to the user, for example, by displaying the results on a display device, transmitting sound corresponding to the results, or providing haptic feedback corresponding to the results.","While the system  of  envisions a user who submits a visual media search query through their computer, the visual media search query does not have to be received from a user or a user's computer, but can be received from any data processing apparatus, process, or person, for example a computer or a process run on a computer, with or without direct user input. Similarly, the results do not have to be presented to the user's computer but can be presented to the data processing apparatus, process, or person that sent the visual media search query to the server or a different data processing apparatus, process, or person. While the system  of  envisions receiving a series of search queries and results selections from a plurality of users user A  and user B , the search queries and results selections do not have to be received directly from a population of users but can be received, for example, from another computer that aggregates user search history information. In some implementations, no user search history information is received by the server . In these implementations, the server receives quality of results statistics corresponding to given queries from one or more data processing apparatus, for example, through the network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"As shown in , a client computer, client A , sends search history information through the network  to the server . Search history information can include user search histories or separate information regarding which search results were selected by a user or how long a user viewed a selected search result. While only one client computer is shown sending search history information in , a plurality of computers corresponding to a population of users may be used. In some implementations, the search history information is received from a computer other than the computer that the user used to submit the search history information. For example, the search history information can be received from a third party computer that aggregates user search histories.","In various implementations, the server  stores the search history information, for example, on a computer readable medium of the server. In some implementations, the search history information is stored on the client computer . In these implementations, the server  requests the information from the client computer  when it is needed. In some implementations, the search history information is accessed when needed to calculate a quality of results statistic. In some implementations, the server  or its quality of results statistic obtainer process  periodically process the stored search history information and generates a quality of results statistic corresponding to one or more queries. In some implementations, the server  or its quality of results statistic obtainer process  process search history information in real-time as it is received.","In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is stored, for example, on a computer readable medium of the server. For example, the quality of results statistic can be stored in a relational database that associates a given query with its quality of results statistic. In some implementations, the quality of results statistic is calculated by another computer or process and provided to the server , for example through the network  or a hardware or software interface.","In some implementations, no search history information is sent to the server . Instead, the server receives information associating one or more queries with one or more quality of results statistics from, for example, a computer connected to the server  through the network .","In various implementations, user  uses their computer  to send a visual media search query through the network  to the server . In alternative implementations, the visual media search query is received from a process running on a computer. In some implementations, the process is running on the server  and the visual media search query is received, for example, through a hardware or software interface. In alternative implementations, the process is running on another computer and the visual media search query is received, for example, through the network .","In various implementations, the server  sends a translation of the search query to the quality of results statistic obtainer . In some implementations, the translation of the search query is provided through the network  by the client computer  of the user who submitted the search query. In some implementations, the translation of the search query is provided by a process running on another computer. In some implementations, the translation of the search query is provided by a translation engine  run on the server .","The quality of results statistic obtainer obtains a quality of results statistic corresponding to the translation of the search query. In some implementations, the quality of results statistic corresponding to the translation has been determined in advance, either by the server  or by another computer. In these implementations, the quality of results statistic obtainer  selects the pre-determined quality of results statistic corresponding to the translation. In some implementations, the quality of results statistic corresponding to the translation has not already been determined. In these implementations, the quality of results statistic obtainer  determines a quality of results statistic using, for example, the search history information from users to calculate a click through rate for the translated query. In some implementations, once the quality of results statistic is determined it is stored, for example, on a computer readable medium of the server. For example, the quality of results statistic can be stored in a relational database that associates a given query with its quality of results statistic.","In various implementations, the search query, translated query, and quality of results statistic are sent to a query creator process  on the server . In some implementations, the query creator process  creates a final query corresponding to the search query, the translated query, and the quality of results statistic for the translated query. In some implementations, the query creator process  determines information about the quality of results statistic for the translated query. In some implementations, this additional information is used instead of the quality of results statistic to rank the search results. In some implementations, this information is used in addition to the quality of results statistic to rank the search results.","In some implementations the additional information is determined in advance and stored, for example, on a computer readable medium of the server. For example, the quality of results statistic can be stored in a relational database that associates a given query with the information determined from its quality of results statistic or a relational database that associates a given quality of results statistic with its additional information.","In various implementations, the final query is passed to a results generator process  running on the server . In various implementations, the results generator process  provides the final search query to a search engine backend . The search engine backend runs a search for terms in the query and returns a group of search results and their scores. In these implementations, the results generator process  adjusts the scores to reflect the quality of results statistic\u2014for example, raising the scores corresponding to the translation when the quality of results statistic is high and lowering the scores corresponding to the translation when the quality of results statistic is low. In some implementations, the search engine backend  ranks the results based on the quality of results statistic before they are returned to the results generator . Other techniques for generating search results are possible.","In various implementations, once the results generator  has generated a group of visual media search results, the server  presents the search results by sending them through the network  to the device that submitted the search . In some implementations the server  can present the results in other ways, including, for example, sending the results to the process that sent the visual media search query, sending the search results to another data processing apparatus or process, displaying search results on a display device, transmitting sounds, or providing haptic feedback. In some implementations, the search results are presented by a results presenter  run on the server .
