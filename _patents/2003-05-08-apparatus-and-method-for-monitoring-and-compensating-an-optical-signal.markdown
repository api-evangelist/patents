The information is usually presented to the network in the form of time-domain electrical signals and may represent any combination of telephony, video, or computer data in a variety of formats. A typical communication network consists of various physical sites, called nodes, interconnected by information conduits, called \u201clinks.\u201d Each link serves to carry information from one site to another site. Individual sites contain equipment for combining, separating, transforming, conditioning, and\/or routing data.","The traffic of even a single link represents a formidable volume of vital data-equivalent to tens of thousands of phone calls. Sudden failure of a data link can cause a significant loss in revenues for a network owner and loss of commerce and other benefits for the network subscribers. Consequently, restoration techniques have been devised to circumvent a network link failure and to restore normal traffic flow soon.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","105","120","121","100","101","105","111","115","120","121","130"]},"A span often includes multiple parallel links to increase working and spare capacity. Redundant spare links are commonly added between sites with the intent that they usually carry no data traffic but are available as alternate routes in the event of partial network failure affecting working links. If the network detects a link failure such as a fiber failure, cable cut, or transmitter\/receiver nodal failure, traffic may be automatically switched from the failed link to an available spare link.","A typical implementation of a high data rate optical span is depicted in . In , a given Site A is connected to another Site B by a span consisting of three optical fibers ,,. Two electrical data signals are presented at Site A via inputs  and . These signals are carried through the network span and recovered at Site B as electrical signal outputs  and  respectively. For example, these data signals can be STS-48 synchronous data signals each bearing digital data at about 2.5 Gbps or the equivalent of 32 thousand telephone-quality voice channels.","At Site A, the signals enter a digital cross-connect switch , and under normal conditions appear as electrical signals along connections  and . The signal at connection  enters an optical Lightwave or Line Terminal Equipment (LTE)  shown to include an optical transmitter , such as a semiconductor laser. Light emitted by the transmitter  is intensity-modulated by the electrical data signal that enters along connection  to deliver a modulated optical output signal over optical fiber .","After traversing the length of fiber , the optical signal arrives at Site B and enters a receiver  such as a photodiode. The receiver  is shown to be a part of an LTE  that amplifies and conditions the signal to render a faithful electrical reproduction at output port  of the original electrical data signal provided at input . In a similar manner, an electrical data signal presented at input  is transported by LTE , fiber , and LTE  to output port .","Under normal circumstances, the digital cross-connect switch DCS  simply connects port  to output port  to complete the end-to-end connection of input  to output . Likewise, DCS  normally connects line  to output  to complete the end-to-end connection of input  to output .","In , fibers  and  are referred to as working fibers because they both carry data traffic when all network elements are functioning properly. In contrast, fiber  is said to be a spare or \u201cprotect\u201d fiber because it carries data traffic only in the event of failure of one of the working fibers  or  or of the associated LTEs , , , and . Under normal circumstances, protect fiber  does not carry an optical data signal.","When a failure occurs along one of the working fibers , , digital cross-connect switches  and  switch data traffic onto the protect fiber . For example, if fiber  becomes too damaged to transmit light, switch  connects input  to connection . At the same time, DCS  disconnects connection  and connects output port  to connection . This switching action restores end-to-end connectivity between input  and output  despite the failure of working fiber .","To successfully perform restoration switching, however, it is necessary to detect failures and to coordinate switching action at each node. As shown in , a separate digital communication network is provided between sites for signaling status and switching commands between DCS  and DCS . Controller  is assigned to Site A to accept alarm inputs  from LTEs , , and . Controller  also directs the switching action of DCS  via control connection . A similar Controller  resides at Site B to accept alarm inputs  from LTEs ,, and  and to exercise control over DCS  via control connection . Each Controller ,  is typically an imbedded microprocessor, computer, workstation, or other type of processor for controlling the switching of lightwave terminal equipment, digital cross-connect switches, and optical cross-connect switches.","Controllers  and  communicate and coordinate with each other over a separate communications link . For example, status messages can be sent to indicate, acknowledge, or confirm a link or node state such as an idle, active, inactive, or detected fault state. Any digital signaling protocol can be used such as X.25, Frame Relay, ATM, B-ISDN or Common Channel Signaling 7 protocols. Alternatively, controllers  and  can communicate status messages using overhead bits or bytes within the data protocol that traverses the working fibers. Restoration algorithms and protocols applied within the controllers to restore end-to-end connectivity in response to a fault detection are well known to those skilled in the art. A central network management system for controlling network operations can be used in addition to or instead of the controllers , .","Thus, the ability to restore network service depends upon the ability to detect and locate failed network components. Faults have been detected in the electrical domain at LTEs. A transmitter  can detect a failed laser diode, for example, by monitoring its bias current. Some transmitters also incorporate a backwave detector. This is a photodiode that picks up the light emerging from the back of the laser diode and can detect the loss of laser output.","A laser diode failure within transmitter  can cause LTE  to report an alarm condition along an alarm connection  to the controller . The controller  can then direct switching of signals from port  to port . The controller  can also send signals along line  to controller  at Site B to cause switch  to connect port  to output port .","A receiver  can detect the presence of light delivered through fiber . A receiver  may also monitor bias current of a photodiode, if so equipped. Breakage of fiber  or failure of receive element  can cause LTE  to generate an alarm signal along an alarm connection  to controller . The controller  may then directly control switch  and indirectly control switch  to circumvent the failed fiber  or failed receiver .","Another way to detect signal presence at the receive end is by the use of a protocol analyzer that looks for specific data patterns, for example data frame alignment bits, in the digital electrical signal. This detection is usually inherent in the course of handling such signals in the electrical domain. Therefore, LTE  could also generate a \u201closs of frame\u201d alarm to controller .","With reference now to , the description of operation provided for elements in  applies to the like elements in . The alarm and controller elements are purposely omitted from the drawing for the sake of clarity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 2","FIG. 3A"],"b":["310","390","330","332","334","370","372","374"]},"In contrast,  represents the more recent, preferred approach of performing more data signal handling in the optical domain. Compared to conventional optical-electronic switching, Spans A-B and B-C are optically interconnected at Site B.  shows that an entire set of LTEs and a DCS at Site B have been replaced by an optical cross connect switch (OCCS)  and several optical amplifiers - and -. Note that the approach of  requires less equipment and removes the intrinsic data rate limitations imposed by intermediate electrical equipment.","The optical switch  is capable of being controlled in the same way as the digital cross-connects. An electrical control signal (or an optical control signal) drives the optical switch to selectively form optical connections among various input and output ports facing optical fibers -, -. For example, internal connections  and  within the OCCS  optically couple respective working fibers ,,, in both spans A-B, B-C under normal network conditions as shown in . The optical amplifiers -, - intensify the lightwave signal and compensate for losses introduced by the working and protect fibers and the OCCS .","While the approach of  is advantageous and represents the current trend towards implementing all-optical networks, a new problem is introduced in reliably detecting and locating failures. Without the receivers and LTEs at Site B, it is no longer possible to detect failure along fiber  as distinct from failure along fiber . In particular, lightwave terminal equipment located at the endpoints of optically interconnected spans cannot distinguish which span causes a communication failure. Therefore, the optical switching function within Site B cannot be usefully employed to bypass failed elements.","This problem is even better understood by examining . In , fiber  has been cut. This failure is detected by receiver  at site C. Without a separate detection at intermediate node B, however, the failure cannot be pinpointed to fiber  or fiber . Any controller receiving an alarm from receiver  at an endpoint node must assume that both fibers  and  have failed.","Restorative switching on a path basis between endpoints can be performed through DCS switches  and  as shown. For purposes of line protection switching and restoration, this recovery scheme leaves optical switch  no more useful than straight permanent connections. This amounts to what is called path protect switching in that entire paths between endpoint sites are switched. The problem is exacerbated as more working and spare fibers are taken into account.","Proper switching of OCCS  can provide a greater number of restoration paths. For example, compound failures as depicted in  can be restored. Such versatile restoration line switching can only occur when fault detection capability is provided at Site B to distinguish span A-B failures from span B-C failures.","One associated problem experienced with communications within an optical communication network is Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). Stimulated Brillouin Scattering is described in Paul E. Green, Jr., (1993 Prentice Hall), incorporated herein by reference. SBS is a type of stimulated light scattering where light is scattered from refractive index variations that are produced or amplified by the interaction of laser light with the material system. SBS is a non-linear effect in optical fibers in which, above a certain threshold, light emitted by the transmitter is reflected back towards it. There exists a need to account for SBS to provide enhanced communications.","According to one aspect of the present invention, an optical communication apparatus comprises: a communication path configured to communicate a first signal; a signal generator configured to provide a second signal; a combiner configured to combine the first signal with the second signal to provide a composite signal; and a light source coupled with the combiner and configured to receive the composite signal and to output an optical signal corresponding to the composite signal to an optical conduit, wherein the signal generator is configured to monitor the application of the optical signal to the optical conduit and to alter the second signal responsive to the monitoring.","Another aspect of the present invention provides an optical communication apparatus comprising: a light source adapted to couple with an optical conduit and configured to apply an optical signal responsive to a data signal to the optical conduit; and a signal generator configured to monitor Stimulated Brillouin Scattering during application of the optical signal to the optical conduit, and to alter the data signal responsive to the monitoring.","According to another aspect, the present invention provides an optical communication method comprising: providing a first signal and a second signal; combining the first signal with the second signal to provide a composite signal; generating an optical signal corresponding to the composite signal; applying the optical signal to an optical conduit; monitoring the applying; and altering the second signal responsive to the monitoring.","Yet another aspect of the present invention provides an optical communication method comprising: providing an optical signal; applying the optical signal to an optical conduit; monitoring Stimulated Brillouin Scattering during the applying; and altering the optical signal responsive to the monitoring.","The making and use of the various embodiments are discussed below in detail. However, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.","Exemplary communication networks are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,914,794, incorporated herein by reference, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,108,113, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention detects optical faults by tapping a portion of a data signal from along a fiber link in an optical switching network. The tapped data signal is evaluated to determine whether an optical fault exists along the fiber link. In this way, optical faults such as a fiber failure, cable cut, or nodal LTE failure occurring within a network path, are isolated to a specific fiber span or link. Versatile optical switching can occur between spans in an all-optical core network to restore end-to-end path communication.","In one embodiment, a presence detector simply evaluates the magnitude of the tapped signal to determine an optical fault. In a second embodiment, a protocol analyzer evaluates selected bits or fields of the protocol used in the tapped data signal to determine an optical fault.","In a third embodiment, a sub-carrier modulation signal is added to the high rate data signal prior to transport over the link. The sub-carrier signal is significantly lower in both frequency and amplitude than the main data signal so as to not impact reliable reception of the main data signal. A low-pass filter tuned to the sub-carrier modulation signal filters the tapped data signal. In the third embodiment, fault can be determined reliably and cheaply by detecting the sub-carrier signal.","According to a fourth embodiment, ancillary network data is conveyed through a sub-carrier modulation signal. By demodulating the sub-carrier signal, the ancillary network data can be recovered at any point along an optical network link. The recovered ancillary network data is useful for a myriad of network applications including tracing network timing references, cumulative link identification, wavelength re-mapping and re-use, telemetry and transmission performance evaluation, customer data payload identification, operational status indication, and\/or other network management operations.","The present invention is described in the example environment of a fiber optic communication network. In particular, fault detection and ancillary data transport along a long-distance fiber optic link in an all-optical switching network is considered. Description in these terms is provided for convenience only. It is not intended that the invention be limited to application in this example environment. In fact, after reading the following description, it will become apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art how to implement the invention in alternative environments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIGS. 1 to 3"],"b":["400","400","400"]},"At site A, a laser diode  is driven at a high data rate by a 1-10 GHz data signal  to produce an intensity modulated optical data signal, i.e. an Optical Carrier OC-192 signal. In general, any type of high data rate modulated optical source can be used, such as an integrated-type of direct modulated laser or an externally modulated laser, depending upon the required performance, cost, and other known design considerations.","The modulated optical signal is transported over fiber link  in span A-B to site B. After traveling a considerable distance, the signal may be strengthened by an optical amplifier  (or a lightwave re-generator) and further sent along fiber . Multiple optical amplifiers can be spaced along a fiber link to increase range.","The modulated optical data signal carried through fiber  eventually reaches an optical cross-connect switch  at a distant site B. Because the OCCS is located at an intermediate site or node, OCCS  can switch optical connections between multiple working and\/or spare fibers as described earlier with respect to OCCS .","OCCS  can be any type of multi-port optical cross-connect switch. In principle for a N\u00d7N OCCS any number of ports, e.g. N=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 40, 72, 128, or 256, can be switched. Any type of optical switch can be used depending upon the available technology. See, e.g., the integrated lithium niobate directional-coupler type switches discussed by Waynant, R. et al., Eds., Electro-Optics Handbook, McGraw-Hill, Inc. U.S.A. (1994), chapter 26, and especially page 26.34 (incorporated herein by reference). Other types of suitable optical switching technology include switches based on a thermo-optic effect in polymer waveguides or silica glass, semiconductor amplification, piezo movement, and integrated indium phosphide.","In addition, while a single OCCS  is shown schematically for clarity, multiple discrete switches and couplers can be used to perform equivalent multiple-port optical switching. For example, a set of discrete 1\u00d72 or 2\u00d72 optical switches can used to switch individual signals between working and protect fibers in different spans. Y-couplers and directional couplers can also be used.","According to the present invention, an optical coupler  is provided for coupling a portion of the modulated optical data signal from optical fiber  through fiber  to a fault detection receiver . For example, a tapped optical coupler (e.g. 90\/10 2\u00d72 asymmetric coupler) can be used to tap a fraction of the optical signal. It is desirable that most of the optical signal continue along fiber  to switch  in order to assure reliable reception at a remote LTE receiver.","In the first embodiment, receiver  includes a photodiode  for detecting the tapped optical data signal. A fast, responsive photodiode  produces an electrical signal  representative of the tapped optical data signal received from fiber  which is provided to a signal detector processor . For example, signal detector processor  can comprise any combination of rectifier, low-pass filter, thresholding, comparator, and hysteresis circuitry. The output of signal detector processor  indicates whether photodiode  is receiving any optical signal.","When the fiber link  is relatively noise-free, the electrical signal  output from the photodiode is representative of the original data signal . Signal detector processor  then accurately indicates that an optical data signal from link  is present when it detects an electrically modulated signal .","As shown in , however, some optical faults can avoid detection due to optical noise introduced by optical amplifiers located downstream of a fiber fault. For example, when a fiber cut  prevents the output of laser  from propagating through fiber , there is no signal present at the input of optical amplifier . It is characteristic of such amplifiers to output a broad spectrum of noise or oscillations whenever there is no injected input signal. Therefore, the amplifier  will generate output light along fiber  despite the failure upstream at fiber . The photodiode  will transduce this noisy optical signal into an electrical signal . Absent sophisticated discrimination electronics, the signal detector  can potentially interpret the presence of the detected optical noise signal as an indication that optical data traffic is passing through the link.","Further, when the optical data signal is weak at the end of fiber link , the tapped fraction of the optical data signal is correspondingly weaker. Therefore, in some cases, the weaker tapped optical signal will not be detected even though the data optical signal is still recoverable resulting in a false alarm indication at output . Thus, the receiver  in the first embodiment is better suited for detecting strong optical data signals from a fiber link free of potential optical noise sources such as light amplifiers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["550","580","580","480"]},"A digital modulating signal  is input that complies with a specific standard protocol, for example, a SONET-compliant STS-48 signal. In general any digital data signaling protocol acceptable to an optical network can be used such as Optical Carrier signals, OC-1 to 192, as long as overhead bits and\/or byte patterns can be recognized to verify the presence of a valid optical data signal. See, e.g., the high-level discussion of SONET overhead protocol in \u201cDigital Transmission Systems and Fiber Optic Technology and Transmission Systems,\u201d chapter 3 in Minoli, D., Telecommunications Technology Handbook, Artech House, Norwood, Mass. (1995) (incorporated in its entirety by reference herein).","Laser diode  is modulated by this signal and propagates the optical signal through fiber , amplifier , and fiber  to eventually reach both the optical switch  and photodetector . The photodetector output signal  is fed to a SONET-compliant analyzer  that can determine whether predetermined alignment bits and\/or byte patterns in the protocol overhead signals are present.","A protocol analyzer  such as a SONET detector, while more costly and complex than a simple thresholding detector, avoids the difficulties presented in  because the analyzer  can distinguish between an adherent data signal (properly formatted) and a spurious noise signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["600","650","660","670","680"]},"With reference to , a high data rate electrical signal  is presented at an input  to signal combiner .

In a preferred embodiment, the frequency of the superimposed monitoring signal  is several orders of magnitude less than that of the data signal . For example, if data signal  is on the order of 1 to 10 GHz, i.e. a SONET-compliant STS-48 digital signal (approx. 2.5 Ghz.) or an Optical Carrier OC-192 signal (approx. 9.9 GHz.), a useful sub-carrier signal  may range from 1 kHz to 10 MHz, depending on the response bandwidth of photodetectors  used at the receiver . Further, the monitoring sub-carrier signal  has a fraction, i.e. one-tenth, of the amplitude of the main data signal . Other ranges of amplitudes and frequencies for the sub-carrier modulation signal  and the main data signal  can be selected.","In , the light output  of laser diode , modulated by the composite signal along input , propagates through fiber , amplifier , and fiber .

This index of traceability applies to an inbound link, i.e., a SONET data link, and can be used by a network management system to trace and select the best available timing reference signal for synchronization.","In application 2, the ancillary network data type include cumulative link identifiers applicable to network signals. Cumulative linking identifiers can identify an originating link, destination link, and\/or any intermediate link. These cumulative linking identifiers can be added to the ancillary network data of a data signal at each link along a network path. In this way, the cumulative linking identifiers can be readout from the ancillary network data at a receiver end of a path to indicate the actual path taken by a signal through the network.","In application 3, wavelength utilization tables are included in the ancillary network data. In WDM systems, a composite wavelength division multiplexing signal is rerouted and mapped to other spare or pre-emptible wavelengths in the event of failure or congestion at a working wavelength. Heretofore, this wavelength routing and re-use information needed to be predetermined and stored at network nodes limiting the versatility and response of nodes for restoration operations.","According to the present invention, however, these wavelength utilization tables can be transported in ancillary network data throughout the network. After demodulating and recovering the ancillary network data, any node can then read and incorporate the wavelength tables for traffic management and restoration purposes, such as, wavelength routing and re-use.","In application 4, initial signal and\/or noise levels of a data signal are embedded as ancillary network data. In this way, performance data regarding the telemetry of a network path and\/or link can be determined. For example, the intensity of a received data signal can be detected at a remote receiver and compared against the initial signal and noise levels embedded in the ancillary network data.","In another example, the error rate of received ancillary network data can be used as an indicator of the quality of the high-data rate carrier transmission signal. Any type of error rate check for evaluating the transmission of an analog and\/or digital data signal can be used by a network manager. For example, a network manager can determine the bit-error rate, perform a cyclic-redundancy-check (CRC), and\/or check bits corresponding to test flags, for the ancillary network data carried by the sub-carrier modulation signal in any of the applications described herein. Test messages can also be embedded and transported either alone or in addition to other ancillary network data described herein.","By detecting intensity level and\/or error rate in the sub-carrier signal, links with poor or degraded transmissivity are quickly detected. Because the sub-carrier signal can be tapped or coupled out at any point along a link or path, intermediate path performance monitoring is possible (like SONET capability). Degradation points and faults can then be detected and isolated to a particular location along a path.","In application 5, customer identifier information is included in ancillary network data. This customer identifier applies to a particular data payload and can be used for network provisioning. The customer identifier can also be used for tracing customer data, determining frequently used areas of a network, and other statistical analysis.","Finally, in application 6, operational status indicators are embedded in the ancillary network data. The operation status indicators identify the status and\/or availability of remote spare elements for restoration purposes. For example, a status indicator can identify whether a fiber link represents a working link, a spare link, or an out-of-service link. In the event of a network failure, the ancillary network data can be read at a node to determine available remote spare elements. In this way, restoration can be achieved effectively without prior knowledge of network topology or design. The above six applications are illustrative; given this description, further applications would have been obvious to one skilled in the art.","The preferred embodiment of the present invention allows for transmittal of a low data rate signal providing ancillary network data as a rider on a high data rate optical signal. This sub-carrier modulated signal can be detected by inexpensive equipment without having to detect and demultiplex the high data rate signal. Ancillary network management information can be communicated regardless of the quality or loss of the high data rate signal.","The availability of an adjunct sub-carrier channel opens a myriad of possible applications. Of particular importance are the possibilities for improving restoration, wavelength routing, and general network management. The advances brought about by the method and system for transporting ancillary network data according to the present invention is very timely, as the telecommunications industry moves rapidly towards perfecting the next generation of all-optical networks.","Referring to , an exemplary optical communication apparatus  is shown.

Alternatively, controller  includes hardware configured to perform the illustrated methodology.","Initially, controller  proceeds to step S to initialize storage device , clock generator  and intensity control  with default settings. For example, controller  selectively instructs storage device  to insert dummy data, sets the clock rate of clock generator  and sets the intensity level of intensity control . As discussed above, the initial settings can be taken from a look up table. This table can be developed by looking to other systems or previous uses of this system as a guideline. When the initial setting can be made more accurate, the procedure will take fewer iterations to optimize. This table is generated for all fiber types; upon initial turn up, the system engineer is queried to indicate the fiber type whereupon that setting is loaded as the initial setting.","Thereafter, controller  proceeds to optimize the settings of storage device , clock generator  and intensity control .
