Often this information is stored and indexed within databases. Once the information is indexed, queries are developed on an as-needed basis to mine the information from the database for a variety of organizational goals.","The enterprise data can originate from a myriad of sources and even external feeds, but ultimately the goal for the enterprise is that all the data be consolidated, indexed, and related within a central enterprise data warehouse.","A major portion of data warehouse management is defining and managing data relationships. A data relationship is data needed to control an association of one piece of data within the data warehouse with another piece of data within the data warehouse. Often this control requires enforcement of enterprise business processes; some processes are automated and some processes are manual.","Thus, it can be seen that improved techniques for data relationship management are desirable.","In various embodiments, techniques for managing data relationships are presented. According to an embodiment, a method for establishing a data relationship is presented. Specifically, a user is dynamically interacted with to identify a first element from a first database table and a second element from a second database table. Next, the first element and the second element are linked in a third database table to create a relationship between the first element and the second element in the third database table. Finally, attributes and properties of the relationship are dynamically presented to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100"]},"A \u201cdata store\u201d as used herein may include a database, a collection of databases organized as a data warehouse, a directory, a collection of directories cooperating with one another, or various combinations of the same. According to an embodiment, the data store is a Teradata\u00ae warehouse product or service distributed by Teradata, Inc. of Miamisburg, Ohio.","The data store includes a variety of enterprise information. One type of information is referred to as an \u201centity.\u201d An entity is something that can be uniquely identified (e.g., a customer account, a customer name, a household name, a logical grouping of certain types of customers, etc.).","The use of \u201centity\u201d and \u201celement\u201d may be used interchangeably herein and below. Additionally, the use of \u201cdata store\u201d and \u201cdatabase\u201d may used interchangeably herein and below.","A table within the data store may include a schema that defines the relationship between one or more elements in the data store. For example, the relationship between data store element \u201chousehold\u201d to element \u201cindividual\u201d and to element \u201caccount\u201d (household\u2192individual\u2192account). The schema defines the fields or elements of the data store. The data store includes a plurality of different tables and different schema's. Schema relationships may be hierarchical or many-to-many relationships.","A \u201crelational object\u201d or a \u201crelationship object\u201d is a special grouping of database elements selected and defined by a user. The phrases \u201cdatabase object,\u201d \u201crelational object,\u201d and \u201crelationship object\u201d may be used interchangeably herein.","Each element or relational object includes attributes and\/or properties. Attributes and properties are values associated with an element or object, types of values, metadata about values, and the like. For example, an attribute\/property of an element \u201chouse\u201d may include a \u201ccolor type\u201d for the house, such as red. Metadata may indicate the house was painted red on a certain date and by a certain company.","It is within this context that the processing associated with the data relationship establishment service is now described in detail with reference to the .","At , the data relationship establishment service interacts with a user to identify a first element from a first database table and a second element from a second database table. It is noted that the first and second elements can be more than a single filed but can be composite information from the tables, such that they are each viewed as database objects or relational objects.","According to an embodiment, at , the data relationship establishment service interacts with the user via a GUI tool that includes user-guided fields to receive the first element and the second element from the user. Example screens of such a GUI tool are provided below with reference to the .","In another case, at , the data relationship establishment service permits the user to define the first element and the second element as selective fields from the first database table and the second database table. Here, as stated above, the first element is a first relationship or relational object and the second element is a second relationship or relational object. So, the elements can be composite information from the databases selected by the user and essentially defined by the user.","At , the data relationship establishment service links the first element and the second element in a third database table. This table is newly established by the data relationship establishment service to create a relationship between the first element and the second element.","In an embodiment, at , the data relationship establishment service permits the user to assign a relationship name or label for the relationship. This permits the relationship name to be integrated into other applications for future usage in an automated fashion. This also permits reuse, such that users can local and retrieve particular relationships by their relationship names.","In a particular scenario, at , the data relationship establishment service permits the user to define the relationship as a hierarchical relationship where the first element is a parent to the second element; the second element a child to the parent within the hierarchical relationship. The parent itself can be a child to another parent and the child can be a parent to another child within the hierarchical relationship.","In still another situation, at , the data relationship establishment service allows the user to add some of the properties or some of the attributes to the relationship. So, new attributes\/properties can be assigned and associated with just the newly created relationship by the user.","At , the data relationship establishment service dynamically presents the attributes and properties of the relationship to the user. This allows the user to interactive inspect and visualize all aspects of the relationship between the first and second elements.","According to an embodiment, at , the data relationship establishment service graphically depicts for the user the relationship between the first element and the second element. This graphical depiction can also include the first database table and the second database table with the attributes and the properties of the relationship. In fact, the graphical depiction can be interactive so more detail can be drilled down into or less detail can be abstracted up on direction of the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200"]},"The data relationship management service presents an alternative and in some cases an enhanced processing perspective to the data relationship establishment service represented by the method  of the . Specifically, the data relationship establishment service is focused on the initial creation of a data relationship and graphical presentation of that relationship along with its attributes and properties. The data relationship management service is focused on managing, controlling, customizing, and modifying such a data relationship as was established with the data relationship establishment service of the .","At , the data relationship management service receives from a user a relationship object. This can be done in a variety of manners.","For example, at , the data relationship management service acquires an identifier for the relationship object as a selection provided by the user within a GUI tool. This identifier can be typed into a field of the GUI or acquired via a pull down list selection, and the like.","At , the data relationship management service changes an attribute or property associated with the relationship object as directed by the user.","According to an embodiment, at , the data relationship management service adds a new attribute or a new property to the relationship object at the direction of the user.","In another case, at , the data relationship management service deletes an existing property or an existing attribute associated with the relationship object in response to direction provided by the user.","So, the changes are customized and user-driven.","At , the data relationship management service automatically updates a database table for the relationship object to reflect the change. The relationship object defines a data relationship between a first database object of a first database table and a second database object of a second database table. The relationship creation that embodies the relationship object was described in detail above with reference to the method  of the .","In an embodiment, at , the data relationship management service presents a graphical view of the relationship object along with the properties and attributes in response to an instruction to do so received from the user.","In another case, at , the data relationship management service provides an interface screen to receive a new definition for a new relationship object that creates a new relationship between different database objects from different database tables. In other words, the data relationship management service can act in a manner similar to the or as an enhanced version of the method  described above with reference to the .","Similarly, at , the data relationship management service provides another interface screen to receive a modification to the relationship between the first database object and the second database object.","So, the relationship object that embodies the relationship can be modified, deleted, created, controlled, and managed via the data relationship management service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"In an embodiment, portions of the data relationship management system  implements, among other things the data relationship establishment service and the data relationship management service represented by the methods  and  of the , respectively.","The data relationship management system  includes a GUI tool  and a relationship management service . Each of these and their interactions with one another will now be discussed in turn.","The GUI tool  is implemented in a computer-readable storage medium and is to execute on one or more processors of a network.
