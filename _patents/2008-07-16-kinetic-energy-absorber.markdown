{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/950,125 filed Jul. 17, 2007, which application is hereby incorporated by reference.","The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to kinetic energy absorbers and in particular to kinetic energy absorbers for projectiles.","Non-lethal and non-explosive projectiles are used with increasing frequency to facilitate a variety of emerging needs. These projectiles are often required to function after initial impact. Therefore, cargo and other internal components must not be damaged during the projectile's impact.","In the past, impact devices have been designed with metallic or polymer foams to provide energy absorption. The effectiveness and versatility of these types of materials are limited because foams are not easily tailored to achieve a specific response. Additionally, foam stiffness increases as compression occurs and requires large envelopes to effectively mitigate the g-levels produced during impact. Large-sized foam sections are often difficult or impractical for use on gun-launched projectiles.","It is an object of the invention to provide a kinetic energy absorber.","It is another object of the invention to provide a kinetic energy absorber for a projectile.","One aspect of the invention is a kinetic energy absorbing apparatus comprising a body having a generally ogival exterior surface; and at least one kinetic energy absorbing structure (KEAS) extending generally rearwardly from substantially an interior surface of the body. A longitudinal axis of the body and a longitudinal axis of the at least one KEAS may be substantially parallel. The at least one KEAS may comprise a plurality of KEAS. The longitudinal axis of the body and longitudinal axes of the KEAS may be substantially coincident. The KEAS may be substantially evenly spaced, radially. Aft termini of the KEAS may lie in substantially a same transverse plane, or in more than one transverse plane.","The KEAS may comprise generally hollow structures, such as, for example, tubes, hollow polyhedrons, hollow conical structures, hollow prisms, or combinations of these.","Another aspect of the invention is a projectile comprising an ogival kinetic energy absorbing apparatus, a projectile body, and a spacer. The spacer may be disposed between the projectile body and a KEAS. The spacer may include at least one forwardly extending member that meshes with a KEAS.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The invention includes a kinetic energy absorber that mitigates the induced g-forces on a projectile, as well as the internal components of a projectile. Reducing induced g-forces on internal components increases their survivability. The invention may be designed to be sacrificial. That is, the structure may fail catastrophically, while leaving the remaining projectile and its components intact.","The present invention may comprise the nose of a projectile. The nose is mounted to the body of the projectile at the forward most point. Mounting methods may include threading, machine screws, or adhesives, depending on projectile size and function. Compared to a foam energy absorber, the present invention provides a more constant stiffness throughout the impact.","In general, a kinetic energy absorber structure (KEAS) may be a hollow structure that extends rearwardly from an interior surface of an ogive. The longitudinal axis of the KEA may be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ogive. The diameter, size, number, wall thickness, radial spacing, and rearward extent of the KEAS may vary. The KEAS are designed to crush upon impact and mitigate g-loading on a projectile.","As impact begins, the KEAS begin to buckle successively, slowing the velocity of the projectile. As buckling continues, the KEAS will deform significantly and may rupture, thus continuing to absorb the projectile's kinetic energy. Material selection for the KEAS may be varied to provide a particular response or buckling mode, allowing the invention to be used in a variety of applications.","The KEAS may be used for commercial applications that require a single use kinetic energy absorber. Additionally, the KEAS may be used in a modular fashion to create large kinetic energy absorbing structures. The illustrated embodiments depict several exemplary variations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","12","14","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["16","5","5","16","18","20","20","18","16"]},"As best seen in , nose  may include KEAS in the form of hollow cylinders or tubes , , .
