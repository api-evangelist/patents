{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention is concerned with secure downloading of applications from a server.","The Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is a standard for digital wireless communications. GSM has much more services than just voice telephony. Today's second-generation GSM networks deliver high quality and secure mobile voice and data services (such as SMS\/Text Messaging) with full roaming capabilities across the world.","The development of GSM Networks and terminals to support more advanced data bearer technologies has allowed for the introduction of new exciting data services and mobile applications.","In mobile networks people can be contacted by calling to their mobile telephone number or by sending to that number a so called short message by e.g. making use of the Short Message Service (SMS). The point-to-point Short message service (SMS) provides a means of sending messages of limited size to and from GSM mobiles. Detailed information can be found in the ETSI standard GSM 03.40 Version 5.3.0.","The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) inside GSM phones is a smart chip that was originally designed as a secure way to connect individual subscribers to the network. There is an on-going evolution of the SIM into a standardized and secure application platform for GSM and next generation networks. New functions added to the SIM card have enabled different applications and accelerated the move towards the mobile phone as a data terminal.","In order to execute various applications such as bank account monitoring, reservations for travel, theatre, weather forecasts services, etc. there is needed some kind of a program that uses different kind of interfaces and is running on the SIM card.","For a successful downloading of an application to a mobile phone, it is necessary that the mobile phone has support for the application by having the right program running on the SIM. The trend towards different standardized high level languages, such as Java Card, will continue, giving more and more flexibility and performance to the SIM card application developers. The adoption of a standard which defines APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and application load mechanisms will allow the service provider to develop his application once and potentially load it over the air to any SIM card complying this standard.","As Java is emerging as an interoperable unified programming environment, it becomes possible to download interoperable applications, so called Java applets, on all SIM cards. The Java applets\u2014such as games, banking applications, and other security applications\u2014can e.g. work through a SIM\/USIM API interface. Java also offers remote management procedures, using the GSM 03.48 and Global Platform communication standards.","The subscriber can by himself add or remove SIM Java applications or other applications either through the web or by using the mobile terminal. The Smart Card has been playing an important role in insuring security in networks and thus, the inherent security properties of the SIM can be used to enable end-to-end security, encryption, authentication and signing.","The SIM card will keep offering its intrinsic security to validate new services access and to secure transactions. The future generation of \u201cInternet-like\u201d phones will make the best use of the SIM card through the execution of authentication applications for service access and transaction acceptation, but also through its capability to store configuration and user data.","The toolkit programs\u2014which are stored on the SIM card are the means by which operators are able to customize their service portfolios.","Different mechanisms allow the service provider to load applications over the air to a SIM card.","Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a protocol that has successfully established a de facto standard for the way in which wireless technology is used for Internet access. WAP technology has been optimized for information delivery to mobile phones. GSM phones can thus access the internet through WAP. WAP downloading of applications to a mobile phone takes place so that the user first browses the site with the mobile phone and selects the midlet\/application he wants to download. The user then writes an URL (Uniform Resource Location) address to a WAP site containing the desired midlets\/applications. The selected application is then directly downloaded and installation takes place on the mobile phone.","Another known WAP downloading method is the WAP push initiated download, in which the user browses a website with a normal internet web browser. This site contains applications, form which the user selects one for downloading and supplies his mobile phone number to the site. The site then connects to a WAP Push gateway and sends a WAP Push to the user. The push contains an URL to the application and the browser is launched to open this URL. The application is then downloaded and installation takes place in the mobile phone.","There are some problems connected to the known downloading solutions with respect to the security, which arise when subscribers can not be sure if they can trust the content provider and the service to be download. The subscribers have to be sure about that the service to be downloaded is secure and without e.g. viruses etc. The increasing number of content providers makes this problem even worse.","The object of the application is to provide improved downloading methods to mobile terminals.","Especially, the object is to develop a secure method for downloading applications to mobile phones.","The method of the invention for downloading applications takes place in a network comprising at least a server, a mobile terminal, a trusted operator and, preferably, a terminal, such as a Personal Computer (PC). In the method, a user selects an application to be downloaded at his computer or mobile terminal. He then sends a request from the server for downloading the selected application to the mobile terminal. The server sends a message to the mobile terminal with instructions for downloading of the application. This message is sent via a trusted operator in order to ensure a secure downloading. Thereafter said application is downloaded to the mobile terminal.","Preferable embodiments of the invention are presented in the subclaims.","By means of the method of the invention, the user can be sure that he can trust the content provider and the service to be downloaded. It is important that the service to be downloaded is secure and without e.g. viruses etc. When the user has verified the origin and authenticity of the content to be downloaded, he can make an informed decision whether to allow the downloading.","The term trusted operator in this text meant an operator on which the user can rely. The role of the operator can be implemented in different ways. Certificates are used in the communication between the server and the operator, by means of which the operator can verify origin and authenticity of the content.","The verification can be performed by e.g. using known Public Key Infrastructures, PKI, involving solutions for encrypting messages, creating digital signatures and for verifying the signature of a sender of a message by means of certificates. A certificate to a sender's identity must be issued by a certification authority (CA), which is an organization that issues certificates in order to verify identities. More detailed information about the technology involved in public key infrastructure systems can be found e.g. in the book \u201cUnderstanding Digital Signatures\u201d by Gail L. Grant, ISBN 0-07-012554-6.","Optionally, certificates are also used in the communication between the operator and the mobile terminal. It might, however, be enough for the mobile terminal that the message is just sent via the operator, since when the user sees that the message came from a given predefined channel, which is agreed in advance between the user and the operator, and it is an indication to the user of a secure communication.","The operator can check the application to be downloaded with respect to viruses, correct working etc. before the message is forwarded to the user. The operator might also check that the mobile terminal has the right settings for the downloading. In that case he might offer the user said settings.","For selecting the application, from e.g. a website, the user might use a PC, a laptop, or a mobile terminal, such as a mobile phone.","Said message to the mobile terminal is a Short Message Service (SMS) to the SIM card on the mobile terminal and includes information for finding the requested application, such as the URL address. This information is the forwarded by the SIM card to a browser in the mobile terminal, the browser then performing the downloading.","As a result of the message to the mobile terminal, a voice and\/or display signal is given to the user of the mobile terminal in order to indicate that the downloading is secure.","In the following, the invention will be described by means of some preferable embodiments referring to figures. The intention is not to restrict the invention to the details of these embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3"]},"The server  communicates with the users mobile terminal  via the user's operator  over a radio network of the mobile terminal, here GSM . The mobile terminal contains the SIM card  on which the services are downloaded and an internet web browser  for browsing web sites. The internet browser is needed for interpreting HTML into words and graphics when viewing a web page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"11"},"For this purpose, the user can then write an URL (Uniform Resource Location) address to a site containing the desired application. Instead of writing an URL address the wanted site, the user might indicate the desired application by just clicking on a place on the site. The user might think that it is more comfortable to do this, i.e. browse and select the application, from his PC. In step , the user sends a request for the application from his PC (or his mobile phone) to the server having the application.","As a reply to the request in step , the server sends a message in step  confirming the user's order of the application and with instructions to the user how to proceed in order to get the application.","The message of step  first goes to an operator that the user can trust. There might be a contract in advance between the content provider having the application in said server and the operator about a channel through which application download confirmations can be sent via the operator. The user then knows that applications received through that channel and sent via the trusted operator are safe, i.e. they are really sent from the right content provider, there has not been any third party attack that has changed the application or introduced viruses therein etc.","The step  message might e.g. be sent through an HTTPS channel that uses the Secure Service layer, SSL, protocol. SSL is a protocol that encrypts a single session. In addition to encryption, authentication is used, which is the way that enables the operator to see that the message really was sent from the actual content provider. Authentication includes the use of certificates, with which it is ensured that the server is the right one.","The message in step  contains the URL address of step  and the telephone number to which the application is intended to be sent.","By means of the telephone number sent with the message in step , the operator can check that the mobile terminal to which the application shall be sent has the right settings for the application (i.e. right program environment) and other such possible things in a checking application and settings step . Furthermore, the operator might perform a virus check on the application. This can be done by an own virus program or by using virus results done by remote components.","In step , the message is forwarded to the SIM card on the mobile phone of the user. The message contains information about how to find the application, such as the URL address, and instructions how to proceed. This message is preferably also a message with certificate information, in which the server is authenticated by the trusted operator.","After checking, in step , that the message came from the trusted operator, for example by reading certificate information, it is forwarded in step  to the browser on the mobile phone in order to download the application.","In step , the browser sends a message to the server for downloading the application, which is sent to the browser in step ."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
