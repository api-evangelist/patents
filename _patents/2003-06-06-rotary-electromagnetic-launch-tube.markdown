title: Rotary electromagnetic launch tube
abstract: An underwater launch system includes a launch tube frangibly sealed at its forward end. At launch time, pressure equalization means introduces water at depth pressure into the launch tube between its frangibly sealed ends. A rotary electromagnetic pump coupled to the launch tube receives water at depth and expels the water at a higher pressure. The higher pressure water is coupled to the aft end of the launch tube.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to underwater launching, and more particularly to a self-contained underwater launch system that uses a rotary electromagnetic pump to provide a launch impulse.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","A submarine's weapons and other devices are currently launched underwater by one of a horizontal or vertical launch system. The horizontal launch system is used to launch a payload (e.g., torpedo, sonobuoy, unmanned underwater vehicle, mines, etc.) into the water whereas a vertical launch system is used to launch a payload (e.g., missile, signaling device, etc.) into the air. The horizontal launch system typically consists of horizontally positioned pairs of tubes with each pair being connected by an impulse tank structure that directs water flow from an ejection pump to each of the tubes. The aft end of each tube is located in the submarine's torpedo room which is inside the submarine's pressure hull. Thus, the tube (which must accommodate payloads up to 21 inches in diameter) must penetrate the pressure hull. Due to the inherent risk associated with such large pressure hull penetrations, a submarine's torpedo room is one of the most complicated and expensive aspects of submarine design and construction.","Vertical launch systems make use of vertically oriented tubes positioned in the submarine's forward end external to the pressure hull. Launch is achieved using gas generators built into each tube. However, the use of such gas generators is loud and environmentally hazardous. Further, since the horizontal and vertical launch systems operate using different systems\/principles, the overall complexity and cost of a submarine is increased when both types of launching must be accommodated in a single vessel.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a launch system that can be used to effect both a horizontal and vertical launch from a submarine.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an underwater launch system that reduces the complexity and cost associated therewith by minimizing the size of any pressure hull penetrations used in the construction of the launch system.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an underwater launch system having a controllable source of launch impulse power so that a minimum launch impulse energy is used, thereby minimizing the acoustic signature associated with a launch.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, an underwater launch system is provided for mounting outside of an underwater vessel's pressure hull. A launch tube (housing a payload) is frangibly sealed at its forward and aft ends. Pressure equalization means coupled to the launch tube between the forward and aft ends introduces water at depth pressure into the launch tube just prior to launch time. A restraining device such as a stopbolt in the launch tube restrains the payload until released just prior to launch. A rotary electromagnetic pump has its input side in communication with water at depth pressure and its output side coupled to the frangibly sealed aft end of the launch tube. The input side receives water at depth while the output side expels the water at a second pressure that is greater than depth pressure. When the stopbolt releases the payload, the higher pressure water acts on the payload and causes same to be driven through the frangibly sealed forward end of the launch tube.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , a self-contained underwater launch system according to the present invention is shown and referenced generally by numeral . Launch system  is designed to be used externally with respect to a submarine's pressure hull in either a horizontal or vertical orientation. The particular payload launched by system  and\/or its support platform (e.g., ship, submarine, buoy, etc.) are not limitations of the present invention.","Launch system  has a launch capsule or tube  housing a payload  therein which can have a propulsor  coupled to its aft end. Payload  is any payload that is to be launched into a surrounding water environment where it will then run its entire course or transition into the air for airborne travel. Prior to launch time, payload  is held in place by an axial restraining lock or stopbolt , a variety of which are well known in the art. As shown here, stopbolt  is operated by an electrical actuator requiring only electrical signal and power lines A for operation.","Up until launch time, payload  is kept dry by a combination of tube  and sealing mechanisms mounted or coupled to tube  fore and aft of payload . For example, in the illustrated embodiment, an aft seal  seals the aft or breech end of tube  and a forward seal  seals the forward or muzzle end of tube . Each of seals  and  is strong enough to withstand the specified operating depth pressure of launch system . Aft seal  is a face seal on the breech end of the tube that sealingly mates with the outer surface of propulsor  on payload . This sealing relationship is maintained as payload  is restrained axially by stopbolt . Forward seal  is a diaphragm with a built in tear strip (not shown) that will rupture when payload  is impulsed through it.","Although not necessarily required, a muzzle door  can be coupled to tube  further forward of forward seal  to insure the integrity of forward seal  until launch time. If muzzle door  is used, opening and closing thereof is achieved with an actuator  which, preferably, is an electro or electromagnetic type of actuator requiring only electrical signal and power lines A for operation.","Just prior to launch of payload , tube  between seals  and  is flooded with water at depth pressure. This can be accomplished by means of a controllable valve  coupled to tube  between seals  and . Note that valve  need not be mounted directly in tube  as illustrated, but may be incorporated in a conduit (not shown) coupling launch tube  and the surrounding water at depth pressure. Preferably, valve  is an electrically-operated valve requiring only electrical signal and power lines A for operation. The combination of seals  and  with valve  provide tube  the means to equalize its interior pressure to depth pressure just prior to launch of payload .","Launch system  further includes a rotary electromagnetic pump  that receives its controlling signals and power via lines A. Pump  has an input side  for receiving water at depth pressure, and an output side  for expelling water at a pressure that is greater than depth pressure. Immediately prior to launch, stopbolt  is actuated thereby releasing payload  in launch tube . Output side  is coupled to launch tube  (e.g., via direct coupling thereto or via a connecting conduit) so that the higher pressure expelled water is delivered to payload  impulsing it forward to break the seat with aft seal . Such impulse energy drives payload  forward through forward seal . To minimize transmission losses, pump  is +axially aligned with launch tube , i.e., input side  and output side  are in axial alignment with launch tube .","Control signal and power supplied on lines A, A, A and A can be supplied by a controller  maintained on or within the launch system's support platform. In terms of a support platform that is an underwater vessel, controller  can be maintained within the vessel's pressure hull. Since each of the controllable elements of launch system  only requires electric signals and power, the lines carrying such signals and power (i.e., lines A, A, A, A) can be contained within a single conduit that requires a small pressure hull penetration.","Rotary electromagnetic pump  is illustrated in greater detail in  pump housing  is open at either end thereof to define a (typically) cylindrical tube having an input side  and output side . A support shaft  is axially supported in housing  by means of a plurality of radial mounts  which are typically hydrodynamically shaped in any one of a variety of ways as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. A shrouded impeller  is rotationally mounted on shaft . Impeller  is designed to propel fluid (water) axially therethrough when rotated as is well known in the art. The particular number of impeller blades (not shown) of impeller  and blade shape are not limiting features of the present invention. Affixed to the outer portion of the shroud of impeller  are a number of permanent magnets . The number, size and\/or configuration of magnets  are not limitations of the present invention. Mounted to housing  is an electric field generator  (e.g., coils) that receives electrical current on lines A. The interaction of the magnetic field produced by magnets  with the electric field produced by generator  causes impeller  to rotate on shaft .","The amount of pressure needed at output side  will vary depending on a variety of factors such as the type of payload , covertness requirements of a launch, and speed of the ship supporting launch system . Accordingly, to make launch system  adaptable to a variety of applications\/situations, rotary electromagnetic pump  is a variable speed pump. That is, speed of adjustment is controlled by the electrical current supplied to electric field generator . Such speed control is monitored and governed by signals\/current supplied over lines A.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Since only a single signal\/power line conduit is needed to bring control signals and power to the launch system, a vessel's pressure hull penetration to support the launch system is greatly reduced when compared to a conventional torpedo tube.","Furthermore, the present invention provides a viable means to store and launch payloads external to a submarine's pressure hull. The dedicated integral motor pump eliminates the need for impulse tank structure and slide valve assemblies found on current torpedo tubes thereby saving cost, weight and complexity. The present invention is independent of high-pressure air and hydraulics since it relies upon electric power to actuate all mechanisms and the rotary electromagnetic pump. Since the rotary electromagnetic pump has a high degree of controllability, an optimized launch pulse can be tailored for each payload as well as any given ship condition (e.g., depth and\/or speed) to ensure that the minimum energy required is applied and thereby minimize the system's acoustic signature.","An additional advantage is that multiple launch tubes can be packaged together for increased payload density. Further, since each tube is autonomous, system reliability is increased compared to existing systems because failure of any given launcher does not impact the availability of any other launcher.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
