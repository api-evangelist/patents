title: Data management
abstract: There is proposed a method of side-loading content onto a mobile device, preferably using a WiFi connection, from a network content store and storing it on the device for viewing later. The method automatically determines when to delete stored content, and more importantly, what content should be transferred over the network in the first instance. The system comprises a content manager which takes into account various parameters to determine what should be transferred and, if required, what should be deleted from the device. The parameters used include user profiles, size of a potential download, as well as available storage space on the device and the predicted duration the device will be in range of a wireless hotspot or broadcast network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT\/GB2009\/000137 filed 19 Jan. 2009, which designated the U.S. and claims priority to European Application No. 08250723.7, filed 3 Mar. 2008, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to method of data management between a mobile device and a network data store, in particular a method of managing the transfer of data from the network data store onto the mobile device and if required to selectively delete data on the device to create sufficient storage for the transfer.","Mobile devices today can provide a consumer with a wealth of services over those of traditional voice and data services. One such service is the delivery of multimedia content such as video clips and TV programs in general, and in particular, delivery of such content wirelessly. As multimedia content consumption has become more popular, techniques have been developed to enable more efficient delivery of the content to the consumer's mobile device. Currently, the most common delivery mechanisms are broadcasting, live streaming, and downloading.","Broadcast technologies send the same content to a large number of devices at the same time over a broadcast channel. Broadcasting is thus relatively efficient in terms of bandwidth use, though typically requires adapted devices to receive the broadcast content as well as dedicated broadcast networks to deliver the content.","Examples of current broadcast technologies include digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H), digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB), and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS).","Most mobile streaming services today are based around existing 3G mobile networks, and therefore require little or no modification to existing mobile phones and network. Streaming to mobiles is usually a unicast service, where content is sent in a continuous stream from a server to a single device and played as it arrives. It has several benefits aside from not requiring a dedicated broadcast network, including allowing the user to choose whatever content desired, and near instant access without having to wait for a complete file to be downloaded. However a significant drawback is that since a separate stream is required for each user, available network bandwidth can quickly become used up. Also, a permanent connection is required for users to watch content.","Increasingly, mobile devices are WiFi (IEEE 802.11) enabled and the WiFi connection can be used for video streaming. Streaming over a WiFi connection is relatively fast even when compared to the streaming over 3G connection. It also has the advantage of being much cheaper than streaming over a 3G connection, and many users now have WiFi coverage in their own homes as part of their ADSL connection, and public WiFi hotspots are increasing in number by the day.","Content can also be downloaded onto a device, stored, and then watched later whenever the user chooses. The download can be made over whatever network connection is available to the device, but the most common are over a 3G network connection or WiFi. Downloading has advantages in that both the average instantaneous bit-rate of the content is decoupled from the underlying transfer rate\u2014a higher quality piece of content with a higher data rate can now be consumed\u2014the user simply has to wait longer for that content to arrive. The disadvantage of this system is, of course, that the user now has to wait for the content to arrive.","It is the aim of embodiments of the present invention to address one or more of the above stated problems, and to provide an improved system for managing content on a mobile device.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of data management between a mobile device and a network data store in a wireless network, said method comprising:","(i) establishing a connection between the mobile device and the network data store by way of a wireless access point;","(ii) estimating a connection duration between the mobile device and the wireless access point, and the bandwidth of the connection between the mobile device and the wireless network;","(iii) determining if the mobile device has sufficient available storage for storing a network file selected from the network data store;","(v) determining if there is sufficient time to transfer the selected network file from the network data store to the mobile device in dependence on the estimated connection duration and the estimated bandwidth; and","(vi) transferring the selected network file from the network data store to the mobile device by way of the access point if it is determined that there is sufficient available storage and sufficient time to transfer the selected network file.","Preferably, the estimated connection duration takes into account prior connection history between the mobile device and said wireless access point.","The network content store may comprise a plurality of data files, and the selected network file is selected from the plurality of data files. The plurality of data files are preferably ranked in order of an interest parameter value, said interest parameter value based on a user profile, and the network file selected is the data file with the highest ranked interest parameter value. Furthermore, after the selected file is transferred, the data file with the next highest ranked interest parameter value can be selected.","The mobile device may comprise a plurality of device files ranked in order of the interest value, and if it is determined that the mobile device does not have sufficient available storage for the selected network file, then deleting one or more device files starting with the device file with lowest ranked interest parameter until the mobile device has sufficient available storage for the selected network file.","Preferably, the device files having an interest parameter value lower than that of the selected network file are deleted from the mobile device.","The data files may be multimedia files, such as video clips.","The network files transferred to the mobile device may be stored on the mobile device for later use\/playback.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for data management between a mobile device and a network data store in a wireless network, said system comprising:\n\n","When the delivery method is downloaded over WiFi, the cost of delivery is very low (and is certainly much cheaper than delivering over a mobile cellular connection such as a 3G or GPRS connection). Thus, it may not matter at all if the content is not actually watched. The benefit to the user is that they can appear to have a much wider range of content, and\/or the content that is delivered can be at a much higher quality as the volume of content is optimised.","The method results in more efficient data management where the transfer of data is optimised so that unnecessary data is not transferred (for example because it is too large or if it is determined that the user is unlikely to watch it). Furthermore, as the data is transferred in advance, and preferentially over a fast network such as WiFi, there are also no issues that usually arise from trying to stream over a connection with restricted bandwidth such as over 3G or GPRS.","The present invention is described herein with reference to particular examples. The invention is not, however, limited to such examples.","In examples of the present invention, there is proposed a method of loading content onto a mobile device, preferably using a WiFi connection, from a network content store and storing it on the device for viewing later. The method automatically determines when to delete stored content, and more importantly, what content should be transferred over the network in the first instance. The system comprises a content manager which takes into account various parameters to determine what should be transferred and, if required, what should be deleted from the device. The parameters used include user profiles, size of a potential download, as well as available storage space on the device and the predicted duration the device will be in range of a wireless hotspot or broadcast network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","102","102","106","104","103","103","103","103","102","103","104","103","102","103","104","103","103","103"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b ","a","a","b","b","a ","b "]},"A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the individual components of the backhaul network access points \/and network  have been omitted for simplicity.","The network content manager  is a server on the network side that controls the transfer of multimedia content to the mobile device . The network server has access to a network content store , which stores multimedia content for transferring to the mobile device . The multimedia content is typically video, such as films, television shows, sports clips and so forth, but may also include other multimedia content such as music, pictures and even software. The network content manager  also has access to a profile store  which stores users profiles such as the user of the mobile device .","Whilst the network content manager  and network content store  are shown as separate entities, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the functionality described below can be provided by a single physical server.","The mobile device  is shown in more detail in . The mobile device  comprises several important elements including a device content manager , a device content store , a device profile store , an on-device data manager , a bandwidth estimator  and a linger time estimator . The device profile store  stores user profiles, and more specifically, the user profile of the user associated with the mobile device . The user profile stored in the device profile store  is mirrored in the network profile store .","Whilst the elements in the mobile device  have been shown as separate entities, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that their function can be provided by a single controller module with access to a suitable data store.","The device content store  has a storage capacity of C for storing multimedia content in accordance with examples of the invention. At any given time, the mobile device  has D pieces of content stored in the device content store . Each item or file i on the device, where i\u03b5[1,D], has an associated storage requirement Si(device). With D items of content stored, the available space left in the device content store is A. The content is ranked taking into account the likelihood of it being watched and the file size of the content.","Similarly, in the network, the network content store  has stored N pieces of content that the mobile device  doesn't already have. Each item or file j in the network, where j\u03b5[1,N], has an associated storage requirement Sj(network). Each of these items of content N is also ranked in a similar way to each of the D pieces of content on the device in order of the likelihood of it being watched. The way in which the ordering is performed is described below.","When the mobile device  is within range of one of the access points or , and thus has a WiFi connection and is able to communicate with the network content manager , the device content manager  and the network content manager  communicate with each other about the pieces of content are held in their respective content stores. An algorithm is then run to determine which of the N pieces of content should be transferred from the network content store  to the mobile device , and also to whether any of the content D on the mobile device  needs to be deleted. The ranking of the content is used in the algorithm as are various other parameters.","The following parameters are used in the method, and are described before the method itself.","1. Interest Value\u2014I","For each available piece of content within the system (both on the mobile device  and in the network content store ), an interest value I is calculated. The interest value for item i on the device, where i\u03b5[1,D], is denoted by Ii(device). Similarly, the interest value for item i in the network, where j\u03b5[1,N], is denoted by Ij(network)","On the mobile device , the on-device data manager  calculates the interest value I for each of the pieces of content D stored in the device content store . The interest value Ii(device) is based on interest criteria associated with the user, which may be stored in a user profile stored in the user profile store . The user profile includes information on viewing history of different content, the user's feedback on previously watched content, and so forth.","A similar value of Ij(network) is also calculated for each piece of content N stored in the network content store . The interest value I may be calculated by the network content manager  or by the network content store itself , and utilises the user profile stored in the network profile store .","The following example outlines one method of calculating the interest value I.","Firstly, the system requires a lexicon of keywords, a profile for each user, and a description (in metadata) for each piece of content.","The lexicon is all the keywords used in the system. For simplicity, each profile comprises an exhaustive list of those keywords (i.e. the complete lexicon) where each keyword has a real number between \u22121 and +1 associated with it. That number indicates the preference of that user for that keyword.","For simplicity, each description is a list of keywords that applies to that piece of content.","Now for each user, to calculate an interest value for that piece of content, sum the real value preferences in that user's profile for all the keywords applicable to that item.","For example:\n\n","Thus, for user A, the interest value I for content X=(\u22120.7)+(\u22120.1)=\u22120.8","And, for user A, the interest value I for content Y=(0.5)+(0.9)+(\u22120.1)=1.3","2. Weighted Interest\u2014\u03bb","For each piece of available content on the mobile device  and in the network content store , a \u201cweighted interest\u201d value \u03bb is generated (\u03bbi(device) for the weighted interest value of item i on device, and \u03bbj(network) for the weighted interest value of item j in network). This value of \u03bb should reflect that there is a resource cost associated with transferring the content. Consequently, for two pieces of content that have the same Interest value I, the content that required the least resource would be transferred. As the file size of the content has the most immediate impact on the resource required for transfer, one possible method for calculating the weighted interest for an item of content is:\n\n\u03bb=\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere I is the interest value, and S is the storage requirement for the item of content. The weighted interest value \u03bbi(device) is calculated by the device content manager  for each item of content on the mobile device , and the weighted interest value \u03bbj(network) is calculated by the network content manager  for each item of content stored in the network. Alternatively, metadata used to describe the content in the network can be transferred onto the mobile device  and \u03bbj(network) can be calculated by the mobile device .\n","The weighted interest value \u03bb thus provides a useful way of ranking the content stored on the mobile device  and in the network. Thus, content that is small is preferred as it is easier (in terms of resource cost) to transfer, and similarly content that has a high interest value is preferred so that content that is likely to be watched by the user is transferred.","3. Linger Time\u2014Lte","One important aspect of the invention is the \u201clinger time\u201d LTe, which is used to predict how long the mobile device  is expected to be \u201cin-range\u201d of a wireless hotspot and thus is a measure of how long a network connection can be expected to last. There are several possible methods for generating this, one of which is the use of a trained Bayesian network.","A Bayesian Network (BN) can be represented with a directed acyclic graph, where nodes represent variables and the arcs between the nodes represent dependencies. A variable may be discrete, having a finite or countable number of states, or it may be continuous. Node A is a parent of node B, and thus B is a child of A, when there is an arc pointing from node A to B.","By definition, a directed acyclic graph is a BN relative to a set of variables if the joint distribution of the node values can be written as the product of the local distributions of each node and its parents:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0068"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"X","mn":"1"},{"mi":["X","n"]}],"mo":[",","\u2062",","],"mi":"\u2026","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","i"]},"mo":"|","mrow":{"mi":"parents","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["X","i"]}}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"If node Xi has no parents, its local probability distribution is said to be unconditional, otherwise it is conditional. If the value of a node is observed, then the node is said to be an evidence node.","In order to fully specify the BN it is necessary to specify the conditional probability of each node upon its parents, this process is called parameter learning",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["Access Point \u2014The Wi-Fi access point to which is the user is connecting","Weekday \u2014The weekday on which the connection is made","Time of day \u2014The time at which the connection is made","Connection duration \u2014The duration the user is connected for"]}}}},"The graph shows that the probability of a specific connection duration is dependent on the weekday, the time of day and the access point in use.","In order to fully specify the Bayesian network it is necessary to specify the conditional probability of each node upon its parents, this process is called parameter learning.","In general, this requires an extensive dataset containing historical information that can be used to \u201ctrain\u201d the Bayesian Network.","In the case of linger time, this dataset can be created by collecting information on the connection behaviour of a user over a period of several weeks. For every connection a user makes, the mobile device  should record the time, weekday, unique name (BSSID for WiFi) of the access point that it connected to, and the duration that the device was connected for. Collating this information provides a dataset which can be used to train the Bayesian network, allowing it to calculate the conditional probability of the connection duration based on time, weekday and access point. Over a period of time, as more connections are recorded and used to train the Bayesian Network, it becomes more accurate in predicting linger time.","Because a Bayesian network is a complete model for the variables and their relationships, it can be used to answer probabilistic queries about them. In this scenario the query is \u201cwhat is the most likely connection duration given the current weekday, time of day and access point?\u201d Since the trained Bayesian Network knows the probability distribution for the connection duration for any given time, day and access point it is able to select the duration with the highest probability. In practice, rather than utilising exact values for connection duration, intervals are likely to be used (e.g. 0-5 minutes, 5-10 minutes, etc.). This interval is the predicted linger time for the connection.","The Bayesian Network is implemented on the mobile device  and is used as part of the linger time estimator . It should be noted that the linger time estimator  can only use the Bayesian Network technique if the user has previously connected to an access point, and that it cannot be accurately used until sufficient data has been collected to train it. Thus, a more basic method, such as average connection time, should be used to predict linger time in cases where the Bayesian Network has yet to be sufficiently trained.","4. Bandwidth Estimation\u2014Be","Another parameter that is calculated is an estimation of the available bandwidth Be of the connection between the mobile device  and the network content store .","Techniques used may be based on round trip times and historical data relating to the access point being used and other network data.","The bandwidth estimation Be is calculated by the bandwidth estimator  in the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","i":["a ","b "],"b":["4","102"]},"In step , the mobile device  makes a connection with one of the access points and a further connection with the network content manager . The above parameters are then calculated by the relevant modules in the mobile device  or by the network content manager , and gathered by the device content manager .","Step  includes calculating by the device content manager  the weighted interest value \u03bbi(device) for each of the i items, where i\u03b5[1,D], of content currently stored in the device content store .","Similarly, the network content manager  calculates the weighted interest value \u03bbj(network) for each item of the j items, where j\u03b5[1,N], of content currently stored in the network content store .","The weighted interest value \u03bbj(network) may be calculated after a connection between the mobile device  and the network content manager  has been established. Alternatively, the weighted interest value can be calculated periodically by the network content manager  so that when a connection is made, the method for managing the content on the device can be initiated without delay. Similarly, the weighted interest value \u03bbi(device) for the items on the device can also be calculated in advance of a connection between the mobile device  and the network content manager .","In step , the D items of content are then ranked in order of their weighted interest value, with the item having the highest weighted interest ranked first. Each item is thus assigned a ranking number d, where d=1 is the highest rank, and where Rd(device) returns the item i of the item ranked d. The N items of content in the network are also ranked similarly, and where Rn(network) returns the item of content j ranked n.","The device content manager  then utilises the parameters and rankings to determine how best to handle the content on the mobile device , including which items of content to transfer from the network content store  to the mobile device . To this end, the network content manager  forwards the content rankings to the device content manager , so that the device content manager  can proceed accordingly.","In step , the first ranked item (i.e. rank n=1) of content stored at the network content store , is selected.","In step , a check is made to determine if there is sufficient capacity in the device content store  for the first ranked item of content stored at the network content store . Effectively, the available capacity A on the device content store  is checked against the storage requirement Sfor first ranked item (where n=1), represented by the following inequality:\n\n\u2003\u2003(3)\n","Note, the available storage A will depend on what content is already stored on the device as well as the total storage capacity of the device C.","If there is insufficient storage capacity i.e. if the inequality test (3) is not satisfied, then processing proceeds to step , and onto , and is discussed below. However, if there is sufficient storage, processing proceeds to step .","In step , a test is made to see if there is sufficient time to download the item of content Rn(network). This test is represented by the following inequality:\n\n\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere,\n\n","Thus, the test is to determine if there is sufficient bandwidth Be and Linger Time LTe to have time to transfer the data, scaled by a weighted error value. If so, then processing continues to step , which starts download of item Rn(network) onto the mobile device . The download takes place over a WiFi connection with one of the two access points or that the mobile device  is connected to at the time. The downloaded item can be stored in the device content store  until the user wishes to use it.","In alternative arrangements, steps can be taken to determine if any of the other items of content are smaller and can be downloaded instead.","Once the download is completed in step , item Rn(network) can be removed from the network content store, and processing continues to step , where the ranking n is incremented by 1 to process the next ranked item.","In step , a test is made to determine if the incremented value of n exceeds the total number of items in the network content store. If so, processing finishes\u2014step . If not (i.e. the incremented item is a valid item in the store), then processing reverts back to step  to determine if the next ranked item can be downloaded as for the previous item.","Turning now to the situation in step  where there is insufficient storage capacity.

Therefore, we test whether\n\n\u03bb(device)<\u03bb(network)\u2003\u2003(5)\n","If the interest value of the network item Rn(network) is not more than that of the device item Rd(device), then processing finishes in step .

In step , a check is made to determine if the ranking number has reached 0, in other words if the highest ranked item has been exceeded. If so, processing finishes in step , if not, processing reverts back to step  to determine whether the interest and storage requirements are met and thus whether to delete the appropriate items from the device.","Steps  to  are thus repeated until the test in step  is satisfied and an items from the device can be deleted to accommodate the network item Rn(network), and then reverts back to . Alternatively, processing can finish entirely if all the device items have been tested i.e. d=0.","It should be noted that steps  and  can be performed in either order. The test is to determine if there are items on the device that can be deleted that are of less interest than the network item that we are trying to transfer. The order of the two tests in steps  and  are not important.","In an alternative method, each item of content can be split into component parts, and each component part may be downloaded separately, using LTe and Be for the calculations.","Processing also finishes if the mobile device  disconnects from the access point at any time, and thus terminates its connection with the network content manager  and network content store .","Once the method is terminated for whatever reason, the process can be repeated next time the mobile device  comes within range of an access point and makes a connection with the network content manager . When a new connection is made, a check can be made to determine if there is any new content to be transferred, or indeed if any of the content on the device should be deleted because of a change in circumstances. For example, an item that has been watched, may still be maintained or indeed have a higher preference to be maintained, which in turn could be managed by increasing its interest value.","The user of the mobile device  may also manually delete some of the device content items once it has been watched, or if it is simply not desired.","Whilst the above examples have been described in relation to a mobile device moving into range of a WiFi access point, and thus establishing a WiFi connection with the network  and onto the network content store , the method can equally be applied to a 3G or other wireless network. However, the advantages using some other networks are minimised. In particular, one advantage of WiFi networks is that they tend to be relatively inexpensive and also have fast data transfer rates.","Therefore, in general, it is noted herein that while the above describes examples of the invention, there are several variations and modifications which may be made to the described examples without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. One skilled in the art will recognise modifications to the described examples."],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a better understanding of the present invention reference will now be made by way of example only to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"b "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
