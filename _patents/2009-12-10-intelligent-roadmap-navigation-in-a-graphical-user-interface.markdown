title: Intelligent roadmap navigation in a graphical user interface
abstract: Systems and methods for intelligent information navigation in a graphical user interface (GUI) where a sequence of items is generated and stored in a memory of a computer system. A number of graphical elements are displayed on a screen of a GUI, wherein each graphical element corresponds to an item of the sequence of items, and wherein the graphical elements are ordered according to the sequence. When requested, the graphical elements scroll in a chosen direction to gradually include a new graphical element into the screen at the direction of scrolling. Respectively, the scrolling could gradually exclude from the screen a graphical element at opposite direction. An item of the sequence of items could be selected as a currently active item. The displayed graphical elements are automatically scrolled to move the graphical element corresponding to the currently active item at a focal position within the screen.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field of the invention relates generally to data processing and digital processing systems. More specifically, the invention is related to presentation of information and navigation in a graphical user interface.","Generally, modern computer applications, including business applications (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP) system applications, customer relationship management (CRM) applications, etc.), implement graphical user interfaces to interact with users. The growing complexity of the functionality embedded in such applications, and the abundance of managed data present a significant challenge for the application developers to design efficient and detailed user interfaces within the limited space of display devices. Usually, users have to scroll and swap\/switch between a multitude of screens in their interaction with the applications to perform various tasks and to achieve desired results. In such a complex interface environment, it is necessary to maintain user's focus by tracking the accomplished work and keeping an up-to-date plan for the next actions.","Many business applications implement wizards or other types of techniques to guide users during execution of sequences of tasks of a complex process. The tasks are successively displayed one after another for execution in a graphical user interface (GUI), where the execution of one task invokes an interface for execution of a next task. Often, a roadmap is displayed within the GUI to help users keep track of a task flow while accomplishing a complex process. Such roadmaps could be described as plans that contain tasks and dependencies for accomplishment of complex processes. Roadmaps help users to navigate between tasks, inform the users for the executed tasks and the forthcoming tasks, provide additional information associated with the tasks, etc. Occasionally, roadmaps cannot display all the tasks of a process within a single screen. Therefore, a user has to navigate along a roadmap in a GUI to review the different tasks of a process.","The implementation of roadmaps provides significant advantage to users during the execution of guided procedures. Similarly, there are various other GUI tools that provide additional information to a user in order to facilitate the accomplishment of a particular action. When the additional information for accomplishment of a particular task is not provided in a single screen, a user has to scroll or navigate between numerous screens during the execution of the task. This navigation or scrolling could cause inefficiency and uncertainty in user's actions. Thus, the overall user performance, as well as the objective and subjective perception for usability of an application GUI, could be harmed.","Systems and methods for intelligent information navigation in a graphical user interface (GUI) are described. A sequence of items is generated and stored in a memory of a computer system. A number of graphical elements are displayed on a screen of a GUI, wherein each graphical element corresponds to an item of the sequence of items, and wherein the graphical elements are ordered according to the sequence. When requested, the graphical elements scroll in a chosen direction to gradually include a new graphical element into the screen from the direction of scrolling. Respectively, the scrolling could gradually exclude from the screen a graphical element in opposite direction. An item of the sequence of items could be selected as a currently active item. The displayed graphical elements are automatically scrolled to move the graphical element corresponding to the currently active item at a focal position within the screen.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for intelligent roadmap navigation in a graphical user interface (GUI) are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.

Thus, the sequence of items could be described as a roadmap for achieving a particular business goal by encompassing a series of tasks or steps. The execution of each task assigned to an item of the roadmap will typically change the state of the completion of the process. Thus, the roadmap could mark the progress of achieving the underlying business goal.

Tags \u201croadMap\u201d and \u201croadMapItem\u201d have attributes that could specify the roadmap and roadmap item display and behavior. For example, attribute \u201cstate\u201d could characterize an active, e.g., current, item or step of the roadmap; an inactive step that could be selected; and a disabled step. A user cannot select or jump to a disabled item to execute a task associated with the item before a condition is satisfied, e.g., a prior action is executed. Further, \u201ctext\u201d attribute provides a label or a title for a roadmap item or step. Attribute \u201ctooltip\u201d provides a text that describes an item. Tooltip text could appear in the GUI when a user moves a pointer over a graphical element that displays the item. Attribute \u201conClick\u201d is used to specify an event that will be triggered when a user clicks on a graphical element with a mouse input device.","The enlisted attributes are only an example. Other attributes with different names and properties could be defined in another embodiment of the invention. Similarly, an \u201conSelect\u201d attribute may specify an action that a computer system executes when an item is selected. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other approaches to define roadmap items and to assign tasks to the items could be implemented. Different development technologies and libraries of other vendors could be utilized to generate a sequence of items in broad sense.","At , a number of graphical elements are displayed in a specified screen area of a GUI. Each of the displayed graphical elements corresponds to an item of the sequence of items. In one embodiment of the invention, the displayed graphical elements represent wholly or partially the sequence of items. The sequence of items could be regarded as a roadmap for accomplishing a particular business process by executing the tasks associated to the items from the sequence. The GUI provides information and guidance to assist a user during the accomplishment of the process by displaying the graphical elements corresponding to roadmap items and the assigned tasks. Thus, the user is easily able to monitor work progress, e.g., to review already executed tasks and to browse the upcoming steps.","Often, the number of items in the sequence is greater than the number of the displayed graphical elements within a single screen. The generated sequence usually includes a considerable number of items and if too many graphical elements are displayed in a single screen, users could get confused and disoriented. The displayed graphical elements provide details regarding the corresponding items and the assigned tasks, according to one embodiment of the invention. The details could include information for the names of the tasks, descriptions or instructions for execution, statuses of the items, the order of the items, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, an efficient GUI displays between five and ten items from the sequence of items in a single screen by using corresponding graphical elements.","In a case where the displayed graphical elements are fewer than the items in the generated sequence, the GUI could provide scrolling functionality. Thus, at , a scrolling is requested to change the set of the displayed items in the screen area and show one or more new graphical elements corresponding to one or more new items from the sequence. The direction where the new graphical elements appear is the direction of scrolling, and it could be specified in the scrolling request. The scrolling could be requested by a user directly in the GUI by utilizing various input devices, including a keyboard, a mouse, a touch screen, etc. For example, scrolling could be requested by using arrows keys of a keyboard; or by moving a mouse pointer over a specific GUI control or area, with or without clicking on a mouse button, or rotating a scroll wheel or scroll ball. Additionally, scrolling could be requested by a system process in response to a specific event, for example, in response to accomplishment of a task execution.","According to one embodiment of the invention, the scrolling in a requested direction is possible only if there is a next item in the sequence of items to be displayed by a graphical element from the direction of scrolling. Respectively, at , a check is performed whether such next item exists. If next item to be displayed at the requested direction of scrolling exists, at , GUI animates a gradual movement of the graphical elements in a direction opposite to the direction of scrolling. The animated gradual movement creates a visual effect for a smooth, e.g., without perceptible jumps, shift or flow of the displayed graphical elements towards the edge of the GUI screen that is opposite to the direction of scrolling. The result of the smooth animation is a user perception for continuing movement along the roadmap of items. As a consequence of this movement, at , a new graphical element corresponding to the next item appears from the direction of scrolling, and is gradually included in the display screen with the pace of the animated movement. The perception for \u201cgradually\u201d or \u201cgradual\u201d move of the displayed graphical elements could be created by fast continuous change of the contents of the GUI screen. The appearance of the displayed graphical objects changes by a fraction at a time commensurate with the size of a pixel, imperceptible for a human eye at the speed of change.","GUI screen allows the display of a limited number of graphical elements. Respectively, the including a new graphical element from one direction could result in excluding of an existing graphical element in opposite direction during the smooth movement along the roadmap. Accordingly, at , an old graphical element is gradually excluded from the roadmap screen area. The execution of this action depends on factors like the number of currently displayed graphical elements, the distribution of the graphical elements in the screen, the continuation of the animated smooth movement, etc.","The animation effect for a gradual movement along the roadmap could be further strengthened by additional visual effects. In one embodiment of the invention, at , the new graphical element visually emerges on the screen and gradually changes its appearance from different levels of transparency to opacity. During this emerging, the contours of the new graphical element could gradually change from dimmed to rich colors. The new graphical element emerges during smooth animated movement during or after being gradually included in the screen area.","Similar to the visual effect of emerging, the exclusion of the old element from the screen area could be strengthened with a visual effect of fading in one embodiment of the invention. In this case, at , the old graphical element could gradually change its visual appearance from opacity to different levels of transparency while moving gradually towards the edge of the screen area. Respectively, the contours of the graphical element could fade or dissolve from full to washy colors. The actions illustrated with blocks  to  in  are repeated until, at , it is confirmed that scrolling request is satisfied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","212","220","200","200"]},"Graphical elements  to  are displayed within screen area  on a display coupled to memory .

At , a set of the sequence of items is displayed in a GUI screen area by corresponding graphical elements. Usually, when a user executes a task assigned or related to an item of the sequence of items, it is convenient to have ready access to as much relevant information as possible for the item. According to one embodiment of the invention, intelligent and efficient information navigation in a GUI could automatically scroll displayed graphical elements to show a particular item of interest within a specified focal position of the screen area. Thus, a user will always have an overview of the currently active item and its neighboring items in the sequence of items.

There are different ways to select an item as a currently active item. For example, a user could use a keyboard, a mouse, or some other input device to directly click on a graphical element corresponding to the item, and thus selecting the item. In another example, a user may click on a button or enter data in another screen area of the GUI that could lead to an item selection. Alternatively, an item could be selected without a user action, as a result of a system event. One of ordinary skill in the art may recognize a number of other possible ways to allocate a particular item from the sequence of items stored in a system memory. If displayed, graphical element corresponding to the currently active item could be modified to indicate the selection. The modification of the graphical element could include different visual effects, e.g., change of element's borders, change of colors, change of size, etc.","At , a check is performed to determine whether a graphical element corresponding to the selected item is displayed at the specified focal position. If such corresponding graphical element is not displayed within the focal area, the currently displayed graphical elements are automatically scrolled to gradually move the graphical element to the focal position. In one embodiment of the invention, the scrolling starts only if, at , it is confirmed that a next, not currently displayed item exists in the direction of scrolling. At , the scrolling is started and the GUI animates a smooth movement of the displayed graphical elements in a direction opposite to the direction of scrolling. During the scrolling, at , an emerging new graphical element corresponding to the next item is gradually included in the display screen area from the direction of scrolling. Respectively, at , the first graphical element displayed in a direction opposite to the direction of scrolling could be gradually excluded from the screen area if there is not enough space. This graphical element could change its appearance in a fading mode as being excluded from the display screen area, according to one embodiment of the invention.","The smooth animation creates a visual effect for gradual movement of the displayed graphical elements. The movement continues until at  it is confirmed that the graphical element corresponding to the selected item is displayed at the focal position. In one embodiment of the invention, the check at  for a next item is not required.
