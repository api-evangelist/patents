{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/054,110 entitled \u201cMULTIMEDIA REDIRECTION,\u201d filed on May 16, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","1. Field","The subject technology relates generally to remote computing and, in particular, relates to redirecting multimedia playback to a remote computer.","2. Background","One approach to the design and implementation of computer networks, particularly with regard to the development of client\/server applications, includes designing client applications and client devices so that the majority of the heavily used resources are at a remote computing device, such as a centralized server, connected via network. These client devices, which include devices connected to a monitor and keyboard, mobile intelligent devices (\u201cMID\u201d), netbooks, personal computers, or telephones, generally have minimal memory, disk storage, and processor power, but are designed under the premise that most users connected to a powerful server do not need the additional processing power. With these client devices, the total cost of ownership is minimized, because of the reduced resources, and security is increased, because the clients can be centrally administered and updated from the server.","Frequently, multimedia content, such as multimedia files and\/or video conferencing, are shared amongst a large number of clients. For example, in a business with geographically isolated offices, multiple clients may want to participate in a videoconference. In order for the client to participate in the videoconference, the server usually has to open the requested multimedia stream and send images and sound of the server-side multimedia playback that are \u201ccaptured\u201d or \u201cscraped\u201d (i.e., an image, such as a bitmap image, is taken of the server-side screen during multimedia playback, which includes a decompressed frame of the video, or in the case of audio, a predetermined portion of audio is recorded as it is played) while the videoconference file is played on the server. The screen-captured images are subsequently displayed (or in the case of audio, replayed) to the client (client-side viewer) connected to the server.","Unfortunately, because this media (e.g., multimedia) information is downloaded by the server, as well as captured and transmitted in an uncompressed format, a heavy load is placed on the network connection between the server and the client, and significant delay is added for the case of real-time applications (e.g. video conferencing). As a result, playback to the client-side viewer is usually interrupted, and playback is of poor quality (e.g., the refresh rate of the screen captured images is too low), often containing errors such as noise or a lack of synchronization between audio and video.","Alternatively, client systems may be required to download the entire multimedia file before being able to play the file, thus creating a significant delay between requesting to view a multimedia file, and actually viewing the multimedia file.","Furthermore, if several clients connect to and request a multimedia file from a single server (unicasting), the total processing and transfer burden to the network connecting the clients and server may render playback and\/or download too slow or error-filled so as to be useless to the users attempting to view the multimedia, reducing the scalability of this approach.","In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure, a system for receiving redirected electronic media playback includes a proxy configured to communicate with a remote access module, the remote access module configured to establish a remote access connection between the system and a remote system, the proxy further configured to receive, from the remote system over the remote access connection, at least one decode request for electronic media content designated for a local multimedia application on the system, the proxy further configured to provide, to the remote system over the remote access connection, a result of the at least one decode request, the proxy further configured to receive, from the remote system over the remote access connection, at least one playback command designated for playing the electronic media content on the local multimedia application, and the proxy further configured to provide, to the remote system over the remote access connection, a playback status of the electronic media content on the local multimedia application.

The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.","Now referring to , a simplified diagram of a multimedia redirection system is illustrated in accordance with one configuration of the present disclosure. The multimedia redirection system  may include local client computing device  (client) in communication with remote server computing device  (server) using remote access connection  and virtual channel . Client  may include proxy , client remote access module , and client multimedia application . Server  may include server remote access module , agent , and server multimedia application . According to one aspect of the disclosure, redirection of multimedia includes the instance of passing the responsibility for processing the playback of multimedia after a certain point (during the playback) from a first system (e.g., server ) to a second system (e.g., client ).","Server  has access to encoded multimedia content . Multimedia content  can include, without limitation, audio information, video information, image information, multi-dimensional graphics (i.e., 2D or 3D graphics), text, or a combination thereof. According to one aspect of the disclosure illustrated, multimedia content  is encoded. Sample encoding formats include, without limitation, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standards, Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standards (such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-3, and MPEG-4, and their constituent parts, versions, and profiles), Audio Codec 3 (AC3), Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Windows Media Video (WMV), Windows Media Audio (WMA), Digital Video Express (DivX), Waveform Audio (WAV), Adobe Flash, RealAudio (RA), RealVideo (RV), and RealMedia (RM) and other types of data that can be categorized as multimedia content. According to another aspect of the disclosure (not illustrated), multimedia content  is not encoded. Encoded multimedia content  may be encoded in a streaming format, in which portions of the multimedia content are configured to be played as they are delivered to a multimedia application, or in a non-streaming format, in which the multimedia content is configured to be played after the entire multimedia file has been delivered to the multimedia application. In certain embodiments, encoded multimedia content  can be used for live streaming through unicast or multicast transmission from multimedia server  over any protocol (e.g., UDP\/TCP).","According to the exemplary configuration illustrated in , encoded multimedia content  may be stored or streamed by multimedia server  to which server multimedia application  has access. In certain cases, proxy  of client  may also have access to encoded multimedia content  on multimedia server , as discussed below with reference to steps - of .","Client remote access module  is configured to create remote access connection  with server remote access module  on server . Together, client remote access module  and server remote access module  are configured to allow client  to access server  over remote access connection . In one aspect of the disclosure, client remote access module  and server remote access module  may be configured to allow client  to remotely control server  over remote access connection . In another aspect of the disclosure, client remote access module  and server remote access module  may be configured to allow graphical user interface software to run remotely on server  so that it can be displayed locally on client . Exemplary remote access applications, which include client remote access module  and server remote access module  configured to create remote access connection , are the Microsoft\u00ae Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) application and the Citrix\u00ae Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) application. The subject technology, however, is not limited to these exemplary remote access applications. Exemplary remote access applications can also have a broker software module sitting on a different system, or any of the two systems  and  described in . Examples can include Virtual Desktop Manager (\u201cVDM\u201d) from VMWare, and XenDesktop technology from Citrix.","Client remote access module  can include an appropriate terminal service client dynamic link library as well as other static libraries for use with a remote connection. Client remote access module  may include a terminal service client dynamic link library for a remote access application such as the Microsoft\u00ae RDP application and the Citrix\u00ae ICA application. Server remote access module  similarly can include appropriate system service modules for use with a remote connection. Client remote access module  and server remote access module  can come pre-installed with the respective operating systems operating on client  and server . Alternatively, client remote access module  and server remote access module  can be later added or otherwise configured to operate with the respective operating systems operating on client  and server .","Client remote access module  can create virtual channel  using at least a portion of remote access connection . Virtual channel  is used for the transfer between proxy  of client  and agent  of server  of information related to the redirection of playback of encoded multimedia content . In one aspect of the disclosure, whenever a remote access connection session is closed, client remote access module  may instruct agent  to stop multimedia redirection to client  from server . According to another aspect of the disclosure, a socket connection between agent  and proxy  may be used instead of, or in addition to, virtual channel .","Redirecting the playback of multimedia content to and from a device is sometimes referred to as multimedia redirection. In one aspect of the disclosure, redirecting multimedia content (e.g., encoded multimedia content  accessible to server ) to a remote system (e.g., client ) allows the multimedia content to appear as if it were being played (including any necessary decoding and decompression) remotely on server  while in actuality it is being played locally on client . Accordingly, the multimedia content appears to be playing remotely on server  while benefiting from the advantages of local playback on client .","For example, a user of a client system (e.g., client ) connected via a remote desktop connection (e.g., remote access connection ) to a server (e.g., server ) can use the server to visit a website displaying a multimedia webcast, and the webcast will be redirected to and played on the client system, within the remote desktop (e.g., client remote access module  and server remote access module ), such that video for the webcast will play on a display device connected to the client system and audio for the webcast will play on an audio output device connected to the client system. In one aspect of the disclosure, a multimedia redirection system can provide when and with which system the multimedia redirection is to be performed, and a multimedia redirection system integrates the multimedia redirection feature with a remote access application.","According to one aspect of the disclosure, while virtual channel  and remote access connection  may share the same physical connection (to network  of ) or the same physical communication path, each of virtual channel  and remote access connection  may comprise a distinct or separate communication \u201cchannel.\u201d","In one exemplary aspect of the disclosure, data packets having one type of header information may be viewed as forming one \u201cchannel.\u201d For instance, data packets having a first type of header information may be viewed as forming a first channel that is virtual channel . Data packets having a second type of header information may be viewed as forming a second channel that is remote access connection . For example, a first header could be labeled \u201cMMR\u201d and a second header could be labeled \u201cRDP.\u201d Thus, information to be sent or received over virtual channel  may be contained in data packets having the first type of header information, and information to be sent or received over remote access connection  may be contained in data packets having the second type of header information. This is an exemplary illustration, and the subject technology is not limited to this example.","The following illustrates one exemplary usage of virtual channel  and remote access connection . Information related to the playback of encoded multimedia content , such as audio information, video information, and event information may be sent over virtual channel , while other requests, such as remote control requests of server  from client , may be sent over remote access connection . Event information, including both server events and client events, as discussed herein may include, without limitation, information regarding stopping playback, beginning playback, resuming playback, rewinding playback, forwarding playback, volume adjustment, screen size adjustment, screen location adjustment, reaching the end of the multimedia content, and encountering an error, such as a corruption in the multimedia content. Event information may also include other requests, commands, or adjustments associated with a multimedia content.","Client multimedia application  is configured to perform various operations with media files or streams, including the rendering of media. In one aspect of the disclosure, client multimedia application  is a multimedia framework and application programming interface, such as Microsoft DirectShow\u00ae, Microsoft Media Foundation\u00ae, GStreamer or Apple Computer's QuickTime\u00ae framework.","Server multimedia application  is configured to play media files, including the rendering of media. In one aspect of the disclosure, server multimedia application  may be a digital media player used for playing audio, video, and viewing images, such as Windows Media Player\u00ae, Adobe Flash or Apple Computer's QuickTime\u00ae.","Proxy  on client  is configured to receive and process a decode request to determine if client multimedia application  has both access to encoded multimedia content , the decoder(s) necessary to decode encoded multimedia content  and support for the appropriate streaming protocols (e.g. RTP, RTSP, MMS, HTTP, etc). The decode request can include, without limitation, a location of the encoded multimedia content, and the detected type of encoding used to encode the encoded multimedia content. If proxy  determines client multimedia application  has both access to encoded multimedia content  including support for any required streaming protocols (e.g. RTP, RTSP, MMS, MSB, etc) and the decoder(s) necessary to decode encoded multimedia content , proxy  is configured to send a notification in this regard, as well as information regarding the encoded multimedia content (multimedia content information). Multimedia content information may include, without limitation, (1) audio information such as encoding type, number of channels, sampling rate, sample size, compression type, and play time (duration), (2) video information such as frame width and height, frame resolution, frame rate, play time (duration), number of frames, compression type, number of colors, and bit rate, or (3) image information such as height and width, number of colors, image content length, image content format, and image compression format. According to one aspect of the disclosure, multimedia content information may be included in the decode request. If proxy  determines client multimedia application  does not have both access to encoded multimedia content  and the decoder(s) necessary to decode encoded multimedia content , proxy  is configured to send a notification accordingly, such as, for example, an error notification.","Proxy  is also configured to execute server event commands on client multimedia application , such as to begin (e.g., a \u201cstart playback\u201d command), resume, seek, stop, pause, adjust volume, adjust a video window, or otherwise affect playback of encoded multimedia content  on multimedia application , as discussed above, and send a notification regarding the successful execution of the command, accordingly. In certain embodiments, proxy  is configured to use a buffering mechanism to facilitate the playback of the encoded multimedia content .","Proxy  can also be configured to process a \u201ccolor key\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cchroma key\u201d or \u201cblue screen\u201d) into a color key command. According to one aspect of the disclosure, a color key is used for mixing two images together, such that a first image is superimposed on a second image (\u201crendering screen\u201d), and may include, without limitation, the position and size of the rendering screen. According to one aspect of the disclosure, the color key command is a command from proxy  in which proxy  commands client multimedia application  to display, on the display of client , the first image with a size and at a location equal to the rendering screen of the same size and at the same location displayed on the screen of server . According to one aspect of the disclosure, by using a color key to direct client multimedia application  to play encoded multimedia content  on a rendering screen, client remote access module  does not attempt to display any data from the rendering screen area of the display of server .","Proxy  may be further configured to receive and send encoded multimedia content as well as playback commands for the encoded multimedia content. Proxy  may be further configured to send a notification that playback of encoded multimedia content has begun on client multimedia application .","In one aspect of the disclosure, proxy  may be a module or a Windows system service, and may be implemented as executable software code (e.g., Proxy.exe). In another aspect, proxy  may be a module that performs a function or operation on behalf of another module\u2014such as client remote access module , client multimedia application , or one or more decoders of client multimedia application \u2014and communicates with agent  or server remote access module  on server  or may be a module that performs a task in the background. In yet another aspect, proxy  may a module that performs other functions or operations.","Agent  on server  may be configured to register with server multimedia application  as the decoder(s) (including codecs) and the file\/stream loader (e.g., a program responsible for accessing and\/or loading a file or stream) for various types of multimedia content, thereby replacing any previously registered server decoder(s) and server file\/stream loader(s). According to one aspect of the disclosure, agent  can also register with the operating system of server . As a result, when server multimedia application  seeks to decode and\/or load encoded multimedia content , server multimedia application  calls agent  to decode and\/or load encoded multimedia content . When called by server multimedia application , agent  is configured to call the previously replaced server decoder(s) and the server file\/stream loader to decode and\/or load encoded multimedia file . According to one aspect of the disclosure, agent  is also configured to call server encoder(s) to encode decoded multimedia content. In certain embodiments, agent  on server  may be configured to register with server multimedia application  as a media splitter.","Agent  may be also configured to send decode requests for encoded multimedia content, including decode requests for portions of encoded multimedia content. According to one aspect of the disclosure, a decode request for encoded multimedia content is a request to determine if a multimedia application has access to the encoded multimedia content and the decoder(s) necessary to decode the encoded multimedia content. Agent  is further configured to send encoded multimedia content, including portions of encoded multimedia content, to a remote system.","Agent  may be further configured to send event commands to control the playback of the multimedia content, and to provide notification of the status of playback of encoded multimedia content on a remote system, such as client . Agent  may be also configured to load a rendering screen on the display of server . Agent  may then generate a color key corresponding to the color key.","In one aspect of the disclosure, agent  may be a module or a Windows system service, and may be implemented as executable software code (e.g., Agent.exe). In another aspect, agent  may be a module that performs a function or operation on behalf of another module\u2014such as a server operating system, a software application, or a driver on the server\u2014and communicates with client , while not disclosing the details of the function or operation to client , or may be a module that performs a task in the background. In yet another aspect, agent  may be a module that performs other functions or operations. In certain embodiments, agent  includes a service acting on the server  configured to run multiple instances of multimedia content, and also configured to act as a feeder to and receiver from the proxy  over the virtual channel .","According to one aspect of the disclosure, client multimedia application  is provided with a compression rate and audio and video quality optimized for playback on client  because of the negotiated delivery of encoded multimedia content . Because the logic for agent  through a negotiation with proxy  determines whether client multimedia application  has access to and can decode encoded multimedia content , encoded multimedia content  requested from server  is provided to and played by client multimedia application  according to the configuration of client . According to one aspect of the disclosure, the bandwidth load for remote access connection  between client  and server  is reduced because server  reduces the amount of unnecessary information sent to client  for encoded multimedia content  to be accessed and decoded. For example, if client multimedia application  has access to and can decode encoded multimedia content , client multimedia application  retrieves and decodes encoded multimedia content  directly, and agent  does not unnecessarily consume bandwidth of remote access connection  to send client  encoded multimedia content  to which client multimedia application  already has access.","In situations where client  can decode certain portions of encoded multimedia content  and not others, agent  sends appropriately encoded portions of encoded multimedia content  according to different encoding compression sizes, such as by streaming portions of the encoded multimedia content , so that client  can decode all portions of encoded multimedia content , while minimizing bandwidth usage. This reduces the delay in playing multimedia on the client-side caused by systems where a client needs to download an entire copy of encoded multimedia content from a server before being able to play the encoded multimedia content.","By shifting the responsibility for decompressing, decoding, playing, and other processing of encoded multimedia content from server  to client , scalability is improved for situations where a plurality of clients (e.g., client ) are connected to server  seeking to access the same encoded multimedia content, and the corresponding load on server , including the load of processing and communicating, is thereby reduced. The communication of information between proxy  and agent  further allows for improved synchronization of multimedia included in the encoded multimedia content, for example, by improving the synchronization between audio and video portions of encoded multimedia content .","Now referring to , a conceptual block diagram is shown illustrating an exemplary hardware configuration for the multimedia redirection system of . A multimedia redirection system may include one or more clients and one or more servers. A server may include one or more encoded multimedia files. Although encoded multimedia content  is illustrated as available through communications module  of server , encoded multimedia content may alternatively be available through communications module  of multimedia server , as denoted by the dotted illustration of multimedia server  and its constituent parts. In either of these cases, agent  has access to encoded multimedia content . In certain embodiments, encoded multimedia content  can be accessed directly by the client multimedia application , such as without the need of proxy  accessing the encoded multimedia content .","Clients  can represent a computer, a laptop computer, a thin client, a PDA, a portable computing device, an MID, or a suitable device with a processor. According to one aspect of the disclosure, when a client is a thin client, it may be a device having at least a processor and memory, where the total amount of memory of the thin client is less than the total amount of memory in server . In one example, a thin client may not have a hard disk. In certain configurations, client  can represent a mobile telephone, an audio player, a game console, a camera, a camcorder, an audio device, a video device, a multimedia device, or a device capable of supporting a connection to remote server . Client  can be stationary or mobile.","Server  and multimedia server  may represent a computer, a laptop computer, a thin client, a PDA, a portable computing device, a virtual machine (e.g. VMware\u00ae Virtual Machine), or a suitable device with a processor. In certain configurations, server  and multimedia server  can represent a mobile telephone, an audio player, a game console, a camera, a camcorder, an audio device, a video device, a multimedia device, or another suitable device. Server  and multimedia server  can be stationary or mobile.","A processor such as processor , illustrated as part of client , server , and multimedia server , may be implemented using software, hardware, or a combination of both. The processors  for the client , server , and multimedia server  can be of varying types. By way of example and not limitation, a processor may be implemented with one or more processors. A processor may be a general-purpose microprocessor, a microcontroller, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a programmable logic device (PLD), a controller, a state machine, gated logic, discrete hardware components, or any other suitable device that can perform calculations or other manipulations of information. A processor may also include one or more machine-readable media for storing software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, data, or any combination thereof, whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise. Instructions may include code (e.g., in source code format, binary code format, executable code format, or any other suitable format of code).","Machine-readable media may include storage integrated into a processor, such as might be the case with an ASIC. Machine-readable media may also include storage external to a processor, such as a random access memory (RAM), a flash memory, a read only memory (ROM), a programmable read-only memory (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD, or any other suitable storage device. In addition, machine-readable media may include a transmission line or a carrier wave that encodes a data signal. Those skilled in the art will recognize how best to implement the described functionality for a processor. According to one aspect of the disclosure, a machine-readable medium is a computer-readable medium encoded or stored with instructions and is a computing element, which defines structural and functional interrelationships between the instructions and the rest of the system, which permit the instructions' functionality to be realized. Instructions may be executable, for example, by client , by server , by multimedia server , or by processor . Instructions can be, for example, a computer program including code. A machine-readable medium may comprise one or more media.","Communications modules , , and , illustrated as part of client , multimedia server , and server , may be implemented using software, hardware, or a combination of both. By way of example, communications modules , , and  may be implemented with one or communications devices, such as, but not limited to, a modem, RS-232, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11x, or other forms of communication.","Communications modules , , and  may also include one or more machine-readable media for storing software.
