title: Real-time menu architecture
abstract: A system and method for implementing a dynamic menu characterized by a real-time menu architecture. An example method includes determining a menu structure, with reference to a data set, for use with user interface software. A menu is then displayed, wherein the menu includes menu items arranged according to the menu structure. An initial drop-down menu list of the menu includes one or more of the menu items. Each menu item is associated with a data object of the data set. A signal is generated when a change is made to a data set corresponding to a menu item. The menu is then updated based on the signal. In an illustrative embodiment, the example method further includes employing a browser to trigger implementation of the method. The browser communicates with a web server, which communicates with an application that is adapted to analyze the data set and associated data structure and provide an update in response thereto via, the signal, to the web server. The web server includes software for enabling the browser to render an updated menu or graphical representation thereof.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application relates to software and more specifically to user interfaces and accompanying menu systems for facilitating navigating or accessing data or software functionality.","Menu systems are employed in various demanding applications, including web blogs, search engines, merchant websites, and business enterprise applications, such as Human Resources (HR), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Project Management (PM), and Supply Chain Management (SCM) applications. Such applications often demand efficient menu systems that enable rapid and intuitive access to desired information and functionality.","Conventionally, software application menus remain relatively fixed, despite whether underlying data changes. To access underlying data, a user must often employ an application's menu to navigate to a particular user interface display screen or dialog box. The dialog box may provide a search field for searching for desired data. Underlying data, often called transactional data, may be returned as search results. When a user wishes to perform a particular operation on the retrieved data or to access related data, the user navigates the menu again to search for the related data or to access a user interface control corresponding to the desired operation. Selection of the user interface control may trigger display of a transactional page with additional user interface controls for modifying or approving a transaction or aspect of the data.","This process of repeatedly navigating a menu to locate data and then navigating the menu to perform an operation on the data, may be particularly inefficient and time consuming, especially if the user has not been trained to use the software.","In an example scenario, a user browsing a merchant website may wish to purchase a camera. The user employs the website's menu system to locate cameras. Once the user locates cameras for sale, the user may be required to search for a particular camera. When a webpage corresponding to a particular camera is found. A user may need to navigate to another page to purchase the camera. If the user wishes to purchase batteries for the camera, the user may be required to navigate the menu system again or otherwise enter data in a search field. To purchase a lens for the camera may require further navigation and\/or searches. Requisite menu navigation, searching, and so on, may be counterintuitive to users and may lead to reduced sales and reduced customer satisfaction with the website.","An example method for implementing a dynamic menu that updates in response to changes in underlying data includes determining a menu structure, with reference to a data set, for use with user interface software; displaying a menu, which includes menu items arranged according to the menu structure; providing an initial drop-down menu list, which includes one or more of the menu items, wherein each menu item associated with a data object of the data set; generating a signal when a change is made to a data set corresponding to a menu item; and updating the menu based on the change in response to the signal.","In an illustrative embodiment, the example method further includes employing a browser as the user interface software. The browser displays a user interface control, such as a menu option, for triggering the method. The browser communicates with a web server, which communicates with an application that is adapted to analyze the data set and associated data structure and provide an update in response thereto via, the signal, to the web server. The web server includes software for enabling a browser to render an updated menu or graphical representation thereof.","The menu structure is characterized by a hierarchical tree structure. Selection of a menu item corresponding to a leaf of the tree structure activates a transactional page corresponding to the leaf. The menu provides a user option to trigger an action associated with a first menu item. The user option is implemented via a second menu item that is displayed in the menu in proximity to the first menu item. In the illustrative embodiment, the action triggered by user selection of the second menu item includes navigation to a third menu item that is related to the first menu item based on a predetermined criterion. The predetermined criterion may include the existence of a key code that is common to data objects corresponding to the first menu item and the third menu item.","Another menu user option facilitates displaying the menu in a graphical format, such as a graphical depiction of the hierarchical tree structure or portion thereof. A drop-down menu or link is displayed in association with a leaf of the graphical depiction of the hierarchical tree structure. The drop-down menu or link provides one or more user interface controls for performing an action associated with data represented by the leaf. The drop-down menu displayed in association with a leaf of the displayed hierarchical tree structure may be further represented as a menu item of the menu.","One or more fly-out menu lists may be displayed upon user selection of a menu item that is associated with one or more subordinate menu items. An indication of a position in the menu corresponding to where a user has navigated to in the menu may be displayed via a breadcrumb band that is positioned above one or more displayed menu lists or menu fly-out lists, as discussed more fully below. The breadcrumb band may be adapted to selectively scroll to accommodate tracking of a user position in a menu. Elements of the breadcrumb band are called breadcrumbs and represent selectable menu items. Menu items displayed in a given menu are selectively presented to a user in one or more lists or drop down menus based on one or more data permissions associated with the user of the menu.","Hence, certain embodiments disclosed herein allow users to not only navigate folders in the menu but to also allow them to navigate real-time data, i.e., such that when data referenced by a menu changes, the menu adapts to reflect the change. This underlying data can be populated differently for different users and can dynamically change depending on any number of criteria. For example, as underlying data is updated, so does the data that the user can navigate via the menu. The user can seamlessly cross the divide from navigation to data processing, intuitively reaching the desired underlying data in one navigation sequence, rather than repeatedly navigating a menu and then entering search queries to reach desired data. The accompanying menu architecture allows real-time data to be displayed in a menu seamlessly and in such a way that the end user may not even be aware they are navigating real time data. In addition, the menu may allow for the association of related actions at any level or all levels in the menu.","Such menu capabilities, may facilitate improving efficient access to data by eliminating unnecessary re-navigation of a menu to access to current data and by providing efficient mechanisms, e.g., breadcrumbs to enable a user to track their position in a menu. Menu options to perform actions on the underlying data further assist the user and may, in some cases, eliminate the need to access a particular transactional page associated with the data. By enabling direct navigation to live underlying data, often called transactional data, via an intuitive menu structure that tracks a users location in a menu striker, businesses may more efficiently access underlying data to facilitate informed decision making, and customers of merchant websites may more readily access information and order pages for products and services they seek.","A further understanding of the nature and the advantages of particular embodiments disclosed herein may be realized by reference of the remaining portions of the specification and the attached drawings.","Although the description has been described with respect to particular embodiments thereof, these particular embodiments are merely illustrative, and not restrictive.","While the present application is discussed with respect to menu implementations in a web browser, embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, dynamically updating menus that change to reflect changes in underlying data and\/or functionality or actions associated with menu items may be employed in virtually any user interface software application, where access to data and or functionality is needed.","Furthermore, while embodiments discussed herein are particularly adapted to reflect changes in underlying data content, embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, menu structures (not just menu items) may be automatically updated to reflect changes in associations of underlying data.","In addition, while certain menus discussed herein are characterized by a different structure or architecture than a structure or architecture of the underlying data, embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, in certain implementations, the menu structure may parallel a hierarchical structure used or organize underlying data.","For clarity, certain well-known components, such as hard drives, processors, operating systems, power supplies, and so on, have been omitted from the figures. However, those skilled in the art with access to the present teachings will know which components to implement and how to implement them to meet the needs of a given application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","14","18"]},"The example system  includes a navigation generator  in communication with a browser  and a database . The browser  acts as user interface software for displaying a dynamic menu . The dynamic menu  is said to be dynamic since the menu is updated in to reflect changes in underlying data  maintained by the database  in response to user interaction with the dynamic menu , such as in response to user selection of a folder or menu item thereof. The underlying data  is said to underlie a menu structure of the menu , since the menu  is employed to navigate the data.","The underlying data  may be implemented as a data set that includes various data objects or data elements, also called data points. For the purposes of the present discussion, a data object may be any grouping of data. Examples of data objects include records or tables of a database. A database may be any collection of data. Note that the underlying data  may be structured according to a database hierarchy or may be relatively unstructured, e.g., arranged in a grid format. Each data object of the data set represented by the underlying data  may be associated with a key code. Each key code may be adjusted to reflect relationships between different data objects. For example, a data object associated with corporate headquarters may include a key code with a set of characters that is shared by a key code of a data object corresponding to a corporate president. The key codes may be employed to determine a menu structure for implementing the menu .","The menu structure of the menu  may represent a superstructure, i.e., a hierarchical organization of data that may differ from any hierarchical organization of the data  of the database . The underlying data  is called real-time data or live data, since the data  may be changed in real time. When the data changes, the navigation generator  may detect the change and facilitate updating the dynamic menu  in response to user interaction with the dynamic menu . Note that changes to the underlying menu data source  can be performed either batch or real time without departing from the scope of the present teachings. In real time mode, menu navigation changes are reflected to end users immediately. However, in batch mode, changes are reflected at a pre-determined time. For example, batch mode can be used for organization changes when the changes should not be visible until a company wide announcement has been made.","In operation, a user employs the user interface of the browser  to trigger or invoke the navigation generator . The navigation generator  includes one or more software routines for determining the structure of the menu  and related actions  associated with particular data objects of the real time data  and for detecting changes to the underlying data  and updating the menu structure, related actions, and data objects referenced by the menu .","The structure of the menu  may be a hierarchical structure, such as a tree. For the purposes of the present discussion, a hierarchical tree structure may be any hierarchy, where a node of the tree structure may have a link or association to a superior node and zero or more links to a subordinate node. A hierarchy may be any arrangement of items, e.g., data objects, names, values, categories, and so on. The items may be ordered or positioned such that they exhibit superior or subordinate relationships with related items in a data set. A hierarchy may refer to a displayed representation of data items or may refer to data and accompanying relationships existing irrespective of the representation.","When the user activates a drop-down menu list via the menu  and selects a menu item of the menu list, a fly-out menu list (also simply called fly-out) is displayed if the selected menu item is associated with child, i.e., subordinate menu items. To display a fly-out menu list, the navigation generator  references any data associated with a menu item (also called menu element) used to trigger the fly-out with reference to the database . Code, such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML), to generate the fly-out reflects the current state of the real-time data  referenced by the menu generator . Such HTML code may be forwarded from the navigation generator  to the browser  to facilitate rendering the dynamic menu .","For the purposes of the present discussion, a menu item may be any element or component of a menu. Generally, menu items are selectable to enable access to functionality or to enable further navigation in a particular menu. A subordinate menu item may be any menu item that is accessible via another menu item in a menu provided by user interface software.","The navigation generator  also facilitates tracking a user's navigation location in the menu  via breadcrumbs and facilitates updating the menu  with menu items that represent user interface controls for accessing functionality to manipulate data associated with a particular menu item or to navigate to related data. For the purposes of the present discussion, a breadcrumb may be any mechanism for indicating a previously visited menu item. In the present specific embodiment, a particular breadcrumb may act as a menu item upon user selection thereof.","Note that the browser  may be implemented via a conventional web browser or other type of data navigation tool, which may render dynamic menus , based on input from the navigation generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10","20","34","36","48","34","36","48"]},"The web server  interfaces the browser  with the application server . The application server  runs a menu structure generator , which includes a charting module  in communication with a breadcrumb-tracking module  and a menu code generator . The menu code generator  communicates with the breadcrumb-tracking module  and an actions module . The actions module  maintains information pertaining to menu folders that contain predetermined actions, as discussed more fully below.","An administrator user interface , which may include software and hardware for manipulating the user interface , communicates with the application server  and menu structure generator . The administrator user interface  optionally communicates with an Application Programming Interface (API) of the content server .","The content server  includes a menu tree manager , which communicates with the menu structure generator  of the application server . The content server  further maintains tree data  derived from data  of the database . The database  also communicates with the tree manager , which maintains a representation of the current tree structure  to be used by menus  of the browser . For illustrative purposes, the tree manager is shown communicating with a permissions module , which may maintain one or more Access Control Lists (ACLs) for selectively modifying the tree structure  and associated content to be delivered to the application server  to facilitate rendering of the dynamic menus  via the browser . The tree structure and associated data rendered by the browser  is modified, with reference to the permissions module , to ensure that a user that has logged in to the functionality provided by the menu structure generator  has been granted permissions to view the data rendered in the dynamic menus .","A tree-manager API  may be employed to enable an administrator or other authorized personnel to selectively modify the general tree structure  and associated behaviors and to change user permissions maintained by the permissions module .","In operation, a user employs the browser  to select an enhanced navigation folder . Selection of the enhanced navigation folder  results in generation of a signal or message to the enhanced navigation generator  to invoke functionality of the menu structure generator  and to provide code for rendering the dynamic menus  and associated page view . The page view  may include the dynamic menus , representations of underlying transactional data via a transactional page or window in association with related actions that can be performed on the transactional data, representations of a graphical depiction of a tree hierarchy representative of the dynamic menus , and so on. Page: 11 For the purposes of the present discussion, a transactional page may be any user interface window, dialog box, or other mechanism for illustrating contents of a data object and providing one or more options to manipulate the contents thereof Transactional data may refer to any data that is grouped according to a predetermined category.","Upon invoking the functionality of the navigation structure generator , a user may be prompted to log onto the system, such as by entering authentication information, such as passwords, identification numbers, and so on. This user authentication information is then employed by the tree manager  to tailor the code used to generate subsequently displayed dynamic menu features to permissions associated with the user.","The dynamic menu  may provide a user option for displaying the menu  in a graphical format, such as a hierarchical tree, as discussed more fully below. If the user selects such an option, the charting module  of the menu structure generator  is invoked. The menu code generator  may access the tree manager  for the latest menu updates, and then activate the charting module  to produce code, e.g., HTML for rendering the tree structure. The code, which may include updated breadcrumb information, which may be retrieved from the breadcrumb tracking module , is provided to the menu code generator . The menu code generator  may augment the code with any actions folders or related action menu items indicated via the actions module . The resulting code for rendering the page view  is then forwarded to the browser . The browser  then renders the page , i.e., user interface display screen.","Related actions are called \u201crelated\u201d actions, since functionality comprising the actions is related to or associated with a particular menu item that is displayed in the menus  or menu tree in proximity to a link, menu item, and\/or other user interface control used to invoke the functionality or action. An action may be a computer process or operation on underlying data, or may be another function, such as a navigation function that enables navigating to a different related menu item. Relations between menu items may be predetermined via the API  and tree manager . Related data objects corresponding to related menu items may be marked by particular key codes in accordance with a particular marking or identification scheme. Exact details of the identification scheme used to associate different data objects or menu items to other menu items or data objects are implementation specific. Those skilled in the art with access to the present teachings may readily implement a scheme for establishing and\/or marking relationships between data objects and between corresponding menu items.","Hence, the actions module  may maintain information identifying which actions are associated with which menu nodes, i.e., menu items. Actions associated with a particular menu item may be changed based on user permissions. User permission information may be obtained by the actions module  from the permissions module  via the menu code generator  and tree manager . Alternatively, the actions module  may communicate directly with the permission s module  and\/or tree manager .","The breadcrumb tracking module  includes one or more routines tailored to track where in the structure of the menu  a user has navigated to by selection of items thereof. A so-called breadcrumb trail is maintained, which indicates the sequence of nodes or menu items traversed to arrive at a particular location in the menu . This breadcrumb trail may be illustrated in the user interface display screen  (called page view) via a breadcrumb band, as discussed more fully below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["70","72","72","80","72"]},"Note that while certain embodiments are discussed as adjusting menu content based on user permissions and changes in underlying data, embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, one or more user interface features or controls may be provided to enable a user to initiate certain changes to a menu, without departing from the scope of the present teachings.","The menu  includes a breadcrumb band  indicating that a user is currently navigating a main menu of a favorites node of the menu . The user has selected a main menu item of the breadcrumb band , as indicated by a first drop-down list . The first example menu drop-down list  includes various menu items, including PeopleTools, Portal, and My Org menu items.","For the purposes of the present discussion, a breadcrumb band may be any region of a user interface display screen used to depict one or more visited menu locations. In the present specific embodiment, the breadcrumb band illustrates a sequence of visited menu locations, i.e., breadcrumbs. Each breadcrumb may correspond to a data object of a data set used to populate the menu.","The user has chosen to navigate the My Org menu item of the first drop-down list  by mouse-over, i.e., by positioning a computer mouse cursor over the My Org menu item. Note that a mouse-over option may be replaced with another option, such as a single click or double click option to activate fly-out menus associated with a given menu item. Exact choices of selection methods may be implementation specific and may be altered without departing from the scope of the present teachings.","Selection of the My Org menu item results in the display of an associated first fly-out menu list , which lists additional menu items. The additional menu items are called subordinate menu items of the My Org menu item, since they are further down in the menu hierarchy.","The first fly-out menu list  includes various menu items, such as Carry Jones, Many Lou, Andy Smith, Joey Lee, and Rick Olsen menu items. Such menu items correspond to data objects that contain data associated with the various persons named via the menu items. Note that the Rick Olsen menu item represents a leaf of the underlying menu tree structure, since no additional fly-out navigation options are provided in association therewith. Selecting or double-clicking the Rick Olsen menu item may result in display of a transactional page associated with Rick Olsen. Alternatively, a tree diagram is illustrated, with a leaf of the tree corresponding to Rick Olsen highlighted. The resulting displayed leaf may provide additional user interface controls for manipulating data associated with Rick Olsen or for navigating to a different location in the menu via a link provided in the leaf. If a different location is navigated to, the breadcrumb band  may be updated to reflect a navigation path that a user has taken to arrive at a new menu item.","In the present example user interface display screen , the user has selected the Joey Lee menu item, which triggers display of a second fly-out list . The second fly-out list includes various menu items, including an Eric Richards, Carson Andre, Ed Johnson, and Rick Anderson. The user may proceed in the fashion described above to continue navigating the menu .","To trigger display of a chart or other graphical representation, e.g., a tree diagram, of the menu , a user may, for example, double click a menu item, such as the Joey Lee menu item of the first fly-out menu list .","The user interface display screen  represents a simplified example of how an example menu may be displayed. Various additional menu features may be provided. For example, actions that can be performed in association with Joey Lee may be displayed via one or more folders and\/or other menu items in the second fly-out menu list  associated with Joey Lee. More detailed implementations illustrating related actions associated with a particular menu item are discussed more fully below, e.g., with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["80","90","72","90"]},"The tree structure  reflects the underlying structure of the menu  of . A Bill Mathew node  is the top node in the tree structure , as Bill Mathew is the user who logged into the accompanying menu-generation system, and the associated menu  of  started at an initial menu drop-down list  associated with Bill Mathew. A Joey Lee node  is shown highlighted, since the corresponding Joey Lee menu item was double-clicked to initiate display of the tree structure .","Nodes directly subordinate to the Joey Lee node  include an Eric Richards node , a Carson Andre node , a Ed Johnson node , and a Rick Anderson node . The nodes , - are shown including respective actions drop-down menus -. Each of the actions drop-down menus - may provide user interface controls for triggering functionality or actions specific to a particular node or leaf of the menu tree structure . The specific functionality or actions associated with a given node or leaf may be predetermined, such as via an administrator with access to the API  of . The Joey Lee node  may also include a drop-down menu, which is obscured by a list  of the Bill Mathew drop-down menu .","Generally, actions or functionality provided in a drop-down menu associated with a particular node or leaf are determined to be related to the node or leaf or otherwise potentially useful to a user accessing the node or leaf. Exact mechanisms for determining whether an action or other functionality should be displayed in a particular drop-down menu is implementation specific. Such mechanisms may be implemented automatically according to predetermined rules or criteria or may be manually preestablished.","Each node or leaf of the menu tree structure  represents or is otherwise associated with a data object characterizing the underlying data  of  and further corresponds to a menu item of a menu. A menu may be accessed from the user interface screen  of  via an updated breadcrumb band . The breadcrumb band  illustrates that the user has currently navigated to the Joey Lee menu item . Display of a menu fly-out may corresponding to Joey Lee may be triggered by user selection of the corresponding breadcrumb element from the breadcrumb band .","For illustrative purposes, the menu band  is shown illustrating a navigation loop. In particular, the user has navigated from the Joey Lee menu item to the Carson Andre menu item and back to the Joey Lee menu item. For the purposes of the present discussion, a navigation loop may refer to any sequence of user selected items in a menu that results in returning to a previous position in a menu. For example, if a user traverses from menu item A to menu item B to menu item C and then traverses back to menu item A, then the user has traversed a menu loop.","User selection of the actions drop-down menu  activates a drop-down menu list , which provides various user options. Since Bill Mathew is the current user, actions drop-down list  may include options that may otherwise not be available to a user navigating to the Bill Mathew node . Example user options, i.e., user interface controls, for facilitating implementing actions or functionality, include user options to change address, change marital status, request a vacation, and to view a payslip. Other user options, such as to navigate to a related node, may also be provided in the drop-down list . A folder corresponding to the drop-down list  may be included in a menu accessible via the breadcrumb band . Such a folder is preferably displayed in a fly-out menu activatable via a Bill Mathew menu item corresponding to the Bin Mathew tree node .","Selection of a user option from the drop-down menu list  may trigger display of a transactional page, such as a dialog box or other window, whereby a user may, for example, change address information, marital status information, and so on. Similarly, selection of one of the subordinate nodes -, also called sub-nodes, may trigger downward expansion of the tree structure  to reveal more subordinate nodes. The breadcrumb band  would then be updated to indicate that a user has navigated to, for example, the Carson Andre sub-node .","The example user interface display screen  further includes an optional search field  and submit button  for entering and initiating a query for menu items or nodes to be displayed. A user may continue navigating the menu or tree structure from any search results returned in response to the implementation of a query via the query field  and submit button .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["120","124","170","124"]},"The present example user interface display screen  shows that a user ahs initially navigated to an Office of the President menu item, via a Main Menu and ABN PCode Tree menu items, as indicated in an updated breadcrumb band . The user has selected the Office of the President (OAP) breadcrumb (which is also considered a menu item), which has activated an OAP drop-down list . The drop-down list  includes various folder menu items, e.g., Actions, Human Resources, Controllers, Retail Services, and Operations Administrator folders, and further includes various leaf menu items, e.g., ASD, BENNETT, and CHERRIER leafs.","The user has employed the Retail Services folder of the OAP drop-down list  to activate display of a second menu tree , such as by double clicking on the Retail Services menu item. Hence, a corresponding Retail Services node  of the second menu tree  is shown in focus or highlighted. Furthermore, a Retail Services breadcrumb in the breadcrumb band  is shown as having been visited.","Selection of the Retail Services menu item of the OAP drop-down list  triggers display of a Retail Services (RS) fly-out menu list . Selection of a Branch Office Administrator folder of the RS fly-out menu list  triggers display of a corresponding Branch Office Administrator (BOA) fly-out menu list .","Each of the drop-down fly-out menu lists - shows an actions folder therein, where each action folder provides various user interface controls for performing actions and\/or accessing functionality corresponding to the menu item used to activate the fly-out menu list. The actions folders and options provided therein may include similar content and options as corresponding drop-down lists. For example, an RS action drop-down menu control  may accommodate similar user options as the actions folder provided in the RS fly-out menu list .","Note that the menu tree , which may be implemented as a chart object, includes various nodes - corresponding to various menu items of the second dynamic menu . In general, each node - of the menu tree  includes an actions drop-down list control - that is analogous to a corresponding actions folder in a menu fly-out list.","In the present example embodiment, each node - of the menu tree  further includes a corresponding details link -. Note that while menu items corresponding to such details links - are not shown in the dynamic menu , analogous links may be represented in the dynamic menu  without departing from the scope of the present teachings.","In an alternative operative scenario, where the dynamic menu  and menu tree  are adapted for use with a merchant website, a user searching for a camera may arrive at a camera node. From the camera node, a user may efficiently order batteries for the camera, purchase a lens, order, a manual, and so on, all without requiring complicated searching or re-navigation of a menu structure. In general, user interface controls for triggering actions, accessing different links, folders, functionality, and so on, that may be useful when a user has navigated to a particular tree node or menu item are provided at that tree node or menu item. If a user interface control associated with a particular action, navigation, or other functionality is deemed not useful based on predetermined criteria, then the user interface control may be removed from the dynamic menu  and corresponding menu tree . Exact details of the predetermined criteria are implementation specific and may be determined by those skilled in the art to meet the needs of a given implementation, without undue experimentation.

Depending upon what processing is requested by the web server, a fifth step  and\/or a sixth step  are subsequently performed.","If the requested processing pertains to generating a sub-menu, i.e., a menu fly-out, the fifth step  is performed. The fifth step  includes accessing transactional data, i.e., data underlying a menu. The fifth step  further includes building an HTML snipped containing menu breadcrumbs, i.e., menu breadcrumb elements.","Data is said to underlie a menu if the menu is used to navigate the data or to otherwise access the data. For the purposes of the present discussion, navigation may refer to a transition of a graphical user interface display from a first display of one or more objects to a second display of one or more objects in response to user selection of an object or control in the first display of one or more objects. A user is said to navigate data or to navigate a menu if the user selects one or more different displayed objects or items to activate other objects or items to be displayed. An object, such as a data object, may be any grouping of data and\/or functionality. A representation of an object, i.e., a displayed object, may be displayed via graphical depiction, such as a menu item, dialog box, and so on. The graphical depiction of an object may also be called an object, a displayed object, or a node.","If the requested processing pertains to generating menu items and\/or structures associated with or related to actions or content that is related to a particular selected menu item, then the sixth step  is performed. The sixth step  includes accessing one or more related actions and building an HTML snippet containing any sub-menu navigation elements representing related actions. A related action may be any action or user option to implement an action that is related to a menu item, also called menu element, which the user selected, such as by clicking, double-clicking, etc., depending upon the desired implementation. Note that a related action may include retrieving data or other content for display in a menu, tree structure, dialog box, or other user interface display mechanism.","After processing pertaining to the fifth step  and\/or sixth step  is complete, a seventh step  is performed. The seventh step  includes combining any sub-menu navigation elements, such as fly-out menu items, breadcrumbs, and related action navigation elements into an HTML response message.","An eighth step  includes sending HTML response message, via an application running on the application server, to the web server.","A ninth step  includes processing the HTML response message, via the web server, and returning a resulting response message to the browser.","In a tenth step , the browser employs the response message from the web server to display a corresponding menu fly-out and to update menu breadcrumbs accordingly.","Note that the process  is merely illustrative and may be altered. For example, processing and messaging implemented via the web server and application server may be combined into a single server application running on one or more computers, without departing from the scope of the present teachings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 1-5"],"b":"190"},"The first four steps - of the related-content service process  are similar to the first four steps - of the menu generation service process of , however, different processing may occur in these steps depending upon the implementation.","After the fourth step , a transactional-data loading step  and\/or a related-content loading step  is performed based on processing requested by the web server in the third step . If the web server requests that the application server perform processing pertaining to transactional data, then the transactional-data loading step  is performed. Similarly, if the web server requests that the application server perform processing pertaining to one or more related actions, then a related-actions loading step  is performed.","The transactional-data loading step  includes accessing transactional data, e.g., from a database or file system, and then loading the transactional data into a software-based container, such as an object.","The related-actions loading step  includes accessing information or code pertaining to one or more related actions, such as by retrieving the code or data from a database or file system, and then loading the code or data into container objects.","Subsequently, after data loading implemented in steps  and\/or , an HTML-generation step  is performed. The HTML-generation step  includes generating an HTML response from the loaded data held in container objects. The HTML response includes HTML code for rendering a transactional page, also called a transactional data representation page.","Subsequent ninth and tenth steps  and , respectively, are similar to the ninth and tenth steps ,  of the process of  and involve the application server sending a response message (based on the HTML generated in step ) to the web server, and he web server returning a corresponding response to the browser.","Lastly, a data-representing step  includes displaying the transactional page to the user via the browser.

The related-content retrieving step  includes retrieving and then assembling data associated with the selected related action into objects, such as software container objects.","A subsequent response-generation step  includes generating an HTML response message based on the data held by the container objects. The response message includes HTML code for generating a web page.","Subsequently, steps  and  are performed, wherein the application server processes and returns the response message to the web server, and the web server processes the response message from the application server and forwards a corresponding response to the browser.","Lastly, a related-content displaying step  includes displaying, via the browser, the related action information contained in the response message received by the browser from the application server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 1-5"],"b":"220"},"The method  includes an initial menu-structure determining step , which involves determining a menu structure for use with user interface software. In certain implementations, the menu structure is predefined by and administrator employing an API, and\/or by relationships inherent in the data, and\/or by a database structure used to organize the underlying data.","A subsequent displaying step  includes displaying a menu, such as via a browser user interface. The menu includes menu items arranged according to the menu structure.","Next, a providing step  includes providing an initial drop-down menu list for display via the browser user interface or other user interface software. The initial drop-down menu list includes one or more of the menu items.
