The specification of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/810,575 is incorporated herein by reference. The present application makes reference to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/812,376 entitled \u201cDEVICE MANAGEMENT IN A NETWORK\u201d filed Jun. 8, 2006, the complete subject matter of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.","In addition, the present application makes reference to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/688,508. entitled \u201cCUSTOMER CARE NETWORK WITH AUTOMATIC CALLBACK TO SUBSCRIBER\u201d, filed Jun. 7, 2005, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

The non-volatile memory in these devices contains firmware, application software, data, and configuration information that makes the devices operational, and may be provided by the manufacturers of the electronic devices, by system operators of telecommunication carrier networks, or by third parties developers. If defects are found in such firmware\/software, or if new features are to be added to such devices, the software and\/or firmware in the affected electronic devices may need to be updated. Errors and\/or interruptions that may occur during the updating of such operational code may leave the electronic device in a partly or completely non-functional state. To avoid this problem, present methods of updating such software and\/or firmware involve returning the electronic device to the manufacturer, to the system operator, or to the third party, so that an update of memory contents may be performed using a direct connection to the electronic device. This is both costly and inconvenient to both the user of the electronic device, and to one performing the update.","Configuration parameters and other information for an electronic device may be stored in the non-volatile memory of such devices, and information about the device capabilities, the hardware, software and manufacturer of the device, and particulars for a given instance of the device in a network may be stored in databases used by, for example, device management and customer service operations. Such databases may be accessible to device management and customer service operations through database access mechanisms using, for example, structured query language (SQL) or similar database management tools.","Updates to firmware and\/or software in an electronic device may be developed by a number of parties including, for example, the manufacturer of the electronic device, the provider of services of a communication network accessed by the electronic device, or a third party. While the manufacturer and\/or third party may be technically qualified and capable of creating workable updates for the firmware and\/or software in an electronic device, such updated firmware and\/or software may not be planned for or compatible with the services and communication capabilities of the communication network of the service provider. Although the user of the electronic device may have authorization to use the network, an update to the firmware\/software of the electronic device may not be authorized for use in electronic device served by the communication network of the service provider.","In some circumstances, updates to software\/firmware of an electronic device that are approved for distribution may be intended only for use by a subset of those electronic device users. For example, new applications or software and\/or firmware updates may provide electronic device capabilities that are intended for use by specific groups of users. Some updates may not yet be fully tested, and there may be a desire to make such updates available to users that have been selected to be testers of an early release of an application or firmware\/software update. In other circumstances, such a subset of users may have a common need for an application or update of firmware\/software, and distribution to such a subset may be desirable. Limiting the distribution of such updates to a selected group may be necessary and\/or prudent, if such updates may cause problems for the users of the affected electronic devices.","Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with a representative embodiment of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.","Aspects of the present invention relate generally to the updating of memory in electronic devices, and more specifically, to methods and systems supporting device management and processing of updates for firmware, software, configuration parameters and file systems in memory of an electronic device such as, for example, non-volatile FLASH-type memory. While the following discussion focuses primarily on mobile electronic devices such as, for example, a mobile handset, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant, a pager, and a handheld personal computer, this is by way of example and not by way of specific limitations of the present invention. The teaching contained herein may also be applicable to a variety of other electronic devices having a processor and memory containing software, firmware, configuration information, data files, and the like, for which updating of memory contents may be desirable.","Representative embodiments of the present invention may be employed during updates using wired or wireless communication links such as, for example, a public switched telephone network, a wired local or wide area network, an intranet, the Internet, and wireless cellular, paging, local area, personal area, and short range networks such as those referred to as WiFi, IEEE 802.11a\/b\/g\/n compatible networks, the short range wireless technology known as Bluetooth, and similar types of communication links.","In a representative embodiment of the present invention, information for updating memory in an electronic device such as those described above is communicated using, for example, an update package comprising a set of instructions executable by firmware and\/or software in the electronic device to transform or convert an existing version of software, firmware, and\/or data in the electronic device into a new or updated version of the software, firmware, and\/or data. Such an update package may also contain metadata related to the update.","The following definitions, acronyms and abbreviations are use in this document:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["API","Application Programming Interface"]},{"entry":["CSR","Customer Service Representative"]},{"entry":["DA","Delivery Agent"]},{"entry":["DAO","Data Access Objects"]},{"entry":["DM","Device Management"]},{"entry":["DM Tree","Device management tree"]},{"entry":["EJB","Enterprise Java Beans"]},{"entry":["IMEI","International Mobile Equipment Identity"]},{"entry":["JDBC","Java Database Connectivity"]},{"entry":["JDO","Java Data Objects"]},{"entry":["JNDI","Java Naming and Directory Interface"]},{"entry":["MMV","Refers to a combination of values that define a device make,"]},{"entry":[{},"model and (firmware) version"]},{"entry":["MO","Management Object"]},{"entry":["MOI","Management Object Identifier"]},{"entry":["MSISDN","Mobile Station Integrated Services Digital Network"]},{"entry":["NVM","Non-Volatile Memory"]},{"entry":["OMA","Open Mobile Alliance"]},{"entry":["RAM","Random Access Memory"]},{"entry":["RMI","Remote Method Invocation"]},{"entry":["SMS","Short Message Service"]},{"entry":["SMSC","Short Message Service Center"]},{"entry":["UI","User Interface"]},{"entry":["URI","Universal Resource Identifier"]},{"entry":["URL","Universal Resource Locator"]},{"entry":["WDP","Wireless Datagram Protocol"]},{"entry":["WSP","Wireless Session Protocol"]},{"entry":["XML","Extensible Markup Language"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","107","107","107","107","157","107","107","107","107","107","107"]},"As shown in the illustration of , the network  in one representative embodiment of the present invention comprises the electronic device , a device management (DM) server , a provisioning server , a customer care server , and a download server .

The electronic device  may also comprise interface circuitry (not shown) to enable operable connection of a subscriber identity module (SIM) card , that may be employed in accordance with aspects of the present invention described later in this document.","In a representative embodiment of the present invention, an electronic device such as, for example, the electronic device  of  may employ an update package (e.g., the update package\/update package array ) delivered by a remote server such as, for example, the download server , to update firmware\/software, data and configuration information in memory of the electronic device . Such an update package may comprise update information including, for example, metadata describing an update, checksums, and instructions executable by one or more update agents such as, for example, the update agent  of . The update agent  may process a set of executable instructions, which may be used as a compact means to encode differences between existing\/first and updated\/second versions of firmware, software, data, and configuration parameters for the electronic device . The executable instructions may be assembled into update packages to be transmitted to an electronic device for use in updating memory of the electronic device. Update agent(s) in the electronic device may process respective portions of the executable instructions from an update package to convert\/transform corresponding portions of an existing\/first version of code in memory of the electronic device  to portions of an updated\/second version of code. The electronic device  may also receive provisioning information from, for example, the device management server , the customer care server , and\/or the provisioning server  to fix configuration problems or reconfigure software and hardware.","In addition to those elements described above, the electronic device  may comprise a downloaded diagnostic client (not shown) that facilitates remote diagnosis, and a traps client (not shown) that facilitates the setting of traps and retrieving of collected information. The DM client  of the electronic device  may interact with the DM server , the diagnostic client, and the traps client, to receive DM commands from the DM server  and to implement them in the electronic device . The download server  may be employed to download firmware and software updates (e.g., update information in the form of, for example, update packages). The download server  may also be used to download new firmware\/software such as, for example, the diagnostics client mentioned above, which may then be installed and activated in the electronic device .","As described briefly above, an electronic device in accordance with a representative embodiment of the present invention (e.g., electronic device ) may receive update information (e.g., an update package) for processing by one or more update agents (e.g., update agent ) to convert\/transform software (e.g., application software ) and\/or firmware (e.g., firmware ) to produce updated software\/firmware in the electronic device. In some representative embodiments of the present invention, the update agent  may comprise multiple update agents, each of the update agents appropriately arranged to process different types of update information for updating different types\/formats of software, firmware, user data, and configuration parameters in the memory of the electronic device . Each of the update packages received may be processed in the electronic device by an appropriate one of the update agent(s)  to update an associated type of information in the memory of the electronic device .","In one representative embodiment of the present invention, an Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) device management (DM)-based applications server is composed of two parts, an OMA DM-based application, and an OMA DM server such as, for example, the DM server  shown in . An OMA DM-based application is mainly focused on business processes, logic, and data. An OMA DM server, however, is mainly focused on the functionality required to support the OMA DM protocol by which the OMA DM-based application manipulates OMA DM-capable electronic devices such as, for example, the electronic device  of .","An OMA DM common framework in accordance with a representative embodiment of the present invention is arranged to support a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) and call back services, so that OMA DM-based applications may be easily and effectively integrated with an OMA DM server, such as the DM server  of , for example. One example of an OMA DM-based application server is the Mobile Variance Platform (MVP) Server developed by Hewlett-Packard Company. An OMA DM-based common framework in accordance with a representative embodiment of the present invention supports a set of APIs and call back services that permit the integration of multiple applications including, for example, a customer care\/service application, and other servers with an OMA DM-based server such as the DM server  of ","A customer care server such as, for example, the customer care server  of , may provide an API for issuing OMA DM commands and values to OMA DM capable electronic devices, including the ability to explore the device management tree (DM tree) on the electronic device. Bootstrapping the electronic device may be supported, along with the ability to configure one or more bootstrap messages. A customer care server such as the customer care server  may support a simple graphical user interface (UI) to allow OMA DM compatible electronic devices to be bootstrapped, and for commands to be issued to allow the electronic device to be explored and configured via a browser such as, for example, an Internet browser.","In a representative embodiment of the present invention, the code to support OMA DM-based device management for customer care activities of a customer care server (e.g., customer care server  of ) may be shared with an OMA DM-based application server. By employing a representative embodiment of the present invention, a system ensure that an application server and a customer care server produce identical behavior in their interactions with electronic devices under OMA DM-based device management.","An OMA DM common framework in accordance with one representative embodiment of the present invention provides for the real-time sharing of data by multiple OMA DM Based applications, and may include sharing of the data from a DM tree in an electronic device such as the electronic device  of . In a representative embodiment of the present invention, each OMA DM-based application may access the data required to create OMA DM commands for the electronic device.","Currently, each manufacturer of an electronic devices such as the electronic device  of  may place electronic device setting parameters (e.g., GPRS setting) in different locations within the DM tree of an electronic device they manufacture. This may cause the node uniform resource identifier (URI) of a given parameter to be different for each electronic device make, model, and version (MMV). Some representative embodiments of the present invention provide a data store to be used in managing DM tree information. Such a data store may hold single device information such as the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) of the electronic device, a password, and a nonce, to name only a few examples. Some data may be customized for each OMA DM-based application including, for example, the type of authentication scheme to be used, and bootstrap content. Some representative embodiments of the present invention allow a user of a customer care system to modify the bootstrap content, to specify the security type and profile type for devices. The security type may, for example, be one or both of \u201cNetworkpin\u201d and \u201cUserpin\u201d. Some representative embodiments of the present invention permit notification and bootstrap functionality to be shared by OMA DM-based customer care and application servers such as the customer care server  and DM server  of , for example. Such an arrangement may permit a user of the customer care server to specify, for example, a short message service center (SMSC) to be used for the sending of notification and bootstrap messages. Some representative embodiments of the present invention provide this functionality through a set of APIs and call back services that support the sending of DM commands and receipt of results.","An example demonstrating how a customer care server may profile a DM tree in an electronic device is discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","210","107","256","209","208","107"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":"107"},"During the management phase, the OMA DM common framework first employs the setCommandResults call back service to communicate the CommandResponse object to the OMA DM based application. In the illustration, this communication is received by functional element SCDMReceiver of the OMA DM based application. As shown in , SCDMReceiver then passes the CommandResponse object to the OMA DM-based application. The OMA DM-based application may then access the CommandRequest object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":"107"},"During a management phase, the OMA DM common framework employs a setBoostrapResult call back service to pass results of the bootstrap activity to the OMA DM-based application.

The DM server may use the \u201ccmd\u201d parameter array to determine which OMA DM command to issue to each electronic device. The expectedDeviceId (IMEI) and authScheme parameter arrays may be passed to save calls by a DM server such as DM server  of  to an OMA DM-based application server. If the DM client in any of the identified electronic devices (e.g., electronic device  of ) responds with a deviceId (IMEI) which is different than the expectedDeviceId, the DM server may perform a call to the OMA DM-based application server using a call back service such as \u201cprocessDevice( )\u201d, described later in this document. If the value returned by the OMA DM-based application server is \u201ctrue\u201d, the OMA DM server may make a call to a function that may be named \u201cgetAuthScheme( )\u201d, to determine the identity of an XML file (e.g., DBOfficer) to use for authentication of that electronic device. If, however, the DM Client returns a deviceId that is the same as the expectedDeviceId, then the DM server may not make a call to \u201cprocessDevice( )\u201d and may use the authorization mechanism indicated by the authScheme parameter for that electronic device, as sent in the call to \u201cexecuteCommand\u201d.
