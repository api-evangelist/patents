title: Firing pin position indicator for gun
abstract: A firing pin position indicator may be mounted to the breech end of a weapon. The indicator may include a solenoid with a plunger and a firing pin adapter that is selectively engageable with the plunger. The firing pin adapter may be fixed to the firing pin of the weapon. The solenoid plunger may be coupled to a quick-release lock. The quick-release lock may be selectively engageable with the firing pin adapter. The quick-release lock may include a housing and a spring-loaded piston that is translatable in the housing. The quick-release lock housing may be coupled to the solenoid plunger with a pin. A sensor may sense the position of the solenoid plunger and may provide a control signal to the weapon.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to guns, such as, for example, mortars and artillery.","When using a 120 mm breech-loaded mortar weapon, for example, the rounds (ammunition) may sometime misfire. It is difficult to determine if the round has been struck by the firing pin, or if the firing pin has been damaged. The mortar weapon may use a revolving firing pin. A suitable revolving firing pin is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/008,782 filed on Jan. 10, 2008, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.","The revolving firing pin may be aligned to strike the round only when the mortar system breech block is closed and locked. A prior firing pin solenoid was not attached to the firing pin. Thus, the firing pin position could not be seen from outside of the breech mechanism. And, there was no indication of what did or did not occur in the mortar system when a round misfired. Because of the danger of a slow burn, the breech block could not be immediately opened after a misfire. After waiting a period of time, for example, ten minutes, the breech block could be opened to inspect the firing pin and determine the cause of the misfire.","A need exists for an apparatus to provide an indication of the cause of a misfire in a breech-loaded weapon.","It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for providing an indication of the cause of a misfire in a breech-loaded weapon.","One aspect of the invention is a firing pin position indicator. The firing pin indicator may be mounted to the breech end of a weapon. The firing pin indicator may include a solenoid having a plunger, and a firing pin adapter. The firing pin adapter may be selectively engageable with the plunger. The firing pin adapter may be selectively translatable with the plunger. The firing pin adapter may be selectively rotatable with the plunger.","The plunger may be coupled to a quick-release lock. The quick-release lock may be selectively engageable with the firing pin adapter. The quick-release lock may include a spring-loaded piston that may be translatable in a quick-release lock housing. The quick-release lock housing may be coupled to the plunger with a pin.","The quick-release lock may include a drive ball. In a first position of the drive ball, the quick-release lock may be engaged with the firing pin adapter. In a second position of the drive ball, the quick-release lock may not be engaged with the firing pin adapter.","The plunger may include a plunger extension and the quick-release lock housing may be coupled to the plunger extension with the pin. The plunger extension may include a through-bore. The quick-release lock may be at least partially disposed in the through-bore. The firing pin position indicator may further include a quick-release lock actuator pin at least partially disposed in the through-bore and translatable in the through-bore. The quick-release lock actuator pin may be engageable with a head of the spring-loaded piston of the quick-release lock.","The firing pin position indicator may include a sensor for sensing a position of the plunger. The sensor may be, for example, a proximity sensor.","Another aspect of the invention is a firing pin position indicator mounted to the breech end of a weapon. The weapon may include a firing pin. The firing pin position indicator may include a solenoid with a plunger, and a firing pin adapter connected to the firing pin of the weapon. The firing pin adaptor may be selectively engageable with the plunger.","A further aspect of the invention is a weapon with a breech end. The weapon may include a firing pin position indicator mounted to the breech end. The firing pin position indicator may include a solenoid with a plunger, and a firing pin adapter that is selectively engageable with the plunger. The firing pin may be connected to the firing pin adapter.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A firing pin indicator may be mounted to the rear of the carrier of a breech-loaded weapon. The firing pin indicator may be attached to the firing pin of the weapon. The firing pin indicator may indicate the position of the firing pin. The firing pin may be out of view because the firing pin is within the carrier housing. The firing pin indicator may be in view of the operator of the weapon. The firing pin indicator may include a flexible strip. The flexible strip may be sensed by, for example, a proximity sensor. The flexible strip may be made of metal. The weapon may shut down if the strip is not sensed by a sensor or seen by the operator of the weapon.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","14","10","12","13","14","12","10","14","16","16","18","17","22","18","22","18","22","18","13","15","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["12","10","13","18","20","19","20","18","21","20","24","30","24","22","24","18","13"]},"Firing pin adapter  may include the function of the firing pin guide disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

With the breech block closed and locked and prior to firing, sensor  may not detect projecting portion  and the control system may shut down the weapon .","To check if firing pin  may be broken, solenoid  may be activated with the breech block in the closed and unlocked position. When the breech block is closed and unlocked, firing pin  is in the safety position (firing pin  cannot move forward). But, if the projection portion  moves forward and away from sensor , then firing pin  may be broken.","When the breech block is closed and locked, and projecting portion  does not move forward upon activation of solenoid , then solenoid  may be broken. When the breech block is closed and locked, and projecting portion  moves forward, but the round did not detonate and there is no recoil, then the round may be out of range of the travel of firing pin  or the round may be bad.","Solenoid  may be removed and replaced, for example, by removing mounting screws  () and depressing quick-release actuator pin . Projecting portion  may be a flexible metal strip made of, for example, spring material. Projecting portion  may be removed and replaced, for example, by removing screws  ().
