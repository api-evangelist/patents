title: Model based security for cloud services
abstract: Applications, such as cloud services, may be deployed within a network environment (e.g., a cloud computing environment). Unfortunately, when the applications are instantiated within the network environment, they have the ability to compromise the security of other applications and/or the infrastructure of the network environment. Accordingly, as provided herein, a security scheme may be applied to a network environment within which an application is to be instantiated. The security scheme may comprise one or more security layers (e.g., virtual machine level security, application level security, operating system level security, etc.) derived from an application service model describing the application and/or resources allocated to the application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Cloud computing generally refers to the practice of a user executing and\/or receiving services (e.g., run applications, store data, etc.) over a network environment (e.g., the internet). When a service is instantiated within the network environment, it has the ability to compromise the security of other services and\/or the infrastructure of the network environment. Security may be compromised on a network level as well as a local level. Current security techniques may not take into account the variety of services and their respective resources requirements. This may allow undesirable activity within the network environment because the security techniques fail to properly secure services based upon their respective allocated resources.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","A technique for applying a security scheme (e.g., a model based security scheme for cloud services) to a network environment within which an application (e.g., a cloud service) is to be instantiated is disclosed herein. A security scheme may be created based upon an application service model corresponding to an application which is to be instantiated within a network environment (e.g., a cloud computing environment configured to host cloud services). It may be appreciated that the term application as provided herein may be broadly interpreted to comprise not only computer applications, but also cloud services, web services, web pages, and\/or other source code.","The security scheme may be derived from the application service model, which may comprise an application description (e.g., a description of the application and other associated constituent applications) and a resource allocation plan (e.g. CPU allocation, memory allocation, network endpoints, etc.). The security scheme may comprise limitations and\/or restrictions (e.g., restrictions of execution privileges, restrictions of computing resources, limitations of computing resources, etc.), which may be enforced upon the application. In one example, the application may be allocated 1 GB of memory; therefore, the security scheme may enforce a limitation of 1 GB of memory for the application. In another example, the application may be restricted from accessing network endpoints not associated with the application as specified within the application service model. Among other things, the security plan may comprise a network filter security, a virtual machine security, an operating system security, a file security, a file resource management security, an endpoint security, a virtual account security, a process security, and\/or an application security. The security plan may be applied to the network environment.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","As cloud computing environments become more prevalent, developers may create cloud services that users may access and execute from within the cloud computing environment. Unfortunately, the cloud services may inadvertently or otherwise compromise the security of other cloud services and\/or the infrastructure of the cloud computing environment. In one example, a cloud service may attempt to access resources (e.g., memory) allocated to a second cloud service, thus possibly causing errors in the execution of the second cloud service. In another example, a cloud service (e.g., execution code associated a banking web page) may be associated with a particular end point (e.g., a banking web page accessible to users). If the cloud service receives information from an unassociated end point (e.g., a second banking web page), then security may be compromised. It may be appreciated that a cloud service does not have to be associated with an endpoint.","Current security techniques may not utilize a model based approach to creating a security scheme for a cloud computing environment, thus falling short of providing adequate security based upon a description of the cloud service and\/or resources allocated to the cloud service. This limits the ability to create a configurable security scheme based upon a model describing the cloud service and its allocated resources (e.g., additional special interfaces may be needed to achieve adequate security).","Among other things, a technique for applying a security scheme to a network environment within which an application is to be instantiated is provided herein. An application service model (e.g., a description of resources allocated by a scheduler to an application) may be utilized in creating a security scheme. The security scheme may comprise one or more security layers derived from the application service model. For example, security layers may be configured with limitations and restrictions derived from an application description and\/or a resource allocation plan within the application service model. In one example, a security scheme may comprise one or more security layers used to enforce limitations and restrictions upon an application within the network environment. The security scheme may enforce the limitations and restrictions through particular security layers (e.g., network filters, virtual machine security, process security, etc.) to allow the application to access allocated resources for proper functioning, while restricting and\/or limiting access to resources that are not allocated to the application. The security may also protect an application from illegal access by other applications. That is, the security scheme may employ security layers configured to protect an application by restricting and\/or limiting other applications from accessing (e.g., interfering with) the application and\/or its allocated resources. In addition, the security may also protect an application from illegally accessing other applications. That is, the security scheme may employ security layers configured to inhibit an application from accessing other applications by restricting and\/or limiting this applications from accessing (e.g., interfering with) other applications and\/or its allocated resources.","One embodiment of applying a security scheme to a network environment within which an application is to be instantiated is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a security scheme may be created based upon an application service model corresponding to an application (e.g., a cloud service) which is to be instantiated within the network environment (e.g., a cloud computing environment). The application service model describes what computing resources and\/other services the application may access during execution. The application service model may comprise an application description and\/or a resource allocation plan. The application description may comprise a description of the application and\/or one or more constituent applications. For example, a banking application may describe its own functionality and information regarding a database the banking application may be access. The resource allocation plan, for example, may comprise a CPU allocation, a disk size allocation, network endpoints, memory allocation, and\/or other resource allocations (e.g., resource allocations designated by a scheduler).","The security scheme may comprise limitations and\/or restrictions that may be enforced upon the application. In one example, a CPU usage limitation may be derived from the resource allocation plan that allocated a particular amount of CPU usage. The security scheme may enforce the CPU usage limitation, so that the application does not use more CPU than its allotted share. This may allow other applications to use their allotted share of CPU usage. In another example, the application description may describe a database the application will be accessing. The security scheme may restrict the application from accessing other databases not described within the application description. In this manner, a banking application, for example, may not access a second database not owned by the bank, thus mitigating unauthorized attempts at accessing the second database.","The security scheme may comprise one or more security layers (e.g., security techniques for enforcing particular limitations and\/or restrictions, thus sandboxing applications within the networking environment). In one example, the security scheme may comprise a network filter security (e.g., a firewall). The network filter security may be configured to isolate resources of a virtual machine within which the application is to be instantiated. For example, a virtual machine may be created within a physical machine. The virtual machine may host one or more applications through an operating system. The network filter security may be configured, for example, to restrict the virtual machine from accessing network endpoints not described within the application service model.","The security scheme may comprise a virtual machine security (e.g., security associated with a virtual machine within which the application is to be instantiated). In one example, the virtual machine security may isolate the application's role into one or more virtual machines as desired. In another example, the virtual machine security may define resource access of the virtual machine, which may be derived from the application service model.","The security scheme may comprise an operating system security (e.g., security corresponding to an operating system within a virtual machine within which the application is to be instantiated). In one example, the operating system security may define access to system resources (e.g., system file, registry, disk resources, etc.) derived from the application service model. In another example, the operating system security may control privileges available to a particular virtual account associated with the application. In yet another example, access to endpoints may be restricted through the operating system security.","The security scheme may comprise a file security (e.g., security within the operating system corresponding to memory allocation). In one example, the file security may define access to files, directories, volume resources, memory allocation, etc. derived from the application service model.","The security scheme may comprise a file resource management security. The file resource management security may define file size limitations (e.g., quotas on disk resources) derived from the application service model. In this manner, the application may not consume more disk resources than what was allocated to the application.","The security scheme may comprise an endpoint security. The endpoint security may restrict access to one or more network endpoints. For example, a bank application would be restricted from opening a port to a web page (e.g., a network endpoint) that is not associated with the bank application.","The security scheme may comprise a virtual account security. The virtual account security may restrict the application from accessing operating system specific operations and resources not specified in the application security model. This restricts the application from accessing privileged operations that may crash other applications within the operating system (e.g., the operating system of the virtual machine within which the application is to be instantiated).","The security scheme may comprise a process security (e.g., a job object). The process security, for example, may be derived from the resource allocation plan within the application service model. In one example, the process security may define memory restrictions, CPU limitations, and\/or access to global objects. Because more than one application may be instantiated within a virtual machine, respective applications within the virtual machine may have their own particular process security enforced upon them. In this manner, applications may not access other application's resources within the virtual machine environment (e.g., application A may be restricted from accessing memory and\/or network endpoints allocated to application B).","The security scheme may comprise an application security (e.g., code access security). The application security may be configured to restrict the application from accessing operating system resources and\/or executing particular privileged operations as specified in the application service model. In one example, the application security may define access to particular operating system resources and\/or may control privileges associated with the execution of particular APIs (e.g., the application security may control privileges associated with code executed in a common language runtime).","In addition to the foregoing, it may be appreciated that the security scheme may comprise other security techniques and\/or configurations that could be used, and that the claimed subject matter is generally intended to comprise the same. At , the security scheme may be applied to the network execution environment. At , the method ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","208","210","202","202","204","206","208","212","214","208","210"]},"In one example, the resource allocation plan  within the application service model  may describe memory allocation, CPU allocation, disk size allocations, and\/or other resource allocations. The application description  within the application service model  may describe what functionality the application may perform and\/or other services (e.g., a database) the application may access within the network environment (or outside of the network environment). The security component  may derive the restrictions  based upon resources and\/or functionality not allocated to the application within the resource allocation plan  and\/or the application description . For example, the application may be restricted from accessing services, disk files, network endpoints, etc. not associated with the application. The security component  may derive the limitations  based upon resource allocations and\/or functionality limitations within the resource allocation plan  and\/or application description  (e.g., the application is limited to 1 GB of memory, the application is limited to a specific CPU usage, etc.).","It may be appreciated that the application may be instantiated within a virtual machine, wherein the enforcement (e.g., applying the security scheme to the network environment) of the security scheme may be accomplished through a variety of security layers (e.g., operating system security, virtual machine security, network filter security, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","308","310","302","302","304","306","308","310","302","304","306"]},"In one example, the security scheme  may comprise a network filter security  (e.g., isolates resources of a virtual machine in which the application is to be instantiated), a virtual machine security  (e.g., define resource access of a virtual machine), an operating system security  (e.g., define access to operating system resources), a file security  (e.g., define access to files, directories, and volume resources), a file resource management security  (e.g., define file size limitations), an endpoint security  (e.g., define access to one or more network endpoints), a virtual account security  (e.g., restrict application from accessing operating system specific operations and resources not specified in the application security model), a process security  (e.g., define memory access, CPU limits, and global object access), an application security  (e.g., define access to particular APIs and\/or restrictions to particular resources), and\/or other security layers that may be applicable.

The security scheme  may comprise one or more security layers used to enforce the security scheme within the network environment (e.g., comprising the virtual machine  and the virtual machine ) within which the application is to be instantiated. For example, a file resource management security may be configured to limit the frontend of the application (bank website service) to 500 MB. A process security may be configured to limit the frontend of the application (bank website service) to 1 GB memory and restrict the frontend of the application to specific memory ranges. An endpoint security may be configured to restrict the frontend of the application from accessing network endpoints other than the bank web page. Security layers may define security for the backend of the application (bank database within the virtual machine ). The backend may also be configured to prevent anyone other than the front end from accessing it.
