{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to a launch system and more particularly to a launcher which eliminates the need for an inlet door for a supply of fluid for launch by using an alternatively configured fluid flow.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The current art for torpedo launch systems with a pressurizing pump have a \u201cU\u201d configuration where one end of the \u201cU\u201d is a flow intake, the bottom of the \u201cU\u201d contains the pump, and the other end of the \u201cU\u201d is the torpedo tube. To operate, the intake end of the launch system includes a large and complex hydraulically actuated door.","A prior art turbine pump ejection system (TPES)  is shown, by way of example, in  of the drawings. The turbine pump ejection system  includes an inlet door  opening to an inlet recess . The inlet recess  supplies seawater as the system fluid to an inlet cylinder  as a result of a turbine pump  drawing seawater into the inlet cylinder and pumping seawater into an impulse tank , through a slide valve , down a torpedo tube , through a shutterway recess , and out of the platform via a primary shutterway .","In operation, the inlet door , the slide valve , the primary shutterway  and a secondary shutterway  are opened to create an open flow path through the launch system .","Prior to launch, the pressure in the inlet recess  and the pressure in the shutterway recess  each independently increase to some fraction of the available dynamic head, as a result of forward motion of the system through the ocean. Any imbalance between the pressure in the inlet recess  and the shutterway recess  causes fluid in the launch system, and any device in the torpedo tube , to move.","When a launch is initiated, the turbine pump  begins to rotate and fluid is drawn though the inlet door , the inlet recess , the inlet cylinder  and into the turbine pump . The turbine pump  pumps fluid into the impulse tank , through the slide valve , down the torpedo tube  carrying the weapon in the torpedo tube through the shutterway recess  and out of the system  via the primary shutterway .","The following reference, for example, discloses an external fluid intake apart from the operating launch tube, but does not disclose an internally circulating fluid path which eliminates an inlet door.","Wosak (U.S. Pat. No. 2,837,971) discloses hydraulic ejection equipment for missiles. Specifically, the reference discloses a system having a water-filled cylinder communicating at one end with the sea and communicating at its other end, through ports in its walls and a passageway or conduit, with the aft end of a missile ejector tube whose fore or discharge end communicates with the sea. A piston is mounted for reciprocating movement in the water cylinder with the piston is connected to a suitable driving mechanism for moving the piston from its retracted position to force water ahead of the piston through the ports in the forward end of the water cylinder though the conduit connecting those ports with the aft end of the missile ejector tube thereby to charge the water into the ejector tube and behind the missile in the tube and in a sufficient amount and with sufficient force to expel the missile from the tube with a force and velocity.","It should be understood that the present invention would in fact enhance the functionality of the launching systems by providing a launcher design which eliminates the need for an intake door.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a launcher system with a fluid intake door eliminated as a component of the launcher.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a launcher system which provides a common path for fluid intake and vehicle exit.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a launcher which corrects reverse fluid flow in existing systems.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an inlet free launcher system including an inlet recess in fluid communication with a shutterway recess. A primary shutterway is provided both for ejection of a vehicle and for supplying fluid intake to the system. A pump selectively circulates fluid from the inlet recess to the shutterway recess, and a launch tube houses the vehicle, such as a weapon, within the system prior to launch thereof. A slide valve and impulse tank combination are positioned intermediate the pump and the launch tube, such that the slide valve controls a flow of fluid to the launch tube. A guide can is positioned in the shutterway recess for guiding the vehicle from the launch tube to an exterior of the launcher and fluid within the system is continually moderated to enable selective launch of the vehicle with a fluid force.","In general, the present invention eliminates the need for a conventional intake door by utilizing a D-shaped launcher  as shown in FIG. . The launcher  is referred to; hereinafter, as a shutterway intake launcher (SIL) because the fluid intake and the exit for a torpedo or an unmanned vehicle share the same communication path with the ambient underwater environment.","In further description, the overall structure of the shutterway intake launcher  includes an inlet recess  having recess communication holes  formed in a wall thereof. The inlet recess  supplies fluid to an inlet cylinder  upon actuation of a pump . The pump  pumps the fluid into an impulse tank , through a slide valve , down a launch tube , through a shutterway recess  and through a primary shutterway . A secondary shutterway is shown as component  in fluid communication with the other component of the launcher .","The recess communication holes  penetrate a wall of the inlet recess  which defines a corresponding wall  of the shutterway recess  such that the shutterway intake launcher  relies on the intake of fluid through either the primary shutterway  or the open secondary shutterway  due to the absence of an inlet door in the inlet recess . In other words and as will be described below, fluid collected in the shutterway recess  is supplied to the inlet recess  via the recess communication holes .","By way of general understanding, the launch tube  is the back of the \u201cD\u201d and the loop of the \u201cD\u201d is a recirculating water path containing the pump . In effect, the fluid intake and vehicle or torpedo exit share the same communication path with the ambient environment.","Several aspects of the invention have been examined using analytical and numerical techniques. Of primary interest is the impact of added mass and loss to the existing flow system. Based on the calculated results, it is estimated that there will be minimal changes to the operation of the turbine pump  and the basic dynamics of torpedo launch will be unaffected by the proposed system changes.","Continuing with the description, the shutterway intake launcher  operates by the intake of fluid through either the operating launch tube (primary shutterway ) or the open second shutterway  to compensate for the loss of fluid flow due to the absence of an inlet door. Furthermore, the shutterway intake launcher  operates largely free from pre-launch reverse flow (the system can be pressure-balanced as much as is possible without eliminating leakage flow), such that the launcher does not require an inlet door.","The functioning and operation of the shutterway intake launcher  is largely controlled by several performance related phenomenon. These phenomenon include changes in performance of the turbine pump  as a result of flow-path changes; effectiveness of pressure balancing due to a closed system operation; launch transient changes as a result of flow-path changes; changes in launch dynamics as a result of launch jet elimination; and changes in flex hose cable dynamics as a result of flow path changes.","The first four of the above phenomena are addressed by formulating a launch system performance model using first principle hydrodynamics concepts. The governing equations for such a model are: conservation of mass, applied at each location where flow streams converge; Newton's equation of motion applied for each fluid mass; Darcy's equation for flow loss applied across each flow restriction; Newton's equation of motion applied for the motion of the vehicle; and an experimental model for transient pump performance.","Although some simplifications are made regarding forces during these transient launch phases, they serve as a primary model for the shutterway intake launcher .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 through 6","b":["32","24","10"]},"Phases  and  are shown in FIG. . Phase  is the pre-launch phase of the operation of the shutterway intake launcher . During the pre-launch phase, the pump  is not actuated but the entire flow path is open. A dynamic head recovered in the shutterway recess  drives fluid through the launcher . Under these conditions, the pump  serves as a flow restriction and is not a source of energy. Other than this slight deviation, the system operates identically as it does in Phase  (description to follow) until the weapon  contacts the aft end of the torpedo tube or moves forward out of the launch tube .","Phase  is the initial acceleration of the vehicle . During this phase of the launch operation, the turbine pump  (see ) begins to increase speed. The head developed by the pump  is a function of the speed, the flow rate and the transient operating characteristics of the pump.  show the performance of the pump  as compared to known parameters.  are reflective as a guide to the head of the pump  versus speed input to the launch operation which determines the relationship between the pressure at points of the inlet cylinder  and the impulse tank .","In Equation (1), two fluid paths are considered. One path is directly from the launch tube  to the guide can  and one from the launch tube  to the shutterway recess  and then back to the launch tube .\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Conservation of mass is applied in the shutterway recess , and in the inlet recess . The rate of volume change (dV) of the shutterway recess  is equal to the flow (Q) out of the launch tube  and into the shutterway recess , less the flow out of the shutterway recess  and into the inlet recess  and the flow out of the shutterway recess  through the two open shutterways, i.e.: \n\n\nor in differential form\n\n\n","The rate of volume change (dV) of the shutterway recess  is incorporated to account for motion of the vehicle  out of the shutterway recess  and into a guide can . The rate of volume change may also be used to incorporate accumulator effects in the cavity. Leakage to other non-pressure hull regions in the forward end of the ship has been included. Conservation of mass must also be addressed in the guide can .","The flow at the intake of the pump  is equal to the sum of the flow through the inlet recess  and from the shutterway recess . In differential form this can be expressed:\n\n\n","The differential form, Equations (1) and (4), is useful when relating the flow rates to flow accelerations.","Flow through each portion of the shutterway intake launcher is controlled by the pressure (P) acting over that portion, the mass in the respective portion, and the loss through the portion. It can be shown that the flow rate (Q) from a starting point (A) to an end point (B) can be expressed as: \n\n","(P) is the pressure with the third term in this expression being the flow loss, which includes a loss coefficient k, the flow area A and the fluid density \u03c1. The fourth term is the flow acceleration, which includes the effective section length l, the flow area, and the fluid density. If the pipe sections between points A and B contain sections with different flow areas, effective loss and mass terms can be incorporated into Equation (5). The effective loss Kis given by \n\n\nand the effective mass Lis given by \n\n","All losses were referenced to a 21-inch diameter flow area.","Although Equations (6) and (7) are not standard expressions for loss and effective mass, they are useful forms for the current modeling effort. Equation (5) can be modified to include the effects of hull curvature and pressure recovery by adjusting the pressures as appropriate. The recovered pressure Pand hull pressure distribution is included through adjustment of the ambient pressures Pusing\n\n+\u00bd()\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nwhere Uis the boat speed and where the pressure recovery coefficient Cand pressure coefficient Cvary between the inlet recess  and shutterway recess . For simplicity of modeling, it is assumed that this pressure acts along the surface of the submarine hull.\n","If the instantaneous flow rates are known, the seven flow acceleration equations are generated using Equation (5), the three conservation of mass equations, Equations (1),(2) and (4), and the pump performance functions (derived from FIGS.  and ), form a set of equations which can be solved for the five unknown pressures and five unknown flow accelerations at a specific time during the launch transient. With the flow accelerations expressed in terms of the flow rates and pressures, the equations can be numerically integrated to develop a time history of internal pressures and flow rates during a launch.","A matrix formulation of the problem, Ax=B, is as follows on the successive pages: \n\n","One determination of the present invention is the assessment of the sensitivity of the shutterway intake launcher  to variations in the launcher loss coefficient. Consequently, the losses initially selected for the present invention serve as a design point only. The sensitivity of the performance of the shutterway intake launcher  to changes about the design point will drive further advances and modifications to the invention.","Phase , as shown in , is the initial device exit from the launch tube .","As the vehicle  begins to exit the launch tube , the effective mass of the section from the point of the launch tube  to the point of the shutterway recess  () begins to increase. To correct for this dynamic change, the first element in the 7row of the matrix in Equation (9) should be changed to read:\n\n\u2003\u2003(10)\n\nwhere A is the area and L is the length and \u03b4 is the distance which the vehicle protrudes from the launch tube .\n","The effective loss from the launch tube  to the shutterway recess  drops significantly during Phase  of the launch because there is no longer a sudden expansion of fluid. The drag on the nose of the protruding vehicle  produces a pressure drop of approximately one fourth of the sudden expansion losses.","The conservation of mass equations remain unchanged as the flow from the launch tube  is exactly matched by the displacement of the emerging vehicle .","Phase  is the motion of the vehicle  into the guide can  and is shown in FIG. . As the nose of the vehicle  leaves the shutterway recess  and enters the guide-can , rapid changes in the flow of the fluid in the shutterway intake launcher  must be accounted for through the conservation of mass equations.","As in Phase  of the launch operation, the effective mass of fluid between the launch tube  and the shutterway recess  continues to increase as the vehicle  travels through the launch tube . Equation 9 remains applicable during this phase of the launch operation.","The flow of fluid through the launch tube  to the shutterway recess  is now governed by the pressure difference between the launch tube  and the guide can  and the dynamic head produced by the motion of the vehicle . The pressure at the guide can  includes the effects of ship motion, shutterway pressure recovery, and transients of the shutterway intake launcher . The loads which arise due to motion of the vehicle  can be approximated using an effective drag coefficient of 0.25 and the internal flow rate of the launcher  to determine the vehicle speed.","The flow of fluid through the primary shutterway  is still driven by the pressure drop across that opening. However, the loss through that opening is increased substantially as a result of the presence of the exiting vehicle  as is the effective mass of the fluid in that region.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["32","28","32","34"],"sub":"0"},"The conservation of mass equations for the shutterway  are modified to account for the motion of the vehicle . As the vehicle  approaches and begins to enter the guide can , fluid is displaced from the primary shutterway . The fluid is either displaced into the shutterway recess  directly or flows along a path external to the ship and then enters the shutterway recess  via the secondary shutterway  as a leakage path or another leakage path. This fluid displacement or external flow takes place in a very short time and can result in unwanted acceleration of the vehicle . Equation 3 can be modified through the second derivative of the volume term to account for this acceleration.","The volume flux into the recesses can be described using \n\n\nand \n\n","The derivative of the rate of the volume flux is related to the velocity of the vehicle  by \n\n\nwhere ds\/dt is the velocity. Because the acceleration of the vehicle  is coupled to the pressures and flow rates of the shutterway intake launcher , (Equation 13) must be incorporated in the matrix solution (Equation 9). Suitably formulated equations are \n\n\nand \n\n","For this preliminary analysis, a 90 degree cone was assumed for the vehicle nose shape (to simplify calculation of A(s)).","Phase  is the motion of the vehicle  out of the guide can  and is shown in FIG. . Once the vehicle  has cleared the end of the launch tube , the dynamics of the launcher  revert to the dynamics of Phase  between the launch tube  and the shutterway recess . At this point, the motion dynamics of the vehicle  is no longer directly coupled with the internal flow of the launch system . The vehicle  decelerates based on the pressure difference between the external flow and the shutterway recess .","Phase  is the weapon clear and is not illustrated. As the vehicle  navigates the guide can  and the primary shutterway , additional transients are expected. However, due to the large areas and volumes at the exit of the primary shutterway , these transients will be ignored. The motion of the vehicle  is assumed to be uncoupled from the dynamics of the shutterway intake launcher  during this phase of the launching operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1","10","2","32","32"]},"Preliminary calculations regarding the shutterway intake launcher  indicate a similar tube exit velocity for both the baseline and modified systems. Added flow losses associated with the operation of the shutterway intake launcher  are small.","During operation of the shutterway intake launcher , the effective mass of the system is less than the effective mass of the system during an open loop operation. The water-hammer effect as the vehicle  enters the shutterway  can produce large accelerations and pressure transients in the shutterway intake launcher .","Because of the transient effects as the vehicle  enters the shutterway , either a means to reduce the added mass of the guide can  must be found or a depth independent accumulator system must be added to the shutterway intake launcher .","The added mass associated with the shutterway  can be reduced by either increasing the area of the inlet recess  or by shortening the path from the external flow to the shutterway recess . The path can be reduced by machining holes somewhere in the boundary between the shutterway recess  and the external flow. Holes already incorporated into the shutterways to reduce pressure recovery may provide the mass reduction needed.","The advantages of the shutterway intake launch system  include a solution to the reverse-flow problem, and the provision of a pressure-balanced system.","Alternatives to the concept presented herein include: An inlet door as a part of a launcher system with the lowest tubes in the submarine torpedo banks isolated from the upper tubes and also connected to the inlet chamber. As such the upper tubes can operate in a standard fashion (drawing water through the inlet door) and the lower tubes can be operated as the shutterway intake launcher concept. Further, an accumulator can be added to the system to eliminate any water hammer effects.","This invention has been disclosed in terms of certain embodiments.
