title: Viewable and actionable search results
abstract: Search results can be viewed and acted upon. Searches may be conducted using a search input in conjunction with a selected category. The search results may be produced from such a search. One or more of the produced search results may be highlighted for previewing. Along with the preview, available actions are presented that are based on the selected category. A user can initiate an action of the available actions. The initiated action is then performed with respect to the highlighted search result(s).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Introduction","Example Environments for Viewable and Actionable Search Results","Example Implementations for Viewable and Actionable Search Results","Example Device Implementations for Viewable and Actionable Search Results"],"p":["The internet contains a wealth of information. In fact, the types of information are so varied and the amount of information is so great that it is difficult to find information without using some kind of search tool. Search tools are powered by search engines that may operate differently. For example, searches may be based on key word search targets. The returned search results often differ from one search engine to another depending on the mechanism employed to crawl the internet and to index the information that is encountered during the crawling.","Regardless of the underlying search engine that is used, search results are usually returned by search engines in a listing format. To peruse the search results, a user clicks on each individual search result that appears to be promising. If the user determines that the search result is ultimately not relevant, the user returns (e.g., backs up) to the search results and clicks on another promising individual search result. The process continues until a helpful search result is actually discovered.","Search results can be viewed and acted upon. Searches may be conducted using a search input in conjunction with a selected category. The search results may be produced from such a search. One or more of the produced search results may be highlighted for previewing. Along with the preview, available actions are presented that are based on the selected category. A user can initiate an action of the available actions. The initiated action is then performed with respect to the highlighted search result(s).","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Moreover, other method, system, scheme, apparatus, device, media, procedure, API, arrangement, etc. implementations are described herein.","As described above, search results are usually returned by search engines in a listing format. To peruse the search results, a user clicks on each individual search result that appears to be promising. The search result is then displayed in a different browser window or in place of the search result listing. If the user determines that the search result is actually not relevant, the user returns (e.g., backs up) to the browser window with the search results listing and clicks on another promising individual search result. The process continues until a helpful search result is discovered.","Once a helpful search result is discovered, the user must open another window of a browser and\/or of another application in order to perform some action on or with the helpful search result. For example, a messenger program or an email program must be launched to send or mail the search result to a buddy or other contact. At least another window must be opened to blog the search result. Furthermore, to search emails, an email program that is separate from a browser program must be launched. In short, the conventional search experience is separate from other services that may be utilized on a computer.","In contrast, certain described implementations for viewable and actionable search results integrate different services and a search function. For example, search results for the web, for emails, for shopping, for news, etc. may be displayed for the same search input merely be changing category. To view a given search result item, the corresponding search result may be highlighted in a search results listing. The given search result is then previewed. To facilitate performing some action with respect to the previewed search result, available actions that depend on a selected category are presented for the previewed search result. Thus, actions that pertain to web search results are presented for a previewed web search result item, actions that pertain to a mail search results are presented for a previewed mail search result item, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","102","108","106","110","102","114","106","116"]},"Although only a single server  and service provider  are explicitly illustrated in environment , multiple service providers  may exist, each with multiple servers . Similarly, although only a single client  and user  are shown, there may be multiple such clients  and\/or users  that are being served by one or more servers . Server  and client  include processing and media resources that are sufficient to perform their respect functions as described herein. Example device hardware, software, etc. for a server  and\/or a client  are described herein below with particular reference to .","Server  and client  communicate over network . Network  may be any given network or combination of networks. Examples include, but are not limited to, the Internet, a telephone network, a cable network, a local or wide area network (LAN or WAN), a wireless or wired network, some combination thereof, and so forth. However, in a described implementation, network  comprises at least the internet, and more specifically, the world wide web (WWW) portion of the internet.","Service provider module  is capable of providing one or more services  over network . Examples of such services include, but are not limited to, web search (), email (), instant messaging (IM) (), news (), shopping (), web log (), productivity (), authentication () . . . other services (s), and so forth. Web log services () may include those services that enable a user  to create a web log (or blog). Productivity services () may include applications such as word processing, spread sheets, financial planning and analysis, audio\/visual presentation development, some combination thereof, and so forth.","Authentication services () may include services relating to proving that a person has certain access rights through, e.g., identification (ID) and password regimes. Other examples may include providing cryptographic services and\/or evaluation of login ID and other identifying data (e.g., a finger print, an iris scan, etc.). Other services (s) represents other possible web-based services, such as those for entertainment, art, and so forth.","In a described implementation, service provider module , which executes on server , stores the data and performs the processing in order to provide services . Accordingly, client  can optionally be a relatively light-weight device with minimal processing and storage capabilities. UI module  executes on client  and presents a UI to user  on behalf of service provider module  in order to provide one or more services . The basics of an example UI are described below with particular reference to .","Although example implementations of viewable and actionable search results are described herein primarily in terms of a paradigm in which the server is responsible for the majority of the computing, viewable and actionable search results may be realized in alternative implementations. For example, client  may have significant processing, storage, and communications capabilities such that a server  is not involved, at least for services  that may be fully or partially self-hosted at client . For instance, client  may search stored emails and blogs without interaction across network . Cooperation, interaction, and division of computing responsibilities between server  and client  may also be realized anywhere along a continuum having one end in which server  is primarily responsible for the computing and having another end in which client  is primarily responsible for the computing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","216","222","222","200","202","202","110"]},"As illustrated, program window  includes a top-level menu bar , a location indicator bar , a category area , a search input area , an information depth selector , and a search results area . The illustrated example menu components of the top-level menu bar  are: File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools, and Help. However, more, fewer, or different menu components may alternatively be present on the top-level menu bar , especially depending on the underlying program. The location indicator bar , if included, has a dual purpose. First, it can be used to input a desired target location that is local or across a network. Second, it presents the location with which communication is currently established.","Category area  includes multiple categories . The illustrated example categories  are: web, images, news, feeds, mail, local, shopping, spaces, and sample category. Respective categories  may correspond to one or more services  (of ). For example, web  may correspond to web search (), mail  may correspond to email (), shopping  may correspond to shopping (), spaces  may correspond to web log (), and so forth. Categories  may also be separate from services  that are provided by service provider module . For instance, category local  may be directed to information stored locally at client .","Categories  may be displayed as part of UI  in any of a variety of manners. They may simply be listed like the text of a menu bar. They may be represented as press-able buttons. They may be realized as tabs. Other manners may alternatively be implemented. Also, although categories  are illustrated as being represented by text, they may alternatively be represented by an icon (e.g., an envelope for mail, a bag for shopping, etc.) or by both text and an icon.","A category  of category area  may be selected as indicated by selection highlighting indicator . Although selection highlighting indicator  is shown as a ring formed from a dashed line, selection can be indicated in alternative manners. Example alternative selection highlighting indication manners include, but are not limited to, visual brightening, inverse video, changing a background color or hue, having a button look depressed, having a tab be moved to the top, adding a check mark, some combination thereof, and so forth.","Desired selection may be indicated by a user  in any of a variety of manners. First, selection may be indicated with keyboard commands (e.g., <Tab> key presses and then <Enter>). Second, selection may be indicated with letters representing particular categories  (e.g., by pressing the underlined letter along with the <Alt> key). Third, selection may be indicated with a pointer device (e.g., by moving a cursor icon in proximity to a desired category  and clicking). These selection indication mechanisms may be combined, and\/or other alternatives may also be implemented.","Search input area  enables the input of search terms. As illustrated, it includes a box for search term input and a button to activate the search. The example search term input is \u201cTerms XYZ\u201d. Search results area  includes the search results  of the search term input. Generally, search results area  includes \u201cr\u201d search results ()-(r), with \u201cr\u201d being some integer. Specifically, as illustrated, it includes search result # (), search result # (), search result # (), search result # (), search result # () . . . search result #r (r). Although search results  are displayed vertically in UI , they may be displayed in an alternative arrangement. Examples of such alternative arrangements include, but are not limited to, multiple columns, one or more rows, a grid, and so forth.","Information depth selector  enables a user  to select the amount or depth of information that is displayed for each search result . As illustrated, information depth selector  is a slider bar . Slider bar  includes a pointer arrow that may be slid by a user to a number of different positions. Sliding the pointer arrow completely leftward causes search results  to be displayed in a relatively minimal format. Sliding the pointer arrow completely rightward causes search results  to be displayed in a relatively maximal format. There are intermediate positions in between the two. In an example implementation, the displayed search results  may be changed in response to sliding the pointer arrow without re-running the search (i.e., all of the data that would be displayed in a maximal format is initially retrieved but may not be initially displayed).","An example relatively minimal format may include the title of a corresponding search result item and an identifier (e.g., a network location) thereof. An example of a relatively maximal format may include for the corresponding search result item: the title, the network location, some initial text of the item, text around the words of the search terms, an image, and statistical information about the item. However, the maximal, the minimal, and the intermediate formats may include more, less, and\/or different information.","Although information depth selector  is specifically illustrated as a slider bar , it may be realized with a different mechanism. For example, information depth selector  may be realized as a set of radio-style buttons. Also, a slider bar, a set of buttons, or another information depth selector mechanism may include detailed icons or text that describe or otherwise indicate the amount of information provided for each setting.","As illustrated, UI  presents category area  between search input area  and search results area  (e.g., below the former and above the latter). In a described implementation, category area  is presented after an input search term is entered, and a search is activated on the search term at search input area . However, category area  may alternatively also be presented prior to a search activation. Although category area  may be presented in a different location presenting it proximate to search results area  facilitates user access and interactivity when switching the selected category .","In a described implementation, the selected category , as visually represented by selection highlighter indicator , determines the context for a requested search. If the images category  is selected, the input search term \u201cTerms XYZ\u201d is applied to, for example, a database or index of data, that pertains to images. If the mail category  is selected, then the input search term \u201cTerms XYZ\u201d is applied to information pertaining to mail.","When a category selection is changed in category area , search results  that are displayed in search results area  are likewise changed. In other words, the output search results  for a search input of \u201cTerms XYZ\u201d are changed. For example, search results  from the images category  are replaced by search results  from the mail category  when selection highlighter indicator  is moved from \u201cImages\u201d to \u201cMail\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","222","3","302","308","300","1","222","1","222","222","3","116","304"]},"Selection of a search result  in search results area  may be effected in the same manners as, or in similar manners to, those described above with particular reference to  for selecting a category  from category area . Likewise, the highlighting of selection highlighted indicator  for a search result  may be realized in the same manners as or in similar manners to those described above for the highlighting of selection highlighted indicator  for a category .","In a described implementation, pane  enables selected search result(s)  to be previewed. Because search result # () has been selected as represented by selection highlighted indicator , the item corresponding to the selected search result # is displayed at . The displayed item  may include text, images, video, some combination thereof, and so forth, depending on the selected category  as well as the content of the particular item .","Although less than all of the material of item  may be displayed, UI  displays as much of a full version of item  as is capable of being displayed in pane  as governed by space limitations. Pane  may be capable of being sized and\/or scrolled. Sizing and\/or scrolling the overall program window  may also change the amount of item  that is displayed within pane .","Pane  also includes an available actions area A. Available actions area A includes actions that are available to be initiated with respect to the previewed item  that corresponds to the selected search result # (). Available actions area A may be part of or merely proximate to pane . They may be present at all times when search functions are being utilized or when a particular search result  has been selected. Available actions area A may also be presented anywhere within program window  (including anywhere on a computing \u201cdesktop\u201d), but proximity to pane  tends to provide context and user convenience.","In a described implementation, the actions that are made available in available actions area A are category-sensitive. In other words, the actions that a user  may initiate for a displayed preview item  depend on the category  that is selected as represented by selection highlighted indicator  in category area . Thus, a UI module , possibly in conjunction with a service provider module , presents available actions area A based on a selected category  of category area .","The available actions are actions that relate to items that would be found in a search with regard to the selected category. For example, available actions presented in available actions area A when the mail category  is selected relate to mail items actions, such as reply, forward, and so forth. Other example available actions for example categories  are described further herein below with particular reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","222","3","402","308","400","404","404"]},"In UI , a user  has selected search result # () as represented by selection highlighted indicator . Although other mechanisms such as keyboarding and pointing-and-clicking may be employed, in his example selection of a search result  has been effectuated based on proximity with pointer icon . More specifically, selection may be effected merely by roll-over of a search result  by pointer icon . (Roll-over by pointer icon  may also be used to select a category .)","When previewing search results  with a pop-up overlay, pop-up overlay  is displayed as part of UI  upon selection of a search result . In UI , pop-up overlay  is displayed as touching or at least proximate to the selected search result (), but another location within program window  may alternatively be chosen.","In a described implementation, pop-up overlay  includes a displayed preview of the item  corresponding to the selected search result #. Pop-up overlay  also includes an available actions area B that presents actions that may be initiated by a user  for performance with respect to the displayed item . The actions of available actions area B are based on the category  that is selected in category area  as represented by selection highlighted indicator . In other words, the actions in available actions area A for pane  may be the same as the actions in available actions area B for pop-up overlay  if the selected category is the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","222","2","222","5","302","308","500","116","216","208","218","222","1","222","214","500","116","222","2","222","2","3","222","3","4","222","4","5","222","5","304"]},"These four selected search results #-# ()-() are reflected in pane . The four items (), (), (), and () that correspond to the four selected search results (), (), (), and (), respectively, are displayed in pane . In this example, when multiple items  are previewed in pane , each item  is displayed in a thumbnail format. However, other display formats may alternatively be used.","An available actions area C is also presented. The actions of available actions area C are based on the selected category . Hence, in the example of UI , the actions of available actions area C depend on which actions are relevant for items that are found from a search of the selected \u201cSample Category\u201d .","The available actions in available actions area C may be adjusted as compared to those of available actions area A or B because certain actions may not be simultaneously applicable to the multiple items ()-() that are previewed in pane . However, for those actions that are simultaneously applicable to the multiple items ()-() that are previewed in pane , initiation of an action from available actions area C by a user  causes the initiated action to be performed with respect to each of the multiple items ()-(). For example, for four web page items  that are displayed in pane , the initiation of a bookmarking action causes all four web page items  to be added to a favorites folder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["600","222","3","302","308","216","600","300","216","600","216","218","306","216"]},"Accordingly, the illustrated actions of available. actions area A* are specifically related to items pertaining to the web. The illustrated example actions include: send, bookmark, highlight, and blog this. As represented in UI  by the downward-pointing triangular symbol, additional options can be made available to user  that relate to sending the previewed item *. In this case, the additional options may relate to a destination and\/or a mode for sending the previewed item *.","The presented actions of the available actions areas  may be presented visually as a drop-down menu, as press-able buttons, as some combination thereof, and so forth.

Table  specifically includes examples for a web category, a mail category, and a shopping category. The associated available actions  for a selected web category  are: send to contact, bookmark, highlight, blog it, and so forth. The associated available actions  for a selected mail category  are: reply, delete, move to, forward to instant message buddy, and so forth.

For example, a UI  may be presented to a user . At block , a category selection is received. The initial category selection may be from user  or a programmatically based on a default initial selection. For example, a category  may be selected as represented by selection highlighted indicator .","At block , a search input is received. For example, search terms may be received at a search input area . At block , the search is performed using the search input in conjunction with the selected category. For example, the input search terms may be applied to a database and\/or index of data that is directed to the selected category. At block , the search results are displayed. For example, search results  in accordance with the selected category  may be displayed in a search results area .","At block , it is detected if a search result is highlighted. For example, it may be detected if at least one search result  is highlighted by user  as represented by selection highlighted indicator . If not, then at block  the operational module can determine if the search input is changed or if the selected category is changed. Either change can cause a different set of search results  to be displayed. Otherwise, the operational module continues to await detection of highlighting of a search result (at block ).","If, on the other hand, it is detected that a search result is highlighted (at block ), then at block  a preview of the highlighted search result is displayed. For example, a preview of an item  corresponding to a highlighted search result  may be displayed in a pane , or in a pop-up overlay , or in another display format.","At block , available actions are presented in association with the previewed search result, with the available actions being based on the selected category. For example, category-dependent actions may be presented in available actions area  for a pane , or a pop-up overlay , and so forth.","At block , it is detected if user input initiates an action of the presented available actions. If not, then at block  the operational module continues monitoring for changes to the search input, the selected category, the highlighted search result(s), and so forth. Possible detection of action initiation at block  is also continued.","If, on the other hand, user initiation of an action is detected (at block ), then at block  the initiated action is performed with respect to the previewed search result.
