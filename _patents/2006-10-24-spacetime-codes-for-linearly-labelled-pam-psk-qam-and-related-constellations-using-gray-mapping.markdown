title: Space-time codes for linearly labelled PAM, PSK, QAM and related constellations using gray mapping
abstract: General algebraic space-time code constructions are presented for Gray-mapped 2-PSK, 2-PAM, and 4-QAM constellations. The space-time codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoffâ€”i.e., they allow the transmission of information at the maximum rate possible for the given signaling constellation and the achieved transmit diversity level. New codes created by applying a nonsingular linear or affine transformation to the constellation labels retain the optimality of the original codes with respect to the rate-diversity tradeoff. Extensions to p-PSK, p-PAM, p-QAM, and related constellations, for p prime, are also given.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of space-time codes for linearly labelled constellations, and more particularly, to a method, system, and computer program product for constructing space-time codes for linearly labelled constellations using Gray mapping.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recent advances in coding theory include space-time codes which provide diversity in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems over fading channels with channel coding across a small number of transmit antennas. For wireless communication systems, a number of challenges arise from the harsh RF propagation environment characterized by channel fading and co-channel interference (CCI). Channel fading can be attributed to diffuse and specular multipath, while CCI arises from reuse of radio resources. Interleaved coded modulation on the transmit side of the system and multiple antennas on the receive side are standard methods used in wireless communication systems to combat time-varying fading and to mitigate interference. Both are examples of diversity techniques.","Simple transmit diversity schemes (in which, for example, a delayed replica of the transmitted signal is retransmitted through a second, spatially-independent antenna and the two signals are coherently combined at the receiver by a channel equalizer) have also been considered within the wireless communications industry as a method to combat multipath fading. From a coding perspective, such transmit diversity schemes amount to repetition codes and encourage consideration of more sophisticated code designs. Information-theoretic studies have demonstrated that the capacity of multi-antenna systems significantly exceeds that of conventional single-antenna systems for fading channels. The challenge of designing channel codes for high capacity multi-antenna systems has led to the development of \u201cspace-time codes,\u201d in which coding is performed across the spatial dimension (e.g, antenna channels) as well as time.","Space-time codes are designed for MIMO communication systems that employ multiple transmit antennas to achieve spatial diversity. The modulated code words are often presented as complex-values M\u00d7T matrices in which the (m,t)-th entry sm,t represents the discrete baseband signal transmitted from the m-th transmit antenna at time t. The initial work on space-time codes by Guey et al. and Tarokh et al. showed that the transmit diversity achieved by a space-time code is equal to the minimum rank among the set of matrices produced as differences between distinct modulated code words. There is a tradeoff between achievable transmission rate and achievable transmit diversity level for space-time codes. Full-rank space-time codes can achieve transmission rates no greater than one symbol per transmission interval. For rank d space-time codes, the maximum transmission rate is M\u2212d+1 symbols per transmission interval. Equivalently, the size of an M\u00d7T rank-d space-time code cannot exceed qT(M\u2212d+1), where q is the size of the signaling constellation. Codes meeting this upper limit are referred to as maximal.","Let C be a linear error-correcting code of length MT, with M\u2266T, over the discrete alphabet \u03a9. The code words of C are presented as M\u00d7T matrices in which the (m,t)-th entry a\u03b5\u03a9 represents the information symbol that is modulated and transmitted from the m-th transmit antenna at transmission interval t. If all of the modulated code word matrices have rank at least d over , then the space-time code is called an M\u00d7T rank-d code. In the special case that all of the modulated code words are of full rank M, the space-time code is called an M\u00d7T full-rank code. There is a tradeoff between achievable transmission rate and achievable transmit diversity level as dictated by the Singleton Bound. For rank d space-time codes, the maximum transmission rate is M\u2212d+1 symbols per transmission interval.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,678,263, Hammons and El Gamal developed the so-called binary rank criteria that allowed, for the first time, the algebraic design of space-time codes achieving maximal spatial diversity of all orders. From the binary rank criteria, they developed the general stacking construction for full-diversity space-time codes, examples of which include block codes derived from Galois fields and rings and rate 1\/M convolutional codes of optimal d. The binary rank criteria showed that the algebraically-designed, full-rank, BPSK-modulated space-time codes could be lifted to full-rank, QPSK-modulated space-time codes. In particular, Hammons and El Gamal showed that, if the linear binary codes A and B produce full-rank space-time codes when BPSK modulated, then the quaternary code C=A+2B produces a full-rank space-time code under QPSK modulation. They referred to this construction as the dyadic construction.","Building on the Hammons-El Gamal framework, Lu and Kumar showed that the dyadic construction extends to 2-PSK modulation in the natural way\u2014i.e., if the linear binary codes A, A, . . . , Aproduce full-rank space-time codes under BPSK modulation, then the 2-ary code",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\ud835\udc9e","mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mn":"2","mi":"i"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["\ud835\udc9c","i"]}}}}}},"br":{},"sup":["m","m","m","m","K","K","K"]},"In U.S. Pat. No. 6,678,263, Hammons and El Gamal showed also that the BPSK and QPSK space-time code constructions admit certain binary transformations that preserve the rank properties of the modulated space-time codes.","In this application, it is shown that similar results apply to the Lu\/Kumar basic constructions for 2-PSK, 2-PAM, and 4-QAM space-time codes. In particular, this refinement provides new algebraic space-time codes that are suitable for use when, as in the usual practice, Gray mapping is used to label the signaling constellations.","This invention shows how to construct space-time codes for 2-PAM, 2-PSK, and 4-QAM modulation that are suitable for different labelings of the constellation points. One way this is done is by introducing transformation into basic space-time code constructions by Lu\/Kumar. Details of the new construction are set forth below. The present invention, as set forth herein, establishes that any linear transformation will preserve the codes' optimal rate-vs-diversity properties. Explicit transformations are given to produce new codes suitable for Gray labeled 2-PAM, 2-PSK, and 4-QAM.","Referring to , by way of an example, a conventional digital cellular Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DSCDMA) base-station-to-mobile-station (or forward) link  is shown using a conventional convolutional encoder and Viterbi decoder.  also illustrates the mobile-station-to-base-station (or reverse) link.","At the transmit end, the system  in  comprises a data segmentation and framing module  where user information bits are assembled into fixed length frames from transmit data blocks . The N bits per frame are input to the base station's convolutional encoder  of rate r, which produces N\/r code symbols at the input of the channel interleaver . The channel interleaver  performs pseudo-random shuffling of code symbols, and outputs the re-arranged symbols to the spread spectrum modulator . The spread spectrum modulator  uses a user-specific transmit PN-code generator  to produce a spread spectrum signal which is carried on a RF carrier to the transmitter , where a high power amplifier coupled to the transmit antenna  radiates the signal to the base station. The techniques of spread spectrum modulation and RF transmission are well known art to one familiar with spread spectrum communications systems.","The signal received at the mobile station antenna  is amplified in the RF receiver  and demodulated by the spread spectrum demodulator , which uses the same PN-code generator  as used by the base station transmitter to de-spread the signal. The demodulated symbols are de-interleaved by the channel de-interleaver  and input to the Viterbi decoder . The decoded information bits are reconstructed using data block reconstruction  into receive data blocks  and forwarded to the data terminal equipment at the receive end.","With reference to , a digital cellular base-station-to-mobile-station link is shown to illustrate the implementation of space-time encoding and decoding in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. While CDMA system is used as an example, one familiar with the art would consider the present invention applicable to other types of wireless systems, which can employ other types of multiple access methods such as frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and hybrid methods.","Transmit data blocks  from the data terminal equipment are segmented and framed  into fixed frame length and applied to the mobile's channel space-time encoder . The output from a channel encoder  is fed to the space-time formatter  which determines the parsing (allocation and presentation order) of the coded symbols to the various transmit antennas , , . The spatial formatter output is applied to the spread spectrum modulator  which uses a user specific PN-code generator  to create spread spectrum signals, carried on a RF carrier via base RF transmitter , to the mobile station transmitter. The transmitter, with high power amplifier coupled to the Transmit antenna, radiates the signals via separate transmit antennas to the mobile station.","The signal received at one or more mobile station antenna(s)  is amplified in the mobile RF receiver  and demodulated in a phase shift keying demodulator , which uses the same PN-code generator  as used by the base station transmitter, to de-spread the signal. The demodulated symbols are processed at space-time decoder  by the space-time de-formatter  and input to the channel decoder . The decoded information bits are reconstructed  into receive data blocks  and forwarded to the data terminal equipment at the receive end. Depending on the space-time code used, the de-formatter  and the decoder  can be grouped in a single maximum likelihood receiver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["90","92","94","90","96","58","98","100","102","102","102","104","106"],"i":["a","b","c"]},"With continued reference to , the source generates k information symbols from a discrete alphabet X on the path  which are encoded by an error control code C by the space-time encoder . The space-time encoder  produces code words of length N over the symbol alphabet Y. The encoded symbols are mapped by the modulators , , , and so on, onto constellation points from a discrete, complex-valued signaling constellation for transmission across the channel. The modulated radio frequency signals for all of the L transmit antennas , , , and so on, are transmitted at the same time to the receiver space-time demodulator . The space-time channel decoder  decodes the signals to the received data path . As shown, the receiver provides M receive antennas to collect the incoming transmissions. The received baseband signals are subsequently decoded by the space-time decoder .","The present invention is concerned primarily with the design of space-time codes rather than the signal processing required to decode them. In most cases, the decoding employs known signal processing for maximum likelihood detection.","In the following discussion, notation is established and certain key ideas of the Lu-Kumar approach, upon which the novel space-time code constructions of the present invention are built, are explained. Following the discussion of the Lu-Kumar approach, new constructions of space-time codes for applying linear and affine transformations to the space-time code constructions proposed by Lu and Kumar, in accordance with the present invention, are described. As described, the proper choice of transformation yields new algebraic space-time codes that are compatible with Gray labelling.","We consider algebraic space-time code design based on the ring [\u03b8] of algebraic integers with \u03b8 a complex root of unity. The connection between modulated space-time codes, with entries from [\u03b8]\u2282, and binary codes over ={0, 1} is through the isomorphism [\u03b8]\/(1\u2212\u03b8)\u2245.

is labelled. In this section, we show that the proper choice of \u03c4 enables the use of Gray labelling, which is common practice for these constellations.","For 2-PSK and 2-PAM, the constellation points have a natural ordering with parameterization by the integers L=0, 1, 2, . . . , 2\u22121. For 2-PSK, the L-th constellation point is s=\u03b8; for 2-PAM, s=2L\u2212(2\u22121). Therefore, it is natural to assign K-bit labels to these constellation points by labelling swith the binary expansion of L. Since 4-QAM consists of two 2-PAM constellations in quadrature, its natural labelling is the cross product of the constituent PAM labellings.","For signaling purposes, however, the natural labelling is usually not optimal. Over typical channels, the predominant symbol errors at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios are those in which the transmitted constellation point is mistaken for one of its adjacent neighbors. Under these conditions, the demodulated bit error rate depends asymptotically on the distribution of Hamming distances between labels of adjacent constellation points. The usual practice is to label 2-PSK, 2-PAM, and 4-QAM constellations using a Gray mapping. A Gray mapping is a function that maps the natural constellation labels to a new set having the property that all adjacent labels differ in exactly one bit position. With Gray labelling, the demodulated bit error rate will then be asymptotically equal to the symbol error rate.","Consider the transformation \u03b6: \u2192in which the natural label b. . . bbis mapped to the new label a. . . aa, with",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0078"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00015","num":"00015"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["a","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["b","k"]},{"mi":"b","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"\u2295"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["if","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1"}],"mo":"<"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"b","mrow":{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["if","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1."}],"mo":"="}}]}]}}}}},"br":{},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00041","he":"3.13mm","wi":"2.12mm","file":"US07675990-20100309-P00003.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}},"sup":["K","\u22121 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0079"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00016","num":"00016"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["b","k"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":["i","k"],"mo":"="},{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["a","i"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"mod","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["if","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1"}],"mo":"<"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"a","mrow":{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["if","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mi":"K","mo":"-","mn":"1."}],"mo":"="},"mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}]}]}}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0015","list-style":"none"},"li":"Corollary 8 Let A be a linear binary maximal rank d code, and let \u03c4=\u03b6be the inverse Gray mapping.
