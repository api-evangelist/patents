title: Adjustable body bias circuit
abstract: Body biasing circuit and methods are implemented in a variety of different instances. One such instance involves placing, a first well of a first body bias island and a second well of a second body bias island in a first bias mode by controlling switches of a body bias switch circuit. The biasing is one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias. The second well is also biased according to one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias. In response to the bias-mode input, the first well of the first body bias island and the second well of the second body bias island are each placed in a second bias mode by controlling switches of the body bias switch circuit. The bias of the first well and second well can be changed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The often competing goals of high-performing and low-power design solutions can require complex architectural and circuit optimizations to the circuit design. Power and performance tradeoffs can require difficult design choices. Body biasing (BB) of semiconductor circuits facilitates tuning functionality, which can improve circuit parameters such as speed, power consumption or leakage. BB can also be used for compensating process-dependent performance spread by tuning after the integrated chip (IC) has been manufactured.","There are tradeoffs to body biasing depending upon the bias that is applied. Forward body biasing (FBB) will generally increase the performance of digital circuits at a penalty of increased leakage. FBB can extend the scaling limit of bulk-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) due to improved short-channel effects. Reverse body biasing (RBB) will generally reduce the leakage power at the cost of a lower circuit speed. RBB offers higher leakage savings for a given performance penalty than non-minimum channel length transistors, reduced VDD or the stack effect in 70 nm CMOS.","While BB can be an attractive silicon tuning technique for achieving better design specifications and increased circuit robustness in modern bulk CMOS technologies, complex integrated circuits can include multiple different circuit portions, each portion having different tuning requirements. Moreover, the desired performance characteristics of a circuit can change during use of the circuit.","Various example embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to body biasing solutions, and to addressing various challenges, including those discussed above.","According to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, two body bias islands (BBIs), each containing at least one respective well, are body biased according to a first mode. The body biasing is then changed to accommodate a second mode. The body biasing can be provided from a body biasing voltage source (e.g., forward voltage supply, reverse voltage supply or nominal voltage sources), and in at least one of the modes, the voltage source can be shared between the two wells.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward a circuit-based apparatus that includes a first body bias island that is configured to allow a body bias to be applied to at least a first well. A second body bias island is configured to provide body bias to at least a second well.","A body bias switch circuit is configured and arranged to operate in different modes in response to a bias-mode input. The different modes involve control of switches connected to the first well and the second well. A first mode places both the first well and the second well into a first bias condition that includes, for each of the first and second wells, one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias. A second mode places the first well and the second well into a second bias condition that includes, for the first well, a different one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias.","According to other embodiments of the present disclosure, a method includes placing, in response to a bias-mode input, a first well of a first body bias island and a second well of a second body bias island in a first bias mode by controlling switches of a body bias switch circuit.","The first well is biased using one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias. The second well is biased using one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias. In response to the bias-mode input, the first well of the first body bias island and the second well of the second body bias island are placed in a second bias mode by controlling switches of the body bias switch circuit. The second bias mode involves changing the body bias of the first well using another of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias and controlling the body bias the second well.","Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward a body bias switch circuit configured and arranged to operate in different modes in response to a bias-mode input. The different modes involve control of switches connected to a first well in a first body bias island and a second well in a second body bias island. A first mode places each of the first well and the second well into a first bias condition that includes, for each of the first and second wells, one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias. A second mode places each of the first well and the second well into a second bias condition that includes, for the first well, a different one of a reverse body bias, a nominal body bias and a forward body bias.","The above discussion is not intended to describe each embodiment or every implementation of the present disclosure. The figures and following description also exemplify various embodiments.","While the disclosure is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the disclosure to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the disclosure is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosure, including aspects defined in the claims.","The present disclosure is believed to be applicable to a variety of different types of circuits, devices and systems for and\/or involving body biasing of circuit components, including but not necessarily limited to N-wells and\/or P-wells, to improve various functional aspects of circuit components located in the circuit components. While the present disclosure is not necessarily limited in this context, various aspects of the disclosure may be appreciated through a discussion of related examples.","While aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward conventional bulk-CMOS technology with N-wells or P-wells, the disclosure is not necessarily so limited. For instance, the architectural concepts and related methodology discussed herein can be used in connection with silicon-on-insulator- (SOI) CMOS technology or other technologies where there might not be an N-well or P-well. For instance, a SOI-CMOS device can use partially-depleted SOI technology and have a transistor body. Body biasing can be applied to such an SOI device by contacting the bodies of individual transistors through well contacts. Other technologies include double-, multi- or FinFet technologies, where there are no N-wells, P-wells or contacts to the transistor body. Instead, body biasing can be done by using one of the transistor gates for V(threshold voltage) modulation while the other gate is used for the normal signaling.","Body biasing (BB) is a technique that enables the adaptation of the threshold voltages of MOS devices after the integrated circuit has been manufactured. For traditional CMOS devices, control is provided by changing the N-well and, or P-well voltage potentials, the voltage between the device's body and source, e.g., VBS. The dependency between VBS and the NMOS transistor threshold voltage Vis:\n\n+\u03b3(\u221a{square root over (2\u03c6)}\u2212\u221a{square root over (2\u03c6)})\n","where Vis the technology-dependent threshold voltage, \u03b3 is the body factor or body coefficient, and 2\u03c6is the surface potential at strong inversion. The relationship between Vand Vis non-linear. Moreover, the value of \u03b3 determines the sensitivity of BB for Vcontrol. As an example, consider the case of an NMOS device. The Vincreases when the body-to-source potential (V=Vin CMOS circuits) is negatively biased. This is referred to as reverse body biasing (RBB). Alternatively, the Vdecreases when the body-to-source potential is positively biased. This is referred to as forward body biasing (FBB). The same holds for PMOS devices, however, the voltage potential is of opposite polarity (V=V\u2212Vin CMOS circuits).","Thus, FBB reduces the threshold voltage (V) of the transistors, thereby increasing on-current, and in its turn, circuit speed. Unfortunately, transistor leakage is also increased under FBB as a result of the reduced V. This is not as large of an issue where the circuit is actively switching states because the switching\/dynamic power often becomes the largest portion of the total power consumption in the circuit under this condition.","RBB lowers the NMOS transistor body voltage as compared to its source voltage, and\/or raises the PMOS transistor body voltage as compared to its source voltage. In this way, RBB increases the Vof transistors, and thus reduces leakage; however, this advantage generally results in a slower switching speed, making it undesirable for active high-speed circuits. RBB can therefore achieve significant power reductions when applied in standby-mode operation and its potential is further exploited when used in combination with power supply voltage scaling.","Aspects of the present disclosure recognize that circuits\/chips can operate according to a number of example power modes and that these power modes can be linked to body biasing. A high-performance\/active mode includes an optimization of BB for speed (e.g., utilizing FBB), a normal mode may optimize for a combination of speed and leakage (e.g., utilizing nominal body bias (NBB)), and a standby\/low-leakage mode may optimize for leakage (e.g., utilizing RBB). Specific embodiments are directed toward modes that include a selective application of BB so that each BB state is not uniformly applied to the whole circuit. For instance, FBB can be applied to a portion (domain) of the circuit that contains speed-critical circuit parts while RBB can be applied to another domain that does not contain speed-critical circuit parts.","Body biasing requires voltage generation for N-well and P-well voltages. The requirements of a FBB voltage generator are generally different than the requirements of a RBB voltage generator. An example FBB generator can be designed to be capable of sourcing\/sinking large well currents due to forward biased junction diodes (mA-range), providing high slew rate of the well voltage transition (e.g., 100-500 mV\/us), and providing low-power consumption (e.g., up to 0.5 mA active current may be acceptable). RBB generator can be designed to be capable of sourcing\/sinking small well currents due to band-to-band tunneling currents (uA-range), providing modest slew rate of the well voltage transition (i.e., up to 10 mV\/us), and providing low-power consumption (i.e., up to 500 nA active current may be acceptable). FBB and RBB generators can therefore be designed as separate circuits.","Aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward a BB architecture that supports the coherent use of different BB within the same chip at the same time at different locations, or at the same location at different times. The architecture facilitates the use of optimized (and a minimum amount of) FBB and RBB generator circuits, which can be beneficial for chip specifications over different power modes of operation.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are related to one or more of the following features: dynamic power-performance management with body biasing; increased chip speed with FBB at minimum power by speeding-up speed-critical parts only; reduced chip leakage with RBB for the same chip having the increased chip speed with FBB; flexibility in the design of logic and\/or memory and\/or analog intellectual property cores (IP blocks); full integration; a solution without the need for external components; a scalable solution to apply to different circuit regions within a given system chip; and\/or a scalable solution to apply in system chips of different complexity.","Various implementations of the present disclosure relate to an ensemble of building blocks that provide for the coherent use of different body biasing voltages throughout an integrated circuit chip. Some of the descriptions herein presume the existence of a chip design that has two voltage domains operating at the same power supply voltage but that can be set to different body biasing. These voltage domains are referred to as Body Bias Island (BBI) , and BBI . Without loss of generality, FBB, NBB, or RBB can be selectively applied at different moments in time for BBI , while BBI  makes use of NBB or RBB. Consistent with various embodiments, both islands have their own triple-well shielding, and do not share the N-well and P-well.","Embodiments of the present disclosure include a circuit designed to operate in different modes in response to a bias-mode input. The modes correspond to different bias settings for the multiple BBIs. For instance, a first mode can involve placing a first BBI in a FBB state and a second BBI in a NBB state. This mode accounts for situations where the first BBI includes high-speed components that benefit from the FBB state, while the second BBI includes components with less stringent speed requirements. Components on both BBIs can operate at their top operating speed. Thus, the first mode can represent an active mode. A second mode can involve placing the first BBI in a RBB state and the second BBI also in a RBB state. This second mode reduces leakage current for both BBIs, which can result in significant power savings when components on the BBIs are inactive. Thus, this second mode can represent an inactive mode or a power savings mode.","Consistent with other embodiments of the present disclosure, one or more additional bias modes can be implemented. For instance, an intermediate mode can place two BBIs in an NBB state. This allows components on both BBIs to operate at an intermediate speed. A device can therefore change bias modes in response to changing processing demands. As a non-limiting example, a smart phone could operate in a first high-power mode (utilizing FBB and NBB) during an active call (or Internet connection) and\/or while performing video processing of other processing intensive functions. The same smart phone could operate in an intermediate mode (utilizing NBB) when there is not an active call, but a user is using other functions of the smart phone (e.g., running an application or accessing various features of the smart phone). When the smart phone is not being actively used, it could operate in power save mode (utilizing RBB).","Various aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward circuits that facilitate the use of a common bias voltage supply circuit to provide a bias voltage to multiple BBIs while also providing the multiple bias modes discussed herein. A BBI switch can be used to selectively link a bias voltage to one or more BBIs. One or more bias voltage supply circuits can be configured with isolation\/tri-state circuitry to allow selective use of produced bias voltages. Examples of these and other aspects are discussed in more detail herein.","Turning now to the figures,  depicts a system diagram including two BBIs and a BBI switch, consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure. BBIs  and  include both N-wells and P-wells. The BBIs can also include a deep N-well (DNW) to collect the charge released in the substrate and to prevent the P-wells from being shorted to one another. BBI switch  switch provides electrical connectivity between the N-wells and\/or P-wells of BBI  and BBI  in response to enable signals (e.g., ena_n). BBI switch  can also isolate the N-wells and\/or P-Wells of BBI  and BBI  from one another in response to the enable signals. This allows for BBIs  and  to operate either at the same body biasing or at different body biasing conditions.","Aspects of the present disclosure are directed toward embodiments in which one or more common bias voltage generators (whether an FBB, RBB or NBB generator) can be used for each of the BBIs  and . When the BBI switch  is active, a voltage generator can provide a bias voltage to both BBIs  and . For instance, a RBB bias voltage generator can be connected to the N-well (and\/or P-well) of BBI . When BBI switch  is active, the output of the RBB bias voltage generator is also provided to the N-well (and\/or P-well) of BBI . Thus, a single RBB bias voltage generator can be used to place both BBIs  and  into an RBB state. When the BBI switch is inactive, however, different body biases can be provided to the BBIs  and  because they are effectively isolated from each other.","Consistent with certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the BBI switch 's enable signal is provided to facilitate the use of one or more bias modes. A first bias mode includes a shared bias voltage between BBIs  and , whereas a second bias mode includes two different bias voltages for BBIs  and . As a non-limiting example, the first bias mode can be implemented with a RBB state for both BBIs  and , while a second bias mode can be implemented with a FBB state for one of the BBIs, and a NBB state for the other of the BBIs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","202","206","208","202","210","206","214","206","212"],"sub":["DD ","SS "]},"Bias voltage generators  and  include isolation\/tri-state outputs that allow other bias voltages to be provided to the BBIs (and their N-well\/P-well) for which they are directly connected.

If both the NBB switch  and the BBI switch  are active, then both of the bias voltage bias voltage generators  and  are isolated.","The system depicted in  allows for the use of multiple different bias modes that can be dynamically adjusted according to the demands placed upon the system.

In certain embodiments, a third domain operates as a voltage domain that is always on. In this example, the first and second domains exploit BB. The configuration corresponding to Table 1 does not apply FBB to BBI , even in high-performance mode. This can be particularly useful when BBI  contains speed-critical circuit components, while BBI  does not. Applying FBB to BBI  would increase leakage overhead while any potential speed improvement would not (or at least not fully) benefit the circuit components of BBI .","Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, an integrated circuit can be implemented that has multiple body bias islands. Each island can be put in a certain bias condition depending on application needs. The proposed body bias architecture discussed herein allow for a reduced number of body bias voltage generators on the integrated circuit through utilization of BBI switches and the recognition that islands with same speed\/power characteristics can have same body biasing for a given mode of operation and that such characteristics can be application dependent.","An integrated circuit could also have circuit portion(s) that have a non-programmable body bias (e.g., are only nominally or forward body biased). This could be the case in a multi-power domain chip, e.g., an always-on domain could be configured without a programmable body bias.","According to the example bias modes of Tables 1 and 2, the FBB bias voltage generator  isolates whenever BBI switch  is active. Thus, the FBB bias voltage generator  can be designed to provide sufficient drive capability to bias the N-well and P-well of BBI ; rather than providing sufficient drive capacity to both BBI  and BBI .","The BB Controller  can be implemented using discrete logic circuits, software-programmable processors and\/or using a look-up table approach. Tables 1 and 2 show a basic implementation of the functionality of BB Controller , however, the disclosure is not necessarily so limited. For instance, BB Controller  could be configured and arranged to set the body bias voltage for each island to different levels. This voltage control could be implemented dynamically and\/or adaptively in response to circuit conditions.","BB Controller  can be configured to operate in several different manners and in response to various different inputs. For instance, BB Controller  can be configured using an interface that is accessible to inputs from, but not limited to, software applications, user inputs and hardware control signals. For instance, software applications can indicate a need to access certain functional circuits and\/or set power-status\/modes. An application programming interface (API) can be provided so that different software programs can initiate different modes. In another instance, BB Controller  can be accessed by writing to a register with data indicating the desired mode. In still other embodiments, BB Controller  can receive a signal that indicates a change in operational speed (e.g., a signal that represents a change to clock speed of one or more circuits). BB Controller  could also respond directly to user input (e.g., a user pressing a button to activate or deactivate the device or a portion thereof). Various other interfaces and inputs can also be used and BB Controller  can be configured to use the different possible inputs alone or in combination.","The above examples are not limiting and various other bias modes are possible. Moreover, the specific configuration of  can be modified to provide different\/additional functionality. For instance, an additional NBB switch directly connected to the BBI  can allow for a bias mode for which BBI  is in a NBB state and BBI  is not (e.g., BBI  could be in a RBB state). In other instances, additional BBIs can be added. Using additional BBI switches, these additional BBIs can share one or more of the bias voltage generators in certain bias modes and yet have BB independence in other bias modes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["302","312","312","314","316","318","320"]},"Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, the system can be configured so that each island can be configured to have a different body bias. In order to reduce the amount of BB voltage generators, multiple BBI switches can be used between the different islands. As two examples: for a 2-island case, there is one BBI switch, whereas for a 3-island case there can be 1-3 BBI switches (e.g., where 3 switches allow for a single switch between all combinations of two islands).","In a particular implementation, the FBB bias voltage generator  and the RBB bias voltage generator  can have separately-controllable tri-state circuits for the different BBIs . Similarly, both BBI switch circuit  and NBB switch circuit  can provide separately-controllable connections to\/between respective BBIs . For example, BBI A can be linked to BBI C when a first switch is active. BBI B can also be linked with BBI D when a second switch is active; however, this second switch can be controlled independently from the first switch.","The independent switch control allows for sets of BBIs  to be linked and controlled, consistent with respective and different BB modes (e.g., according to Table 1).
