title: Method and an apparatus for a waveform quality measurement
abstract: A method and an apparatus for waveform quality measurement are disclosed. An actual signal, representing a waveform channelized both in time and in code is generated by, e.g., an exemplary HDR communication system. Test equipment generates an ideal waveform corresponding to the actual waveform. The test equipment then generates an estimate of offsets between parameters of the actual waveform and the ideal waveform, and the offsets are used to compensate the actual waveform. The test equipment then evaluates various waveform quality measurements utilizing the compensated actual waveform and the corresponding ideal waveform. Definitions of the various waveform quality measurements as well as conceptual and practical examples of processing of the actual waveform and the corresponding ideal waveform by the test equipment are disclosed. The disclosed method and apparatus may be extended to any waveform channelized both in time and in code regardless of the equipment that generated the waveform.

More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for waveform quality measurement.","2. Background","Recently, communication systems have been developed to allow transmission of signals from an origination station to a physically distinct destination station. In transmitting signals from the origination station over a communication link, the signal is first converted into a form suitable for efficient transmission over the communication link. As used herein, the communication link comprises a medium over which a signal is transmitted. Conversion, or modulation, of the signal involves varying a parameter of a carrier wave in accordance with the signal in such a way that the spectrum of the resulting modulated carrier is confined within the communication link bandwidth. At the destination station the original signal is replicated from a version of the modulated carrier received over the communication link. Such a replication is generally achieved by using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the origination station.","Modulation also facilitates multiple-access, i.e., simultaneous transmission and\/or reception, of several signals over a common communication link. Multiple-access communication systems often include a plurality of remote subscriber units requiring intermittent service of relatively short duration rather than continuous access to the common communication link. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division multiple-access (TDMA), frequency division multiple-access (FDMA), and amplitude modulation (AM). Another type of a multiple-access technique is a code division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spectrum system that conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wide-Band Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard.
