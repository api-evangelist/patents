The government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to systems for performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.","Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique used in condensed matter physics and chemistry to study vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in molecular systems. In a Raman spectroscopic experiment, an approximately monochromatic beam of light of a particular wavelength range passes through a sample of molecules and a spectrum of scattered light is emitted. The spectrum of wavelengths emitted from the molecule is called a \u201cRaman spectrum\u201d and the emitted light is called \u201cRaman scattered light.\u201d A Raman spectrum can reveal electronic, vibrational, and rotational energies levels of a molecule. Different molecules produce different Raman spectrums that can be used like a fingerprint to identify molecules and even determine the structure of molecules.","The Raman scattered light generated by a compound (or ion) adsorbed on or within a few nanometers of a structured metal surface can be 10-10times greater than the Raman scattered light generated by the same compound in solution or in the gas phase. This process of analyzing a compound is called surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (\u201cSERS\u201d). In recent years, SERS has emerged as a routine and powerful tool for investigating molecular structures and characterizing interfacial and thin-film systems, and even enables single-molecule detection. Engineers, physicists, and chemists continue to seek improvements in systems and methods for performing SERS.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems for performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The systems include a waveguide configured with an array of features to support guided-mode resonance for certain wavelengths of Raman-excitation light which increases the intensity of the electromagnetic field associated with the Raman-excitation light. In particular, wavelengths of the Raman-excitation light can be selected to generate a spectrum of Raman scattered light associated with particular analyte molecules, and the waveguide and array of features can be configured to provide guided-mode resonance for the Raman-excitation light. Portions of the outer surfaces of the array of features are coated with a Raman-active material that when exposed to the Raman-excitation light cause analyte molecules located on, or in close proximity to, the Raman-active material to enhance the intensity of the Raman-scattered light.","The term \u201clight\u201d as used to describe the operation of system embodiments of the present invention is not intended to be limited to electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths that lie only within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, but is intended to also include electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths outside the visible portion, such as the infrared and ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be used to refer to both classical and quantum electromagnetic radiation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","102","104","106","106","102","106","102","106","102"]},"In certain embodiments, the outer surface of the Raman-active system  can be coated with a Raman-active material in the form of Raman-active nanoparticles.
