title: Systems and methods for protecting private information in a mobile environment
abstract: Techniques for protecting non-public information in a mobile environment are provided. A request for non-public information about users in a mobile environment is received. Privacy policies, non-public and optional public information about the users affected by the request are determined. An optional privacy impact indicator is determined based on how satisfying the request increases the current public information about the users. Crowds of users having similar attribute name/values are optionally determined. User and optional requestor privacy policies which associate threshold release criteria such minimum crowd size, minimum consideration with the non-public information are determined. A privacy agreement is reached for the disclosure of the requested non-public information based on the compatibility of the requester and user privacy policies. Privacy protecting transformations are optionally determined and applied to create crowds or groups associated with the requested attribute.

No. 11\/003,688; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of Invention","This invention relates to protecting non-public information.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional systems for protecting information privacy determine quasi-identifiers in data sets useful in re-identifying individual subjects. These conventional systems attempt to generalize, hide or withhold quasi-identifiers in the data sets to protect the privacy of individuals. For example, a subject's salary information can be hidden within aggregate salary information for a group.","Other conventional systems for protecting privacy attempt to generalize the information to prevent re-association with specific subjects. For example, some of these systems replace some or all digits of a subject specific identifier with wildcards to generalize the identifier. In this way, a group of subjects is created in which the group is associated with a non-subject specific identifier. The group lessens the impact of information disclosures on any specific subject while allowing the release of interesting aggregate information.","Samarati et al. in \u201cProtecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: k-Anonymity and Its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression\u201d, Technical Report, SRI International, March 1998, describe a system for protecting privacy based on a theory of k-anonymity. Samarati et al. propose granular access to any sensitive information by applying the minimal set of generalization transformations necessary to create desired groups of size at least \u201ck\u201d. The subject identifying portions of the information are transformed by these generalizations.","These conventional privacy protecting systems assume that access to the underlying data source is available. However, in a typical data-mining environment, the underlying data sets are not necessarily available for access. Moreover, these conventional systems do not work well in mobile environments. Although some conventional systems aggregate subject specific information before it is disclosed to a third party, all personal data must be disclosed to the aggregator. This is often unacceptable in a mobile environment.","Conventional privacy protecting systems also assume that all the relevant information for a large group of subjects is simultaneously available in a single location. However, information about mobile users is not always centralized and\/or if centralized is not usually available from the network operator. In mobile environments, subject devices such as mobile phones, WiFi-enabled personal digital assistants and the like are typically associated with unique identifiers. The unique identifiers are useful in re-associating specific information with subjects over multiple sessions. Thus, if the extracted knowledge or mined information associated with the session identifier information is not properly protected and\/or anonymized, it may be re-associated with individual subjects by combining it with public information. Therefore, systems and methods for protecting extracted knowledge or data in a mobile environment would be useful.","The systems and methods according to this invention provide for protecting non-public information in a mobile environment. A query for non-public information is received. Information previously released by the user to the same or a different requester of information, non-public information, optional publicly available information about the users and\/or the requester, and optional privacy policies are determined for one or more users. User privacy policies are associated with the attribute names, values, required crowd size, consideration required to disclosure identifying information and\/or other possible requirements. Crowds of users associated with the same and\/or similar requested attributes or features are optionally determined. A privacy impact indicator is optionally determined based on the privacy consequences of releasing the requested information. The privacy consequences may include, but are not limited to an increase in the publicly available information about a user, whether releasing the requested information violates the user's privacy policy, and the like. Privacy protecting transformations are optionally determined and applied to the user's data before replying to the query, based on the user's privacy policy, the requestor's privacy policy and optional publicly available information about the users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","300","400","600","800","1010","1020","1030","900","99","150","150","100","400"],"sup":"rd "},"The public information source  contains information publicly known about a user. Public information is information about a subject that has already been released, is widely known and is easily obtained. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the public information is optionally purchased from a public information repository, or may be made available without charge. For example, the public information  may contain information about the user's address and telephone numbers listed in telephone directories and the like. However, it will be apparent that any type of publicly available information may be optionally stored in the public information source .","In one of the various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the system for protecting non-public information  is optionally embedded within the personal computer or server . In various other embodiments according to this invention, the system for protecting non-public information  is embedded in a personal computer, a workstation and\/or in any fixed or mobile device accessible via communications links . The system for protecting non-public information  controls and\/or mediates access to information about a user encoded within the data structure for storing non-public information . The non-public information is stored within a mobile device, the smartcard , in a central encrypted repository, within the user's home gateway , a router, a personal computer, the smartphone , or at any other location accessible over a communications medium. The user's non-public information encoded within the data structure for storing non-public information  includes information that is not widely known. For example, the non-public information includes, but is not limited to the user's net worth, color preferences, clothing size and the like.","In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the non-public information includes, but is not limited to medical records, x-rays, pharmacy records, genetic profiles, previous adverse drug interactions and\/or any known or later developed non-public health information. However, it will be apparent that the non-public information may also include lifestyle information such as hobbies, work interests, travel locations, purchases, education, or any known or later developed category of information about a user.","The data structure for storing non-public information  may include all, or portions of the information in the data sources . In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the non-public information includes information and\/or data obtained from pervasive location sensors, heart rate and\/or body monitoring sensors, audio and\/or video sensors, telephone caller id and call log information from telecommunication device , video viewing information from video viewing device , audio information from audio device , firewall or proxy server logs and\/or information from various sensors and\/or devices associated with a user.","The various information sources may be combined logically and\/or physically into a single data structure for storing non-public information . In various exemplary embodiments, feature vectors derived from each source of information are determined and combined into a multi-modal representation of the user.","In still other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the non-public information encoded within the data structure for storing non-public information storage  is optionally synchronized with the smartphone ; the user's smartcard  and\/or any known or later developed device. For example, the information contained within an exemplary data structure for storing non-public information  is associated with a personal computer, workstation, server and\/or gateway optionally synchronized with the user's smartphone  and\/or the user's smartcard . It will be apparent that synchronization may occur between the same or different types of information storage medium capable of storing the information encoded within the data structure for storing non-public information . Thus, synchronization may occur between the data structure for storing information  encoded on a mobile device, such as a smartphone , and the data structure for storing information  encoded on a personal computer, a workstation, a home gateway or any other known or later developed device and\/or medium for storing the non-public information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","700","100","200","400","700","99"]},"A requestor  initiates a request for non-public information from the system for protecting non-public information  embedded in personal digital assistant . The system for protecting non-public information receives the request and optionally displays a privacy impact indicator to the user based on the privacy consequences of releasing the information. Privacy consequences may be measured based on a comparison to the user's privacy policy, the public information  and the like. Optional threshold release criteria previously specified by the user allow transactions compatible with the user's privacy policy and threshold release criteria to be automatically completed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["601","603","201","203","201","601","99"]},"In one exemplary embodiment according to this invention, request server  transmits a request for non-public information  to the first smartphone , the second smartphone  and the third smartphone . The request for non-public information  requests the identification of users associated with attribute A. In one exemplary embodiment, the attribute Aspecifies the hair color of a specific user. The systems for protecting non-public information (not shown) are embedded within the first, second and third smartphones - respectively. The systems for protecting non-public information (not shown) determine whether the response to the request complies with the selected privacy policies of the relevant users. That is, the systems for protecting non-public information (not shown) embedded within the first, second and third smartphones - determine whether the release of the requested information violates the user's privacy policy.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the second and third embedded systems for protecting non-public information (not shown) use private cryptographic matching protocols. The cryptographic matching protocols identify candidate users and\/or build crowds of users willing to share the requested attribute information Abased on threshold release criteria associated with each user. For example, a user may specify a willingness to share their non-public green hair color attribute information with an external requester, only if at least N other users with the green hair color attribute value also share their information.","The user specifies threshold release criteria based on the value, minimum privacy and\/or any known or later determined consideration. The threshold release criteria may include but are not limited to the minimum number of users willing to share the same or similar non-public attribute values. The threshold release criteria are specified in a preference file and\/or entered manually. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, cryptographic matching protocols are used to determine whether the threshold criteria have been met. For example, cryptographic matching protocols are used to determine the number of users willing to share the information associated with one or more requested attribute values. Since the attribute values are encrypted, the actual attribute values are not revealed unless the threshold release criteria are satisfied.","The threshold release criteria may be previously entered by the user and\/or determined dynamically. For example, a first user's privacy policy specifies that hair color information is to be released from crowds of at least 2 users. The privacy policies associated with the second and third users permit the sharing of hair color information from crowds of at least 2 users. Since there are two or more users willing to share the requested attribute information, a crowd of size at least 2 is formed for the green hair color attribute. The crowd of size at least 2 returns the aggregated \u201cGREEN\u201d hair color attribute information to the server  using an anonymizing network or the like. In this way, a request for non-public information is satisfied in an aggregate form that also satisfies the constraints imposed by the privacy policy of each user.","In various exemplary embodiments, the request for non-public information is accompanied by an offer of valuable consideration. That is the requestor offers something of value if the user reveals the requested non-public information. For example, the requestor may agree not to store and\/or save the requested non-public information, not to transfer the information to a third party and the like. Alternatively, merchandise and\/or other valuable consideration is offered in return for access to the user's non-public information. It will be apparent that the exemplary protocol for exchanging anonymized non-public information may be used in any wireless or wired environment, a trusted computing environment, with processor chips embedded into smartcards and\/or various other types of computing environments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["2000","2010"]},"In step S, the non-public information store is determined. The non-public information store is contained within a mobile device, in a central encrypted repository, within the user's gateway, a router, a personal computer or at any other location accessible over a communications medium. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the non-public information store contains identifying information, potentially identifying information, and\/or partially identifying non-public information about a user.","For example, in one of the embodiments, a user's green hair color and recent purchase of green pants are associated with the user based on identifying, potentially identifying and\/or partially identifying information. In still other embodiments, personal, financial, transaction, medical or other non-public information useful in providing context and\/or a profile of the user is also associated with the subject based on the identifying, potentially identifying and\/or partially identifying information.","The non-public information store is populated via data mining techniques, explicitly via user surveys and\/or questionnaires and\/or using any known or later developed method of determining attributes and\/or features associated with a user. After the various types of identifying information in the non-public information store have been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, an optional privacy policy is determined. The optional privacy policy indicates how much information the user is willing to disclose, under what circumstances and with what restrictions. Thus, in one example, a subject's default or null privacy policy indicates an unwillingness to disclose any information not already in the public domain. However, in another example, a subject specifies a high level of privacy for medical information and a low level of privacy for favorite colors, favorite actors and the like. In other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a privacy policy is associated with the requestor. The privacy policy of the requestor specifies how the information received from the user is handled. The privacy policy of the requestor is optionally communicated to the user. After the optional privacy policies have been determined, control continues to step S.","A request for non-public information is received in step S. In various exemplary embodiments, the request for non-public information is a request from a vendor for all or a portion of the information contained in the non-public information store. For example, the request may be a request by a styling salon for the hair color or styling preference of the user. In return for disclosing the non-public styling preference information, the user is optionally offered a coupon, cash or other types of consideration. In various other exemplary embodiments, the user's privacy policy specifies the minimum size of the group or the crowd size parameters to be satisfied before the requested attribute values are released. After the request for non-public information has been received, control continues to step S.","In step S, a privacy impact indicator is determined based on the query, the user's privacy policy, and optionally the requestor's privacy policy and the publicly available information. The privacy impact indicator is based on audio, visual, tactile, olfactory or any other human sense. For example, a privacy impact indicator may visually indicate the effect of disclosing the requested information using a user interface element such as a thermometer, a dial, a meter and the like. In other exemplary embodiments, audio-indicators such as sounds of varying frequencies, duration, beat, tactile indicators and the like are used alone or in combination. Control then continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made as to whether the user has requested termination of the current session. The sessions may be automatically managed and terminated under program control. However, a user may also request termination of the current session using a key sequence, a voice command or the like. If it is determined that termination of the session has been requested, control continues to step S and the process ends. Otherwise, control continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made whether the user will release the requested non-public information. For example, in various embodiments according to this invention, a pop-up window displayed on a personal digital assistant requests the user's permission to release the requested non-public information. The release prompt is accompanied by a privacy impact indicator. In some of the exemplary embodiments, the privacy impact indicator is a visual warning indicator such as a cautionary sign, yield symbol, a stop signal or the like. The privacy impact indicator may be displayed to the user on the display of a personal digital assistant, a smartphone or any other appropriate display device. The subject's response to the request for information is facilitated by the privacy impact indicator. The information is optionally anonymised and\/or otherwise transformed before being released.","For example, the disclosure of seemingly innocuous non-public information may significantly affect the amount of public information already available about the user. In this case, a red traffic light is displayed as the privacy impact indicator to indicate a privacy risk to the user. Conversely a green traffic light may be used if the release of the requested information would not significantly add to the public information already available. However, it should be apparent that any color and\/or various other types of user interface elements may be used without departing from the scope of this invention.","If it is determined that the user does not want to release the requested non-public information, control continues to optional step S where a flag is optionally set to ignore similar requests for information for a determined period. Control then proceeds immediately to step S. Steps S-S are then repeated until it is determined in step S that the requested non-public information should be released; or a determination is made in step S that a session termination request has been received.","In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a user designates a set of threshold release criteria. The threshold release criteria describe acceptable conditions for the disclosure and\/or sale of non-public information. The threshold release criteria may specify 3party transfer rights, minimum crowd sizes to be satisfied before non-public information is released or the like. The privacy impact of the threshold release criteria are optionally indicated to the user by a privacy impact indicator, such as a privacy meter or the like. Requests for information compatible and\/or matching with the user's threshold release criteria are automatically satisfied. This allows the user to continue transactions with fewer interruptions. If it is determined in step S that the requested non-public information should be released, control continues to step S.","In step S the requested non-public information is shared with the requestor. For example, a request for the user's hair color is selectively revealed if a sufficient number of other users with green hair are willing to respond and\/or the selected privacy policy permits disclosure of the non-public information. After the requested non-public information has been shared with the requestor, control immediately continues to step S. Steps S-S repeat until a determination is made in step S that a session termination request has been received. Control then continues to step S ad the process ends. The sessions may be managed manually or automatically. Thus, users may directly request the termination of sessions. However, sessions may also be started and terminated under programmatic control to eliminate the need to manage sessions directly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["2200","2210","2210","2220"]},"In step S the requested information and the public information are compared to determine a degree of disclosure. Thus, in one exemplary embodiment according to this invention, if the requested information is already available as public information, the degree of disclosure is low. If the requested information is not available as public information, the degree of disclosure is high. For example, if the requested information is hair color and zipcode, satisfying the request would reveal that the user's hair color is \u201cgreen\u201d and the user's zipcode is \u201c94105\u201d. If the requested information can be combined with publicly available information to reveal the user's identity then the degree of disclosure is high. After the degree of disclosure has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, a privacy impact indicator is determined based on the degree of disclosure. The privacy impact indicator is based on visual, audio, tactile, olfactory, taste or any other known or later developed human sense. The privacy impact indicator is then displayed to the user. Exemplary visual privacy impact indicators may be dials, thermometers, bar graphs or any visual user interface element useful in indicating a range. However, it will be apparent that audio, tactile, olfactory or other types of human sensible privacy impact indicators may also be used without departing from the scope of this invention. After the privacy impact indicator is determined, control continues to step S and immediately continues to step S of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["3000","3010","3020"]},"The non-public information store contains non-public information about a user. The non-public information includes, but is not limited to buying preferences, health and\/or lifestyle information, financial information and\/or any other type of non-public information about a user. It will be apparent that in various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the non-public information store is contained on a single physical or logical device and\/or may be split between multiple physical or logical devices without departing from the scope of this invention. After the non-public information store has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S a request for non-public information is determined. The request may be for all, or a part of the information contained in the non-public information store. The request for information may be for computed, intrinsic or other non-public information about a user. In one exemplary embodiment, the request for non-public information includes a request for the user's favorite ice cream flavor mined from grocery sales transactions, a \u201cfrequent shopper\u201d reward program, a response to a survey based on direct input from a user. However, it will be apparent that any known or later developed repository or source of information about the user may also be used as a source of non-public information about a user. After the request for non-public information is received, control continues to step S where the privacy impact indicator is determined.","The privacy impact indicator is determined based on the impact of releasing the requested non-public information. For example, if the user's full name is requested, the privacy impact of releasing the full name information would be high since release of the full name uniquely identifies the user. In contrast, the privacy impact indicator of a request for the release of the user's city and state of residence is low, if the requested non-public information is disclosed in aggregate form with a sufficient number of other users who share the same city and state residence values. However, depending on context, disclosure of out-of-country, or out-of-state, city information may have a high privacy impact, if the information can be easily combined with other public information to re-identify the user. Thus, in still other exemplary embodiments, the privacy impact indicator is determined based on the requested non-public information, the public information and an optional context of the request. After the privacy impact indicator is determined, control continues to step S.","A privacy agreement is negotiated in step S. In one of the various exemplary embodiments, the negotiated privacy agreement is based on at least one of: a privacy policy associated with the user; a privacy policy associated with the requestor; a recommended privacy policy and the impact of releasing the requested information. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the privacy agreement specifically identifies information to be disclosed; consideration to be provided; duration of the privacy agreement; amount and\/or type of information; further uses of the information such as 3party sales and distribution rights, to whom the information may be revealed and\/or any term and\/or condition relevant to a privacy agreement.","For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the user specifies acceptable privacy policy threshold release criteria describing acceptable conditions for the disclosure and\/or sale of non-public information. Proposed privacy agreements that satisfy the user's specified privacy policy threshold release criteria are automatically accepted. Manual user acceptance is optionally required for proposed agreements outside the scope of the threshold release criteria. However, it will be apparent that any combination of manual and\/or automatic acceptance of proposed agreements may be used without departing from the scope of this invention. After the privacy agreement has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, non-public information is transferred to the requestor based on the negotiated privacy agreement. If the user does not agree, either manually or automatically, to the requestor's set of acceptable parameters for the privacy agreement, a default, null or no transfer privacy agreement is created. The default, null, or no transfer privacy agreement prohibits the transfer of any non-public information. After the privacy agreement has been determined, control continues to step S and the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["3300","3310","3310","3320"]},"In step S, the requestor's privacy agreement negotiation range is determined. In one exemplary embodiment, the requestor specifies a range of consideration for increasingly specific user information. This increases the likelihood that one or more users will provide the requested non-public information. After the requestor's negotiation range has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made as to whether the negotiation range of the user and the negotiation range of the requestor overlap, that is, if the range of negotiation values calculated overlap at any point. If the range of negotiation values overlap, control continues to step S where a privacy agreement is determined based on the overlap. In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, a measure of compatibility between the privacy policy of the requestor and the privacy policy of a user is determined. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, a measure of compatibility is used to compare Boolean, numerical or literal privacy values. However, it should be apparent that a measure of compatibility may be determined between one or more privacy values of any known or later developed type, without departing from the scope of this invention. After any overlap has been determined, control continues to step S and immediately continues to step S of .","Otherwise, if it is determined in step S that the negotiation ranges do not overlap, control continues from step S to step S. In step S a determination is made as to whether the negotiation session has been aborted or terminated. For example, if the pre-defined negotiation ranges of the user and the requestor do not overlap, the negotiation session is optionally aborted and the requestor and user enter into an optional manual re-negotiation session.","In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the user indicates a preference not to be notified of un-successful negotiation sessions. The un-successful negotiation sessions are optionally logged and saved for later review or may be ignored by the user. Alternately, the negotiation session may terminate when a device is turned off, a time limit is exceeded and\/or may terminate based on any other condition or event.","If the negotiation session is terminated, control continues to step S where a privacy agreement is set that provides for the exchange or transfer of no information. Control then continues to step S and immediately continues to step S of .","If no negotiation session termination request is received, control continues to step S. In step S a new range of negotiation values is requested from the user and\/or the requestor. Control then jumps to step S. Steps S-S are repeated until a privacy agreement is reached or the negotiation session is terminated. It will be apparent that the privacy agreement negotiation can be completed in one round or in multiple rounds without departing from the scope of this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["4000","4100"]},"In step S an item is selected. The item may be a digital property such as a movie, music, an e-text or audio book, grocery items or any other item offered for sale or use. Once the item has been selected, control continues to step S.","In step S, the selected item is acted upon. For example, the item may be purchased, leased, rented; viewed or listened to and the like. After the selected item has been acted upon, control continues to step S.","In step S, the user's information store is updated with transaction information about the item. Thus, in various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, movie purchase activity is recorded separately from movie rental activity. For example, a purchased item may be a gift, while the viewed item is more likely to reflect specific personal attributes of the user. The non-public information store is updated manually and\/or automatically. That is, the user may manually update the non-public information store as transactions occur or an automatic update of the non-public information store occurs based on electronic receipts (e-receipts) electronic bills (e-bill), entries in a PDA TO-DO list, entries in a digital calendar, email messages or any other known or later developed source of non-public information. After the non-public information store has been updated, control continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made as to whether the update session has been terminated. In various exemplary embodiments, the update sessions may be created and terminated automatically or manually by the user. If no request to terminate the update session is determined in step S, control immediately jumps to step S. Steps S-S are then repeated until it is determined that an update termination request has been received.

For example, the item may be an encrypted digital property such as a movie, music, an audio book, a text and the like. However, it should be apparent that any type of property asset or item for which feedback is to be determined may also be used without departing from the scope of this invention. Control then continues to step S.","In step S, the user's interest in the item is determined. User interest may be based on positive or negative feedback, duration, posture or attitude, feedback surveys or any other known or later developed method of determining user feedback about the item. After the user's interest or feedback information has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the information store is updated with the user interest or feedback information. For example, if viewing of the romantic-comedy is aborted after 10 minutes, the implied user interest in the romantic-comedy genre may be reduced. In contrast, if a user has explicitly indicated interest in the romantic-comedy genre, the abort feedback information may be used to impliedly reduce the user's expressed interest in one or more of the actors and\/or directors associated with the aborted movie. In this way, the user model encoded within the non-public information store can be further refined based on user feedback. After the non-public information store has been updated, control continues to step S.","In step S, a determination is made whether a request to terminate the session for updating the information store has been received. The session may be terminated automatically by the system or manually by the user. If termination of the update session has not been requested, control continues to step S. Steps S-S repeat until it is determined in step S that a termination request has been received. Control then continues to step S and the process ends.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["6000","6100"]},"The non-public information store is contained within a mobile device, in a central encrypted repository, within the user's gateway, a router, a personal computer or at any other location accessible over a communications medium. For example, in various exemplary embodiments, the non-public information is stored within a home gateway. The home gateway facilitates access to ubiquitous computing and sensor devices in the user's home environment. When the user leaves the home environment, the non-public information store is synchronized and\/or transferred to the user's mobile smartphone, personal digital assistant, smartcard and\/or any other known or later developed device capable of holding a copy and\/or mediating access to the non-public information store. In various other exemplary embodiments according to this invention, portions of the non-public information store are located on different logical and\/or physical devices, without departing from the scope of this invention. After the user's non-public information store has been determined, control continues to step S.","In step S, the user's privacy policy is determined. The privacy policy may be previously set by the user and read from a file, entered dynamically by keyboard, voice and\/or retrieved from any other source. After the user's privacy policy has been determined, control then continues to step S.","In step S, a request for information is received. The request may be for all or a portion of the information associated with the user. For example, a styling salon near the user's current location may request the user's hair color. However, many users are reluctant to release such information if it can be used to identify or partially identify them. Control therefore continues to step S where the number of users willing to reveal the same value for one or more attributes (or set of attributes) is determined.
