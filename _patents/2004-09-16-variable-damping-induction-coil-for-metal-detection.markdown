title: Variable damping induction coil for metal detection
abstract: A pulse inductive metal detector that includes a variable resistor for controlling coil characteristics for both transmitter and receiver modes of operation. A coil coupled with an electronic switch is charged with current from the power source in a transmitter mode such that when the electronic switch is abruptly switched closed the coil emits a magnetic field that induces eddy currents in a metal target. Once the transmitter magnetic fields have decayed enough, the coil can be operated in a receiver mode to detect a magnetic field resulting from eddy currents in the metal target. The variable resistor is coupled across the coil for varying the resistance across the coil to optimize the pulse inductive metal detector sensitivity to the metal target.

N00024-98-D-8124. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","10"]},"According to Faraday's Law, the collapsing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in nearby conductors, such as the metal target . This EMF induces eddy currents to flow in the conductor. Because there is no energy to sustain the eddy currents, they begin to decrease with a characteristic decay time that depends on the size, shape, and electrical and magnetic properties of the conductor. The decay currents generate a secondary magnetic field that is detected by a magnetic field receiver  located above the ground and coupled to the transmitter  via a data acquisition and control system .","Pulse induction metal detector (PIMD) antennas (transmitter and receiver coil) come in two basic types as shown in and . The first type of PIMD shown in illustrates a single combined transmitter and receiver coil  and damping resistor  with multiple loops of wire forming the coil . A current pulse is sent through the multiple turn coil  and the received metal detection signal is sensed by the same coil . The small voltage generated by the metal target is typically amplified by a high gain electronic amplifier  (typical gain factor of 100 to 1000). A protection circuit  is provided to protect the sensitive amplifier from the high kick-back voltage pulse generated by switching the inductive coil off abruptly (V=L di\/dt, where L is the inductance of the transmitter coil and di\/dt is the slope of the current decay in the coil).","The second type of PIMD illustrated in uses a separate coil  and damping resistor  for the transmitter and a coil  and damping resistor  for the receiver. This configuration provides isolation between the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit and allows for more flexibility in the receiver coil  (e.g., different number of turns, size or differential coil configuration) and amplifier circuit design (e.g., single ended operation of electronics). The high gain amplifier  also sees the high kick-back voltage pulse generated by switching the transmitter coil  off abruptly and protection circuitry  is needed to protect it from damage.","The induced eddy currents in a metal target are proportional to the change in magnetic field with time (\u0394B\/\u0394t) at the metal target location. For high sensitivity, one would like to have dB as large as practical and \u0394t (the change in time) matched to the metal object's time response (bandwidth). For a small metal object with a fast time response (high bandwidth) the optimal detector sensitivity would be achieved with a small \u0394t matched to the small metal objects response (matching bandwidth of sensor and target). For a large metal object with a slower time response the optimal detector sensitivity would be achieved with a larger \u0394t matched to the metal object's time response. The magnetic field (B) is proportional to the current (I) in the transmitter coil and the number of coil turns (N), thus B\u02dcIN. More coil turns (N) increases the magnetic field at the target depth for a fixed current. However, increasing the number of coil turns also increases the kick-back voltage across the transmitter coil and switch due to the increased inductance. The voltage across the transmitter coil and the electronic switch turning off the coil current is V=L di\/dt and L\u02dcN. More coil turns also increases the capacitance C of the coil due to the potential (voltage) differences that exist between the individual turns of wire which makes up the coil.","Consider the transmitter coil. The same effects apply also to a receiver coil that is being excited by a transmitter coil. At the moment of current change in the transmitter coil, a high voltage appears across the coil. A fixed shunt resistor R is typically placed across the transmitter coil to dissipate the current in the coil. The resistor is called the damping resistor since it is used to dampen or suppress coil oscillation caused by the LCR circuit formed by the coil. The larger the shunt resistor, the greater the current dissipation and the faster the current decay. Fast current decay allows for small metal targets to be more easily detected since the coil has a higher bandwidth. If the damping resistor value is set to high current is forced into the coil where the capacitance and inductance combination causes voltage\/current oscillations: the oscillations will mask small metal target signals. A small damping resistor slows down the coil decay and lower the sensitivity of the coil to small metal targets. Controlling the damping resistor effects the performance of the PIMD.","The present invention is a pulse inductive metal detector. It includes an electronic switch for switching a power source on and off. A coil coupled with the electronic switch is charged with current when the switch is closed from the power source in a transmitter mode such that when the electronic switch is abruptly switched open the coil emits a magnetic field that induces eddy currents in a metal target. Once the transmitter magnetic fields have decayed enough, the switch can be closed and the coil can be operated in a receiver mode to detect a magnetic field resulting from eddy currents in the metal target. A variable resistor is coupled across the coil for varying the resistance across the coil to optimize the pulse inductive metal detector sensitivity to the metal target.","The variable resistor can be made from a MOSFET transistor coupled with a digital-to-analog converter. A computer controls the digital-to-analog converter such that it sends a control signal to the digital-to-analog converter causing the gate voltage of the MOSFET to vary. This, in turn, affects the resistance between the source and drain of the MOSFET. The electronically controlled variable resistor can operate in either a static mode with fixed resistance values set at different times during the metal detection process or dynamically such that the resistance of the variable resistor is optimized as a function of time during the metal detection process.","The present invention can be implemented for a pulse inductive metal detector that utilizes a combined transmitter\/receiver coil or separate coils for the transmitter and receiver. If using separate coils, then each of the coils can be outfitted with a variable resistor to control the characteristics of its respective coil. The computer can be used to control both variable resistors in a two coil implementation.","The present invention applies to pulse inductive metal detectors (PIMDs). The present invention replaces the fixed damping resistor that is placed across the transmitter and\/or receiver coil in a typical PIMD with a variable resistor. The variable resistor is computer controlled so as to be configurable for different metal detection conditions. The electronically controlled variable resistor can operate in either a static mode with fixed resistance values set at different times during the metal detection process or dynamically such that the resistance of the variable resistor is optimized as a function of time during the metal detection process. Thus, the metal detector operator can control parameters like the bandwidth and kick-back voltage of the transmitter or receiver coil to optimize the PIMD in a wide range of environmental and operating conditions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b ","a"],"b":["20","23","22","23","23","21"]},"The above applies to the dual coil configuration of .

When the coil is operating in receiver mode, raising the resistance will increase the coil bandwidth while lowering the resistance will decrease the coil bandwidth. Changing the bandwidth of the transmitter or receiver coil to match the bandwidth of a metal target increases the sensitivity of the PIMD. Increased sensitivity will optimize the metal detector for metal classification via time decay analysis. A first estimate of a metal object's time decay using a typical general purpose damping resistance value can be used to select the proper damping resistor values for an improved metal detection process. If the first time decay estimate measures a target with a long time decay then the computer can select a low damping resistor value from a look-up table (developed from previous measurements) so that the time decay of the transmitter and receiver will be more closely matched to the target's time decay. A lower damping resistor also reduces the bandwidth of the sensor and thus lowers the noise collected by the receiver coil. Conversely, if the first time decay estimate indicates a fast metal target time decay, the compute can select a large damping resistor value from a look-up table (developed from previous measurements) for the transmitter and receiver.","For metal detectors that use switches\/relays to select different numbers of coil turns for either the transmitter or receiver, the computer controlled variable resistor method removes the need to have switches or relays select different value resistors for each coil configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"i":["b ","b "],"b":["26","28","32","34","32","27","34","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","a "],"b":["30","40","41","42","41","40","40","41","42"]},"The fast resistance response of the MOSFET allows the invention to dynamically adjust the damping resistor during the coil current change.
