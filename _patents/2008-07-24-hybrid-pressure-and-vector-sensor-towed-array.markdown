In particular, the present invention is directed to hydrophones in towed arrays for use with underwater vehicles.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Underwater vehicles currently utilize n-element towed arrays of acoustic pressure hydrophone sensors. Each hydrophone in the towed array has an omni-directional acoustic beam response. When a hydrophone towed array is designed, the linear array demonstrates an axial symmetric beam pattern. Because of this axial symmetric response, a target signal coming from either the left or the right has the same array response. The inability to distinguish between a left or right array response is referred to as the \u201cleft-right ambiguity\u201d. An n-element towed array beam pattern is shown in , where the towed direction is along the x-axis, and the y-axis is at the starboard direction and z-axis is upward.","An acoustic vector sensor, either particle velocity sensor or accelerometer sensor detects the acoustic information from sound wave particle velocity or acceleration. A single acoustic vector sensor demonstrates a cosine beam pattern independent of the sound wave frequency. To resolve the left-right ambiguity, one could form a vector sensor towed array, where all hydrophone elements of the towed array are replaced by vector sensors or combined pressure-vector sensors. However, this approach introduces a higher level of complexity in regard to the design and operation of the towed array. In order to have a successful working array made of all combined vector sensors, the three dimensional orientations for each vector sensor in the array must be known. Instead of forming an n-element vector sensor towed array, what is needed is a means to resolve the left-right ambiguity in towed arrays of hydrophone sensors through the use of a single combined pressure-vector sensor package, where a pressure hydrophone sensor is integrated with an acoustic vector sensor.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to resolve the left-right ambiguity in towed arrays of hydrophone sensors by hybrid technique.","The above object is accomplished with the present invention through the use of a combined pressure-vector sensor package, where a pressure hydrophone sensor is integrated with an acoustic vector sensor of tri-axes.","The towed array design of the present invention is a hybrid towed array, where only one element is a combined vector sensor and the rest are all hydrophone sensors. illustrates an example of a hybrid linear towed array  of (n) sensor elements, where one of the sensor elements is a combined vector sensor  located at the acoustic center of the array, while the other n-elements are pressure sensors (i.e. hydrophones)  distributed throughout the array.","Within the hybrid towed array , the n-element pressure sensor array shows a beam pattern, D(\u03b8,\u03c6), similar to the beam pattern illustrated in , based on the following equation, where i is \u221a{square root over (\u22121)}, \u03b8 is the bearing and \u03c6 is elevation and depression angles respectively, and p(\u03b8,\u03c6) is a normalization constant, which equals to the maximum of p(\u03b8,\u03c6) for all \u03b8 and
