title: Systems and methods for providing a complete view of large computing networks
abstract: The management tool can determine and store all information that is relevant to the computing systems in the network. The management tool can generate and provide reports that are customizable by a requester. The management tool can receive a request to generate a report which specifies the information relevant to the computing systems to be included in the report.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to network management.","Most entities such as companies and universities operate large networks of computing systems. These networks are typically made up of a wide variety of computing systems, such as servers providing various services and individual computing systems. As such, the computing systems in the network varying greatly in the hardware and software contained in the computing systems. Additionally, the computing systems in the network are often located in different physical locations. For example, a company may operate a network which spans multiple geographic regions (e.g. cities, countries, continents) and multiple regions in a single geographic region (e.g. multiple office building, different floors in the office building, different offices in the office building).","One or more system administrators are tasked with the job of tracking and maintaining the computing systems in the network. This involves diagnosing and fixing problems in the computing systems, insuring that the systems are properly configured, and the like. These large networks also tend to grow and change organically over time. New computing systems may be added to the network or computing systems may be removed from the network. Additionally, the computing systems themselves change over time. The computing systems are reconfigured, new hardware and software are added, hardware and software are upgraded, and the like. As such, the administrator of these large networks are presented with a large and every-changing task of tracking the computing systems. If the network is supported by multiple administrators, these administrators must coordinate their work so that the network stays in proper working order. Additionally, as administrators leave their jobs, the new administrators must learn the outlay of the network. Often this can be difficult because administrators lack the ability to capture and view an entire layout of the network.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing a large, enterprise network of computing systems and devices. More particularly, an administrator can utilize a management tool to inventory the network and generate customized views of the network.","According to embodiments, an administrator system can be configured to include a management tool. The management tool can be configured to determine all information that is relevant to the computing systems in the network. This information can include a unique identification of each computing system, the physical location of the computing systems (geographic and region location), the network location of each computing system (gateway, network address, location in the network hierarchy, etc.), types of hardware contained in each computing system (processors, memory, network interfaces, storage, etc.), types software executing on each computing system (operating systems (OS), application programs, etc), the configuration of each computing system, and the like. The management tool can determine all the relevant information by directly querying and communicating with the computing systems, by communicating with other management systems such as a network management server, by communicating with the monitoring agent executing on the computing systems, and by receiving information from the administrator or other persons. The management tool can be configured to classify and to store this information in a set of records.","According to embodiments, the management tool can be configured to generate and to provide reports that are customizable by a requester. The management tool can be configured to receive a request to generate a report which specifies the information relevant to the computing systems to be included in the report. The management tool can be configured to search the stored records and generate the report with the stored information that matches the request. The reports can include network topology maps based on the request and geographic maps based on the request.","By utilizing the management tool, the network management server can inventory the entire network of the computing systems and determine all the information relevant to those computing systems, thereby providing a complete view of the network. Likewise, by generating customizable reports, the management tool can allow an administrator to easily determine specific information about the network. As such, the management tool can reduce the time and effort of managing the network by providing a complete view of the network from a single administrator system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","100","100"]},"In embodiments, the network system  can include a number of computing systems located in different geographic locations  and  connected by one or more networks .
