{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The Present Application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/059,260, filed on Jun. 5, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Not Applicable","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to cloud computing. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for synchronization of a web application to at least one cloud provider.","2. Description of the Related Art","In general terms, cloud computing provides a developer (individual or company) to have access to resources for a Web application, in particular a web site. Various vendors provide cloud computing to the developer community. Such vendors include JOYENT (see joyent.com), Amazon Web Services (See amazon.com), Google App Engine (see http:\/\/code.google.com\/appengine\/) and others.","General definitions for terms utilized in the pertinent art are set forth below.","Applets or Java Applets are mini-executable programs named with the .class suffix and are placed on the web page and provide interactive and multimedia uses.","Application Programming Interface (API) is a collection of computer software code, usually a set of class definitions, that can perform a set of related complex tasks, but has a limited set of controls that may be manipulated by other software-code entities. The set of controls is deliberately limited for the sake of clarity and ease of use, so that programmers do not have to work with the detail contained within the given API itself.","Asynchronous Server-Side Processing is a means for avoiding having to reload a new page for every request sent by a client and involves placing a intermediary between a client and server in order to send a request to the intermediary (i.e. XMLHttpRequest object) which sends it to the server for processing and receives the response from the server for passing on to the client.","Boot or Bootstrap refers to loading the first piece of software that starts a computer since the operating system is essential for running all other programs, it is usually the first piece of software loaded during the boot process.","A Channel is information about organized content on an intranet or the Internet. Channels enable Web developers to categorize and describe Web site content and make that data available to users on demand.","Cloud computing is generally defined as using computing resources, primarily servers, owned by a third party provider (such as the AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD, JOYENT, and GOOGLE APPS) such that the user does not need to make a substantial investment in computer hardware and scale resources depending on the user's needs. Cloud computing primarily involves Web applications but can include storage, raw computing and other specialized services.","FTP or File Transfer Protocol is a protocol for moving files over the Internet from one computer to another.","HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a method of mixing text and other content with layout and appearance commands in a file, so that a browser can generate a display from the file.","Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of conventions for controlling the transfer of information via the Internet from a Web server computer to a client computer, and also from a client computer to a Web server.","Internet is the worldwide, decentralized totality of server computers and data-transmission paths which can supply information to a connected client computer, and can receive and forward information entered from the client computer.","JavaScript is an object-based programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. JavaScript is generally designed for writing software routines that operate within a client computer on the Internet. Generally, the software routines are downloaded to the client computer at the beginning of the interactive session, if they are not already cached on the client computer. JavaScript is discussed in greater detail below.","JSON is JavaScript Object Notation format, which is a way of taking data and turning it into valid a representation of program information that can be read by another program.","MySQL is a relational database management system which relies on SQL for processing data in a database.","Parser is a component of a compiler that analyzes a sequence of tokens to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar. Parsing transforms input text into a data structure, usually a tree, which is suitable for later processing and which captures the implied hierarchy of the input. XML Parsers ensure that an XML document follows the rules of XML markup syntax correctly.","Platform is the combination of a client computer, an operating system, and a browser, which together can support HTTP access and in particular the operation of interactive forms.","Portlet is a Web based component that will process requests and generate dynamic content. The end-user essentially sees a portlet as being a specialized content area within a Web page that occupies a small window. One could use this content area (the portlet) to receive different types of information. The portlet provides users with the capability to customize the content, appearance and position of the portlet.","Provisioning is the act of supplying and configuring computing resources, primarily servers, for a web application.","Pulling or Pull Technology is technology that enables Web browsers to retrieve information from a Web server such as updating information at periodic intervals, essentially Web browser initiated activity.","Pushing or Push Technology is technology that initiates delivery of material from a server to a properly configured Web browser, such as providing automatic updates to a Web browser.","Serialization places an object in a binary form for transmission across a network such as the Internet and deserialization involves extracting a data structure from a series of bytes.","Servlets are objects that receive requests and generate a response based on that request.","SQL (Structured Query Language) is a computer language designed for data retrieval and data management in a database.","Structural layer of a web page is the marked up document and foundation on which other layers may be applied.","URL or Uniform Resource Locator is a address on the World Wide Web.","User is a client computer, generally operated by a human being, but in some system contexts running an automated process not under full-time human control.","User Interface or UI is the junction between a user and a computer program. An interface is a set of commands or menus through which a user communicates with a program. A command driven interface is one in which the user enter commands. A menu-driven interface is one in which the user selects command choices from various menus displayed on the screen.","Web-Browser is a complex software program, resident in a client computer, that is capable of loading and displaying text and images and exhibiting behaviors as encoded in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) from the Internet, and also from the client computer's memory. Major browsers include MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, NETSCAPE, APPLE SAFARI, MOZILLA FIREFOX, and OPERA.","Web-Server is a computer able to simultaneously manage many Internet information-exchange processes at the same time. Normally, server computers are more powerful than client computers, and are administratively and\/or geographically centralized. An interactive-form information-collection process generally is controlled from a server computer.","World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an unofficial standards body which creates and oversees the development of web technologies and the application of those technologies.","XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a language for describing the content of hypertext documents intended to be viewed or read in a browser.","XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a W3C standard for text document markup, and it is not a language but a set of rules for creating other markup languages. As shown in , a cloud computing system \u2032 of the prior art generally involves a single cloud provider \u2032 which is accessed from a user \u2032 at a user interface \u2032 over a network such as the Internet. The user \u2032 can only work with the single cloud provider \u2032 and is provided very little information about the performance of the web application on the cloud provider \u2032. Further, in order to scale up, the user \u2032 must repeat the uploading process.","However, current technologies fail to provide a system and method for facilitated synchronization of a web application to a single cloud provider, and also fail to provide a system and method for synchronization of a web application to multiple cloud providers.","The Present Invention overcomes the obstacles of the prior art and provides a method and system for synchronizing a web application to multiple cloud providers, and for facilitated synchronization of a web application to a single cloud provider.","One aspect is a method for facilitated synchronization of a web application to a cloud provider. The method includes accessing a remote cloud manager. The method also includes selecting a plurality of web resources for the web application at the remote cloud manager. The plurality of web resources located at at least one cloud provider. The method also includes identifying a plurality of authored works for the web application. The method also includes synchronizing the plurality of web resources and the authored works to deploy the web application to a cloud provider.","The plurality of authored works preferably includes graphic files, HTML documents and audio files. The plurality of authored works also preferably includes flash documents, PHP documents and JavaScript documents. Synchronizing the plurality of web resources and the authored works to deploy the web application to a cloud provider preferably comprises provisioning the web application and deploying the web application to the cloud provider.","Identifying a plurality of authored works for the web application preferably comprises providing a file location for each of the plurality of authored works to the cloud manager.","Another aspect is a system for facilitated synchronization of a web application to a cloud provider. The system includes a network, a plurality of cloud providers, a plurality of authored works and a cloud manager. Each of the plurality of cloud providers is accessible over the network. Each of the plurality of cloud providers includes a plurality of web resources. Each of the plurality of authored works for the web application is located at a user site. The cloud manager identifies the plurality of authored works for the web application, selects from the plurality of web resources for the web application and synchronizes the plurality of web resources and the authored works to deploy the web application to a cloud provider.","The cloud manager can preferably synchronize to multiple targets comprising public, private and staging. The cloud manager can preferably concurrently synchronize to each of the plurality of cloud providers. The cloud manager can preferably concurrently synchronize a first set of the plurality of authored works to a primary cloud provider and a second set of the plurality of authored works to a secondary cloud provider wherein the primary cloud provider has a first transfer format and the secondary cloud provider has a second transfer format that is different than the first transfer format.","Yet another aspect is a computer program for facilitated synchronization of a web application to a cloud provider. The computer program includes means for accessing a remote cloud manager, means for selecting a plurality of web resources for the web application at the remote cloud manager, the plurality of web resources located at at least one cloud provider, means for identifying a plurality of authored works for the web application, and means for synchronizing the plurality of web resources and the authored works to deploy the web application to a cloud provider.","Yet another aspect is a method for facilitated concurrent synchronization of a web application to a plurality of cloud providers. The method includes selecting a plurality of web resources for the web application at the remote cloud manager. The plurality of web resources is located at a plurality of cloud providers. The method also includes identifying a plurality of authored works for the web application. The method also includes concurrently synchronizing the plurality of web resources and the authored works at the plurality of cloud providers.","Yet another aspect is a method for facilitated concurrent synchronization of a web application to a plurality of cloud providers. The method includes selecting a plurality of web resources for the web application at a remote cloud manager. The plurality of web resources is located at a plurality of cloud providers. The method also includes identifying a plurality of authored works for the web application. The method also includes synchronizing a first plurality of web resources and the authored works for the web application to a first of the plurality of cloud providers and concurrently synchronizing a second plurality of web resources and the authored works for the web application to a second of the plurality of cloud providers.","Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention provides a novel system and method for a user to develop a web application such as a web site, deploy the web application for access over the Internet, manage and monitor the web application to ensure adequate resources are provided during times of heavy traffic such as heavy viewing of a web site.","As shown in , B and C, a system  generally includes a cloud manager  having a cloud manager API , a primary cloud provider , a secondary cloud provider and a second secondary cloud provider . A web application  is located at the primary cloud provider . The cloud manager  communicates over a network, such as network  shown in , directly with the web application , the primary cloud provider , the secondary cloud provider and the second secondary cloud provider . Those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that the system may only include one cloud provider, or more than three cloud providers. A developer\/user  operating from a user interface  also communicates with the remote manager . Preferably, the network is the Internet. As shown in , the cloud manager  can also communicate with an internal IT site . The cloud manager  can transfer the web application from and to a provision state, from and to a staging state and from and to a live state. The cloud manager  allows the developer  to monitor the performance of the web application. The cloud manager  automatically wires web resources from the cloud providers  and  to the web application as needed depending on the load activity on the web application .","The cloud manager  is preferably an abstraction layer that can utilize multiple cloud providers for a single web application. The cloud manager  allows for facilitated synchronization of a web application to a cloud provider and concurrent synchronization to multiple cloud providers. Thus, if a web application  requires additional web resources, the cloud manager  can simultaneously contact multiple cloud providers and simultaneously allocate web resources from multiple cloud providers to the web application . The cloud manager  can pull in new servers based on the load activity of a web application. The cloud manager  is preferably includes a universal cloud API which allows for access to and allocation of web resources from multiple cloud providers. The cloud manager  can also be programmed to provide a predetermined return on investment for a developer wherein the cloud manager  allocates resources based on a monetary return from increased activity on a web application. The developer  can set limits on the resources or expenses for the web application, or set ratios for return on investment.","The cloud manager  can also move a web application to VMware for virtualization purposes. Thus, the cloud manager  can take a web site that is live and pull it back to a VMware image. The cloud manager  also allows a developer  to validate a web site in a staging state before going live with the web site. The developer  can validate the web site from a user interface . Further, the cloud manager  allows for team control of a web site so that various developers can access and control a web application .","A user interface  (also referred to as UI) is typically a computer which includes a processing means for interacting with various input and output devices (\u201cI\/O devices\u201d), and various networks. The I\/O Devices can be drives, a keyboard, a display, a scanner, a mouse and the like. The processing means typically includes a CPU such as an INTEL PENTIUM\u2122 processor or the like. The processing means also preferably includes a memory (random access memory and read only memory) and interfaces for communicating with networks and the I\/O Devices.","An integrated development environment (\u201cIDE\u201d), such as disclosed in Colton et al., U.S. patent Ser. No. 12\/264,882, filed Nov. 4, 2008, for a System And Method For Developing, Deploying, Managing And Monitoring A Web Application In Single Environment which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, may be used with the system and method disclosed herein. The IDE provides a user  with the tools necessary to build a Web application such as a Web site. One such IDE is set forth at aptana.com, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The APTANA IDE is an open-source, cross-platform, JAVA script-focused development environment for preferably building AJAX applications. However, those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that other IDEs may be utilized without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. The IDE is provided to facilitate the development of software applications or other software programs by one or more software developers. The IDE can include one or more servers, workstations, and other components, as well as languages, compliers, editors, and other tools used by developers in the development environment. The IDE is preferably confined to a single geographic location or alternatively can be distributed across a plurality of geographic locations. A geographically diverse configuration would typically include one or more communication channels (networks or otherwise) among the various development locations to allow for a collaborative work environment. The IDE includes a suite of tools to assist in Web application development projects. Various aspects of a preferred IDE are described below in conjunction with the system and method.","The primary cloud provider , first secondary cloud provider and second secondary cloud provider , and any other cloud providers, each provide Web resources that may be used for the Web application . The Web resources are primarily servers, owned by a third party provider (such as the AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD, JOYENT, and GOOGLE APPS) such that the user does not need to make a substantial investment in computer hardware and can scale resources depending on the user's needs.","The cloud manager  automatically manages the Web resource needs of the Web application . The cloud manager  provisions the Web application , syncs the Web application , and automatically provides scalability for the Web application . A more detailed explanation of the cloud manager is provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["23","25","25","23","25","60","60","65","60","65","32","32","23","63","62"]},"In an example of a preferred embodiment, the portal index page is at com.aptana.ide.server.jetty\/content\/index.html.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"function setup ( )",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"{",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003dojo.require( \u201cdojox.cometd\u201d) ;",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003dojo.connect (dojox.cometd, \u201cfinishInit\u201d,",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003function (type, data, evt, request) {",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003dojox.cometd.subscribe (",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u201c\/portal\/portlets\/\u201d+ dojox.cometd.clientId,",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u201cechoRpcReturn\u201d",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003);",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003}",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2003) ;",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Dojox.cometd.init(\u201c\/cometd\u201d);",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The flow preferably involves the initial portal index page requesting a list of portlets from \/portlal\/portlets. The IDE  returns a list of configured portlets and URL to request a bootstrap JavaScript code (e.g., \/portlets\/cloud). The portal index page executes the bootstrap code to alter the model and the user interface as appropriate per portlet. The portlet can continue to request new files and resources from for example \/portlets\/portlet_id\/sub urls (\/portlets\/cloud\/images\/cloud_portlet_banner.png).","The MyCloud Servlets involve comet architecture that specifies channels for publishing and subscription. A common model involves a client subscribing to a client-id specific channel, but publishing on a generic channel. For example, a client subscribes to \/portal.portlets.a1234564, the client publishes to \/portal\/portlets, with published implicitly including the client ID. The return messages are routed to the specific channel subscribed to by the user. Alternatively, the return messages are routed to a global \u201cbroadcast\u201d channel, such as \/projects.","The portal is preferably an AJAX Web application that operates on top of the internal Jetty server  and communicates with the IDE  through comet . End users access the portal through IDE buttons, and the basics of starting up and debugging are briefly discussed below. In order to ensure that no XHR requests remain unterminated (or waiting to time out) when the portal is closed and then re-opened, the IDE  completely terminates the internal JETTY server  every time that a user closes the portal view. As such, the portal needs to use a different port every time, starting with 8500 and incrementing by 1 each subsequent time the portal is loaded. Similarly, the cometd server runs on its own port, starting with 8600. For the portal to load properly, the portal should preferably be requested as follows: http:\/\/localhost: [port number]\/index.html?port=[comet port number]. For debugging the portal, the log output contains every major action logged preferably using FIREBUG. Therefore, a review of the log output should identify the problem.","URL parameters are used to have the portal load with specific content rather than the default \u201cHome\u201d page. A specific tab is loaded with a query string pram: tab having possible values of \u2018my_aptana\u2019 or \u2018my_cloud\u2019, for example, http:\/\/localhost:8500\/index.html?port=8600&tab=my cloud. To a load a specific site in \u201cMy Cloud\u201d query string param: siteId with possible values of any site Id for the logged in user for example: http:\/\/localhost:8500\/index.htmI?port=8600&tab=my cloud&siteId=1234.","To deploy a project to the Cloud, query string param: project. Possible Values are any undeployed project (url encoded, case-sensitive), for example: http:\/\/localhost:8500\/index.html?port=8600&project=MyCoolProject.","To start at a specific product in \u201cMy Aptana\u201d, query string param: product. Possible Values are studio, plugins, jaxer and cloud. For example: http:\/\/localhost:8500\/index.html?port=8600&product=plugins.","The servlet listing returns JSON data. Preferably, JSON data will be parsed, not evaluated.

Each object has a unique location that is used to obtain and update the remote model for the object. The core model object  also interfaces with the ISynchronizableObject. Each object has a core set of methods to synchronize with the remote model. The core set of methods include the following: commit; update; perform action; and delete. The core model object  interfaces with the ITransformObject. Each object is able to serialize and de-serialize itself from either the remote format received from the Site Manager or the format obtained from the local data store when the Site Manager is unreachable. The core model object  further interfaces with the IModifiableObject. Each object is able to detect changes in the model and notify listeners when model changes occur.

By way of example, the user, who is deploying project \u201cgullwing,\u201d is asked to enter a preferred Web site name for project \u201cgullwing,\u201d such as \u201ccars90210.\u201d APTANA Cloud then determines whether the preferred Web site name (\u201ccars90210\u201d) is available. At step two, the user selects among various service plans available for the Cloud project. During the third step in deploying a project to Cloud, the user sets up enters his user information or sets up a new user account. Additional steps in deploying a project to Cloud include setting up billing information, accepting the Cloud services agreement, and confirming and placing the order. Upon placement of the order, the Web page is displayed, notifying the user that the site is being provisioned. Provisioning the site preferably includes the following steps: (1) contacting APTANA Cloud; (2) setting up the necessary servers; and (3) configuring the Web site.","Once a site has been provisioned on APTANA Cloud, a user may monitor the status of that Web site.  illustrates the particular My Cloud information for a selected site that is displayed to the user.
