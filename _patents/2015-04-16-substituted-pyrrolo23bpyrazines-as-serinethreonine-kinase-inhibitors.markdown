The present compounds are selective inhibitors of ERK. The present invention further relates to methods for treating cancer or hyperproliferative diseases with compounds within the scope of the present invention.","The processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand-bound cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK's) such as erbB family, PDGF, FGF, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of an RTK induces a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf, a serine-threonine kinase.","Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK1\/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1\/2. When activated, ERK1\/2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK\/MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation, and it is believed that the ERK\/MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes, which are upstream of ERK1\/2, are mutated in several cancers including colorectal, melanoma, breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition, mutations of BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase of the Raf family, are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas (60%), thyroid cancers (greater than 40%) and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERK1\/2 signaling pathway is an attractive pathway for anticancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumors. (M. Hohno and J. Pouyssegur, 2003 5:219)","Therefore, small-molecular inhibitors of ERK activity (i.e., ERK1 and ERK2 activity) would be useful for treating a broad spectrum of cancers, such as, for example, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Such a contribution is provided by this invention.","There is a continuing need for new and novel therapeutic agents which can be used for cancer and hyperproliferative conditions. The Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway is an important signaling pathway which is frequently over-expressed and\/or overactive in many cancerous tissues. Design and development of new pharmaceutical compounds is essential.","In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound according to formula I wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"19.73mm","wi":"52.07mm","file":"US09382257-20160705-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Ris an optionally substituted heteroaryl selected from the group consisting of N-aralkyl-pyrazole, pyridinyl and pyrimidinyl.","Ris an optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted heteraryl wherein said heteroaryl group is selected from the group consisting of pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, indolinyl, quinolinyl and indazolinyl.","wherein each said phenyl, said aralkyl or said heteroaryl is optionally independently substituted with one to three groups selected from the group consisting of:","Calkyl,","Chaloalkyl,","Chydroxyalkyl,","Calkoxy,","Chaloalkoxy,","Ccycloalkyl-Calkoxy,","hydroxyl,","halogen,","(k) (CH)NRR,","(l) X(CH)NRRwherein Xis NH or O,","(n) NHNRR,","(o) cyano,","(p) nitro,","(q) CONRR,","(r) (CR)Ar wherein Ar is a phenyl, pyridinyl or quinolinyl optionally substituted with one to three groups independently selected from the group consisting of Calkyl, Chaloalky, Calkoxy, Chaloalkoxy, cyano and nitro and Ris independently in each occurrence hydrogen or Calkyl; and,","(s) optionally substituted O(CH)Ar.","Rand Rare independently hydrogen or Calkyl, Ccycloalkyl, optionally substituted benzyl, Cacyl, 5-methyl-isoxazole-3-carbonyl, 2-methyl-3H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl, 2,5-dimethyl-oxazole-4-carbonyl, pyrazine-2-carbonyl or Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a cyclic amine.","In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound as described herein.

In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for treat a hyperproliferative condition or cancer with an ERK inhibitor as described herein.","The phrase \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d entity as used herein refers to one or more of that entity; for example, a compound refers to one or more compounds or at least one compound. As such, the terms \u201ca\u201d (or \u201can\u201d), \u201cone or more\u201d, and \u201cat least one\u201d can be used interchangeably herein.","The phrase \u201cas defined herein above\u201d refers to the broadest definition for each group as provided in the Summary of the Invention or the broadest claim. In all other embodiments provided below, substituents which can be present in each embodiment and which are not explicitly defined retain the broadest definition provided in the Summary of the Invention.","As used in this specification, whether in a transitional phrase or in the body of the claim, the terms \u201ccomprise(s)\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are to be interpreted as having an open-ended meaning That is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases \u201chaving at least\u201d or \u201cincluding at least\u201d. When used in the context of a process, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the process includes at least the recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or components, but may also include additional features or components.","The term \u201cindependently\u201d is used herein to indicate that a variable is applied in any one instance without regard to the presence or absence of a variable having that same or a different definition within the same compound. Thus, in a compound in which R\u2033 appears twice and is defined as \u201cindependently carbon or nitrogen\u201d, both R\u2033s can be carbon, both R\u2033s can be nitrogen, or one R\u2033 can be carbon and the other nitrogen.","When any variable (e.g., R, R, Ar, Xor Het) occurs more than one time in any moiety or formula depicting and describing compounds employed or claimed in the present invention, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and\/or variables are permissible only if such compounds result in stable compounds.","The symbols \u201c*\u201d at the end of a bond or \u201c------\u201d drawn through a bond each refer to the point of attachment of a functional group or other chemical moiety to the rest of the molecule of which it is a part. Thus, for example:","MeC(\u2550O)ORwherein",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0037"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"23.96mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US09382257-20160705-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A bond drawn into ring system (as opposed to connected at a distinct vertex) indicates that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.","The term \u201coptional\u201d or \u201coptionally\u201d as used herein means that a subsequently described event or circumstance may, but need not, occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, \u201coptionally substituted\u201d means that the optionally substituted moiety may incorporate a hydrogen or a substituent.","The term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to mean approximately, in the region of, roughly, or around. When the term \u201cabout\u201d is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20%.","As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus, for a variable which is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any integer value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable which is inherently continuous, the variable can be equal to any real value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an example, a variable which is described as having values between 0 and 2, can be 0, 1 or 2 for variables which are inherently discrete, and can be 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real value for variables which are inherently continuous.","Compounds of formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates while; in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto\/enol (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH-\u21c4-C(\u2014OH)\u2550CH\u2014), amide\/imidic acid (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NH-\u21c4-C(\u2014OH)\u2550N\u2014) and amidine (\u2014C(\u2550NR)\u2014NH-\u21c4-C(\u2014NHR)\u2550N\u2014) tautomers. The latter two are particularly common in heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings and the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds.","It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that some of the compounds of formula I may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore exist in two or more stereoisomeric forms. The racemates of these isomers, the individual isomers and mixtures enriched in one enantiomer, as well as diastereomers when there are two chiral centers, and mixtures partially enriched with specific diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention. It will be further appreciated by the skilled artisan that substitution of the tropane ring can be in either endo- or exo-configuration, and the present invention covers both configurations. The present invention includes all the individual stereoisomers (e.g. enantiomers), racemic mixtures or partially resolved mixtures of the compounds of formulae I and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms thereof.","The racemates can be used as such or can be resolved into their individual isomers. The resolution can afford stereochemically pure compounds or mixtures enriched in one or more isomers. Methods for separation of isomers are well known (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in \u201c\u201d, Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) and include physical methods such as chromatography using a chiral adsorbent. Individual isomers can be prepared in chiral form from chiral precursors. Alternatively individual isomers can be separated chemically from a mixture by forming diastereomeric salts with a chiral acid, such as the individual enantiomers of 10-camphorsulfonic acid, camphoric acid, .alpha.-bromocamphoric acid, tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, malic acid, pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, and the like, fractionally crystallizing the salts, and then freeing one or both of the resolved bases, optionally repeating the process, so as obtain either or both substantially free of the other; i.e., in a form having an optical purity of >95%. Alternatively the racemates can be covalently linked to a chiral compound (auxiliary) to produce diastereomers which can be separated by chromatography or by fractional crystallization after which time the chiral auxiliary is chemically removed to afford the pure enantiomers.","The compounds of formula I may contain a basic center and suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples of salts of inorganic acids include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate. Examples of salts of organic acids include acetate, fumarate, pamoate, aspartate, besylate, carbonate, bicarbonate, camsylate, D and L-lactate, D and L-tartrate, esylate, mesylate, malonate, orotate, gluceptate, methylsulfate, stearate, glucuronate, 2-napsylate, tosylate, hibenzate, nicotinate, isethionate, malate, maleate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, esylate, and pamoate salts. For a review on suitable salts see Berge et al, 1977 66:1-19 and G. S. Paulekuhn et al. 2007 50:6665.","The terms \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to therapeutic treatment wherein the object is to slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, limiting the extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.","The phrase \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

The range of ERK binding activities was less than 1 nM (nanomolar) to about 10 \u03bcM (micromolar). A cell-based function assay (Example 9) was used to determine the effect of ERK inhibitors on down-stream signaling by assaying phosphorylation of P90RSK.","The cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of formula I exemplary compounds was measured by: establishing a proliferating mammalian tumor cell line in a cell culture medium, adding a formula I compound, culturing the cells for a period from about 6 h to about 5 d; and measuring cell viability (Example 8). Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC), cytotoxicity (EC).","The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of the invention and at least one therapeutically inert carrier, diluent or excipient, as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. In one example, compounds of Formula I with the desired degree of purity may be formulated by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a dosage form at ambient temperature and at the appropriate pH. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but typically ranges anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of Formula I is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, the compounds of Formula I are sterile.

Typically such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the patient as a whole.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package.

When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.","An example of a suitable oral dosage form is a tablet containing about 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30 mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40 mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1-10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound, for example 5-400 mg, of the invention in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such as sodium chloride, if desired. The solution may be filtered, e.g., using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants.","In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition also includes at least one additional anti-proliferative agent.","An embodiment, therefore, includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, tautomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","The compounds of formula I may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of formula I is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above co-administered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of formula I and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided.
