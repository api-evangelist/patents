Conclusion"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/359,168, filed Jun. 28, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Not applicable.","Not applicable","Not applicable.","1. Field of the Invention","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to a fitting for use in fuel gas systems and applications using the same.","2. Background Art","Fuel gas systems (e.g., propane or natural gas piping systems for distribution and metering of fuel gas to end users such as business and residential customers) are generally closed systems without ready access into the system for such purposes as: a) leak testing; b) testing of differential pressures in rotary and diaphragm meters; c) supplying gas from a cylinder to the system while maintenance is performed such as meter and regulator replacement; and d) testing operation of a relief valve.","Prior art fittings for accessing fuel gas systems have flexible seats or seals held in a housing through which access to the system requires the use of metal probes or needles which are forced through the seats and into the system. The use of lubrication between the probes or needles and the flexible seats is required when using such prior art fittings. The seats can leak below 45 degrees Fahrenheit due to memory problems. Further, such prior art fittings require the use of safety goggles and gloves because the probes can potentially \u201cblow out\u201d of the fitting and cause injury.","Another way that that access into the system could be provided would be by providing permanent bypass valves and associated piping in the system. However, providing such permanent bypass valves and piping is both expensive and difficult with which to work.","With respect to leak testing, fuel gas leaks, including propane and natural gas leaks, can cause serious problems from both a health and safety standpoint. For example, fires resulting from such leaks can cause both property damage and personal injury including, in some cases, death.","At present, two tests are generally required as set out in NFPA Pamphlet 54, a safety code that applies to the installation of fuel gas piping systems, appliances, equipment, and related accessories. First, a pressure test must be performed on the piping installed in a fuel gas system. The second test that must be performed is a leak test on the functional fuel gas system.","The pressure test is usually performed at 1\u00bd times the system working pressure, but not less than 3 psig. Thus, fuel gas appliances or other devices must not be connected to the system so appliance controls are not damaged. Also, air or inert gas is used instead of the anticipated fuel to be used during normal operations. As such, the air or inert gas must generally be purged from the system prior to use of the selected fuel.","The leak test is generally performed after appliances or other such devices are attached to the fuel gas system and can be performed with the fuel gas that is used in the system. As such, the leak test is designed to test for leaks in the entire system, including the fuel delivery source location, regulators, meters, piping, and appliance control modules. Further, a leak test is also required anytime there has been an interruption in the fuel gas system (e.g., an interruption in service).","Additionally, access to fuel gas systems is required for performing testing of differential pressures in rotary and diaphragm meters, supplying gas from a cylinder to the system while maintenance is performed such as meter and regulator replacement, and testing operation of a relief valve.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a fitting is for use in a fuel gas system having an access port for providing access to the system. The fitting includes a fitting body and a valve core. The fitting body includes: a first end for providing mating connection of the fitting body to the access port, a second end for providing connection of an accessory to the fitting body, and a central bore of at least 13\/64\u2033 completely through the fitting along a longitudinal axis thereof providing an opening completely through the fitting body between the first end and the second end. The valve core is removably received in a valve receiving means of the fitting body, and includes a valve operator actuatable to open a fluid connection between the first end and the second end. The valve core is removable from the fitting body so that a full, unobstructed volume of the central bore can be available for a flow of fuel gas into the fuel gas system.","According to one implementation, the first end includes \u00bc\u2033 MNPT threads for providing the mating connection of the fitting body to the access port, and the second end includes 7\/16-20 UNF threads for providing connection of the accessory to the fitting body.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method is for supplying fuel gas from an alternate fuel source to a fuel gas system while upstream maintenance is performed. The method includes: providing a shutoff valve downstream of the maintenance to be performed; providing an access port downstream of the shutoff valve, the access port for providing access to the fuel gas system; and installing a fitting in the access port.

Continuing with the method, the method further includes: attaching an alternate fuel supply to the fuel supply receiving port; attaching the swivel connector to the second end of the fitting; removing the valve core from the fitting using the core removal rod; retracting the core removal rod and the valve core through the ball valve, allowing the alternate fuel supply to communicate with the fuel gas system through the full, unobstructed volume of the central bore; closing the ball valve; and closing the shutoff valve so that the fuel gas system is supplied by fuel gas from the alternate fuel source while maintenance is performed upstream of the shutoff valve.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method is for testing for leaks in a fuel gas system having an access port for providing access to the system and a valve positioned upstream of the access port. The method includes installing a fitting in the access port. The fitting includes: a fitting body including a first end for providing mating connection of the fitting body to the access port, a second end for providing connection of an accessory to the fitting body to, and a central bore along a longitudinal axis thereof providing an opening completely through the fitting body between the first end and the second end; and a valve core removably received in a valve core receiving means in the fitting body and including a valve operator actuatable to open a fluid connection between the first end and the second end.

Examples of such gases include, but are not limited to, natural gas, propane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, butane, argon, propylene, air, fluorocarbons such as refrigerants, and helium. Typically, connector  is an integral outlet port that forms part of the portable cylinder  so as to provide access to the compressed gas.","The control valve  is located downstream to control flow of the compressed gas from the portable cylinder  to the fuel gas system. In exemplary embodiments, the control valve can comprise a conventional valve such as a needle valve, a shutoff valve, or a ball valve.","The bleeder valve  is used to selectively \u201cbleed off\u201d some of the pressure, i.e., to reduce pressure in the system downstream of the bleeder valve  to a value below the designed working pressures of gas regulators so that a test instrument device, such as a gauge, water manometer, or other suitable instrument, can communicate with, i.e., is used to measure parameters associated with, the complete gas system.","The instrument fitting  is installed in the assembly  so as to enable the test instrument device G to be attached to the assembly  and used to obtain pressure readings used to perform leak and pressure tests.

The regulator  is capable of delivering a pressure that is adequate for testing fuel gas systems at the designed working pressure of the fuel gas system at a the desired test location (e.g., 7\u2033 WC, 11\u2033 WC, 10 psi, and 30 psi and the static pressure of the compressed gas in cylinder ). This enables pressure testing and leak testing to be carried out prior to the initial service connection to a gas supply.","The assembly  described above can be used with a number of different fuel gas systems, including any domestic or industrial gas system utilizing vapor that can be isolated from a fuel supply at the supply source (e.g., a gas main or a propane tank).

In these embodiments, the assembly  is attached to the fuel gas system (e.g., , fuel gas system ) by the connector or adaptor  and the control valve  is opened and then closed. When this is done, the system is thereby pressurized from the portable cylinder  to a desired pressure. After releasing a recommended amount of pressure depending on the application, using the bleeder valve , the pressure of the complete system, including the fuel gas system and the assembly , is then observed, using the test instrument device G received in fitting , for any increases or decreases in pressure readings. This is done for a period of time sufficient to satisfy any Federal, State, and Local codes for the particular industry regulatory authority. In general, an increase in observed pressure indicates that the fuel gas system is being fed by a pressure source while a decrease in pressure indicates that there is a leak in the fuel gas system, which can then be located and repaired.","Returning to , as previously indicated, the first exemplary fitting and the second exemplary fitting are positioned on either side of the meter  to allow access into the system  for differential pressure testing of the meter .","Advantageously, the exemplary fitting (e.g., , fitting ), or a fitting having a bore smaller than 13\/64 inch (since this application only requires detecting pressures on either side of the meter ), provides ease of use, allowing the differential pressure testing of the meter  to be conducted without the use of tools, probes, safety glasses, or gloves, and eliminates any possibility that a lubricated probe could \u201cblow out\u201d and potentially cause injury.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","102","510","100","110","108","600","628","630","628","632","628","634","630","632","636","628","630","638","636","632","630"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["600","628","630","640","634","636","638"]},"Referring now to , , and , the portable cylinder assembly  is used with the core removal tool  to supply fuel gas to the fuel gas system  while maintenance is performed, such as meter and regulator replacement, according to the following sequence of steps.","In a first step, a gauge is attached directly to the fitting  to determine an operating pressure of the system to be serviced. This gauge is then removed.","Then, a regulator  having the appropriate operating pressure characteristics is connected to the compressed gas cylinder  (i.e., an alternate fuel supply) to provide adequate pressure to operate the system.
