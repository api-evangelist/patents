No. 61\/080,697, entitled \u201cAUTOMATIC PROFILE UPDATE IN A MOBILE DEVICE\u201d filed Jul. 15, 2008, the entirety of which is incorporated herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention, in general, relates to electronic business cards. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of exchanging electronic business cards through mobile phones between a user and contacts of the user. The contacts of the user may comprise personal and business contacts of the user.","2. Description of the Related Art","Electronically cataloging traditional business cards may be time consuming and prone to error. Business card information logged into an electronic contact management system may become obsolete over a period of time. The user may run out of the traditional business cards for exchange with the user's business contacts. The user may need to track relationship context along with the business card information of the user's business contacts to make note of context information such as place, time, relationship with a particular business contact, etc. The user may also need to send updates to the business card information of the user to user's business contacts in real time. The updates to the user's business card information may comprise a change in job profile, address, phone number or email address of the user. The user may also need to stay updated on the latest business card information of the user's business contacts at all times.","The user may also lose electronic business cards received from user's business contacts due to loss, malfunction, or replacement of the user's mobile device. Therefore, for an instance of loss of the electronic business cards, the user may need a backup of the electronic business cards of the user's personal and business contacts to retrieve the electronic business cards back on the mobile device of the user. The user may also want to send updated contact information to new business contacts through the user's mobile device automatically without user intervention. Existing online service providers' provide communication means to exchange business card information through web sites and electronic mails (emails), and business card scans stored on computer. The communication means provided by the existing online service providers may not capture the context of the exchange, for example, time and date of exchange, user notes, location, etc., nor may it capture social media information (e.g. blogs, LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter information). However, means to exchange the business card information instantly using mobile phones may not be provided by the online service providers.","Therefore, there is need for a method and a system that enables the user to exchange electronic business cards instantly through the user's mobile phone, share business card information (including social media information and context) with the user's business contacts, and capture context of meetings with the business contacts. There is also a need for the method and the system for storing the electronic business cards of the user's business contacts on a central server as a backup means. There is also a need for the method and the system to automatically update modified business card information of the user's business contacts on the user's mobile device and vice versa.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described in the detailed description of the invention. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential inventive concepts of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The method and system disclosed herein provides a mobile client on a requestor's first mobile device. The requestor provides requestor profile to an information exchange server through the mobile client. The requestor requests a connection with the recipient using the mobile client. The mobile client is provided on a recipient's second mobile device. The recipient provides recipient profile to the information exchange server through the mobile client. On acceptance of the request for connection by the recipient, the information exchange server transfers the recipient profile to the mobile client on the requestor's first mobile device and vice versa. The mobile client automatically updates the transferred recipient profile on the requestor's first mobile device based on changes made by the recipient to the recipient profile and vice versa.","Particular embodiments of the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-2","b":["201","203","201","203","201","203"]},"Although the description refers to the requestor  as the party asking for the recipient's  profile information, it is to be understood that the requestor  and the recipient  may change roles, such that the recipient  may be the one asking for the requestor's  profile information. However, for clarity and to avoid confusion, the description will refer to the requestor  as the one asking for profile information from at least one or more other recipients .","The method disclosed herein provides mobile client on a first mobile device  of the requestor . The requestor  may download and install the mobile client from a host website via a network  onto the first mobile device . The mobile client is compatible for installation on mobile devices working on different technological platforms and operating systems, for example, Java, Symbian, Windows, Mac, iPhone, Linux, Unix, Palm, etc.","The requestor  then provides  requestor profile to an information exchange server  of the host website through the mobile client via the network . The requestor  may also use browser based computing devices to provide the requestor profile on the host website on the internet directly. The requestor  then requests  for a connection with the recipient  through the information exchange server  using the mobile client as shown in the user interface  of . At box , the requestor  may generate and send (at box ) the request as a short message service (SMS), an electronic mail (email), or through push notification (if the recipient is registered in the system the requestor may use the user ID of the recipient  instead of the SMS or email) via the information exchange server  to a second mobile device  of the recipient  using the mobile client as illustrated in . The status of the various generated requests may be shown at box . Various types of information may be included in the user interface , such as active screen information (box ), or logos and or other types of advertisement information (at boxes , ).","The request may be described as an \u201cidentification code\u201d or ID code that initiates a set of instructions to be performed and controlled by the information exchange server . Specifically, the identification code might contain an access code along with a key or hash function, a call to the specific API or API function, and\/or any other type of required data to execute the appropriate function or functions. The function might consist of a profile transfer request to or from the recipient  or the requester , or any other function the user could perform through the mobile application. In one example, the access code and key may be a unique code and key which is established or loaded onto the mobile device ,  when the user first registers, logs in, or uses the mobile client on the mobile device , . In such an embodiment, the mobile device may provide the access code and key, and\/or associated data information, to all transmissions along with the API request and appropriate data to provide the identity of the device, the user, and the appropriate instructions. The access code and key might also be a user name and password which are passed to the information exchange server  along with the API or instruction request and related data.","The identification code may be associated with various types of information, including but not limited to an access code, a key, a hash function, an API request or call, data required to perform the API request, information about the mobile device, location based information, a user, a user's preferences, the mobile device capabilities, profile information of a user, a social or professional event, a group, a centralized group coordinator, and any other type of data in accordance with this invention.","Another important aspect about the present invention is the ability for the system to obtain, pull, or retrieve information about the mobile device used by the requestor  or the recipient . Such information might include the type of mobile device, platform and version, carrier information, profile information, and location based information. The system will know if a user changes mobile devices, the capabilities of the mobile device, if the user had updated software, or changes information about their mobile device. The profile and location data can be used to identify users about software upgrades, version conflicts, and location based services including internet access to GPS location of lost mobile devices.","In more detail, it is to be understood that various types of information may be made available to the information exchange server  during signaling in accordance with systems and methods of this invention, similar to the information exchanged when a mobile device registers (either as a push or a pull inquiry) with its serving network. At registration, and likewise when as here the mobile device signals into the network , information about the particular device being used, such as the location of the mobile device, the user's profile, user preferences, and the like, may be shared with the information exchange server . For various reasons, this information may be used by the information exchange server  to coordinate the type of messaging that should be prepared and sent to an intended mobile device recipient. For example, one user, and\/or serving network for the mobile device of the user, may set a preference to receive SMS messages on his mobile device, while another user may prefer to receive email messages on their mobile device or at another device location. The information exchange server  is equipped to handle such translation and requests appropriately for the particular preference appropriately.","An \u201cevent\u201d may be a one-to-one communication encounter, a one-to-many communication encounters, a social or personal meeting, and other engagement or environment in which contact profile information is generally exchanged amongst various people. Although the request is described above as a SMS or an email to communicate back to the information exchange server , it is to be understood that any type of push or messaging protocol may be employed, including but not limited to, MMS, USSD, a dedicated short code, and or any other suitable messaging protocol capable of sending a request. The requestor  may also use other communications means, for example, infrared data transfer, Bluetooth, WiFi or WiMax, etc, to send the request to the recipient's  second mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIGS. 8B-8K"],"b":["800","202","800","801","802","801","803","804","803","805","801","800"],"i":"a "},"The information exchange server  then provides  the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device  for acceptance of the request from the requestor . The information exchange server  may provide a hyperlink in an SMS or in an email sent by the requestor . The recipient  may click on the hyperlink in the SMS or the email for downloading the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device . The recipient  may then download and configure the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device . The recipient  then provides  the recipient profile to the information exchange server  through the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device .","The recipient  may accept the request from the requestor  through information exchange server  on the recipient's  second mobile device  as illustrated in . On acceptance of the request by the recipient , the information exchange server  may establish the connection between the requestor's  first mobile device  and the recipient's  second mobile device . In one embodiment, the information exchange server  may establish the connection between the requestor  and the recipient  via the SMS or the email before the mobile client is downloaded and configured by the recipient  on the recipient's  second mobile device .","On acceptance of the request from the requestor  by the recipient , the information exchange server  transfers  the recipient profile and the requestor profile to the mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  and the recipient's  second mobile device  respectively. The information exchange server  first transfers the recipient profile to the requestor's  first mobile device . The information exchange server  then transfers the requestor profile to the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device . Although the exchange of each of the requestor's  and recipient's  profile information , is being sent from the information exchange server , it is to be understood that profile information , may be sent directly between the first mobile device  and the second mobile device , without having to go through the information exchange server . In such instances, copies of the profile information , may be sent back to the information exchange server  to update the information exchange server's  profile information , records.","The mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  may store the transferred recipient profile of the recipient  as a recipient business card. The mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device  may also store the transferred requestor profile as a requestor electronic business card. For example, the mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  may update a requestor address book on the requestor's  first mobile device  by storing the electronic business card of the recipient  in the requestor address book ","The mobile client then automatically updates  the transferred recipient profile on the requestor's  first mobile device  and the transferred requestor profile on the recipient's  second mobile device  based on changes made to the recipient profile and the requestor profile by the recipient  and the requestor  respectively. The recipient  may make changes to the recipient profile on the information exchange server  using the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device . The recipient  may make the changes to the recipient profile due to changes in one or more of job profile of the recipient , address of the recipient , phone number of the recipient , email address of the recipient , or any information or data stored or included in the recipient profile.","If the recipient  makes changes to the recipient profile on the information exchange server , the information exchange server  may automatically transfer the changes made by the recipient  to the mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device . The automatic transfer may be in real time or near real time or pushed at logical intervals. For example, the mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  and the information exchange server  may have a persistent interne protocol (IP) connection. The requestor  may then subscribe to receive the changes made by the recipient  automatically through the information exchange server  in real time. The mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  may then automatically update the transferred recipient profile on the requestor's  first mobile device  with the changes made by the recipient  to the recipient profile . The mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  may also automatically update the electronic business card of the recipient  with the changes to the recipient information in the requestor address book of the requestor's  first mobile device . In addition, rather than a full time connection or periodic request, the system may employ a push technology or ping technology which acts when a profile is updated. The exchange server  upon receiving updated profile information would trigger an automatic push of the new information to the mobile device, with or without notification, or might ping the mobile device to accept the updated information.","Similarly, if the requestor  makes changes to the requestor profile on the information exchange server , the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device  may also receive the changes from the information exchange server . The mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device  may then automatically update the transferred requestor profile on the recipient's  second mobile device  automatically with the changes made by the requestor  to the requestor profile . The mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device  may also automatically update the electronic business card of the requestor  with the changes to the recipient information in the recipient address book of the recipient's  second mobile device . The requestor  and the recipient  may also update one or more personal and business contacts selectively on the requestor's  first mobile device  and the recipient's  second mobile device  respectively. The mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device  and the recipient's  second mobile device  may also send requests to the information exchange server  at predefined intervals to automatically receive the changes to the recipient profile and the requestor profile respectively.","The requestor  may have access to the recipient profile of the recipient  on one or more of the social network websites. The requestor  may then import and store the recipient profile of the recipient  from the social network websites directly onto the requestor's  first mobile device  through the mobile client on the requestor's  first mobile device . The information exchange server  may then automatically establish a connection between the requestor  and the recipient  when the requestor  imports and stores the recipient profile on the requestor's  first mobile device  using the mobile client . The recipient  may also import and store the requestor profile of the requestor  from the social network websites directly onto the recipient's  second mobile device  through the mobile client on the recipient's  second mobile device .

Various commercially available location based services may be used, such as for example, GPS, cell tower triangulation techniques, and any other suitable position locating technology.","The CRM contact management system  may be used in combination with the systems and methods of this invention in such a way that proprietary sales data information about a carrier's vendors and their partners may be securely shared with a proprietary sales person in the carriers  employ. In more detail, an aspect of this invention is to allow the carrier employee access to carrier's client database while under carrier's employ. However, carte blanche access may not be desired by the carrier. Consequently, certain identity information about the carrier's proprietary contact information may be masked so that if the employee should leave the carrier's employ, the carrier employee will be disconnected from acquiring access to the carrier client database, as well as lacking the ability to further access the carrier's client database. It is to be understood that various types of contact managements systems may be employed, such as, Siebel on Demand, Sales Force, as well as other contact management databases such as LinkedIn, MS Dynamics, Twitter, MySpace, and any other now known or later discovered contact management database.","The Location Based Service  element can operate in a variety of different ways. According to a first embodiment, a one-to-one social encounter may take place in which a requestor  and a recipient  encounter each other. Although the one-to-one social encounter has been described in detail with respect to , an additional aspect of this scenario is such that the location based service  may be integrated into the one-to-one encounter. This feature would allow a requestor  and a recipient  having a mobile client installed on each of their phones respectively, to exchange profile information without the need to manually enter an email address, an identification code or a phone number. Employing the location based service , equipped for example with GPS or cell tower triangulation techniques, and within predetermined time interval, the information exchange server  may match and compare incoming exchange requests and present participating users with a list of available participating users. That is, where the requester  and a recipient  desire to share profile information , , both the requestor  and the recipient  may initiate the exchange of their profile information nearly simultaneously by, for example, selecting an assigned button on their respective mobile devices , . LBS  may then determine whether the requestor  and the recipient  are proximally close to each other and have both selected to share their profile information at approximately the same time with each other. The need to identify and associate a specific ID code with the encounter may not be necessary because the LBS  may determine that since the first mobile device  and the second mobile device  are substantially close to each other and have both selected to share profile information with another mobile device in close proximity to them, the likelihood that they are both requesting each others profile information is highly certain. The information exchange server  can send a verifying message to both the first mobile device  and the second mobile device  requesting verification that they desire to exchange profile information with each other. Upon acceptance, the requestor profile and the recipient profile may then be exchanged with each other wirelessly. Although described as a one-to-one encounter, it is also possible to implement this process in a group setting where more than one mobile device is available to share each of their respective profile information amongst the group. Once the profile information has been accepted, the profile information will be shared and populated into the requestors address book and the recipients address book  respectively. According to this embodiment, there isn't a need to manually accept and\/or transcribe the data manually into the address book.","According to another exemplary embodiment, a social group encounter may take place in which a requestor  and a number of recipients  may introduce themselves to each other and desire to exchange profile information, which is typically done by sharing business cards with each other. In this scenario, a single group identification code associated with the social event may be generated, tagged and associated with the particular social event. This scenario works well, for example, in situations where various unfamilar participants attend a conference, a large meeting, and the like. The multiple attendees, herein, the requestor  and the various recipients , may share their profile information , with each other. Those in attendance at the event may wish to share their profile information with others at the social event. In operation, attendees at the social event may send their own profile information via the Internet or from a mobile client resident on their mobile device into the information exchange server  via the group identification code. The information exchange server  will then compile all of the received profiles, match the requestors  with the recipients  and share the respected profile information , . An acceptance policy may be embedded such that an acceptance message is first sent to the requestor's  user interface prompting the requestor  to decline or approve the sharing of the profile information with the recipient. Any further modification to a particular profile in the group will be subsequently updated and revised at the information exchange server  and thereafter transmitted to all group member participants associated with that group identification code.","According to another exemplary embodiment of invention, a single group coordinator may be established who controls what profile information may be shared amongst a member's only directory defined group. The member's only directory may be accessed via the Internet or the mobile client . The member's only directory may display only selected public information to the other members of the group. The individual members can exchange profile information from the member directory. The group can be un-moderated or moderated. An un-moderated group can be set up by one of the participants via the Internet or through the mobile client by entering a group name and a group identification code associated with the member directory. By sharing this group identification code with others, the other participants can join the member directory group.","A moderated group is one in which a single group coordinator may be established who controls what profile information may be shared amongst the members only directory defined group. The group coordinator maintains management control of the profile information of each of the participants. The group coordinator can choose to selectively share information with each of the participants as a group and\/or individually. For example, a university may be given the management control as a group coordinator. Various types of participants may subscribe to the university group, such as for example, alumni, current students, prospective students and faculty. Where an alumni participant may be concerned, all other alumnis may share profile information amongst each other, the group coordinator would solely control the sharing of this information amongst the various alumnis. Where a student is concerned, the group coordinator may selectively share profile information about faculty pertinent to that student's class schedule. Furthermore, where a prospective student may be concerned, the group coordinator may selectively share profile information about admission counselors and\/or other information about programs or classes within the university. It is to be noted that the information tagged and shared to selected sub-groups within the university group may include, but is not limited to, personal profiles but may include data information about events, activities, programs, and the like. The group coordinator may also manage the permission of the user or organization to upload existing contact lists. Likewise, the group coordinator may manage member requests.","As part of the management of member requests, the group coordinator can setup \u201csegments\u201d which will allow them to associate members and tag them with words, phrases and\/or terms they define. For example, the group coordinator may choose to tag a member to \u201cemployee\u201d, \u201cpartner\u201d, \u201cvendor\u201d or \u201crecruiting candidate.\u201d This feature is beneficial for marketing purposes. In addition, the group coordinator may customize the registration pages for new users and setup response emails, and\/or other alerts when new users attempt to join. The various directories and tags may be tied to various back end systems in accordance with this invention.","It is to be understood that various types of controls and profiles may be created for a particular user. For example, a user may have a first business profile set up with his\/her professional information and associated data. Likewise, the user may have a second social profile set up with his\/her casual\/social information and associated profile information data. Depending upon the environment in which the user is a participant, the user may selectively share one of the particular profiles with a recipient. Likewise, the user may opt-in to make all or portions of his\/her personal contact information private to other users who already have their current profile information. Selectable security elements may be tied to various portions of the profile information which may be made visible or invisible to a recipient  of the profile information.","In the instance where a group coordinator or organization is managing various pieces of profile information, various privacy controls may be set that would apply to all members in that particular group, such as employees of the organization. The privacy controls can be applied to any profile field, such as in this example to email and phone numbers. Once the profile field is set to private, it cannot be viewed on the user's profile information. The group coordinator may apply privacy controls selectively to various requestors  and recipients  as it deems fit. Although the profile field for the email and\/or phone number may be set to private and is hidden from the recipient , the recipient  of the profile information may still be able to email or call the person since the contact information including email address and phone number is still available to the information exchange server . A masked phone number and\/or email may be used to communicate between the participants. The ability to communicate, and various other controls tied to the profile information, may be modified as desired. For example, if the requestor  decides later to prevent the recipient  to communicate with her, then the requestor  may select a \u201cdisable communication\u201d profile field so that the recipient  can no longer call or email her.","According to another aspect of the invention, the information exchange server  may capture and include selective membership and financial information in a user's profile information, such as membership, loyalty and credit card account numbers. Examples of such membership and financial information include information typically fond on shopping and gym membership cards, shopping loyalty cards, frequent flyer accounts, bank debit and credit cards and the like. The compilation of this profile data information comprises a digital wallet. The advantage of the digital wallet is that the user would no longer have to carry multiple cards in a wallet but would have quick access and use of the information in a secure fashion.","By way of example, when a user wishes to make a financial transaction the user initiates the payment process by selecting the Vendor  () listed on the mobile device  and entering the amount of the transaction. The mobile device  transmits the vendor information, the transaction number, the amount of the transaction, and the user information to the information exchange server . The information exchange server  then pulls the financial information such as the credit card information of the user from the database  and transmits the information to the vendor . The vendor's system would then validate the transaction and send confirmation to the point of sale (POS) terminal at the location where the user is making the mobile payment to complete the transaction. Through use of the present invention, the user's information need not be displayed on their mobile device and all private information can be masked locally on the mobile device . Masking the private information thereby prevents theft from onlookers or anyone that sees, holds, or takes the user's mobile device .","The system of the present invention could also employ a peer to peer transaction by pushing contact information from the mobile device  to the POS terminal directly or through the information exchange server . In this embodiment, the POS terminal would receive a request from the mobile device which includes the user's profile. The Vendor , upon receipt of the request, would receive the transaction amount and user's profile information and would then connect to the network  to receive the user's financial credit card information. The vendor  would then approve the transaction or could transmit an SMS message or email message to the user's mobile device  to verify the transaction and amount.","The user may selectively separate and assign the credit cards in the digital wallet depending on whether the nature of the financial transaction to be made is one which is defined as a social or business related transaction. For example, at a business function, if a financial transaction is to be accomplished, the user may conduct a financial transaction with a credit account number related to her business account. Alternatively, the user may desire to make a financial transaction using a non-business related credit account number stored in her digital wallet in a social environment. The exchange of information between the requestors  mobile device  and the information exchange server  containing the digital wallet information may be performed using secured encrypted signaling of information at the time of the transaction throughout the system so as to prevent the sensitive financial information from being illegally accessed. Separate identification codes may be assigned to the various accounts numbers in the digital wallet and securely stored at the information exchange server , as well as in the requestors  mobile device .","As mentioned briefly above, identification codes may be associated with various types of membership accounts and rewards programs. The average person carries numerous membership and\/or rewards cards on her person. Keeping track of these various membership cards can be cumbersome and monotonous. Thus, according to this invention, it is possible to associate one or many identification codes with each of the user's membership and\/or rewards cards. By doing so, the need to carry various membership and\/or rewards cards is eliminated.","Retrieval of a particular identification code may be achieved in numerous ways. In one example, the location based system  may be employed to automatically determine the location of the mobile device  of a user. The location based system  may determine the position of a mobile device  of a user in a number of commercially available ways, for example, using GPS, XY coordinates as registered by a cell tower, triangulation and\/or any other suitable means for determining the location of the mobile device  of the user.","For example,  depicts an example user interface  that may be prompted as soon as the user enters and\/or comes close to the location of the grocery store (i.e. Safeway). As shown, when the information exchange server  has acknowledged that a requestors  mobile device  is within a predetermined proximity of the Safeway, various information such as the offer  \u201c50% off groceries this Saturday Jun. 7, 2008 only with this coupon\u201d is sent to the requestor's  mobile device  and displayed on the user interface . The requestor  may select from a variety of buttons  to block, reject or send the offer to another contact. Various types of information may be provided from the information exchange server  to the user interface  of the mobile device . A scanning barcode  may also be displayed as shown on the user interface  for use upon checkout from the grocery store. The advantage of providing this information accessible by the requestors  mobile device  is that the requestor  will not have to carry a variety of rewards card associated with numerous different establishments. Other membership and\/or rewards programs may be utilized in a similar manner to the one described above, for example, walking into a gym, a requestor  may transmit an identification code with her mobile device  to the information exchange server , which in turn would transmit the appropriate profile information for that particular member to the Vendor  (as seen in ) through the network . The profile information returned from the information exchange server  could also be shared directly from peer to peer from the requestors  mobile device  to a receiving device at the gym, and\/or a copy of the returned profile information may be directly sent to the gym establishment with a participating identification code and connected to the network . Likewise, purchases at these various establishments may also be made via the convenience of the requestors  mobile device  and an associated identification code. The benefit of the systems and methods of this invention is that personal and financial profile information may be securely embedded and masked on the requestor's mobile device  yet quickly and conveniently used at the appropriate establishments thereby eliminating the need to physically carry a wallet and\/or purse. Leveraging this system, up-to-date contact profile information can be shared with various requesting parties such as, but not limited to, universities, organizations, billing agencies, and the like.","Another aspect of the present invention is to enhance the user's interactivity with their contacts and provide updates\/feeds from various different social networks with full interactivity. The present invention enables the requestor  or the recipient  to set include within their profile all of their social media profile information including the following: LinkedIn, Salesforce, Siebel, Twitter, Dynamics, Facebook, Myspace, Orkut, Plaxo, Bebo, Friendster, FriendFeed, Xanga, Yahoo, SugarCRM, BlackberryPush, iPhonePush, Geo Location Service, Digg, Vimeo, YouTube, Flickr, loopt, Brightkite, Google LAttitude, Yelp, Delicious, and IMs like Yahoo, AOL, Google Talk, MSA, iChat. Recipients of a profile could then decide manually or set their account to automatically follow or connect to social network accounts of new or updated profiles. For example, if a requestor  has a Twitter account identified in their profile the recipient could set their preferences to automatically follow the requestor on Twitter. The system and methods of the present invention can act as a central hub or messaging center for all communications and connections within the social spectrum relating to the participating contact or profile with which a user had connected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["203","202","201","201","202","201","401","201","206","402","201","206","403","202","206","206","206","202","404","206","202","206","405","202","406","202"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a","a","a","a","a.
