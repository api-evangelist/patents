{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH\/DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/847,537, filed May 17, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,505,572 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/471,917, filed May 20, 2003, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Not Applicable","Many industries rely on advertising to attract a steady flow of qualified customers. Advertising campaigns may cost thousands of dollars and utilize various media, such as newspapers, magazines, yellow pages, television and direct mailings. In the multi-housing industry, for example, advertising expenses are second only to capital expenditures. Hence, both advertisers and marketing firms are highly motivated to verify the cost-effectiveness of advertising media and advertising campaigns.","Nevertheless, many conventional methods of advertising fail to successfully utilize technology to conduct a sufficiently cost-effective operation. For example, in the traditional model for renting apartment units in the multi-housing industry, a potential customer may provide preliminary information to a sales\/office representative over the telephone, in person, and\/or through electronic communications. The representative may be forced to manually write down the customer's information onto a \u201cguest card\u201d which is used to maintain a record of the communication. Given the nature of such a manual system, it can become difficult and\/or nearly impossible for a sales\/office representative to efficiently keep track of the potentially large number of communications received by the rental office. In the case of a repeat customer, it may be desirable for the representative to quickly retrieve information concerning one or more prior communications made by the customer. Unfortunately, manual-based systems have inherent limitations involved in physically locating and pulling relevant paper files, all of which costs valuable time.","Accordingly, there exists a need for a comprehensive customer information system which provides a streamlined approach to processing incoming communications that are placed in response to advertisements. It would be desirable for such a system to maintain records of past communications, and provide an efficient way to retrieve such records in realtime.","The present invention, roughly described, is directed to a system for managing customer information. In various embodiments, the system can include a system server, one or more client workstations, and a database. In certain embodiments, the database is configured to store customer information pertaining to communications received by the system including electronic communications, interactions with \u201cwalk-in\u201d customers, and\/or telephone calls that are received by the system. Information extracted from the incoming communications can be received by the system server and cross-referenced with the database to obtain cross-referenced customer information pertaining to previous communications of the same customer. The cross-referenced information can be passed to a client workstation for review by a user of the system.","When the user selects an incoming communication, the cross-referenced information can be displayed to the user on the client workstation. The user can update the cross-referenced customer information and enter additional information pertaining to the communication, thereby maintaining a retrievable record of the incoming communication. The record can be subsequently recalled as cross-referenced customer information upon a subsequent communication by the customer.","In certain applications, the system can be used by advertisers to manage incoming communications made in response to special service numbers and\/or online content. Customer information can be displayed to a representative of the advertiser (i.e. a user) in the form of an industry-specific template formatted in accordance with the business needs of the user. The template can be automatically populated with the cross-referenced customer information and displayed on the client workstation. With regard to the multi-housing industry in particular, customer information can be displayed in the form of a guest card template and\/or a service card template.","The system can be configured for use with electronic communications made in response to online content such as advertising and\/or other content. In various embodiments, such electronic communications can comprise email messages, responses to online forms, and\/or other electronic communications made in response to such online content.","Additional functionality can be provided for integrating customer information received in person from \u201cwalk-in\u201d customers by reading a magnetic card provided by such walk-in customers. Other functionality can be provided for managing authorized users, managing advertising sources\/campaigns, generating reports\/records, monitoring transactions performed by the system server, monitoring the client workstations, and other functionality described herein.","These and other embodiments of the present invention are discussed in further detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","110","111","112"]},"Customer information of a caller customer , walk-in customer , and\/or online customer  can include but need not be limited to: any information extracted from an incoming telephone call and\/or electronic communication; any previously stored information relating to a customer, personal information of the customer, any information entered by a user  of system  relating to the customer during and\/or after a telephone call, meeting, and\/or electronic communication with the customer. For example, when system  is used in the context of the multi-housing industry, customer information can include personal information regarding the customer (i.e. name, address, telephone number, etc.), the substance of previous conversations\/communications between the customer and a user  (i.e. a sales\/office representative) of system , any previous preferences communicated from the customer to a user  (i.e. what type of apartment home is desired by the customer), and any other information which may be useful to conducting rental transactions. Similarly, calls, meetings, and\/or electronic communications may be initiated by customers having service requests directed toward the managing entity of a rental property. In such applications, the customer information processed by system  can be directed toward information relevant to service transactions.","A user  of system  can conduct a telephone conversation with a caller customer , while simultaneously and\/or subsequently interacting with a client workstation  to review, enter, recall, and\/or update current and\/or previously stored customer information associated with the caller customer  or the caller customer's  telephone number. As a result, the system  can provide users  with the functionality to create an electronic record of a telephone conversation placed by a caller customer , and include in that record any applicable customer information that may be desirable to review and\/or cross-reference with future calls at a later date.","Although the present disclosure generally refers to one or more caller customers  interacting with user  by telephone, various embodiments of the present invention can also provide functionality for integrating information received from one or more \u201cwalk-in\u201d customers  that physically appear in person to user  through walk-ins, scheduled appointments, or otherwise. For example, any information provided by a walk-in customer  to user  in person can be considered customer information. Such customer information received in person from walk-in customer  can be entered by user  into client workstation  and can therefore be handled by system  in the same manner as customer information received pursuant to a telephone call placed by a caller customer .","Various embodiments of the present invention can also provide functionality for integrating information received from one or more online customers  that submit customer information through a customer computer device  over network . Such customer information received from online customers  can be handled by system  in the same manner as customer information received pursuant to a telephone call placed by a caller customer .","As a result, system  can provide users  with the ability to cross-reference customer information received in relation to caller customers  with customer information received in relation to walk-in customers  and\/or online customers , and vice versa. Therefore, if a caller customer  has previously appeared before user  as a walk-in customer  and\/or online customer , or vice versa, the customer information associated with the customer or the customer's telephone number can be conveniently cross-referenced and displayed to user  in connection with the user's  further interactions with the customer.","As illustrated in , system  can include system server , telephony server , and client workstation . Telephony server  receives telephone calls placed by caller customer  from customer telephone  over voice network . It will be appreciated that voice network  can be any of the various networks known in the art to facilitate voice transmission, including but not limited to a conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN), a wireless telephone network, a network employing a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), and\/or others known in the art.","In various embodiments, telephony server  can extract Automatic Number Identification (ANI) information, Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) information, and\/or other information from incoming telephone calls. As a result of this extraction, system  can be provided with the name and telephone number associated with customer telephone  (indicated by the ANI information) and\/or a special service number  called by caller customer  (indicated by the DNIS information).","Telephony server  passes the extracted information to system server  through computer network , and forwards the telephone calls to the appropriate destination number at user telephone . Optionally, telephony server  can connect to system server  directly (not shown). Moreover, the functionality of the telephony server  can be optionally integrated into system server , as further described herein. If such an implementation is desired, the system server  can communicate directly with the voice network , rather than through telephony server .","System server  can use the extracted customer information to recall any previously stored customer information associated with the customer or the customer's telephone number, format all of the customer information, and send the formatted customer information to a corresponding client workstation  for display. In various embodiments, system server  can listen for any incoming requests from client workstations  or telephony servers  that have registered with system server .","As further illustrated in , one or more blackbox servers  (for example, two load balanced servers) can be provided in communication with system server  and network . Blackbox server  can provide a queuing system for customer information in the event that communication between voice network  and computer network  fails. In the event of such communication failure, customer information received by blackbox server  can remain in a queue maintained by the blackbox server  until communication is restored. Once communication is restored, incoming calls and electronic communications referenced by the queue of the blackbox server  can be immediately sent to system server  for processing.","Blackbox server  can be configured so it can be seen by telephony server , providing a gateway for telephony server  to communicate with system server . Blackbox server  can receive customer information through web services over http and send the customer information to system server  using private communications through communication path  and\/or through network .","In various embodiments, communication with system server  can be facilitated by Microsoft Messaging Queue Services (MSMQ) where the web services inject extracted customer information to MSMQ. System server  can be configured to listen for incoming MSMQ messages and as they come in, and then be processed by server application  of system server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["198","199","190","198","112","199"]},"If an online customer  desires to receive additional information from the advertiser, the online customer  may choose to fill out an online form provided by the content  and\/or send an email message to an email address provided by the content . For example, in the context of the multi-housing industry, the online customer  may choose to fill out a form with some customer information indicating various personal information of the online customer  and\/or various preferences the online customer  may have in relation to rental properties.","The online form and\/or email message submitted by the online customer  from customer computing device  can be received by an electronic communication server  which extracts customer information from the submission. In one embodiment, electronic communication server  can be implemented in accordance with Microsoft Exchange Server  technology. Electronic communication server  can be configured to forward the extracted customer information to system server  through web services and MSMQ technology as previously discussed.","Client workstation  interacts with system server  over computer network  to permit a user  to view the customer information forwarded from system server  (including the extracted customer information and previously stored customer information), as well as to add and\/or modify customer information as desired. It will be appreciated that computer network  can be any of the various networks known in the art to facilitate data transmission, including but not limited to a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a virtual private network (VPN), and\/or others known in the art.","In various embodiments, communication between system server  and client workstation  can be facilitated by .NET remoting technology, available from Microsoft Corporation, through TCP or HTTP. In one embodiment, the interaction is configured using a TCP port with a binary formatter. However, other embodiments employing custom communication methods are also contemplated. System server  can also interact with a public database , such as an online telephone white pages and\/or other information repositories known in the art to obtain additional customer information, such as an address associated with the customer or the customer's telephone number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["197","160","190","197","160","197","130","160","180"]},"In another aspect of the present invention, system  provides functionality for generating reports and implementing various administrative tools, as further described herein.","As is known in the art, advertisers often use special service numbers to determine the effectiveness of advertising. By placing different special service numbers in advertisements, advertisers can determine the effectiveness of a given advertisement by monitoring calls made to the particular special service number associated with the advertisement.","System  can be used by an advertiser in order to efficiently handle telephone calls initiated by caller customers  in response to advertisements. For example, a caller customer  (i.e. a potential customer) may review an advertisement  that is listed in a distributed media publication . It will be appreciated that media  may be any advertising medium known in the art, including but not limited to printed publications and\/or electronic (i.e. online) publications. Advertisement  provides a special service number  for the caller customer  to use in contacting the advertiser.","If the caller customer  desires to contact the advertiser, the caller customer  can initiate a call by dialing the special service number  using the customer's telephone . After the special service number  is dialed, the call is routed through voice network  to telephony server  which is associated with the special service number . As previously described, telephony server  extracts customer information from the call and passes the extracted information to system server . Telephony server  also routes the call to user telephone . As also previously described, system server  can recall additional customer information and forward the extracted and recalled customer information to client workstation .","User  can receive the call when it is routed to user telephone . Typically, user  will be a person associated with the advertiser, such as a sales\/office representative, who is responsible for responding to incoming customer telephone calls. User  has access to client workstation  which is in communication with system server  over computer network . Client workstation  provides a user interface (such as a graphical user interface) to user  which permits user  to interact with the client workstation  and view customer information forwarded by system server .","User , user telephone , and client workstation  can be situated at an office  of an advertiser. For convenience of illustration, only one client workstation , user , and user telephone  are shown in . However, it will be appreciated that a plurality of client workstations  and\/or user telephones  can be employed in one or more offices , with various associated users . In order to facilitate communication between system server  and different offices , a unique \u201cOfficeID\u201d identifier can be associated with each office  and used in communications between client workstation  and system server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2E","FIGS. 2A-2E"],"b":["100","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["160","100","160","160","310","160","330","390","330","2000","330","390","370","320","160","320","320","190"]},"As illustrated, server  can communicate with computer network  through web server . Optionally, the functionality of telephony server  can be incorporated into system server  through a telephony application programming interface (TAPI) engine . For example, TAPI engine  can respond to incoming calls and transfer such calls to a user telephone . As a result, server  can communicate with voice network  through TAPI engine . In one embodiment, TAPI engine  is an amTAPI Pro V1.12 available from Allen-Martin. It will be appreciated that various technology known in the art can be used to facilitate communication between TAPI engine  and voice network .
