Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the preparation of surfactant-free dispersions comprising a low viscosity hydrophilic continuous phase and the use of such dispersions in topical formulations. In certain aspects, the present invention is directed to stable surfactant-free dispersions of hydrophobic substances in low viscosity hydrophilic glyceryl polyacrylate or glyceryl polymethacrylate fluids, and topical vehicles formulated with such ingredients.","B. Background","Topical formulations generally have to combine multiple, and sometimes competing, attributes, such as those relating to aesthetics, stability, delivery and compatibility. In regard to aesthetics, topical formulations are generally required to display appropriate tactile and visual properties when applied to the skin. Such formulations should also maintain functionality in regard to the delivery of various active agents onto or into the skin. Stability requirements apply both to individual ingredients (e.g., active agents) as well as to more gross aspects of the product form, such as precipitation or potential separation of phases. Compatibility constraints generally require that a formulation can be applied to the skin without eliciting a significant adverse reaction, such as an allergic or irritant response.","Formulations range from aqueous based solutions and gels to anhydrous vehicles. Simple aqueous based vehicles have limitations in regard to both solubility and stability of active agents, and can have poor tactile properties. Anhydrous vehicles have limitations in regard to desirable aesthetic properties. Emulsions are often employed in skin formulations to obviate such problems. An emulsion is a dispersion comprising two immiscible liquid phases, wherein one phase, a non-continuous phase, is dispersed into the continuous phase. The two basic types of such dispersions usually comprise either a hydrophilic, e.g. aqueous, dispersed phase in a hydrophobic continuous phase (water-in-oil) or a hydrophobic dispersed phase in a hydrophilic continuous phase (oil-in-water).","Emulsions are generally made by preparing separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases and mixing the two together. This is generally accomplished with the use of one or more emulsifying agents which reduce the surface tension between the immiscible phases creating micelles, i.e., a surfactant effect, thereby making the dispersion physically stable. However, surfactants have long been known to be associated with skin irritation and comprise the majority of adverse skin reaction to personal care products (e.g., Barany et al., 1999; Bodin et al., 2000; Effendy & Maibach, 1995).","Low viscosity dispersions are advantageous in that they can be readily processed through various mixers, mills and homogenizing equipment in order to produce a stable dispersion without the build up of excessive heat, which can occur when processing high viscosity \u201cgel-like\u201d dispersions due to friction. Low viscosity dispersions can spread and absorb easily into the skin and impart a characteristic \u201clight\u201d feel. However, the omission of surfactants from low viscosity dispersions would be expected to result in physical instability of the dispersed phase, i.e. phase separation, in contrast to high viscosity dispersions wherein the gel-like consistency physically stabilizes the dispersed particles.","The present invention overcomes the deficiencies in the art by providing surfactant-free dispersions suitable for formulating topical preparations. The removal of surfactants will generally enhance cutaneous compatibility of topical preparations. For instance, skin irritation can be reduced or prevented. An additional benefit of the dispersions and compositions of the present invention is the reduction in manufacturing costs by excluding surfactants and detergents from the dispersions and compositions of the present invention.","In one aspect of the present invention, there is disclosed a dispersion comprising a hydrophobic dispersed phase in a hydrophilic fluid continuous phase. The hydrophilic continuous phase can include glyceryl polyacrylate or glyceryl polymethacrylate, or mixtures of the two. A unique aspect of the dispersion is that it is surfactant free and stable. Stated another way, no surfactants are needed to obtain a stable dispersion of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the dispersion comprises from about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 to about 99%, or any range or integer derivable therein, by weight of the glyceryl polyacrylate. In other aspects, the dispersion can include from about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 to about 99%, or any range or integer derivable therein, by weight of the glyceryl polymethacrylate. The viscosity of the hydrophilic fluid can range from about 20 to about 1600 cps. In certain aspects, the viscosity of the hydrophilic fluid is 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1250, 1300, 1350, 1400, 1450, 1500, 1550, 1600 cps, or any range or integer derivable therein.","In certain aspects, the dispersion can include from about 15, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 to about 99%, or any range or integer derivable therein, by weight of the hydrophobic dispersed phase. The hydrophobic phase can include a plant, animal, paraffinic, or synthetic derived fat, butter, grease, solvent, wax, or oil, or mixtures thereof. The hydrophobic phase can include a non-volatile silicone, a mineral oil, a vegetable oil, a water insoluble organic ester, a water insoluble triglyceride, or a fluorinated compound, or mixtures thereof. In other embodiments, the hydrophobic dispersed phase can be a liquid and\/or can have a melting point below 25\u00b0 C. In other aspects, the melting point can be below 24\u00b0 C., 23\u00b0 C., 22\u00b0 C., 21\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C., 19\u00b0 C., 18\u00b0 C., 17\u00b0 C., 16\u00b0 C., 15\u00b0 C., 14\u00b0 C., 13\u00b0 C., 12\u00b0 C., 11\u00b0 C., 10\u00b0 C., 9\u00b0 C., 8\u00b0 C., 7\u00b0 C., 6\u00b0 C., 5\u00b0 C., 4\u00b0 C., 3\u00b0 C., 2\u00b0 C., or 1\u00b0 C. In certain aspects the hydrophobic dispersed phase does not include a wax.","The dispersion of the present invention can also include water, a polyol, or mixtures thereof. Non-limiting examples of polyols include glycerin, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, or pentylene glycol, or mixtures thereof. The dispersion can be incorporated into a vehicle.
