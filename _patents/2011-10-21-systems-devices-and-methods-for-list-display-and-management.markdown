Equivalents"],"p":["Exemplary embodiments provide systems, devices and methods that allow creation and management of lists of items in an integrated manner on an interactive graphical user interface. A user may speak a plurality of list items in a natural unbroken manner to provide an audio input stream into an audio input device. Exemplary embodiments may automatically process the audio input stream to convert the stream into a text output, and may process the text output into a sequence of a plurality of n-grams. Exemplary embodiments may automatically populate a new or existing list on a user interface with the n-grams in the sequence of n-grams so that each n-gram corresponds to a different list item. Exemplary embodiments also provide systems, devices and methods that allow display of items on a shopping list on a map of a store in order to facilitate a shopping trip.","In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for allowing creation and management of a list on a mobile computing device. The method includes rendering a user interface on a display device of the mobile computing device, and receiving user input from a user for creating a list. The method includes receiving an audio input stream from the user at an audio input device of the mobile computing device, the audio input stream including a sequence of a plurality of list items spoken by the user. The method includes, in response to receipt of the audio input stream at the audio input device, calling a speech processing engine from the user interface to process the audio input stream into input text and to parse the input text into one or more n-grams. The method includes, in response to user input accepting the one or n-grams, rendering a list on the user interface in which each n-gram is represented as a separate list item.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a mobile computing system is provided. The mobile computing system includes an audio input device for receiving audio input, a visual display device configured to display one or more user interfaces and a processor. The processor is programmed to render a user interface on the visual display device and to receive user input from a user for creating a list. The processor is also programmed to receive an audio input stream from the user at the audio input device, the audio input stream including a sequence of a plurality of list items spoken by the user. The processor is also programmed to call a speech progressing engine from the user interface to process the audio input stream into input text and to parse the input text into one or more n-grams, in response to receipt of the audio input stream at the audio input device. The processor is also programmed to render representations of the one or more n-grams on the user interface to allow the user to accept, reject and\/or edit the one or more n-grams for representation in the form of a list and, in response to user input accepting the one or n-grams, render a list on the user interface in which each n-gram is represented as a separate list item.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, one or more non-transitory computer-readable media encoded with computer-executable instructions are provided for performing a method for allowing creation and management of a list on a mobile computing device. The method includes rendering a user interface on a display device of the mobile computing device, and receiving user input from a user for creating a list. The method includes receiving an audio input stream from the user at an audio input device of the mobile computing device, the audio input stream including a sequence of a plurality of list items spoken by the user. The method includes, in response to receipt of the audio input stream at the audio input device, calling a speech processing engine from the user interface to process the audio input stream into input text and to parse the input text into one or more n-grams. The method includes, in response to user input accepting the one or n-grams, rendering a list on the user interface in which each n-gram is represented as a separate list item.","In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a computer-implemented method is provided for a mobile computing device. The method includes receiving a list of items, and rendering a map of a store on a user interface displayed on a visual display device of the mobile computing device. The method also includes rendering representations of the list items on representations on the map of corresponding geographical locations in the store at which the list items are available. The method also includes rendering a route on the map that connects the representations of the list items to indicate a path to follow in picking up the list items in the store.","List management systems allow creation and management of lists of items, e.g., shopping lists, to-do lists, and the like. Certain conventional list management systems allow a user to provide audio input identifying the list items one list item at a time. As a result, these conventional systems require the user to speak the list items one item at a time and to wait between each list item input while the previous list item input is being processed, which increases the time required to create the list and makes the conventional list management system slow and user-unfriendly.","Exemplary embodiments address deficiencies of conventional list management systems that require a user to provide audio input for creating a list one list item at a time. Exemplary embodiments provide systems, devices and methods that allow creation and management of lists of items in an integrated manner on an interactive user interface. A user may speak a plurality of list items in a natural unbroken manner to provide an audio input stream into an audio input device. Exemplary embodiments may automatically process the audio input stream to convert the stream into a text output, and may process the text output into a sequence of a plurality of n-grams. Exemplary embodiments may automatically populate a new or existing list on a user interface with the n-grams in the sequence of n-grams so that each n-gram corresponds to a different list item. Exemplary embodiments thus provide a fast, efficient, convenient and streamlined manner of creating and managing lists, and avoids the need for providing audio input for the creation of a list one list item at a time.","Exemplary embodiments also provide systems, devices and methods that allow display of representations of list items of a shopping list on a map of a store in order to facilitate a shopping trip. Exemplary embodiments provide systems, devices and methods to display a route represented on a store map that may be taken through the store to pick up the items on a shopping list during a shopping trip. A user may follow the displayed route to easily navigate through the store, visit only those store departments where the listed items are located, and to pick up all of the listed items. Exemplary embodiments thereby allow the user to save time, easily locate items that may be difficult to find in a large store, and to complete his\/her shopping activities without having to locate and request assistance from store employees.","Certain terms are defined below to facilitate understanding of exemplary embodiments.","As used herein, a \u201clist\u201d is an ordered or unordered collection of items.","As used herein, a \u201clist item\u201d is an item on a list wherein each item comprises one or more words.
