{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/088,103, filed Apr. 15, 2011, which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/JP2010\/053384, filed on Mar. 3, 2010, entitled \u201cPYRIDINE DERIVATIVE\u201d, which claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application Number JP 2009-051820, filed on Mar. 5, 2009, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a medicine, in particular, a novel pyridine derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable ester thereof, or a pharmacologically acceptable salt of the derivative or ester, which has a hypoglycemic effect or treats and\/or prevents the onset of a disorder of carbohydrate or lipid metabolism or a disease mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3.","The present invention also relates to a therapeutic agent and\/or prophylactic agent for diabetes (especially type II diabetes), hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, cachexia, psoriasis, diabetic complications, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, pancreatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), gestational diabetes mellitus, inflammatory disease, cancer, osteoporosis, involutional osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, hyperuricemia, metabolic syndrome, or the like, which has an effect of improving carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, an effect of improving insulin resistance, an antiinflammatory effect or an effect of inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, the therapeutic agent and\/or prophylactic agent comprising a novel pyridine derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable ester thereof, or a pharmacologically acceptable salt of the derivative or ester as an active ingredient.","In recent years, the number of patients with metabolic syndrome such as type II diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, adiposity, hypertension or atherosclerotic disease has been increasing around the world due to reasons such as changes in lifestyles. Patients with metabolic syndrome have a several-fold increased risk of coronary artery disease, cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage and are further affected with chronic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy. The increase in the number of patients with complications has been a major cause of rising medical costs (Non-Patent Document 1).","Recent researches have shown that ligands acting on PPAR\u03b3 are useful for the prevention or improvement of a pathology called metabolic syndrome such as type II diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, adiposity, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease or insulin resistance (Non-Patent Document 2). Ligands acting on PPAR\u03b3 inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines (Non-Patent Documents 3 and 4) and induce apoptosis to inhibit the growth of cancer cells (Non-Patent Document 5). Therefore, the ligands are also useful for the prevention or improvement of inflammatory disease or cancer. Specific examples of the ligands activating PPAR\u03b3 include pioglitazone (Non-Patent Document 6) and rosiglitazone (Non-Patent Document 7) classified into thiazolidinedione drugs already medically used in the treatment of type II diabetes. These thiazolidinedione drugs have side effects such as fluid retention, body weight increase and increased risks for heart disease. Therefore, safer pharmaceuticals have been desired to be developed (Patent Document 1). Many researchers have now been researching and developing pharmaceuticals with an aim to prevent or improve insulin resistance, diseases caused by inflammation or the like, or metabolic syndrome through researches of ligands activating or inhibiting PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 or PPAR\u03b4 (Non-Patent Document 8).","Patent Document 2 describes compounds having an alkoxy group, a (substituted) phenyloxy group, a pyridyloxy group or the like bonded to the 6-position of a benzimidazole group as derivatives having the same skeleton as in the compounds of the present invention, and use of those compounds as therapeutic agents for diabetes, hyperglycemia or the like. However, in the synthetic examples in this document, the sole pyridyloxy group at the 6-position of the benzimidazole group is an unsubstituted 3-pyridyloxy group. On the other hand, in the compounds of the present invention, a pyridyloxy group having 1 to 3 substituent(s) is bonded to the 6-position of a benzimidazole group.\n\n","The present inventors have conducted extensive studies to develop therapeutic agents and\/or prophylactic agents for disorders of carbohydrate or lipid metabolism or diseases mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3. Thus, the inventors have found that pyridine derivatives having a specific chemical structure have an excellent hypoglycemic effect or have an effect of improving carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, an effect of improving insulin resistance or an effect of improving so-called metabolic syndrome such as arteriosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular disorder or complications derived from them or a pathology caused by various inflammations. The inventors have further found that the compounds are ligands acting on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 and therefore have an effect of inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. These findings have led to the completion of the present invention.","Specifically, the present invention provides novel pyridine derivatives or pharmacologically acceptable esters thereof, or pharmacologically acceptable salts of the derivatives or esters, which are useful as therapeutic agents or prophylactic agents for metabolic syndrome, specifically, diseases such as diabetes (especially type II diabetes), hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), hypertension, fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetic complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy), arteriosclerosis, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), inflammatory disease (such as osteoarthritis, pain or inflammatory enteritis), acne, sunburn, psoriasis, eczema, allergic disease, asthma, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic maculopathy, macular edema, diabetic nephropathy, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disorder, peripheral circulatory disturbance, autoimmune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic rheumatism, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Hashimoto's disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic Addison's disease, male sterility, Goodpasture's syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Behcet's disease or CREST syndrome), pancreatitis, cachexia, cancer (such as gastric cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer or liver cancer), leukemia, sarcoma (such as liposarcoma), osteoporosis, involutional osteoporosis, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, hyperuricemia, dry eyes, or the like.","Also advantageously, the compounds have been found to be highly safe.","The present invention relates to:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0022"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"28.45mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US08946264-20150203-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"R represents a pyridyl group substituted with 1 to 3 group(s) independently selected from Substituent Group A,","Substituent Group A represents a group consisting of a halogen atom, a C-Calkyl group and a C-Calkoxy group, and Me represents a methyl group]","or a pharmacologically acceptable ester thereof, or a pharmacologically acceptable salt of the compound or ester.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention include:\n\n","The \u201chalogen atom\u201d in the present invention is a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or an iodine atom.

Commercially available reagents and kits were used according to the attached instructions. The details will be shown below.","(1) Preparation of GAL4-PPAR\u03b3 Chimeric Receptor Expression Plasmid","The ligand-binding domain of human PPAR\u03b3 (corresponding to about 300 amino acids at the carboxy end) was bound to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (corresponding to 147 amino acids at the amino end) with reference to the report by Kliewer et al. to prepare a gene expressing a GAL4-PPAR\u03b3 receptor.","The base sequence of the human PPAR\u03b3 gene is described in the gene database GenBank under Accession No. X90563.","(1-1) Extraction of Total RNA from Cell Line HepG2","The cell line HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection HB-8065) was purchased from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and cultured in a tissue culture flask having a culture area of 75 cm(manufactured by BD Biosciences). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco D-MEM, manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (manufactured by HyClone) at a volume ratio of 10% and an antibiotic solution [Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution, stabilized (100\u00d7), manufactured by Sigma] at a volume ratio of 1% was used as a medium.","The cells were cultured in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37\u00b0 C. under 5% carbon dioxide for three days. When the cells were grown to an approximately semiconfluent state, the medium in the flask was removed by aspiration. The cells were washed by adding 10 ml of ice-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline, manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation), and then the saline was removed by aspiration. Thereafter, 7.5 ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco TRIZOL reagent, manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation) was added to the cells in the flask, and repeatedly pipetted. The cells were lysed by incubating at room temperature for about five minutes.","The cell lysate was subjected to precipitation with isopropyl alcohol according to the instructions of the Trizol reagent. The resulting RNA precipitate was dissolved in pure water and stored in a freezer at about \u221220\u00b0 C. Here, the volume of the RNA solution was 0.22 ml. A sample obtained by diluting a part of the RNA solution 100-fold with pure water had an absorbance at 260 nm of 0.562.

The reaction product was subjected to 1.5% agarose electrophoresis. The amplified band of about 900 base pairs was cut out, purified, and cloned to the plasmid pCRII (manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation). The amplified DNA fragment is assumed to have the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3 of the Sequence Listing which includes a sequence encoding the ligand-binding domain, specifically, amino acids 175 to 475, of human PPAR\u03b3, and to which a restriction enzyme BamHI cleavage site and a restriction enzyme HindIII site are added on the 5\u2032-terminal and 3\u2032-terminal, respectively. The plasmid clone correctly containing the sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3 was selected by confirming the nucleotide sequence.","(1-3) Production of Plasmid pM-PPAR\u03b3","Next, the selected plasmid was treated with restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII to obtain a 900-base-pair fragment containing the gene of the PPAR\u03b3 ligand-binding domain. This was inserted into the BamHI-HindIII site of the plasmid pM having the gene of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (manufactured by Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and cloned.","The plasmid pM-PPAR\u03b3 obtained by the above operation includes the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4 of the Sequence Listing and encodes an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5 of the Sequence Listing containing amino acids 1 to 147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 at the amino end and containing amino acids 175 to 475 of human PPAR\u03b3 and a stop codon at the carboxy end.

The solution was serially diluted 3.3-fold with dimethyl sulfoxide to prepare solutions of the compound at concentrations up to 400 nM. Dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared for the control group. Rosiglitazone dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 4 mM was prepared for the positive control group. They were diluted 20-fold with the medium, and 5 \u03bcL of the dilution was added to the wells in which the cells were grown. The concentrations of the test compound treating the cells ranged from 10 \u03bcM to 1 nM. After the addition, the cells were cultured overnight.","On the following day, the medium was removed, and Luc Lite (manufactured by PerkinElmer Inc.) was prepared according to the attached document and added at 50 microliters per well. The plate with cells in the Luc Lite was stirred for about 30 minutes. The amount of luminescence in each well was measured as luciferase activity using Analyst (Molecular Devices) for 0.5 second. A dose-dependent curve was drawn.","When the luciferase activity of the positive control group was 100% and the luciferase activity of the control group was 0%, the maximum luciferase activity exhibited by the test compound alone was calculated as Emax (%) and the concentration of the test compound represented by Emax\/2 was calculated as EC50.","The smaller the EC50 value of the compound, the more potent the PPAR\u03b3 activation effect\/modulator activity of the compound.","Compound A used in Test Example 1 was used as a comparative compound.","The results of comparing the compounds of the present invention with the comparative Compound A are shown in Table 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0390","num":"0553"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"EC","Emax"]},{"entry":[{},"Example ","(nM)","(%)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20022","\u2002180","\u200273"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20024","\u2002180","\u200281"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20025","\u200324","\u200279"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20028","\u2002100","100"]},{"entry":[{},"\u20029","\u200343","\u200274"]},{"entry":[{},"10","\u200351","\u200260"]},{"entry":[{},"11","\u2002260","\u200282"]},{"entry":[{},"12","\u200371","\u200283"]},{"entry":[{},"14","\u200369","\u200267"]},{"entry":[{},"15","\u2002120","\u200294"]},{"entry":[{},"16","\u2002190","110"]},{"entry":[{},"17","\u2002100","110"]},{"entry":[{},"18","\u2002160","100"]},{"entry":[{},"Compound A","6800","\u200266."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"As shown in Table 2, the compounds of the present invention have PPAR\u03b3 activation effect\/modulator activity equal to or greater than that of Compound A described in WO 2008\/126732.
