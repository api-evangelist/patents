title: Method and system for writing data on a magnetic tape
abstract: In a magnetic tape storage controlled by a server, three attributes, namely, “read/write,” “read only” and “protection” are provided for data to be written, and each magnetic tape is set to a mode in which multiple attributes can be handled or a mode in which only one attribute can be handled. By properly selecting an attribute and a mode, a backup state depending on the importance of data is achieved.

Technical Field","The present invention relates to a method and system for recording data on a recording medium in general, and in particular to a method and system for writing data on a magnetic tape.","2. Description of the Related Art","A magnetic tape recording device can provide data backup for a network system or data base system. Magnetic tape recording devices are commonly referred to as tape storage. One drawback of magnetic tape recording devices is that random access cannot be performed on the devices and a long time is required to write and read data to and from the devices. However, magnetic tape recording devices, unlike hard disk drives, seldom crash to become unusable and hence very reliable. Further, magnetic tape recording device is relatively inexpensive. As such, magnetic tape recording devices are still being widely used for data backup.","There are various types of magnetic tapes of which a cartridge type is commonly used. Usually, the magnetic tape recording device is connected to a network attached storage (NAS) or a computer through a SCSI port or a fiber channel port. The magnetic tape recording device has a property that when data are overwritten with new data on a magnetic tape, all data recorded at the positions subsequent to the position at which the new data are written are deleted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00008","num":"00008"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["91","1","2","3","91","1","2","3","91","1","2","3","91","91"]},"Consider a case when an error is found in the data contents of A which is then corrected and overwritten. The magnetic tape  is loaded in a recording device and the data A are read out on a terminal to correct the error.  shows a state where the data A is overwritten on the magnetic tape  of FIG. . In the recording device using the magnetic tape , all the data A and subsequent data are deleted when the data A are overwritten. That is, as shown in , the overwriting of the data A causes the data A to An to be deleted.","When the overwriting (rewriting) of the contents of the data A is carried out under the state that the data A to An are recorded on the magnetic tape, the data A and subsequent data, that is, the data A to An are automatically deleted. Such an operation is carried out to prevent occurrence of a situation described in detail below. From a structural limitation standpoint, the magnetic tape cannot perform an operation of writing a piece of data at a random position (although it is not impossible to write a piece of data at a random position, it is impractical to do so because the rotational speed of the magnetic tape has a limit, resulting in a longer write time). Therefore, data are written on a magnetic tape sequentially from its start portion toward its end portion. Accordingly, when an overwriting operation is carried out on data recorded at some midpoint of the magnetic tape, the overwriting would extend to an area storing the next data if the overwriting data volume is larger than the original data volume before the overwriting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["2","91","3","3","3","3","2","3","2","2"]},"In order to prevent occurrence of such a situation, the magnetic tape recording device is designed to delete the data A to An when the data A is overwritten. Such deletion occurs even when the data A is slightly modified. Further, when the magnetic tape recording device is shared by multiple users, new data might be accidentally written on the data A which should be left intact.","One method for preventing occurrence of the situation described above may be the one which prohibits any subsequent data writing once data are written. For example, the magnetic tape itself may be write-protected. With such method, however, when the amount of written data is small, an unused portion of the magnetic tape is wasted. Also, with such method, many users cannot share the magnetic tape. Further, with such method, even when multiple magnetic tapes are provided so that multiple users can use them, unused portions of these magnetic tapes would be large and thus wasteful. In addition, with such method, write protection of a magnetic tape has to be set one by one at the recording device side that is inconvenient when the recording device is placed in another room.","Consequently, it would be desirable to provide an improved method for storing data in a magnetic tape recording device.","The present invention relates to a method for writing data on a magnetic tape. The method includes a step of causing a user to select data to be recorded on a magnetic tape, a step of reading out an attribute written on the magnetic tape, and a step of writing the selected data on the magnetic tape with the same attribute as that read out in the second step.","According to the present invention, the attribute of the data to be newly written is the same as the attribute of the data written previously. Thus, the magnetic tape can be handled as being set to a mode in which only one attribute is permitted for writing. Multiple kinds of attributes can be set as data attributes in accordance with importance of data or how to use the data. The user may properly select a backup state of the data on the magnetic tape in conformity with the importance of the data. For example, it is possible to prevent written data from being deleted by selecting an attribute which prohibits data overwriting so that the magnetic tape is permitted only writing with that attribute. Further, an access to the written data by any unauthorized person can be prevented by selecting an attribute which requires input of a code number or password to access the written data.","All objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["201","202","203","204","205","206"]},"LAN  provides a network environment using the well-known Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol. LAN  may use Ethernet, Token Ring, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) or the like. The network may be wired, wireless or combination thereof. The user terminals ,  and  are connected to the LAN network  using the TCP\/IP protocol. Each of the user terminals ,  and A may be any computer having basic functions of a conventional personal computer.","A server  is a NAS that contains a large-capacity hard disk drive and has a centralized management function for mass storage. The server  also has a function of controlling the operation of the magnetic tape storage  described later, and a function for recording and executing Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that enables users to carry out operations using the user terminals ,  and  described later. A basic Operating System (OS) that can operate the GUI is installed in each of the user terminals ,  and .","For example, when LAN  is an in-house LAN built in an office building, the server  conducts centralized management for accounting data, customer data, sales data, etc. When LAN  is built in a factory, the server  conducts centralized management for order data of products, delivery date data of manufactured goods, cost data of parts, process control data, yield ratio data of products, test data of products, inventory data of parts, inventory data of products, etc.","The magnetic tape storage  has a function of backing up data to be handled by the server . The magnetic tape storage  is equipped with multiple cartridge-type magnetic tapes any one of which can be selected by a user instruction. The magnetic tape storage  includes a magnetic tape drive, a drive controller and a magnetic head (not shown), and has a function of writing data on and reading data from the magnetic tape. Further, the magnetic tape storage  has a well-known function of deleting data written at positions subsequent to overwritten data due to the data overwriting operation. The magnetic tape storage  has also functions of writing data having one of the attributes described later, and setting a loaded magnetic tape to a mode described later.","In the present embodiment, a user can select one of two modes for a magnetic tape, which are mixed attribute and non-mixed attribute modes described later.","Data backup can be carried out at any interval that is set at user's convenience, such as every day or every week. Even if data recorded in the server  are lost due to an unforeseen accident, the backup could minimize the data loss. Although data to be backed up are not specifically limited, the above-described data handled by the server  may be backed up.

These attributes are \u201cread\/write,\u201d \u201cread only\u201d and \u201cprotection.\u201d","The \u201cread\/write\u201d attribute is defined as the one which, under the state that data having this attribute have already been written on a magnetic tape, permits data restoring, overwriting with new backup data, and data writing in a free area to be performed without limit. The free area is an area on a magnetic tape containing no written data and positioned subsequently to an area in which last data are written under the state that data are sequentially written in successive areas on the magnetic tape.","The \u201cread only\u201d attribute is defined as the one which, under the state that data having this attribute have already been written on a magnetic tape, permits data restoring and data writing in a free area to be performed without limit, but prohibits overwriting any written data with new backup data.","The \u201cprotection\u201d attribute is defined as the one which permits data overwriting, data writing in a free area, and data restoring to be performed only when a user ID and a user password are input.","In the magnetic tape storage , magnetic tapes each having either the mixed attribute mode or the non-mixed attribute mode are housed, from which the user can properly select a magnetic tape having a desired mode.","The mixed attribute mode permits multiple attributes to coexist in a single magnetic tape. In the mixed attribute mode, for example, data having the \u201cprotection\u201d attribute can be written subsequently to data having the \u201cread\/write\u201d attribute on a magnetic tape. On the other hand, in the non-mixed attribute mode, only one attribute is permitted for data to be written on a magnetic tape. In the non-mixed attribute mode, the attribute of data which are first written on the magnetic tape determines the attributes of data to be subsequently written. For example, if the attribute of data written first on a magnetic tape is \u201cread only\u201d, only data having the \u201cread only\u201d attribute are permitted to be written subsequently on the magnetic tape. Information for identifying the mixed attribute mode and the non-mixed attribute mode is contained in header information of data recorded at a first position of a magnetic tape.","An example of data overwriting on a magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode on which data have already been written will be described below.  illustrates a backup screen displayed at a user terminal in one embodiment to which the data recording method of the present invention is applied.  illustrates a restore screen displayed at the user terminal in one embodiment to which the data recording method of the present invention is applied.  shows an exemplary flowchart for explaining one embodiment to which the data recording method of the present invention is applied.","The procedure described below is carried out according to the flowchart of FIG. . The procedure is recorded in a recording device of the server , and read out and executed by a processor (not shown) in the server . First, a user calls the screen of  from the server  by operating the user terminal , and starts a data backup operation (step ). Then, the user selects the non-mixed attribute mode as a tape mode (step ). The selection of the tape mode is carried out, for example, by clicking a \u201cnon-mixed attribute\u201d button on the screen of the user terminal .","When the tape mode is selected by the user, the server  reads the header data written at the beginning of each magnetic tape housed in the magnetic tape storage  to select a magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode. When multiple magnetic tapes having the non-mixed attribute mode are housed in the magnetic tape storage, selection of a magnetic tape is carried out after step .","Further, the server  reads the header data of the data written at the beginning of the magnetic tape. The server  displays the read information as detailed information of all the data written on the magnetic tape on a display of the user terminal  in a manner illustrated in  (step ). The non-mixed attribute mode can be identified from the header data of the data recorded at the beginning of the magnetic tape.","As illustrated in , the detailed information contains a tape name, and names, sizes and attributes of backed up data. Further, a free or writable capacity remaining on the magnetic tape is also displayed together with the detailed information. The user who operates the user terminal  can check the state of data written on the magnetic tape by viewing the detailed information of the written data displayed on the screen of FIG. .","The user checks the above detailed display, and selects a data writing position (step ). That is, the user selects which displayed data are to be overwritten (step ). Such selection can be carried out by moving a cursor to a selected portion and clicking it. Then, the user selects data to be backed up by overwriting (data to be written) from a recording device such as a hard disk drive disposed in the server  (step ). In this selection, the user can use a \u201cselect backup data\u201d button to select the overwriting data from another data file (not shown). Following step , the server  judges whether the mode selected in step  is the mixed attribute mode or not (step ). In this example, the non-mixed attribute mode has been selected in step , and thus the decision of step  is false that causes a branch to step . In step , the server  determines whether data are written on the selected magnetic tape. In this example, a magnetic tape on which the data have been written is selected, so that the judgment of step  is true.","Next, the server  reads a data attribute from the header data of the data written at the beginning of the selected magnetic tape (step ). If the read data attribute is \u201cprotection\u201d, the server  prompts the user to input a user ID and a password on the display of the user terminal . The user ID and the password correspond to the written data which are to be overwritten. Accordingly, others who do not know the user ID and the password of the written data cannot go to the subsequent steps. When the read data attribute is \u201cread only\u201d, an error is indicated.","Next, the server  sets an attribute of the data selected in step  to the attribute read in step . The user checks the selected and inputted items on the screen of , if there is no problem, clicks the backup button on the screen of  to instruct execution of the backup. In response to this instruction, the server  overwrites the specified data on the magnetic tape. That is, the server  first writes the header data of the backup data (step ), and then writes the backup data (step ). Thus, the writing of the backup data by the overwriting operation is finished (step ). In this example, the header data contains the tape mode and the data attribute. When \u201cprotection\u201d is selected as the attribute, the header data further contains the user id and the password.","The above data writing procedure will be described further with reference to . It is assumed here that the data A which has been written on the magnetic tape  are overwritten. In this example, the data A to A having the same attribute have been written on the magnetic tape  before the data writing is carried out (FIG. ). Then the data A recorded on the magnetic tap  are overwritten with the backup data having the same attribute as the data A to A. In , the data A thus overwritten is replaced with data A-. Further, the data A are deleted due to the overwriting of the data A.","In this example, it is assumed that the backup data are written on a magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode on which no data are written. In this case, writing of the backup data is the first writing operation for the magnetic tape. The user operates the terminal  to start the data backup operation (step ), and selects the non-mixed attribute mode as a tape mode (step ). In response to this selection, the server  selects a magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode which is housed in the magnetic tape storage . In this example, no data are written on the selected magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode.","In response to the selection of the tape mode in step , the server  displays the detailed information of the selected tape on the screen shown in  with indication at the corresponding portion on the screen shown in  that no data are written (step ).","In this example, since no data are written on the selected magnetic tape, the user indicates a beginning position of the magnetic tape as a data writing position (step ). Next, the user selects data to be written (step ). The server  then determines whether the mode of the magnetic tape selected in step  is the mixed attribute mode or not (step ). In this example, since the non-mixed attribute mode is selected in step , the judgment of the step  is false. Next, the server  determines whether data have been written on the selected magnetic tape (step ). Since the magnetic tape having no data written thereon is selected, the judgment of the step  is true.","Next, the user selects an attribute of the data selected in step  (step ). When \u201cprotection\u201d is selected as the attribute, the server  requests a user ID and a password to the user. If there is no problem in the selected and inputted items, the user clicks the backup button shown in  to instruct data writing to the server  (step ). In response to this instruction, the server  writes header data (step ), and further writes the backup data (step ). The header data contains information indicating the non-mixed attribute mode. Thus, the writing of the backup data is finished (step ).","Once the backup data is written, any data which will be subsequently written on the magnetic tape should have the same attribute as that of the first written data. For example, if \u201cread only\u201d has been selected as a data attribute, any data to be subsequently written must have the \u201cread only\u201d attribute. In this case, since the attribute prohibits overwriting, the attribute once written cannot be changed.","In this example, it is assumed that data are written in a free area on a magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode on which other data have been written. In this case, since the non-mixed attribute mode is set, data to be written in the free area should have the same attribute as that of the written data.","The user operates the terminal  to start the data backup (step ), and selects the non-mixed attribute mode as a tape mode (step ). In response to the operation of the user, the server  selects a magnetic tape set to the selected mode, and displays, on the screen shown in , information of data written on the magnetic tape (step ).","Next, the user indicates a data writing position on the screen of FIG. . In this example, the user can indicate the data writing position by clicking an unoccupied portion below the written data on the screen of  (step ). The user then selects data to be written on a screen (not shown) (step ). In response to this operation, the server  determines whether the mode of the magnetic tape selected in step  is the mixed attribute mode or not (step ). In this example, since the non-mixed attribute mode has been selected in step , the decision of the step  is false.","Next, the server  judges whether data are written on the selected magnetic tape (step ). Since it is assumed in this example that data have been written on the magnetic tape, the decision of the step  is true. In response to the determine \u201cYES\u201d in step , the server  reads the attribute of data written at the first position of the magnetic tape, which is contained in its header data (step ). If the attribute of the read data is \u201cprotection\u201d, the server  prompts the user to input a user ID and a password on the display of the user terminal . The user cannot go to the subsequent procedures unless the user inputs the user ID and the password.","Next, the server  sets the attribute of the data selected in step  to the same one as the data attribute read in step . The user checks the selected and inputted items on the screen of , and if there is no problem, the user clicks the backup button on the screen of  to instruct execution of the backup. In response to the instruction, the server  writes the data selected in step  in a free area on the magnetic tape. That is, the server  writes the header data of the selected data (step ), and then writes the backup data (step ). Thus, the writing of the backup data is finished (step ).","The above writing procedure will be described with reference to . In this example, before the data writing is carried out, the data A to A having the same attribute have been written on the magnetic tape . Data A are newly written in a free area subsequent to the data A recorded on the magnetic tape , with the same attribute as that of the data A to A.","In this example, it is assumed that the user writes data in a free area of a magnetic tape having the mixed attribute mode. First, the user operates the user terminal  to access the server  through the LAN  and invokes the backup operation screen shown in FIG. . This operation starts the backup operation of backup data (step ). Next, the user selects, on the screen of , the mode of the magnetic tape on which the backup data will be written (the mixed attribute mode in this example) (step ). In response to this selection, the server  reads header data written at the beginning of each magnetic tape in the magnetic tape storage , and selects a magnetic tape having the mixed attribute mode.","When the magnetic tape having the mixed attribute mode is selected, the server  displays detailed information of all data written on the selected magnetic tape at that time on the screen of  (step ). Then, on the screen of , the user moves a cursor to a blank portion below data names which have been written, and clicks it to start the operation of writing new data in a free area. Through this operation, the writing position of the data is indicated (step ). Next, the user uses the select backup data button to select a data file to be written or backed up on another screen (not shown) (step ), and inputs a data name at the position previously indicated on the screen of  in step . Selected in step  are data handled in the server , and thus the data are read out from the hard disk drive in the server .","Then, the server  judges whether the mode of the selected magnetic tape is the mixed attribute mode or not (step ). Since the mode selected in step  is the mixed attribute mode in this example, the decision of the step  is true.","Next, the user selects the attribute of the data to be written (step ). The user may select the \u201cread\/write\u201d attribute on the screen of , for example. Then, the user checks all the inputted items and clicks the backup button of FIG. . In response to this operation, the server  writes the header data in a free area on the magnetic tape (step ), and subsequently writes the backup data (step ). Thus, the writing of the backup data in the free area is finished (step ).","An example of the above data writing operation will be described with reference to .  shows a state that the data A to A have been written on the magnetic tape .  shows a state that the data A are further written in a free area after the state of FIG. .","In the above example, the data A is written in the free area subsequent to the data A on the magnetic tape  having the mixed attribute mode on which the data A to A have been written as shown in , and thus the state shown in  is achieved. Since the magnetic tape  is set to the mixed attribute mode, the data A to A may have the same or different attributes.","In this example, it is assumed that data which have been written on a magnetic tape having the mixed attribute mode will be overwritten. The user first selects a magnetic tape having the mixed attribute mode in step . After step , on the screen of , the user selects specific data to be overwritten which have been written on the magnetic tape. Through this operation, the data writing position (overwriting position) is indicated (step ). If the attribute of the selected data (data to be overwritten) is \u201cprotection\u201d, the server  requests the user to input a user ID and a password. If the attribute is \u201cread only\u201d, an error is notified.","Next, the user selects overwriting data (step ). In response to this selection, the server  determines whether the mode of the magnetic tape selected is the mixed attribute mode or not (step ). In this example, the decision of the step  is true. Thereafter, the user selects the attribute of the overwriting data (step ). Since the magnetic tape on which the overwriting is to be conducted has the mixed attribute mode in this example, the overwriting data may have an attribute different from the attributes of the data which have been written on the magnetic tape.","When the user selects the \u201cprotection\u201d attribute, the server  requests the user to input new user ID and password. If there is no problem in the inputted and set items, the user clicks the backup button on the screen shown in  to instruct the backup by the overwriting. In response to the instruction of executing the backup, the server  first writes the header data (step ), and then writes the backup data (step ). Thus, the writing of the backup data is finished (step ).","In the above, the header data contains the mode of the tape and the attribute of the data.

Further,  shows the state that the data A of  has been deleted due to the overwriting of the data A of FIG. .","Since the above example assumes the mixed attribute mode, each of the data A to A may have any attribute.","An example of restoring will be described below.  shows a screen displayed on the user terminal when restoring is carried out. In this example, the user operates the user terminal  to access the server , invokes a restoring screen of  to display it on the display of the user terminal . Then, the user selects a magnetic tape for restoring by indicating the name of the tape, for example. The server  displays a list of data recorded on the selected magnetic tape on the screen of FIG. . The user selects data to be restored from this display. If the attribute of the selected data is \u201cprotection\u201d, the server  displays on the display of  an indication requesting the user to input a user ID and a password.","If there is no problem in all items, the user specifies a restore destination on the screen of , and then clicks a restore button to instruct restoring of the selected data. In response to this instruction, the server  reads the data to be restored from the magnetic tape, and then writes the data in the restore destination.","In the above shown embodiments, the user can recognize the state of the data recorded on the magnetic tape at the time of the backup operation or the restoring operation at the user terminal which the user operates. By recognizing the state of the data which have been recorded, the user can judge importance of the data or priorities of the data to be left as backup data. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent occurrence of an accident that important backup data are deleted due to careless backup or restoring, which would lead to database corruption.","When the attribute of the data written is \u201cread only\u201d, no overwriting can be carried out, so that it is possible to prevent such a situation that written data are deleted due to overwriting. Further, with respect to data having high importance, it is possible to achieve a backup state of the data with lower risk of deletion by setting the mode of the magnetic tape to the non-mixed attribute mode, and the attribute of the data to be written to \u201cread only\u201d.","Also, by setting the attribute of the data to \u201cprotection\u201d, only a specific user is permitted to access the data, and thus security for data protection is enhanced. Particularly, it is possible to achieve a backup state of the data with lower risk of deletion by a third person by setting the magnetic tape to the non-mixed attribute mode and the attribute of data to be written to \u201cprotection\u201d. Further, in the above-shown embodiments, even when data having the \u201cread only\u201d attribute prohibiting overwriting are written on the magnetic tape, a free area can be used.","Further, in the above-shown embodiments, plural magnetic tapes may be provided each of which has a selectable tape mode. By utilizing this, the user can perform flexible operations in which data which should never be lost are written on a magnetic tape having the non-mixed attribute mode with the attribute of the data being set to \u201cread only\u201d, while data to be backed up for the present are written on a magnetic tape having the mixed attribute mode with the attribute being selected properly.","According to the above-shown embodiments, it is possible to construct a data backup system which can prevent occurrence of an accident that important data are lost, enhance secrecy of data, if necessary, and further effectively use the magnetic tape, by properly selecting the data attribute and the tape mode. Further, according to the embodiments, it is possible to properly select a data backup method depending on a data handling manner.","The above operation is carried out by using GUI. Since the information on the data attribute and tape mode is recorded on the magnetic tape, there is no cumbersome operation as compared with the one found in the conventional magnetic tape storage. All the setting operations can be performed through the GUI provided from the server. This is significant from the viewpoint of usability for the user. Further, the above operation does not need cumbersome proceedings such as communications with the administrator, checking, etc. for the backup operation even when the server and the magnetic tape storage are placed remotely from the user.","The above-shown embodiments may be implemented by developing software for executing the above procedure, which can be realized at low cost. This point further enhances the superiority of the magnetic tape storage which is originally low in cost per recording capacity.","In the above-shown embodiments, the magnetic tape storage may be equipped with plural magnetic tapes having the same mode. For example, it may be equipped with two magnetic tapes having the non-mixed attribute mode, one of which is exclusively used for data having the \u201cread only\u201d attribute while the other is exclusively used for data having the \u201cprotection\u201d attribute. This allows the user to properly use the magnetic tapes, for example, the former magnetic tape is used for data which should not be overwritten while the latter magnetic tape is used for data which can be accessed from only a specific person, so that a backup method suited to a given data type can be implemented.","Also, while the above-shown embodiments have been described in which the attribute is read out from the header data of the first data on the magnetic tape in step , the attribute may be read out from the header data of any data written on the tape in step . While the present invention has been specifically described with reference to the embodiments thereof, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and can be modified without departing from the gist thereof.","For example, while three user terminals are shown in , the number of the user terminals is not limited to three. Usually, a larger number of user terminals are connected to the LAN . The server  is not limited to NAS, and any server having the function of providing required services may be selected properly. Further, a mail server, a communication server, a print server, a printer, etc. may be connected to the LAN environment shown in . Also, a printer, a scanner, etc. may be connected to any user terminal.","The magnetic tape storage may have a configuration in which only one magnetic tape can be used, or while only one magnetic tape can be used, it can be replaced with a new magnetic tape when the free capacity of the tape becomes too small.","In the configuration in which only one magnetic tape can be used, the user may not freely select the mixed attribute mode or the non-mixed attribute mode. For example, when data having the \u201cprotection\u201d attribute have been written on a tape having the non-mixed attribute mode, data having the \u201cread only\u201d attribute cannot be written subsequently thereto. In order to overcome this inconvenience, magnetic tape storage dedicated to the mixed attribute mode and the non-mixed attribute mode, respectively, may be separately provided, and the selection thereof may be controlled by the server. Alternatively, plural magnetic tape storage dedicated to the non-mixed attribute mode may be provided, and the selection thereof may be controlled by the server.","Also, while the embodiments utilizing the LAN environment have been described, the present invention may be applied to a larger network environment. For example, the present invention may be applied to a data backup system in a domestic or worldwide network of a specific company or organization.","In the above-described embodiments, the user performs the data backup operation by using the GUI displayed on the screen of the user terminal. However, any equipment that can perform the same function as that described in the above embodiments may be used as a terminal operated by the user. For example, a PDA or a cellular phone may be used as a terminal operated by the user.","The data attribute is not limited to those described in the embodiments, and various attributes can be set, such as a \u201cread only\/protection\u201d attribute which prevents data from being accessed or overwritten unless a user ID and a password are inputted, and an attribute which requires inputting of a user ID and a password when restoring is carried out.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention itself, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objects, and advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00020","num":"00020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00022","num":"00022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
