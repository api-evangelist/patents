No. 60\/790,046 that was filed Apr. 7, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the following agency: NSF IIS Division Grant No. 0513692. The United States has certain rights in this invention.","The field of the disclosure relates generally to data processing to create results for presentation to a user. More specifically, the disclosure relates to the use of a workflow query and\/or an analogy defined between workflows to rapidly develop new data processing results based on the query and the analogy.","The volume of information has been growing at an exponential rate. Since 2003, new information generated annually exceeds the amount of information created in all previous years. Digital information now makes up more than 90% of all information produced, vastly exceeding data generated on paper and film. One of the greatest scientific and engineering challenges of the 21st century is to effectively understand and leverage this growing wealth of data. Computational processes are widely-used to analyze, understand, integrate, and transform data. For example, to understand trends in multi-dimensional data in a data warehouse, analysts generally go through an often time-consuming process of iteratively drilling down and rolling up through the different axes to find interesting \u2018nuggets\u2019 in the data. Often, to mine data, several algorithms are applied and results are compared, not only among different algorithms, but also among different configurations of a given algorithm. To build data warehouses and data marts that integrate data from disparate data sources within an enterprise, extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) workflows need to be assembled to create consistent, accurate information. Additionally, to understand and to accurately model the behavior of environmental components, environmental scientists often need to create complex visualization dataflows to compare the visual representations of the actual behavior observed by sensors with the behavior predicted in simulations. Further, to improve the quality of a digital photo, a user may explore different combinations of filters. As a further example, to plan a radiation treatment, a radiation oncologist may create a large number of 3-dimensional (3-D) visualizations to find a visualization that clearly shows the lesion tissue that requires treatment.","Due to their exploratory nature, these tasks involve sometime large numbers of trial-and-error steps. In an exploratory process, users may need to select data and specify the algorithms and visualization techniques used to process and to analyze the data. The analysis specification is adjusted in an iterative process as the user generates, explores, and evaluates hypotheses associated with the information under study. To successfully analyze and validate various hypotheses, it is necessary to pose queries, correlate disparate data, and create insightful data products of both the simulated processes and observed phenomena. Before users can view and analyze results, they need to assemble and execute complex pipelines (dataflows) by selecting data sets, specifying a series of operations to be performed on the data, and creating an appropriate visual representation. As an additional factor that contributes to the complexity of these tasks, assembling the computational processes may require a combination of loosely-coupled resources, including specialized libraries, grid and Web services that may generate yet more data, adding to the overflow of information users need to process.","Workflows are emerging as a paradigm for representing and managing complex computations. Workflows can capture complex analysis processes at various levels of detail and capture the provenance information necessary for reproducibility, result publication, and result sharing among collaborators. Because of the formalism they provide and the automation they support, workflows have the potential to accelerate and to transform the information analysis process. Workflows are rapidly replacing primitive shell scripts as evidenced by the release of Automator by Apple\u00ae, Data Analysis Foundation by Microsoft\u00ae, and Scientific Data Analysis Solution by SGI\u00ae.","Often, insight comes from comparing the results of multiple visualizations created during the exploration process. For example, by applying a given visualization process to multiple datasets generated in different simulations; by varying the values of certain visualization parameters; or by applying different variations of a given process (e.g., which use different visualization algorithms) to a dataset, insight can be gained. The path from \u201cdata to insight\u201d requires a laborious, trial-and-error process, where users assemble, iteratively modify, and execute complex workflows, which may include pipelines and\/or dataflows.","In the course of exploratory studies, users often build large collections of workflows, which include, for example, different types of visualizations, each of which may help in the understanding of a different aspect of their data. For example, a user working on a new computational fluid dynamics application might need a collection of visualizations such as 3-dimensional (3-D) isosurface plots, 2-dimensional (2-D) plots with relevant quantitative information, and various direct volume rendering images. Although in general, each visualization is implemented in a separate workflow, there is a certain amount of overlap between the workflows. For example, each workflow may manipulate the same input dataset(s). Furthermore, for a particular class of visualizations, the users might generate several different versions of each individual workflow while fine tuning visualization parameters or experimenting with different data sets. Thus, constructing insightful visualizations is a laborious process that requires expertise in both visualization techniques as well as the domain of the data being explored. Therefore, what is needed is a method and a system for simplifying and semi-automating the construction of new visualizations to allow the rapid development of workflows and to reduce the need to understand both visualization techniques and the data domain.","A method and a system for capturing, modeling, storing, querying, and\/or interacting with provenance information for an evolutionary workflow process is provided in an exemplary embodiment. Modifications to a workflow are captured as the user generates, explores, and evaluates hypotheses associated with data under study. Abstractly, a workflow consists of modules (e.g., programs, scripts, function calls, application programming interface (API) calls, etc.) connected in a network to define a result. A dataflow is an exemplary workflow. The initial modules and the subsequent modifications are captured as actions that identify, for example, a change to a parameter value of a module in the workflow, an addition or a deletion of a module in the workflow, an addition or a deletion of a module connection in the workflow, addition or deletion of a constraint in the workflow, etc. These changes are presented in a version tree, which reflects the evolution of the evolutionary workflow process over time. The provenance information can also be used to simplify and to semi-automate the development of new results for presentation to users to aid both expert and non-expert users in performing data exploration.","In an exemplary embodiment, a device for identifying a workflow of a plurality of workflows is provided. The device includes, but is not limited to, a computer-readable medium having computer-readable instructions therein and a processor. The processor is coupled to the computer-readable medium and is configured to execute the instructions. The instructions comprise receiving a query workflow at a first device, wherein the query workflow comprises a plurality of modules, and further wherein the plurality of modules are connected; identifying a workflow of a plurality of workflows, the identified workflow at least partially matching the received query workflow; and presenting the identified workflow to a user at the first device.","A method of identifying a workflow of a plurality of workflows is provided. A query workflow is received at a first device, which includes a plurality of modules that are connected. A workflow is identified of a plurality of workflows, the identified workflow at least partially matching the received query workflow. The identified workflow is presented to a user at the first device.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, a computer-readable medium is provided. The computer-readable medium has computer-readable instructions therein that, upon execution by a processor, cause the processor to implement the operations of the method of identifying a workflow of a plurality of workflows.","In an exemplary embodiment, a device for creating an analogous workflow is provided. The device includes, but is not limited to, a computer-readable medium having computer-readable instructions therein and a processor. The processor is coupled to the computer-readable medium and is configured to execute the instructions. The instructions comprise receiving a first workflow, a second workflow, and a third workflow, determining an analogy workflow based on a difference between the received first workflow and the received second workflow, applying the determined analogy workflow to the received third workflow to define a fourth workflow, and presenting the defined fourth workflow to a user at the first device. The first workflow comprises a plurality of first modules that are connected. The second workflow comprises a plurality of second modules that are connected.

A second workflow is received at the first device, the second workflow including a plurality of second modules that are connected. A third workflow is received at the first device, the third workflow including a plurality of third modules that are connected. An analogy workflow is determined based on a difference between the received first workflow and the received second workflow. The determined analogy workflow is applied to the received third workflow to define a fourth workflow. The defined fourth workflow is presented to a user at the first device.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, a computer-readable medium is provided. The computer-readable medium has computer-readable instructions therein that, upon execution by a processor, cause the processor to implement the operations of the method of creating an analogous workflow.","Other principal features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following drawings, the detailed description, and the appended claims.","With reference to , a block diagram of an evolutionary workflow processing system  is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The components of evolutionary workflow processing system  may be implemented using one or more computing devices, which may be a computer of any form factor such as a laptop, a desktop, a server, etc. Evolutionary workflow processing system  may include a display , an input interface , a memory , a communication interface , a processor , and an evolutionary workflow tool . Different and additional components may be incorporated into evolutionary workflow processing system . For example, evolutionary workflow processing system  may include speakers for presentation of audio media content.","Display  presents information to a user of evolutionary workflow processing system  as known to those skilled in the art. For example, display  may be a thin film transistor display, a light emitting diode display, a liquid crystal display, or any of a variety of different displays known to those skilled in the art now or in the future.","Input interface  provides an interface for receiving information from the user for entry into evolutionary workflow tool  as known to those skilled in the art. Input interface  may use various input technologies including, but not limited to, a keyboard, a pen and touch screen, a mouse, a track ball, a touch screen, a keypad, one or more buttons, etc. to allow the user to enter information into evolutionary workflow tool  or to make selections presented in a user interface displayed on display  under control of evolutionary workflow tool . Input interface  may provide both an input and an output interface. For example, a touch screen both allows user input and presents output to the user.","Memory  is an electronic holding place or storage for information so that the information can be accessed by processor  as known to those skilled in the art. Evolutionary workflow processing system  may have one or more memories that use the same or a different memory technology. Memory technologies include, but are not limited to, any type of RAM, any type of ROM, any type of flash memory, etc. Evolutionary workflow processing system  also may have one or more drives that support the loading of a memory media such as a CD or DVD or ports that support connectivity with memory media such as flash drives.","Communication interface  provides an interface for receiving and transmitting data between devices using various protocols, transmission technologies, and media as known to those skilled in the art. The communication interface may support communication using various transmission media that may be wired or wireless. Evolutionary workflow processing system  may have one or more communication interfaces that use the same or different protocols, transmission technologies, and media.","Processor  executes instructions as known to those skilled in the art. The instructions may be carried out by a special purpose computer, logic circuits, or hardware circuits. Thus, processor  may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination of these methods. The term \u201cexecution\u201d is the process of running an application or the carrying out of the operation called for by an instruction. The instructions may be written using one or more programming language, scripting language, assembly language, etc. Processor  executes an instruction, meaning that it performs the operations called for by that instruction. Processor  operably couples with display , with input interface , with memory , and with communication interface  to receive, to send, and to process information. Processor  may retrieve a set of instructions from a permanent memory device and copy the instructions in an executable form to a temporary memory device that is generally some form of RAM. Evolutionary workflow processing system  may include a plurality of processors that use the same or a different processing technology.","Evolutionary workflow tool  provides an infrastructure for systematically capturing detailed provenance and streamlining the data exploration process. Evolutionary workflow tool  uniformly captures provenance for workflows used to create results as part of a evolutionary workflow process used to generate a final result. A result may include a Boolean value, a visualization, a table, a graph, a histogram, a numerical value, a string, etc. The result may be presented pictorially, numerically, graphically, textually, as an animation, audibly, etc. Use of evolutionary workflow tool  allows reproducibility of results and simplifies data exploration by allowing users to easily navigate through the space of workflows and parameter settings associated with an exploration task. Evolutionary workflow tool  may include a workflow execution engine , a cache manager , a cache , and an evolutionary workflow interaction application . One or more of the components of evolutionary workflow tool  may interact through communication interface  using a network such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, the Internet, etc. Thus, the components of evolutionary workflow tool  may be implemented at a single computing device or a plurality of computing devices in a single location, in a single facility, and\/or may be remote from one another.","Evolutionary workflow tool  provides a graphical user interface for creating, editing, executing, and querying workflows and for capturing a full provenance of the exploration process defined as part of an evolutionary workflow process. As a user first creates an initial workflow and then makes modifications to define additional workflows, a capture mechanism records the modifications. Thus, instead of storing a set of related workflows, the operations or changes that are applied to create a series of workflows, such as the addition of a module, the modification of a parameter, etc. are stored. Such a representation uses substantially less space than storing multiple versions of a workflow and enables the construction of an intuitive interface that allows the user to understand and to interact with the evolution of the workflow through these changes.","Workflow execution engine  may be invoked by a user of evolutionary workflow interaction application . Workflow execution engine  receives a workflow as an input from evolutionary workflow interaction application  and executes the received workflow. Workflow execution engine  executes the operations defined by the received workflow by invoking the appropriate functions. The functions may be invoked from a plurality of sources, including libraries, visualization APIs, and script APIs. In general, the workflow manipulates one or more data files that contain the data for processing and that may be stored in a database . A plurality of evolutionary workflow files may be organized in database  which may include a structured query language (SQL) database. The database may be organized into multiple databases to improve data management and access. The multiple databases may be organized into tiers. Additionally, database  may include a file system including a plurality of data files. Database  may further be accessed by remote users using communication interface . Remote users may checkout and checkin data and\/or files from database  as known to those skilled in the art.","Cache manager  controls workflow execution keeping track of operations that are invoked and their respective parameters. Only new combinations of operations and parameters are requested from workflow execution engine . Cache manager  scheduled the execution of modules in a workflow execution performed by workflow execution engine . Cache manager  determines data dependencies among the modules associated with the received workflow and substitutes a call to access data from a results cache to a call to access data from cache  based on the determined data dependencies and identification of common intermediate results generated during execution of the workflow. As the workflow is executed, cache manager  stores the results of one or more of the modules. For example, a module name and parameter values together with a handle to the output results may be stored. Cache manager  performs a cache lookup from cache  based on the determined data dependencies during a workflow execution process to avoid redundant processing of overlapping sequences in multiple workflows. Caching is specially useful while exploring multiple results. When variations of the same workflow need to be executed, a substantial improvement in execution time can be obtained by caching the results of overlapping subsequences of the workflows. Cache  is implemented using a type of memory.","Evolutionary workflow interaction application  may include a workflow creator application  and a result presentation application . For example, user interface windows associated with workflow creator application  and a result presentation application  may be opened together. With reference to , a user interface  of workflow creator application  is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. User interface  includes a module selection region , a workflow interaction region , and a menu region . Module selection region  may include a list of modules  that can be used to build a workflow and a search text box  that can be used to locate a specific module to be included in a workflow. User entry of a module name in search text box  causes the corresponding module to be presented in the list of modules . The list of modules  may be presented in a tree view based on a class structure hierarchy. Workflow interaction region  may include a workflow area  and a picture-in-picture (PIP) area . PIP area  may be removed by user selection of a PIP button  which toggles the display of PIP area  on and off. Items presented in workflow area  are controlled based on user selection of a workflow tab , a version tree tab , a query tab , and a parameter exploration tab . Items presented in menu region  are controlled based on the item selected for display in workflow area . In the exemplary embodiment of , user interface  is shown with an empty workflow interaction region  because no evolutionary workflow process has been opened from an existing data file or has been created.","The stored provenance consists of one or more change actions applied to a workflow. The provenance is represented as a rooted version tree, where each node corresponds to a version of a workflow and where edges between nodes correspond to the action applied to create one from the other. The version tree reflects the process followed by the user to construct and to explore workflows as part of the evolutionary workflow process and to concisely represent all the workflow versions explored. With reference to , workflow area  includes a version tree , and PIP area  includes a workflow diagram  based on user selection of version tree tab . In the exemplary embodiment of , user interface  is shown with a version tree in workflow interaction region  after user selection of an existing node in the version tree. Version tree diagram  indicates a parent-child relationship between an empty workflow  and a first workflow , a parent-child relationship between first workflow  and a second workflow , a parent-child relationship between second workflow  and a third workflow , and a parent-child relationship between third workflow  and a fourth workflow . First workflow  is indicated as an oval which includes a name associated with first workflow  and a line which connects first workflow  to second workflow . The line indicates that first workflow  is a parent of second workflow . Similarly, second workflow  is indicated as an oval which includes a name associated with second workflow  and a line which connects second workflow  to third workflow . The line indicates that second workflow  is a parent of third workflow . Third workflow  is indicated as an oval which includes a name associated with third workflow  and a line which connects third workflow  to fourth workflow . The line indicates that third workflow  is a parent of fourth workflow .","The user optionally may show all nodes in the version tree or may only show nodes that have been named or tagged. A connection between named nodes may be represented in different ways. For example, a connection may be indicated with three perpendicular lines crossing the connection line to represent that a plurality of actions are performed to create the child. A connection without the three perpendicular lines may indicate that a single action is performed to create the child.","In the exemplary embodiment of , fourth workflow  is highlighted to indicate selection by the user. As a result, workflow diagram  includes a workflow diagram of fourth workflow . Additionally, a provenance summary area  includes a workflow name textbox  for fourth workflow , an author text field , a creation date text field , and a notes text area . The provenance summary information may be captured as metadata. The user can change the name of fourth workflow  by entering a new name in workflow name textbox  and selecting a \u201cchange\u201d button . The new name is presented in the oval associated with fourth workflow  and is updated in database  to capture the version tree.","With reference to , workflow area  includes a first workflow diagram  based on user selection of workflow tab . The workflow associated with the selected oval in version tree diagram  is presented. In this mode, workflow area  is used to create and edit workflows. A nodes-and-connections paradigm or pipeline view associated with workflow systems is used to present the workflow to the user. First workflow diagram  includes a plurality of nodes . Each node is associated with a module that executes a function which includes instructions executed as part of the execution of the workflow to form a data product. A node can be repositioned by dragging it to the desired location of workflow area .

All of the methods that can set module parameters for selected module  are listed in method grid . A user selects a method from method grid . Parameter area  displays a plurality of parameters  which can be defined by the user using the selected method. Associated with each of the plurality of parameters  is a label, which indicates the parameter input type and a text box for editing the parameter. Initially, default values are shown in the text boxes. To select a method, the user may drag the method to parameter area . Alternatively, the user may select the method from method grid  which causes the display of the parameters in parameter area . When a module is changed, a new workflow with the changed parameters is added to version tree  automatically.","A workflow is created by dragging one or more modules from module selection region  to workflow area . The plurality of nodes  are connected with lines  that represent the workflow connections through the modules. Modules can be connected or disconnected and added or deleted from a workflow. The line connecting each of the modules starts and ends in a small box at the top or bottom of the node representing a module. To disconnect modules, the user selects the connection line and selects delete. To connect two modules, the user places the cursor over a small box in the lower right corner of a first node corresponding to an output port, clicks the mouse, and holds down the mouse button while dragging the cursor from the first node to an input port of the second node. A connection line appears. In the exemplary embodiment of , input ports to a module are shown in the upper left corner of each node as small squares and output ports are shown in the lower right corner of each node as small squares. Each node may have zero, one, or more input ports and zero, one, or more output ports depending on the functionality provided by the module. The input ports of the module only accept connections from correct output ports. Dropping a connection on a module causes it to snap to the most appropriate port. However, when a module accepts multiple ports of the same type, proper connectivity is achieved by starting the connection at the module with multiple ports of the same type and by dragging the mouse to the appropriate endpoint. To determine the port to start at, hovering the mouse cursor over a port causes presentation of a small note which includes information about the port in question.","Input and\/or output ports can be added to a module.

The plurality of dimension selector buttons  are included for selected method  because a plurality of parameters can be used to perform the parameter exploration. In some cases, a single parameter may be presented with a number of steps value that can be defined by the user. In addition, general functions can be defined that produce a set of values.","A dimension is associated with each of the plurality of dimension selector buttons . Because a plurality of data products are created during execution of the parameter exploration process, the user can select which parameterization is presented in either a column dimension , a row dimension , a sheet dimension , or a time dimension  within a cell of a data product spreadsheet. For each dimension, an indicator  indicates the dimension graphically and a number of steps value  indicates the number of steps to be taken between a start value selected for the parameter by the user and an end value selected for the parameter by the user in the respective start value text box  and end value text box . The user can modify the number of steps value  associated with each of the plurality of dimension selector buttons  to cause repetition of the execution of the workflow for values for the parameter from the start value to the end value in the selected number of steps. The user may optionally select an ignore button  to leave the associated parameter out of the exploration.","The user may also select a method for defining each value of the parameter as part of the parameter exploration process by selecting an interpolation button  associated with each parameter of parameter grid .

In the exemplary embodiment of , column , row  contains the data product formed form execution of third workflow  shown with reference to ; column , row  contains the data product formed form execution of fourth workflow  shown with reference to ; column , row  contains the data product formed form execution of sixth workflow  shown with reference to ; and column , row  contains the data product formed form execution of seventh workflow  shown with reference to .","Result presentation application  may use various techniques and formats to display and represent the results of a workflow execution. For example, a cell may display a Web page (in hypertext markup language), text, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional graphs, histograms, animations, numbers, etc. The result presentation interface can be used to display the results of parameter explorations side by side, for example, varying different parameters over different axes, or in an animation performed by repeating a workflow over time. In addition, display cells can share the same cache so that overlapping computations across the corresponding workflows are shared.","With reference to , a query result  is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment in workflow area . The query interface of workflow creator application  supports both simple, keyword-based and selection queries such as finding a result created by a given user, as well as complex, structure based queries such as finding results that apply simplification before an isosurface computation for irregular grid data sets. To support simple, keyword-based and selection queries, a query identification area  includes a query text box , a \u201cSearch\u201d button , a \u201cRefine\u201d button , and a \u201cReset\u201d button . Simple keyword-based queries as well as structured queries may be supported. A user identifies a module to be searched for in version tree . The user enter the module name in query text box  and selects \u201cSearch\u201d button .","In the exemplary embodiment of , the module having the name \u201cvtkCamera\u201d is to be located in the workflows of version tree . Version tree  is traversed to identify workflows which include the module based on the module name entered. The identified workflows are presented in workflow area  through highlighting. For example, in the exemplary embodiment of , second workflow , fifth workflow , sixth workflow , and seventh workflow  include the selected module. Alternatively, if after specifying a query the user selects \u201cRefine\u201d button , instead of highlighting the selected nodes and graying the nodes that do not match the query, the non-matching nodes are hidden and collapsed into crossed edges.","With reference to , a query can be defined in workflow area  based on user selection of query tab  to support complex, structure based queries. Instead of searching for use of a single module in the workflows of the version tree, the user selects query tab  to define a plurality of modules and their connectivity for identification in the workflows of the version tree. The user selects the modules from module selection region  and defines their connectivity as described with reference to creation or to modification of a workflow thus creating a workflow or sub-workflow to query.","With reference to , a plurality of data products are shown in result presentation window  of result presentation application  in accordance with a second exemplary embodiment. Each cell can contain one or more pictorial representation, one or more numerical representation, one or more textual representation, one or more pictorial animation, and an audible representation. Controls can be included within each cell to control the display, to play an animation within the cell, etc.","Information associated with a version tree is defined based on an extensible markup language (XML) schema in an exemplary embodiment. User interaction with workflow creator application  to define workflows is captured as a series of actions of different types. The different actions are associated with adding modules, deleting modules, changing parameter values, adding connections, deleting connections, changing connections, etc. An exemplary XML schema is shown

They include files in a file system, native XML databases, relational databases, etc.","The embodiments described use a tightly-coupled architecture , shown with reference to , where the provenance management is performed in the same environment in which the workflows are created and change actions are captured. Other loosely coupled embodiments are possible in which the provenance management and capture occur in different environments. For example, a first loosely coupled system  includes a workflow system , a provenance capture module , and a provenance manager . Workflow system  and provenance capture module  are tightly coupled in the same environment. Change notifications may be sent to provenance manager  for example, in a client-server fashion. As another example, a second loosely coupled system  includes a graphical user interface (GUI) , scripts , a provenance capture module , and provenance manager . User interactions with GUI  and scripts  are captured and sent to provenance capture module , for example, in a client-server fashion. Provenance capture change notifications may be sent to provenance manager , for example, in a client-server fashion.","With reference to , a high-level overview of a synchronization process  is provided in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. A first user creates an evolutionary workflow process, which includes timestamps -. A second user checks out the evolutionary workflow process and develops a first evolutionary workflow process , which adds timestamps  and . Timestamps  and  are associated with modifications to the evolutionary workflow process performed by the second user. A third user checks out the evolutionary workflow process and develops a second evolutionary workflow process , which adds timestamps  and . Timestamps  and  are associated with modifications to the evolutionary workflow process performed by the second user. As a result, when the first user and\/or the second user check in their evolutionary workflow processes to the evolutionary workflow process acting as a parent repository, some timestamps are changed as shown with reference to third evolutionary workflow process , which is saved as the evolutionary workflow process and which includes modifications performed by the first user and the second user.","To perform synchronization, synchronization points are identified. The synchronization points are the overlapping nodes and edges in the two version trees being compared. When an evolutionary workflow process is \u2018checked-out\u2019, the system keeps track of the largest timestamp at checkout, i.e., \u201c4\u201d as in the example above. When an updated evolutionary workflow process is \u201cchecked-in\u201d, because the evolutionary workflow process is monotonic (nothing is deleted), synchronization is applied only to the nodes with a timestamp>4. For clarity, an evolutionary workflow process is captured and presented as a version tree. To merge two evolutionary workflow processes, it is sufficient to add all workflow nodes created in the independent versions of the evolutionary workflow processes while maintaining a locally unique set of timestamps for each action associated with the added workflow nodes. As shown with reference to third evolutionary workflow process , the timestamps  and  of the first user are re-labeled as  and .","To perform synchronization in a P2P environment, the process is more complex to ensure that the re-numberings are performed correctly. Because timestamps only need to be unique and persistent locally, a re-labeling map is created and maintained for each synchronization server from which a user in the P2P network executes a check-out\/check-in process and is associated with the local evolutionary workflow process. Thus, re-labeling maps may be used when there are multiple synchronization servers. At each check-out, information about the original synchronization server is kept. An evolutionary workflow process checked-out from a first server Scan only be checked back into S. If the evolutionary workflow process is saved to a server S, so that it can be exported to other users, a re-labeling map should be created in S.","The information about the original synchronization server as well as the re-labeling map is associated with the evolutionary workflow process. The re-labeling map can be saved together with the evolutionary workflow process (e.g., XML specification in a database, XML specification in a separate file, tables in a relational database, etc.) as long as the association is maintained. The re-labeling map is associated with a synchronization server that exports a given evolutionary workflow process. A synchronization server can serve (receive and export) changes performed by multiple users.","In an exemplary embodiment, a set of bijective functions \u0192: N\u2192N is used to form the re-labeling map. The function \u0192maps timestamps in the original evolutionary workflow process that is checked-out to new timestamps in the modified evolutionary workflow process. The re-labeling map includes a set of external labels associated with a set of local labels. The set of external labels for a child are the timestamps assigned by a parent evolutionary workflow process i when the child evolutionary workflow process is checked in to the parent evolutionary workflow process i in order to maintain a unique set of timestamps in the parent evolutionary workflow process i. The set of external labels for a child are the timestamps assigned by the child evolutionary workflow process as the user interacts with their evolutionary workflow tool . The set of local labels are the timestamps assigned during local execution of the evolutionary workflow process or check-in of a child evolutionary workflow process.","The set of internal labels are exposed when an evolutionary workflow process is used as a repository because the internal labels are consistent with the evolutionary workflow process. When the user stores a set of actions, the parent evolutionary workflow process provides a new set of timestamps by creating new entries in the parent's evolutionary workflow process and updating the re-labeling map to indicate a mapping between the set of external labels and the set of local labels. The re-labeling map of the child evolutionary workflow process modifies the set of external labels based on the new set of timestamps assigned by and received from the parent. As a result, the second user's re-labeling map set of external labels is changed from {5,6} to {7,8}, though the set of local labels remains {5,6}. If fis denoted as the old re-labeling map, and f\u2032is denoted as the new re-labeling map, f(5)=f\u2032(7), f(6)=f\u2032(8), and so on. Thus, even though a user's local timestamps may change when stored to the parent evolutionary workflow process, each evolutionary workflow process exposes locally consistent, unchanging timestamps to other users, ensuring correct distributed behavior.","With reference to , a collaborative workflow evolution system  is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.

If psatisfies the query, and the difference \u03b4is known, the domain context of \u03b4can be checked to determine if it contains any elements that match p. If not, palso satisfies the query. Similarly, if pdoes not match pand R(\u03b4) does not contain the necessary elements for matching p, pdoes not satisfy the query. Thus, all pipelines that satisfy the query can be determined by iteratively matching and updating the matches based on differences. Every operation performed on a workflow (adding and deleting modules, adding, deleting, and modifying connections, and\/or modifying parameters) can be expressed as a (potentially partial) function \u0192:v\u2192v. \u03b4:v\u2192v is defined as a function on the space of workflows, and \u0394:v\u00d7v\u2192\u03b4 as a function that takes two workflows pand pand produces another function that transforms pto p. For brevity, \u03b4=\u0394(p, p). Formally, the domain context of \u03b4, \u0394(\u03b4), is the set of all workflow primitives required to exist for \u03b4 to be applicable. These contexts may be represented as sets of identifiers. For example, if \u03b4 is a function that changes the filename parameter of a module with id , \u0394(\u03b4) is the set containing the module with id . Similarly, the range context of \u03b4, R(\u03b4), is the set of all workflow primitives added or modified by \u03b4. Note that \u0394(\u03b4\u22121)=R(\u03b4), which provides an easy way to compute range contexts.","As discussed with reference to , as a user develops an evolutionary workflow, the entire manipulation sequence is transparently stored in the version tree. Each action f that modifies the workflow (e.g. adding or deleting a module, connecting modules, or changing a parameter) is represented explicitly as a function \u0192:v\u2192v, where V is the space of all possible workflows. A workflow is the composition of these functions, and is materialized by applying the resulting function to an empty workflow. The action-based formalism associated with capturing the version tree supports the straightforward computation of simple differences. When p<p, \u0394(p, p) is the sequence of actions to take pto pwhich can be read directly from the workflow evolution description. In addition, the inverse operation of f for each type of operation is implemented (i.e., add module versus delete module) so that \u03b4is also easily constructed. However, if pnot< pand pnot<p, there exists some p(possibly the empty pipeline, though, in general, pis the least common ancestor of both pand p) such that p<pand p<p. Then, \u03b4=\u03b4\u03b4=\u03b4\u03b4so \u0394(p, p) can be found for any two workflows, even if they are not directly related.","The result of workflow matching can either be a binary decision (whether or not the workflows match) or a mapping between the two workflows. The binary decision can be obtained by thresholding the total score of the mapping. If D represents the set of all domain contexts, to identify the best mapping between two workflows, define map:v\u00d7v\u2192(D\u2192D) as a function which takes two pipelines, pand pas an input and produces a (partial) map from the domain context of pto the domain context of p. The map may be partial in cases where elements of pdo not have a match in por vice versa. If p<p, map(p, p)=mapis the identity on all elements that were not added or deleted in the process of deriving p. To construct such a mapping, the problem may be formulated as a weighted graph matching problem. Let G=(V, E) be the graph corresponding to the pipeline p. Vrepresents the modules in pand Erepresents the connections in p. However, other definitions such as the dual of this representation may be used. For V, a scoring function s:V\u00d7V\u2192[0.0,1.0] defines the compatibility between vertices. For example, the score of two modules that are exactly the same might be 1.0 and the score of two modules that differ except that one is a subclass of the other might be 0.6. A matching between Gand Gmay be defined as a set of pairs of vertices M={(\u03bd,\u03bd)} where \u03bd\u03b5Vand \u03bd\u03b5V.

In addition, even though discrimination between input and output ports can be included, directionality is not enforced on the edges so that similarity can be diffused along them. In workflow matching, a mapping from the context of one workflow to another is determined. To do so, the workflows are converted to labeled graphs and a scoring function is defined for nodes based on their labels. With a graph for each workflow, the mapping by pairing nodes that score well is computed and connectivity constraints are enforced between the pairs.","Let Gand Gbe the graphs corresponding to pand p.

To iteratively refine the estimate, the neighborhood similarity is diffused according to \u03c0=\u03b1A(G)\u03c0+(1\u2212\u03b1)c(G)=M\u03c0(1). The final pairwise similarity between modules is given by \u03c0=lim\u03c0. In general, c(G) provides a good measure of similarity so that A(G) may be used to break ties between multiple alternatives. Thus, a small weight \u03b1, such as \u03b1=0.15, is chosen for the neighborhood. Min Equation 1 is a linear operator; therefore, if p converges, it does so to an eigenvector. Based on the theory of Markov chains, the special structure of Mhas a spectrum ((1, \u03b1, \u03b1, . . . ) so that the iteration is exactly the power method for eigenvalue calculation. Therefore, the iteration converges to a single dominant eigenvector, and each iteration improves the estimate linearly by 1\u2212\u03b1. Because a small \u03b1 is used, a rapid convergence is achieved. From the iteration, \u03c0 is obtained, which contains the relative probabilities of \u03bd\u03b5Gand \u03bd\u03b5Gmatching for each possible pair. For each vertex in v, the vertex in vwhose pair has the maximum value in \u03c0 is considered the match. Thus, the most likely pairing is determined based on the similarity measure. For example, even where data types may not match exactly, the most likely match is determined from among the possible modules.","Whereas the query interface allows users to identify workflows (and sub-workflows) that are relevant for a particular task, a result determination by analogy mechanism provides for the reuse of the identified workflows in constructing new results in a semi-automated manner and without requiring users to directly manipulate or edit the workflow specifications. For example, a user may wish to improve a given result by modifying parameters in a similar fashion to a previously determined result. Alternatively, the user may want to modify an existing workflow to use a new technique that generates higher quality visualizations. The difference between a pair of workflows is determined, and the difference is applied to a third workflow to define a fourth workflow. The user need not have a priori knowledge of the exact details of the three workflows to perform the operation. To apply an analogy to a workflow, the user defines an analogy template by selecting two workflows whose difference is to be applied to a third workflow selected by the user. The analogy is applied to the third workflow to create a new fourth workflow. In an exemplary embodiment, the user can cause execution of these operations using either workflow creator application  or result presentation application .","Using workflow creator application , an analogy may be defined by dragging a first workflow representing an initial workflow to a second workflow representing the desired result. As discussed previously with reference to , this operation displays the difference between the selected workflows. As shown with reference to , a workflow difference  indicates module additions\/deletions, connection additions\/deletions\/modifications, and parameter modifications. To create an analogy based on the difference between the workflows, the user may select a create analogy button . With reference to , an analogy naming window  is presented to the user. Analogy naming window  includes an analogy name text box . The user defines a name for the analogy using analogy name text box . The user selects an \u201cOK\u201d button  to create the analogy with the defined name or a \u201cCancel\u201d button  to cancel the analogy creation.","With reference to , the user applies an analogy by selecting a third workflow  presented in a version tree  of workflow area  of version tree tab  and selecting the analogy for application to the third workflow . For example, the user may right-click after selection of third workflow , causing presentation of a process selection window . Process selection window  may include a \u201cPerform analogy . . . \u201d item . Scrolling down to \u201cPerform analogy . . . \u201d item  causes presentation of an analogy list  from which the user may select. For example, with reference to , analogy list  includes a single created analogy named \u201csphere to silicium\u201d. A fourth workflow is created in version tree  which may be executed and a result presented in a cell of result presentation application  as discussed previously relative to .","Using result presentation application , an analogy may be defined and applied without interacting with the version tree of workflow creator application . Result presentation application  supports an interaction mode and an edit mode. In the edit mode, a user can create an analogy by dragging one cell into another cell thereby creating an analogy based on a comparison between the workflows used to create the results presented in the respective cells. To apply the analogy, the user drags the workflow to be modified to a new cell, the analogy is applied, and the result of the new workflow is presented to the user in the cell to which the workflow to be modified is dragged. For example, with reference to , a plurality of data products are shown in result presentation window  of result presentation application  in accordance with a third exemplary embodiment. Result presentation window  of  includes a first cell , which includes a first result , a second cell , which includes a second result , a third cell , which includes a third result , and a fourth cell  which is empty. Thus, three workflows have been executed to generate results presented in three cells of result presentation application .","The user switches from an interaction mode of result presentation application  to an edit mode of result presentation application , for example, using a menu item selector or a button. The edit mode allows, among other things, the creation and execution of one or more analogy. With reference to , a first control set  is presented in first cell , a second control set  is presented in second cell , and a third control set  is presented in third cell  in response to switching to the edit mode. First control set  may include a copy control , a move control , a \u201ccreate analogy\u201d control , and an \u201capply analogy\u201d control . Second control set  may include a copy control , a move control , a \u201ccreate analogy\u201d control , and an \u201capply analogy\u201d control . Third control set  may include a copy control , a move control , a \u201ccreate analogy\u201d control , and an \u201capply analogy\u201d control . To create an analogy, the user drags one of the \u201ccreate analogy\u201d controls , ,  from the cell corresponding to the source to the cell corresponding to the target. For example, to create an analogy between first cell  and second cell , the user drags \u201ccreate analogy\u201d control  from first control set  to second cell  and releases \u201ccreate analogy\u201d control . The workflow associated with creation of first result  is the first workflow, and the workflow associated with creation of second result  is the second workflow, and an analogy is defined based on a difference between the first workflow and the second workflow.","To apply the defined analogy, the user drags an \u201capply analogy\u201d control , ,  from the cell that corresponds to the result on which the analogy is applied, and drops it into an empty cell which is used to display the results of the analogy. For example, to apply the analogy created between the first workflow and the second workflow, the user drags \u201capply analogy\u201d control  from third control set  to fourth cell , and releases \u201capply analogy\u201d control . The result of the analogy is automatically inserted in the version tree, as discussed with reference to . With reference to , fourth cell  includes a fourth result  determined based on application of the created analogy to third result .","Two ordered pairs are analogous if the relationship between the first pair mirrors the relationship between the second pair. Therefore, if the relationship between a first workflow pand a second workflow pis known and a third workflow pis identified, a fourth workflow ppair can be determined. To implement such an operation automatically, a workflow difference is determined between p, pand applied to p. However, updating pwith an arbitrary \u03b4 may fail if pdoes not contain the domain context of \u03b4. As a result, the difference is mapped so that it can be applied to p. Thus, in a first operation the difference \u03b4=\u0394(p, p) is determined. In a second operation, matching is performed between Gand Gto obtain the map map=map(p, p). In a third operation the mapped difference \u03b4*=map(p, p) is determined. In a fourth operation, pis determined as \u03b4*(p). The fourth workflow pcan be executed to present a result in a cell of result presentation application .","For example, to update inputs in multiple workflows, a user may perform a query to identify matching workflows. A desired update to a matching workflow can be performed and an analogy created between the desired update pand the matching workflow p. The analogy can be applied to all of the identified matching workflows creating child workflows for each of the identified matching workflows based on the created analogy. The child workflows can be executed and the corresponding results presented in cells of result presentation application  automatically.","As another example, analogies can be used to quickly combine three different techniques to transform a simple workflow into a visualization that is more complicated and more useful. In many areas, the amount of data and the need for interaction between users across the world has led to the creation of online databases that store much of the domain information required. Analogies can be used to modify a simple workflow that visualizes protein data stored in a local file to obtain data from an online database, to create an enhanced visualization for that protein, and to publish the results as an HTML report. A version tree that includes workflows that accomplish each of the individual goals is opened in workflow creator application . A first workflow preads a file with protein data and generates a first result of that data. The difference between a second workflow pand a third workflow p\u2032 is that preads a local file and p\u2032 reads data from an online database. The difference between a fourth workflow pand a fifth workflow p\u2032 is that puses a simple line-based rendering  and p\u2032 improves the rendering to use a ball-and-stick model  as shown with reference to . The difference between a sixth workflow pand a seventh workflow p\u2032 is that pdisplays a visualization  while p\u2032 generates an HTML report  that contains a visualized image  and a protein summary . To create a new workflow using all three differences, a first analogy between pand p\u2032 is determined and applied to pto create a first new workflow. A second analogy between pand p\u2032 is determined and applied to the first new workflow to create a second new workflow. A third analogy between pand p\u2032 is determined and applied to the second new workflow to create a third new workflow p*. Third new workflow p* prompts the user for a protein name, uses that information to download data for that protein, creates a ball-and-stick visualization of the data, and embeds that image in an HTML report. A new result is determined quickly and with a reduced understanding of the steps required to form the new result.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration.
