{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DEFINITIONS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","TABLE OF REFERENCE CHARACTERS"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/418,070, filed Nov. 30, 2010, entitled, \u201cSystem and Method for Implementing Dynamic Access Control Rules to Personal Cloud Information\u201d, herein incorporated by reference.","A system and method are provided that allow access control rules relating to personal cloud information to be determined dynamically, resulting in group memberships that change over time based on criteria that incorporates communications between the user and his or her contacts.","Social networks, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and others, have become popular in the past several years. In these networks, users are permitted to store and share information in a controlled manner, so that only those individuals with whom the user wishes to share certain information can actually access it.","In these networks, a user may designate different groups, or classes, of individuals, and then may define access permissions based on these defined groups. Therefore, only members of a particular group may be authorized to access a particular piece of information. By way of example, a user may designate a group called \u201creal friends\u201d, then assign Bob to the group of good friends. The user can then designate his cell phone number as only viewable by good friends, and Bob (but not others who are not members of the \u201creal friends\u201d group) will subsequently have access to the user's cell phone number.","In addition to having a user manually define such groups and then subsequently define group membership, it is also possible to have group membership in predefined groups allocated based on some criteria that can be determined automatically.","For example, it is known to utilize social network thresholds that can be determined automatically with regard to access control decisions. If a second user does not have an appropriate privilege level to access a particular piece of information, then a statistical threshold for access can be determined based on social networking statistics, such as a number or percentage of users listed as friends by a content owner.","A method is herein provided for sharing data of a user with contacts, the method comprising collecting the contacts from the user, collecting data related to the communications between the user and his contacts, automatically grouping the contacts into different groups based on a level of communications between the user and the user's contacts, defining an access level for each group, with each access level granting access to some part of the user's data based on the access level, and notifying each member of each group of contacts having been granted access to that part of the user's data based on the access level when that data has become accessible or has changed. Advantageously, this permits a dynamic assignment of authority to access content that does not have to be actively managed by the user.","A non-transitory computer program product is also provided, comprising a computer usable medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein, said computer readable program code adapted to be executed to implement the method.","A server device is also provided for sharing data of a user with contacts, the server device comprising: a storage element configured to store contacts collected from said user; a storage element configured to store data related to communications between the user and his contacts; and a processor configured to run: an algorithm that automatically groups the contacts into different groups based on a level of communications between the user and the user's contacts; and an algorithm that defines an access level for each group, with each access level granting access to some part of the user's data based on the access level.","A system is also provided comprising the server device, a client device comprising a reader configured to read the part of the user's data; and a network that connects the client device to the server device.","Various embodiments of the invention involve automatically generating access control rules (ACL rules) based on a user's true connection to his friends. The contacts are collected over the different sources provided by the user, such as emails, phone contacts, and SN friends. Based on the number of emails, phone calls, interactions over the SN, contacts are divided into a number of groups, e.g., from real friend, to occasional friend, and temporary friend. Different access rights are defined for each of these groups. The user simply has to drag his content to folders associated with each of the generated access rights. The corresponding users are notified and they can access to these folders by virtue of the access rights (using, e.g., a universal ID, or OpenID).","The following definitions are used for the discussion below:\n\n","The system described below, herein referred to as \u201cPersonal Cloud\u201d, is a trusted and secure user-centric platform providing a trusted environment for users to consolidate and manage their personal data. Personal Cloud allows users to regain access and control over their personal user generated content, including their personal preferences, internet click-streams, as well as digital artifacts like photos, videos and music. Further, users are able to apply only the relevant aspects of their personal profile data towards personalized services, ensuring the ownership of the data is maintained and services are only being provided this data in exchange for highly personalized experiences they provide.","By way of example only, the system is described in an architecture that is based on the Tonido (CodeLathe) platform, however the scope of the invention extends beyond this embodiment, and can extend across the web, including social networks, e-commerce sites and any other online services available today. The system provided, as described below, enables users to greatly simplify their online experience. The system may utilize OpenID, which is a significant factor in enabling Personal Clouds for users.","The Personal Cloud (P.C) architecture is illustrated at a high level in . The P.C  is a service running at user premises that provides a secure and trusted environment for user generated content. It manages user content generated, identities and personalized services. The P.C  is thus becomes a user content broker between user and content associated with the user , , , and third party online services .","At a high level the P.C  provides a user experience to sharing online data by implementing a Distributed Social Network (DiSo) function , a Distributed Search (DiSe) function , and other user services  through an application program interface (API) . A media delivery optimization module  may be provided to optimize transcoding and improve the quality of service of streaming media. Security  may be provided by way of OpenID and OAuth. The sharing function may be implemented via Data Management (D.M)  and utilize DyACL. A search function  to search for content in the cloud may be provided. An Identity Management (I.M)  may also be provided. The P.C  may also include a mechanism for device discovery and may provide for some form of rule-based content notification. Storage consolidation  is also provided to aggregate user information.","Communication access is provided to specific cloud service providers , to other personal cloud members , and a simple integration is provided to on-line third party service providers , such as Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.","The P.C  provides access to user content , which can include any content generated by users that can be stored in any device compatible with the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) (www.dlna.org) or that may plug to the network. It may also provide access to imported online content , which can include any content that has been uploaded to third party on-line services. The user can import this content from the third party and either move it back to the personal cloud or provide only indexed access. Finally, the P.C  can provide access to a local Index  comprising metadata related to all the information, location, and access control lists (ACL) of content.","Tonido\u2122 System","The present system can be based on a platform provided by CodeLathe called Tonido\u2122 of which the basic components are illustrated in . The Tonido system  is a person-to-person (P2P) personal web application platform that allows a user to access and share all of the user's desktop files, documents, photos, music and videos from anywhere.","Tonido offers the following features: P2P support for communication between Tonido instances, access to content from anywhere, available anytime access to the Tonido application online or offline, secure communication-encrypted data transfer, support to multiple operative systems, and an API and software development kit (SDK) to build applications on top of the platform.","There are two main software components in Tonido: the first is the Tonido Runtime platform, which is installed on the end user device destination; and the second is the Tonido Domain Server (TDS), which is responsible for managing authentication, custom URL to IP address mapping and connection brokering.","The Tonido runtime platform is installed on the end user machine. It consist of two components: the first is the Tonido Core, which is the primary software component that provides programmable APIs and manages and provides HTTP and P2P connectivity. The second is Tonido applications\u2014these are shared libraries\/dlls that are loaded\/unloaded dynamically.","Tonido has two primary interfaces to the outside world: the first is the HTTP interface (which is the user interface), and the second is the Tonido network interface, which is used to connect to other Tonido instances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1010","1010","1060","1050","1010"]},"TDS operates on well-known Internet Engineering Task Force\u2014(IETF) approved ports 24465 for user datagram protocol (UDP) (which may be used as the control link  and data link ) and 24465 for transmission control protocol (TCP) (HTTPS).","The TDS  has the following functions. First it performs authentication, which includes: 1) Identifying a Tonido instance (or a device or user) uniquely; 2) creating a Tonido ID (this is done via an HTTPS connection to the TDS; and 3) assigning a unique secret key to the Tonido Runtime. Second, it performs URL to IP address mapping, with a custom URL being based on the domain the TDS  is running on (dynamic DNS). Third, it performs connection brokering. The TDS  serves as an intermediary to broker P2P connection setup between two Tonido instances. The TDS allows two instance to establishes a direct P2P connection (network address translator (NAT) punching).","Personal Cloud","One aspect of the Personal Cloud is the User Experience. The Distributed Social Networks element DiSo  is decentralized and distributed across different providers, that emphasizes portability and interoperability. Currently there are multiples open standards associated with the distributed social networks. In a preferred embodiment, OpenID and OAuth are the standards utilized, although other open standards may be utilized as well.","With this element, personal cloud members  are able to share and access content from other members without downloading the content based on some kind of ACL. Although the Personal Cloud could search content from the user's friends and itself, there is no anonymous search\u2014thus, the content is always attached to some personal cloud members .","It is possible for the P.C member to set up notification rules for sending automatic notifications to other members of the P.C regarding any new content associated with the member. Also, the P.C member can publish to his\/her favorite social network an indication of the existence of new media content. When a member of the social network (SN) tries to access the P.C content, the member will be redirected to the user's Personal Cloud where the new media content is hosted. Also, P.C members can subscribe to have a feed of their friends activities.","The storage consolidation  has two parts to it. First, there are physical storage devices that include all content stores in any device with local storage. Using P2P technology a user could map the personal cloud identity with multiple devices. Such devices send a representation of their file system. This permits the user to be able to navigate all the content store in the different file system with one unified view. Second, there are online data stores, which include all of the different online data stores (social network, photo sharing, video sharing, etc.) that the users upload content to.  illustrates the use of the Tonido system  with the present storage consolidation  to which clients can push content.","As to physical storage devices, for DLNA universal plug and play (UPnP) devices, personal cloud members can have an aggregated view of the content stored in any device compatible with DLNA\/UPnP. For a non-DLNA device, personal cloud members can have an aggregate view of all the content stored in devices that are running a Tonido instance.","With regard to online data stores, personal cloud members can aggregate different online data stores (social networks, photo sharing, video sharing, etc.). A personal cloud member can import and log their content generated from different online data stores (e.g., twitter, posts, comments, photos, videos, etc.) to their personal cloud.","This system thus provides the following beneficial functionality: access from\/to any file located in the personal cloud; storage of any file from any device to the personal cloud; deletion of any file stored at the personal cloud; moving content between devices; adding or removing a device from the storage consolidation; and some form of authentication between the device and the personal cloud.","User Experience\/User Interface","An important part of the user experience involves the user interface. The service that manages and orchestrates private user content is referred to herein as the Personal Assistant. Preferably, the Personal Assistant provides access, preferably via a web browser interface, to the exemplary user experiences\/functionalities illustrated in the table below.","The user interface may be implemented as a series of folders that are shown to the user, each of which is associated to a group of contacts. By way of example for associating contacts with folders, in an associating function, a list of folders can be shown in one windows and a list of contacts can be provided to the user in another window. The user can then select one or more contacts and simply drag them to a particular folder, thereby associating that folder with the selected users. Similarly, the user can select one or more folders and drag them to a particular user, thereby associating that user with the selected folder. Any mechanism can be used to associate the users with the folders.","Advantageously, in a content updating process, when the user updates content in a folder (e.g., by dragging and dropping content into the folder), the users associated with the folder are notified of the content update in a manner described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0068"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"User Experiences\/Functions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["User Experience","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Home","Helps users to select any of the different options"]},{"entry":[{},"from the personal cloud:"]},{"entry":[{},"Me (Identity Manager)"]},{"entry":[{},"Files (Storage consolidation)"]},{"entry":[{},"Media (All the media content from the"]},{"entry":[{},"storage consolidation)"]},{"entry":[{},"MyPeople (Dynamic ACL)"]},{"entry":[{},"MyApps (a feature for personalized"]},{"entry":[{},"services)"]},{"entry":[{},"Search (local search)"]},{"entry":["Identity Manager","Manages user online identity:"]},{"entry":[{},"Email accounts"]},{"entry":[{},"Social network"]},{"entry":[{},"Personal cloud ID (openID)"]},{"entry":[{},"Mobile"]},{"entry":[{},"Cloud devices"]},{"entry":["Dynamic ACL","Provides a map between users and folders.

The words \u201cmechanism\u201d and \u201celement\u201d are used broadly and are not limited to mechanical or physical embodiments, but can include software routines in conjunction with processors, etc.","The particular implementations shown and described herein are illustrative examples of the invention and are not intended to otherwise limit the scope of the invention in any way. For the sake of brevity, conventional electronics, control systems, software development and other functional aspects of the systems (and components of the individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in detail. Furthermore, the connecting lines, or connectors shown in the various figures presented are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships and\/or physical or logical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional relationships, physical connections or logical connections may be present in a practical device. Moreover, no item or component is essential to the practice of the invention unless the element is specifically described as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d.","The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. Unless specified or limited otherwise, the terms \u201cmounted,\u201d \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201csupported,\u201d and \u201ccoupled\u201d and variations thereof are used broadly and encompass both direct and indirect mountings, connections, supports, and couplings. Further, \u201cconnected\u201d and \u201ccoupled\u201d are not restricted to physical or mechanical connections or couplings.","The use of the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) should be construed to cover both the singular and the plural. Furthermore, recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. Finally, the steps of all methods described herein are performable in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., \u201csuch as\u201d) provided herein, is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed. Numerous modifications and adaptations will be readily apparent to those skilled in this art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0001","num":"0172"},"b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0002","num":"0173"},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0003","num":"0174"},"b":"115"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0004","num":"0175"},"b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0005","num":"0176"},"b":"122"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0006","num":"0177"},"b":"124"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0007","num":"0178"},"b":"140"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0008","num":"0179"},"b":"146"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0009","num":"0180"},"b":"148"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0010","num":"0181"},"b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0011","num":"0182"},"b":"170"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0012","num":"0183"},"b":"175"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0013","num":"0184"},"b":"180"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0014","num":"0185"},"b":"185"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0015","num":"0186"},"b":"186"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0016","num":"0187"},"b":"187"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0017","num":"0188"},"b":"188"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0018","num":"0189"},"b":"189"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0019","num":"0190"},"b":"190"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0020","num":"0191"},"b":"195"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0021","num":"0192"},"b":"196"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0022","num":"0193"},"b":"197"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0023","num":"0194"},"b":"198"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0024","num":"0195"},"b":"199"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0025","num":"0196"},"b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0026","num":"0197"},"b":"210"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0027","num":"0198"},"b":"212"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0028","num":"0199"},"b":"214"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0029","num":"0200"},"b":"220"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0030","num":"0201"},"b":"230"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0031","num":"0202"},"b":"250"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0032","num":"0203"},"b":"260"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0033","num":"0204"},"b":"290"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0034","num":"0205"},"b":"295"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0035","num":"0206"},"b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0036","num":"0207"},"b":"350"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0037","num":"0208"},"b":"400"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0038","num":"0209"},"b":"1000"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0039","num":"0210"},"b":"1010"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0040","num":"0211"},"b":"1040"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0041","num":"0212"},"b":"1045"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0042","num":"0213"},"b":"1050"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0043","num":"0214"},"b":"1050"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0044","num":"0215"},"b":"1060"}]}}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is illustrated by reference to various embodiments illustrated in the drawings and described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
