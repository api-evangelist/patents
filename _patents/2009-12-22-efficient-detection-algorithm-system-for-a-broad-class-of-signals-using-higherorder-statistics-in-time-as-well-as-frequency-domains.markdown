title: Efficient detection algorithm system for a broad class of signals using higher-order statistics in time as well as frequency domains
abstract: An algorithm system to detect a broad class of signals in Gaussian noise using higher-order statistics. The algorithm system detects a number of different signal types. The signals may be in the base-band or the pass-band, single-carrier or multi-carrier, frequency hopping or non-hopping, broad-pulse or narrow-pulse etc. In a typical setting this algorithm system provides an error rate of 3/100 at a signal to noise ratio of 0 dB. This algorithm system gives the time frequency detection ratio that may be used to determine if the detected signal falls in Class Single-Carrier of Class Multi-Carrier. Additionally this algorithm system may be used for a number of different applications such as multiple signal identification, finding the basis functions of the received signal and the like.

Cognitive radios will help not just the commercial systems but the military communication systems as well, by doing away with the need for comprehensive frequency planning. In fact, a cognitive radio would be capable of sensing its environment, making decisions on the types of signals present, learning the patterns and choosing the best possible method of transmitting the information. They would be situation aware, and capable of making decisions to ensure error-free and smooth transfer of bits between the users. Cognitive radios will be based on software defined radio (SDR) platforms and will try to understand not only what the users want but also what the surrounding environment can provide. The first step for any cognitive radio will be to understand the surrounding environment and to detect the ambient signals that are present.","The prior art discusses work on signal detection in AWGN using HOS as qualifiers, as is disclosed in B.

Detection of a Broad Class of Signals","Many types of information bearing signals show a Gaussian distribution in the time domain whereas in the frequency domain they are non-Gaussian. For example, the amplitude distribution of a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signal in the time-domain is non-Gaussian. On the other hand, the amplitude distribution of the multi-carrier signal samples, formed as a result of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in the time-domain is Gaussian, but the distribution of its complex samples in the frequency domain is not. Hence in order to be able to detect all these signal types, we apply the algorithm in time as well as in the frequency domains as shown in .

M. C. Dogan and J. M. Mendel, \u201cSingle Sensor Detection and Classification of Multiple Sources by Higher Order Spectra,\u201d IEE Proceedings-F, vol. 140, no. 6, pp. 1451-1458, December 1993, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses the use of the tri-spectrum of the received waveform. The tri-spectrum is projected onto 2-Dimensions and sampled to form a matrix. The singular value decomposition (SVD) is then applied to find out the dominant components. The number of significant singular values determines the number of signal types present in the received waveform. We apply a similar method for our case. However, instead of tri-spectrum we obtain a compressed spectrogram of the signal only segments. If higher computation power is available, then one may use the tri-spectrum instead. The compressed spectrogram of the signal only segments forms a matrix X. We then take the SVD of this compressed spectrogram, and find out the number of dominant singular values in it which gives us the number of different signal types that are present in the signal.","C. Finding the Basis Functions for the Received Signal","Basis functions of the received signals could provide us with important information about the signal itself and what constitutes it. For example, it would be important to know the spreading sequence, given that the received signal is formed using code division multiplexing (CDMA). In order to find the basis functions of the received signal, the SVD of the signal only matrix is obtained. However, rather than choosing the length of the columns of the matrix arbitrarily, some prior synchronization is done on the received waveform to find the underlying periodicity. This estimate of the periodicity in the waveform is used to determine the number of samples in each column of a synchronized signal only matrix X as shown in . Then the SVD of this synchronized signal only matrix is obtained and the vector corresponding to various principal singular values determine the basis functions of the received signal.","IV. Simulation and Experimental Results","This section explains the simulation and experimental results for the signal detection algorithm system and its applications.  shows the probability of error in correct classification of a segment of the received waveform versus the average SNR. The direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) waveforms confirming to the IEEE 802.11b Standard, as is disclosed in IEEE Standard 802.11g-2003, Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications: Higher-speed Physical Layer Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band., IEEE Std. 802.11, 2003, were generated and transmitted over an AWGN channel. The chips at the receiver were over-sampled by a factor of eight, and an average energy in the received samples for the entire data record was used to compute the signal energy. An appropriate noise was added to the received samples. The figure shows the effect of choosing different segment-lengths (N) and different values of the threshold coefficient \u03b3 on the probability of error. We calculated the cumulants till the 6th order and hence R for our case was 4. The segment length N was chosen to be of a power of 2 in order to efficiently compute its fast Fourier transform (FFT). Larger the value of N, more accurate are the estimates of the cumulants and lower are the error floors in the probability curves. On the other hand the value of \u03b3 may be used to move the curves sideways. Lower value of \u03b3 results in a lower threshold and hence lower P. Higher values of \u03b3 results in higher Pand lower P. Based on the curves obtained, we choose \u03b3=2 for all our experiments for over-the-air-collected test data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["13","25"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 8 and 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"D. Jammer Classification\u2014Denial of Service (DoS) detection","Finally,  depicts a simplified flow chart  of a method for classifying jammer signals. In cases where performance metrics such as the Bit Error Rate (BER) at the receiver show drastic degradation, or the Carrier to Interference plus Noise Ratio (CINR) shows drastic reduction, however, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) shows that the received signal energy is quite high, it is possible that the received signal is being jammed\u2014which means that the system is experiencing Denial of Service (DoS) attack . Perform signal or noise detection on the received signal  to separate signal from noise using higher order statistical method previously described (Blind Source Separation). If the signal is detected in the time or the frequency domains , then the jammer waveform is non-Gaussian in time and\/or frequency domains . If the signal is not detected , then the jammer waveform is Gaussian in the time and frequency domains .","V. Conclusions","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that an algorithm system has been disclosed that detects a broad class of signals in Gaussian noise using higher-order statistics. The algorithm system was able to detect a number of different signal types. In a typical setting this algorithm system provided an error rate of 3\/100 at a signal to noise ratio of 0 dB. This algorithm system gave the time frequency detection ratio which was used to determine if the detected signal fell in Class Single-Carrier of Class Multi-Carrier. Additionally we showed how this algorithm system may be used in applications such as signal identification and finding the basis functions of the received signals.","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description.
