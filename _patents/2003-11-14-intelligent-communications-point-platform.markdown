To start with, the ICP Platform is not an end point in the network, but rather an invisible node that sits in front of a Signaling End Point (SEP), which may be, for example, a Signaling Transfer Point (STP), Service Switching Point (SSP), or Service Control Point (SCP). All SS7 links are routed into the ICP and are then routed out to the SS7 network. In addition, the ICP Platform design can be broken down into five parts; SS7 links cards and SS7 stack, interface to the ICM, platform core services, software and hardware control\/status, and the application region.","SS7 Link Cards and SS7 Stack","The ICP Platform contains multiple T1\/E1 link cards. All SS7 links from an SSP are routed into the ICP and then out to the SS7 network. Each link card supports multiple links and processes Message Transfer Part (MTP) layers  and , while the CPU host card supports the ICP core services, applications, and MTP layer . MTP defines the physical, electrical, and functional characteristics for the digital signaling link. MTP ensures accurate end-to-end transmission of a message across a signaling link. In addition, MTP implements flow control, message sequence validation, and error checking. When an error occurs on a signaling link, the message (or set of messages) is retransmitted. Moreover, MTP, which resides on the link cards, has a failsafe mode. When MTP fails, MTP will automatically route traffic between the SEP and the SS7 network.","MTP provides message routing between signaling points in the SS7 Network and routes traffic away from failed links and signaling points. In addition, MTP controls traffic when congestion occurs. In the ICP Platform, two links are used to achieve the usage of one normal link. The ICP sits between an SSP and SS7 network and literally breaks the link into two links. These two links are considered to be one link pair. All SS7 traffic coming in one link will be routed out of the ICP through the other link of the link pair (FIG. ). If the ICP fails due to hardware or software failures, these link pairs close allowing the SS7 traffic to pass through the ICP as if the ICP was not in the network. The link pairs can also be manually closed while still allowing the ICP to have visibility to the SS7 traffic flowing through the link pairs. In addition, link cards route non-SS7 traffic on open DS-0 data lines directly to the other port without going through the ICP.","Interface to the Intelligent Communication Manager (ICM)","The ICP Platform is managed by the ICM. The ICP interface is the bridge for communications between the ICP and the ICM. Through this interface software, the ICM user can gain access to the ICP core services and application software. The interface allows the user to bring the ICP into service, bring up and down application software, retrieve ICP core service data such as logs and events, retrieve application specific data, and configure\/status the ICP hardware\/software.","Platform Core Services","The ICP Platform provides a set of core services for the developers of the applications to use when designing the application, including Logging Data, Process Events, Peg Counting, and the SS7 message interface (FIG. ). Logging Data services allow the applications to collect data which can be passed to the ICM for display to the customer. Process Event service is a method in which alarms can be raised to inform customers of an event that may or may not be critical. Each event is marked with a severity level which indicates to the user whether the event needs attention or not. Peg Counting services are tied in with the traffic metering and measurement (TMM) and bookkeeping processes. Along with the core set of peg counts, applications will also have their own sets of peg counts that can be collected and displayed on the ICM through the TMM graphical user interface (GUI). The SS7 message interface service allows applications to have access to SS7 traffic flowing through the ICP. The ICP processes all SS7 traffic according to rules. These rules define the actions as to how the SS7 message is going to be processed. Customers can implement rules that will act as a SS7 Firewall to protect the SEP (refer to the pending SS7 Firewall System patent, dated Sep. 7, 1999). Applications can receive SS7 traffic by implementing application rules that pass the message from the stack up through to the application, or can send out SS7 messages through an ICP SS7 API (Application Programming Interface).","Software and Hardware Control\/Status","Software on the ICP is managed by the platform manager (FIG. ). The platform manager is responsible for starting core services and applications. In the event of a software failure, the platform manager will attempt to restart the failed software along with raising events to the ICM and closing the link pairs so that SS7 traffic is not disrupted. The manager software will send status of the software and overall ICP health to the ICM through the ICP interface software. The hardware and the SS7 stack configuration are handled by System Management Software. Through the use of a configuration file stored on the ICM, the System Management Software programs the hardware interfaces such as the SS7 link cards and configures the SS7 stack software. Status of the hardware and state of the paired links (open or closed) are sent to the ICM through the ICP interface software.","Application Region","The heart of the ICP Platform is its ability to host any number of different SS7 applications (FIG. ). Local Number Portability Cache (LNPC) is just one example of an application that could be developed for the ICP Platform. Through the use of the ICP core services, developers can design applications that can interact with the SS7 network. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are available to the application designers. These APIs allow the designers access to the core services and aid in the development process.","Now referring to the figures,  represents the end point connections in a SS7 network. Reference numeral  designates a signaling end point (SEP) which may be, for example, a Signaling Transfer Point (STP), Service Switching Point (SSP) or Service Control Point (SCP) and reference numeral  designates signaling transfer points (STPs). In a typical SS7 network, traffic flows on data links  between STPs and SEPs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","220","14","200","14"]},"ICP Platform  processing distribution is driven by the signaling protocol stack as shown in FIG. . The MTP\/MPT\/ layer has a number of link cards (E\/T). The MTP\/MTP\/ layer is loosely coupled with the MTP layer allowing MTP\/MPT\/ to reside on the link cards and MTP to reside on the single board computer. MTP defines the physical, electrical, and functional characteristics for the digital signaling link. MTP, which resides on the link cards, has a failsafe mode. When MTP fails, MTP will automatically route traffic back down and out to the SEP. MTP ensures accurate end-to-end transmission of a message across a signaling link . In addition, MTP implements flow control, message sequence validation, and error checking.","The MTP layer can interface with multiple MTP processors on the link cards through a compact Peripheral Component Interconnect (cPCI) bus. By modifying the MTP layer to disable message discrimination, all messages are allowed to be passed up to the ICP Platform  for processing. The MTP layer can be easily modified by making appropriate changes in the SS7 protocol stack being used.","In addition, MTP manages the Message Signaling Unit (MSU)\/Link association and has end to end management message coordination. MTP also provides message routing between signaling points \/ in the SS7 Network, and can route traffic away from failed links and signaling points. Moreover, MTP controls traffic when congestion occurs.","The Core Services  layer supports various support services and signaling processes to distribute traffic upwards to the Applications  layer and accept downward message routing requests. The Core Services  layer contains various subsystems and processes within these subsystems that developers of applications can use when designing applications.","The Applications  layer contains all the applications that are implemented above the Core Services  layer. The Applications  layer supports various applications that can monitor, modify, or create messages. Each application can process its own set of messages, use its own rules and can be independent of other applications in general. In addition, one or more of the application processes may be running at a given time to load-share the work.","As shown in , a SS7 MTP MSU  addressed for a signaling point, e.g., , travels from a signaling point, e.g., , through the ICP Platform . The MSU  goes through a MTP port  and then travels up the SS7 protocol stack through the MTP I\/O card and MTP stack. The MTP stack may reside on the CPU card, or on the I\/O card. A heartbeat signal  is maintained between MTP and MTP. Loss of the heartbeat , indicating a failure of the CPU cards in the MTP layer, results in a failsafe mode (closed mode). During a failsafe mode, message traffic is passed up only to MTP and is then routed back down and out. If the CPU is available, a copy of the MSU  is passed to MTP for non-intrusive processing. During normal operation (open mode), data is transmitted between MTP\/MTP\/ and MTP. The MSU  is then delivered to Core Services  which contains various subsystems and processes within these subsystems. Some of those subsystems and processes will described in detail below.","The Platform Control Subsystem (PCSS)  has data provisioning capability and is also responsible for the management of all the other subsystems. In particular it starts and stops all the other processes in a controlled manner. The Signaling Subsystem (SGSS)  routes and distributes SS7 messages. This subsystem processes every message that passes through the ICP Platform . However, since Fill-in Signal Unit (FISU) messages do not pass up to the ICP platform , they are not processed by the SGSS . The Interface Subsystem (IFSS)  is responsible for the external system interface. In addition, the ICP System has the capability to interface with multiple Intelligent Communications Managers (ICMs) , and with other ICP Platforms . Moreover, a single ICP Platform  may be distributed in multiple processors. The IFSS  provides the network interface commonly used for all these conditions.","The Accounting Subsystem (ACSS)  is responsible for collecting the Traffic Metering and Measurement (TMM) data and statistic messages from subsystems that generate these messages. The Recording Subsystem (RCSS)  is responsible for collecting event and log messages for all other subsystems. Event messages are accumulated over a short period of time while the events are buffered and duplicates are filtered out. The various processes in the Data Management Subsystem (DMSS)  provide functions for data storage and retrieval, data synchronization, data distribution, data partition management, etc. Furthermore, the Utility Subsystem (UTSS)  contains library routines that are developed for re-use. by all subsystem processes.","The Intelligent Communication Manager (ICM) , a control and management device, is connected via the TCP\/IP link  to the ICP Platform  for storage and display of logs, alerting, programming control policy rules, providing simple visibility, configuration, and other operational features of the ICP Platform . Multiple ICP Platforms  can be managed by one ICM . Logs are routed via the TCP\/IP link  from the ICP  to the ICM  and may range from simple events to full SS7 call or transaction messages. The TCP\/IP link  provides communication including, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Services and Internet Services between the ICP  and the ICM .","The ICP Platform  has the capability to view data traversed on MTP data links  and signaling units, except the Fill-in Signal Unit (FISU). In addition, the ICP Platform  can view all MSUs , i.e., network management, traffic routing, test and upper layer protocols on MTP and can decode all Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) User Part (ISUP) messages and view all ISUP parameters and sub-fields. While not shown, it is understood that the ICP Platform  is can also communicate within an enterprise network with various hosts for providing management, configuration, and reporting functions.","The ICP Platform  is a fully active datalink layer (layer  of the seven layer Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) network model) device while providing layer three and above visibility and control. Network layer control messages, such as re-alignment messages, are transferred autonomously from node to node, e.g., from the SEP  to the SEP , within the SS7 network. The ICP Platform  manages these messages and coordinates control between the end nodes \/. This allows end nodes to operate as masters of MTP, while communicating directly to the ICP Platform . MTP MSUs  are transferred end-to-end making the ICP Platform  appear invisible to each SEP \/, at the network layer and above.","The ICP Platform  is a full MTP signaling link terminal. It also manages MTP management messages between nodes  and . Additionally, it manages coordination of MTP traffic management, link management, and route management messages to synchronize MTP events between the two links. Functionally, the ICP Platform  consists of SS7 I\/O logic, which contains MTP\/MTP\/, and MTP SS7 stacks, located on the I\/O card. The function of the stacks process MSUs  for MTP. Moreover, the ICP Platform  contains MTP control logic located on the CPU card. These functions work independently of each other and provide a higher level visibility by processing signaling units into MSUs  and MSUs into protocol data units (PDUs) (layer  and above of the seven layer OSI network model).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["200","400","312","1","2","230","240","3","250","270","270","312","312","300","200"]},"The ICP Platform  may be implemented with commercially available components as will be understood by those skilled in the art. While not shown, it is understood that the ICP Platform  is controlled by computer programming instructions stored in memory within the ICP Platform  and potentially other components of the system connected to the ICP Platform .","The Platform Control Subsystem (PCSS)  is responsible for the management of all other subsystems. PCSS  processes, which include the Platform Control Process, the Rule Provisioning Process and the SS7 Provisioning Process, have various responsibilities within the ICP Platform . The Platform Control Process is ordinarily the first process to start on the ICP Platform  and manages all other processes running on the ICP Platform . The Rule Provisioning Process manages the process configuration profile and the application rule repository. This process receives updates from the IFSS  and makes updates to the DMSS . The SS7 Provisioning Process is responsible for SS7 Node provisioning. This process will receive updates from the IFSS  and will make updates to the SS7 stack, using vendor provided programming interfaces.","The Signaling Subsystem (SGSS) , which is part of the core services layer , contains the ISDN User Part (ISUP) process , the Signaling Connection Control Point (SCCP) process , the Signaling Network Management  (SNM) and the Signaling Network Testing  (SNT). All ISUP process  and SCCP process  traffic can be processed through a SS7 firewall to enforce control policy rules. Management messages such as re-alignment messages are controlled by the ICP Platform's  control message manager application. Some of the common functions provided by the ISUP process , SCCP process  and SNM\/SNT  are to generate events to report process start and stop and to report abnormalities. In addition, they inform the MTP layer  of any status change so that traffic can be started or stopped.","The ISUP process  contained in the SGSS  is responsible for receiving and forwarding ISUP messages between the MTP layer  and the Application Layer . This process maintains connectivity to the Application Layer  process and determines readiness of the ISUP message processing capability, and decodes and encodes the ISUP header. In addition, the ISUP process  distributes messages to the Application Layer  processes, discards message response if timeout occurs, and takes default action if message response timeout occurs.","The SCCP process  is responsible for receiving and forwarding SCCP messages between the MTP layer  and the Application Layer . The SCCP process  provides communications between signaling nodes  and  and provides specialized routing and management functions necessary to support routing to partitioned and\/or duplicate databases. In addition, this process returns messages back to MTP when message is checked OK.","The SNM\/SNT process  is responsible for receiving and forwarding SNM\/SNT, and in particular the Link Status Signal Unit (LSSU) messages and any other messages that the ISUP process  and SCCP  process can not process. In addition, SNM\/SNT process  generates Traffic Metering and Measurement (TMM) data and generates events to report LSSU data.","The APSS  sends MSUs  to the ICM  through the Interface Subsystem  (IFSS). TMM data is generated by both the APSS  and the SGSS . Statistics are only generated by the APSS  and are sent to the ICM  through the Accounting Subsystem  (ACSS). Every subsystem generates events and logs that are sent to the ICM  through the Recording Subsystem (RCSS) .","The ICM  provides configuration data for the ICP Platform  and the SS7 stack. As illustrated in , configuration data is sent to the PCSS  through the IFSS . The PCSS  updates the database with platform configuration through the DMSS . SS7 node configuration is sent to the UTSS . UTSS  interfaces with the SS7 stack (vendor software portion) to change stack configuration. In addition, the ICM  provides rules to the APSS  and SGSS , which use the rules to determine message distribution and processing. Rules are first passed to the Platform Control Subsystem  (PCSS) which updates the database at the Data Management Subsystem  (DMSS). As illustrated in , rules are first passed from the IFSS  to the PCSS  which updates the database at the DMSS . The APSS  and the SGSS  then read the rules as needed. The ICM  also sends the rule switching command (CMD) to the PCSS , which is processed and used in the same way as the rules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["400","400","312","270","270","312","270","313","270","312","320","314","270","320","314","320","315"]},"It is understood that the present invention can take many forms and embodiments.
