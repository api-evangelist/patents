(PBDs), in particular pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers having a C2-C3 double bond and a propargyl group at the C2 position on one monomer unit, and their inclusion in targeted conjugates.","Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and numerous synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., 1994, 433-465 (1994); Antonow, D. and Thurston, D. E., . 2011 111 (4), 2815-2864). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., 25, 437-444 (1972)).

In the B-ring there is either an imine (N\u2550C), a carbinolamine (NH\u2014CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH\u2014CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, ., 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.","It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of this molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8\/C\u2032-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al., 114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al., 61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5\u2032-Pu-GATC-Py-3\u2032 interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al., 42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al., 44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity.

Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na and K, alkaline earth cations such as Ca and Mg, and other cations such as Al. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e. NH) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NHR, NHR, NHR, NR). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine.

Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.","Solvates","It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and\/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term \u201csolvate\u201d is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent. If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.","Carbinolamines","The invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety, which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol (ROH, where Ris Calkyl):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0439","num":"0642"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00079","num":"00079"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00079","he":"25.40mm","wi":"156.13mm","file":"US09399641-20160726-C00079.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD. The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found, as well as the nature of the moiety itself.","These particular compounds may be isolated in solid form, for example, by lyophilisation.","Isolation of Compounds of Formula I","Without wishing to be bound by theory, it has been found that compounds of formula I where Rand Rform a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound, have a tendency to reversibly dimerise on isolation. This reversible dimerisation is thought to occur due to reversible addition of Q on one molecule with the imine bond of another compound. Treatment with methanol, e.g. for 1 hour, can assist with isolation of the monomeric form of compounds of formula I.","Isomers","Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r-forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and I-forms; (+) and (\u2212) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; \u03b1- and \u03b2-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cisomers\u201d (or \u201cisomeric forms\u201d).","Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term \u201cisomers\u201d, as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, \u2014OCH, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, \u2014CHOH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.

Phosphine-palladium complexes such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) are used for this reaction, but palladium(II) complexes can also be used because they are reduced to the palladium(0) species by the consumption of the terminal alkynes in the reaction medium. The oxidation of triphenylphosphine to triphenylphosphine oxide can also lead to the formation of Pd(0) in situ when catalysts such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride are used. In contrast, copper(I) halides react with the terminal alkyne and produce copper(I) acetylide, which acts as an activated species for the coupling reactions.","The reaction medium must be basic to neutralize the hydrogen halide produced as the byproduct of this coupling reaction, so alkylamine compounds such as triethylamine, diethylamine or piperidine are sometimes used as solvents, but also DMF or ether can be used as solvent. Other bases such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate are occasionally used.","The two coupling steps are usually carried out sequentially.

The incubation was terminated by centrifugation (5 min, 300 g) and the cells were washed once with drug-free medium.

Plates were then kept in the dark at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO. The assay is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce a yellow soluble tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Aldrich-Sigma), to an insoluble purple formazan precipitate. Following incubation of the plates for 4 days (to allow control cells to increase in number by approximately 10 fold), 20 \u03bcL of MTT solution (5 mg\/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well and the plates further incubated for 5 hours. The plates were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300 g and the bulk of the medium pipetted from the cell pellet leaving 10-20 \u03bcL per well. DMSO (200 \u03bcL) was added to each well and the samples agitated to ensure complete mixing. The optical density was then read at a wavelength of 550 nm on a Titertek Multiscan ELISA plate reader, and a dose-response curve was constructed. For each curve, an ICvalue was read as the dose required to reduce the final optical density to 50% of the control value."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
