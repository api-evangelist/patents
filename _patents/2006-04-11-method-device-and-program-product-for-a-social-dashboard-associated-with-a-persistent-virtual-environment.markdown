Technical Field","The disclosed technology relates to the fields of monitoring persistent virtual environments and Social Network Analysis of on-line entities within the persistent virtual environment.","2. Background Art","Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are becoming increasingly popular with subscribers in the millions. The MMOG providers sell a product (the software executed on a player's computer) and a service (by making a persistent virtual environment available to the account holder) for a periodic subscription fee. Thus, account holder retention is financially important to the MMOG provider because the longer the player associated with the account holder remains involved with the MMOG, the longer the MMOG provider receives subscription income. Hence, the MMOG providers are motivated to create and sustain healthy, long lived, online player communities.","Maintaining and increasing subscriber motivation to continue the subscription is a major business focus of the game industry. However, no diagnostic tools are available to timely measure the social aspects of player interactions in the persistent virtual environment or to measure or monitor the health of the online player community in a persistent virtual environment. While the MMOG provider can gather massive amounts of information about the persistent virtual environment, this information must be analyzed at high cost with, for example, Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae or SPSS\u00ae. Thus, it is difficult, expensive and time consuming for the MMOG provider to monitor the social health of the persistent virtual environment and the analysis results only reflect the state of the persistent virtual environment at the time the data was collected. Thus the analysis is not timely, has no capability to forecast problems, and only operates from single source of information.","Microsoft, Excel, are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. SPSS is a registered trademark of SPSS Inc., of Chicago, Ill.","Marc Smith et al. in , Proceedings of CHI'2001 (Seattle Wash., April 1998), ACM Press, pages 136-143, teaches analyzing and presenting a snapshot visualization of interpersonal connections extracted from newsgroup communications.","Warren Sack, in --, Journal of Management Information Systems, Winter 2000, Vol. 17, No. 3, pages 73-92, taught a series of visualization panels to analyze social interactions in newsgroup to help readers navigate the newsgroup's information space.","Smith and Sack only teach analyzing data from a single information source (the newsgroup).","Nicolas Ducheneaut, in : A socio-technical analysis, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 14(4), pages 323-368, taught techniques for visualizing interactions between people and interactions between people and things (for example, software code) over time. Ducheneaut teaches accessing a variety of information sources, but is narrowly focused to Open Source Software development projects.","It would be advantageous to provide a way to timely monitor persistent virtual environments and to measure, monitor, and treat the health of online player communities within persistent virtual environments.","Other aspects of the disclosed technology include methods, devices and program products for monitoring a persistent virtual environment by displaying a visualization that represents a social aspect of the persistent virtual environment where the visualization is responsive to a metric. On receiving a selection command from a user, the technology displays, responsive to the selection command, a second visualization that represents drill-down information associated with the metric.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","103","105","107","107","101","109","101","111","113","115","117","117","119","121","113","125","115","117","119","109","121","119","105","123","103","121","109","109","109","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","203","200","201"]},"One aspect of the persistent virtual environment  can be a client data harvester  and\/or a provider data harvester . These data harvesters repeatedly gather social interaction information to determine an on-line entity's social ties in the persistent virtual environment . Additional information can be harvested from the persistent virtual environment  such as the on-line entity's possessions, location, profession, skills, experience, player association membership etc. The provider data harvester  generally can access more private account holder information than can the client data harvester  because the virtual world provider  imposes more access restrictions on client computers such as the client data harvester .","The term \u201csocial interaction information\u201d includes the time the information was acquired as well an any type of on-line entity data acquired by a data harvester, or that can be associated with on-line entity data acquired by a data harvester. Examples of social interaction information include, without limitation, time information, on-line entity identification information, communication content information, communication type information, communication source information, and audience identification information.","The client data harvester  interfaces to the virtual world server(s)  through one or more application programming interfaces (API) generally provided or authorized by the virtual world provider  (for example, as a programming interface to a specific computer programming language, or as \u201cmacros\u201d provided to automate player actions). However, the client data harvester  will generally be limited in the number and\/or type of interactions it can make to the virtual world server(s) . This can limit the amount of social interaction information that can be captured by the client data harvester  and\/or can extend the time required to capture the social interaction information. In addition the client data harvester  generally does not have access to any social interaction information other than that which would be available to a player through his\/her on-line entity (for example, the client data harvester  generally does not have access to another account holder's account information). The provider data harvester  however does not have the performance restrictions of the client data harvester  nor need it be restricted from access to account information.","A player in a persistent virtual environment may have multiple personas in that environment. Each persona is a separate on-line entity within the persistent virtual environment. Unless the player discloses player-specific information to other players or the MMOG provider provides facilities to do so, the actions, communications, and characteristics of the player's on-line entity is the only source of information available to other on-line entities. Thus, a player refers to an actual person or computerized robot that controls the on-line entity (such as an avatar) in the persistent virtual environment. The account holder is the real-world entity who has subscribed to the persistent virtual environment (who may also be a player), the on-line entity is the avatar in the persistent virtual environment that is controlled by the player. On-line entities can establish player associations such as guilds, cities, clans, etc. The industry term \u201cplayer association\u201d is generally an association of on-line entities and not generally of \u201cplayers\u201d as these terms are used herein. Player association, as used herein, includes a goal-directed temporary association (a \u201cparty\u201d\u2014such as a \u201chunting party\u201d) created by associating multiple players who agree to cooperate for a period of time or to achieve a goal.","The player can become virtually present within the persistent virtual environment  by using a virtual world client  to \u201clogin\u201d to the persistent virtual environment . In this way, the player controls an on-line entity in the persistent virtual environment . The virtual world client  communicates over the network  to the virtual world server(s)  and presents to information about the persistent virtual environment  to the player (such as by presenting textual, visual, audio, or other information to the player's senses). The player causes the player's on-line entity to interact with other players' on-line entities, with non-player entities, or with virtual objects in the persistent virtual environment .","The persistent virtual environment  can provide access to newsgroups and other communication forums (not shown) that are commonly accessible through the network . Generally, each of the virtual world server(s)  has its own separate persistent virtual environment. Some MMOG providers may provide persistent virtual environments that integrate across the servers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","301","303","305","307","301","303","305","307","301","207","209","303","307","305","307","307"]},"The \u2018data acquisition\u2019 process  monitors one of the virtual world server(s)  to acquire social interaction information from communications and acts between players of on-line entities in the persistent virtual environment. The social interaction information includes communications made by the players across channels (for example, those communications made via in-game group chat, private messaging, public talk, persistent virtual environment mail messages, and economic transactions). Additional communications can also be obtained from sources outside the persistent virtual environment such as message postings on forums related to the persistent virtual environment, etc. The \u2018data acquisition\u2019 process  stores the social interaction information, which includes information identifying the on-line entities involved in the communication or act, when the social interaction information occurred, and what the social interaction information was related to.","For example, the social interaction information can be represented by interaction data such as:\n\n","The \u2018data acquisition\u2019 process  can be performed by the client data harvester  and\/or the provider data harvester  and serves to acquire social interaction information from the players through conversations and acts of their on-line entities as well as from the players through off-line communications. The social interaction information can be stored in memory or in other accessible storage (such as the data storage ).","The \u2018analysis\u2019 process  can use the stored social interaction information as input to various analysis procedures. Each analysis procedure can generate a metric that represents a social aspect of the persistent virtual environment. Some embodiments provide a number of different metrics that represent different social aspects of the persistent virtual environment. These metrics include those that have been identified as representing the \u201chealth\u201d of the persistent virtual environment.","The \u2018visualization\u2019 process  presents a visualization responsive to the metric to provide information about the persistent virtual environment. In one embodiment the presented visualization is graphically represented by one or more visualization panels (for example, a panel to display prestigious and central on-line entities; a panel to display \u201chot topics\u201d that identifies most active topics of conversation between the players; etc. Examples of visualization panels are provided by  through  with their accompanying text.","In some embodiments, the \u2018data acquisition\u2019 process  and\/or the \u2018analysis\u2019 process  are ongoing processes (for example threads, tasks, etc.) that continually or periodically execute. Other conceived-of embodiments use event driven invocation of the processes.","In some embodiments, the social interaction information can include a presence state value (such as whether the on-line entity is virtually present when the presence history is gathered). In the case of player associations for example, the presence state value can include a participation level such as a number or percentage of the player association that are virtually present at the time of acquisition. Furthermore, the presence state value can have a positive or negative value with respect to a threshold.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","400","401","403","203","400","405","203","407","400","405","203"]},"The \u2018social interaction information dispatch\u2019 process  can be invoked as a result of a boot of the client data harvester  or the provider data harvester , by an operator or batch command, or in any other way known to one skilled in the art. One skilled in the art will understand that the functionality of the \u2018social interaction information dispatch\u2019 process  can be tightly incorporated into the virtual world server(s)  itself and need not be performed on a separate processor or as a separate process.","One embodiment provides a pool of identical threads each of which can parse the social interaction information. In this embodiment, each thread determines the type of the social interaction information when it is received and parses the social interaction information accordingly. Other embodiments maintain a pools of threads where the threads in each pool are used to parse a particular type of the social interaction information. In these embodiments, the \u2018dispatch social interaction information to parser thread\u2019 procedure  determines the social interaction information type and dispatches the social interaction information for parsing.","A separate process (not shown) can be used to gather social interaction information from sources that are not directly accessible from the persistent virtual environment (such as a newsgroup or forum related to the persistent virtual environment). One skilled in the art, after reading the teachings within, will understand how to access and analyze information from such a source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","403","400","500","501","503","500","505","407","505","500","507","509","511","507","509","511","500","513","115","500","505"]},"The social interaction information is generally text (but can, for example, be text generated from a speech recognition component) between an on-line entity and an audience, as well as descriptive text resulting from an emote and\/or action command. This synchronous information can include, for example but without limitation, identification of the involved on-line entities, when the communication was passed, how long the communication lasted, the communication mode (such as instant message, gesture, emote, communication channel (such as a guild communication channel)). The social interaction information can also be an asynchronous communication between players either within or external to the persistent virtual environment such as e-mail, newsgroup or forum postings as well as user ratings, notes, reviews, group affiliations, rankings and the like. In addition, the social interaction information can include demographic information related to account holders. The social interaction information can also include features extracted from an audio or video stream, such as duration, number of phrases, intensity of emotion, etc.","Social interaction information can also be inferred from other indicators that do not require direct communication between the parties. For example, but without limitation, behavioral information (such as that information relating to the player participating in joint activities) can be inferred from a \u201cgrouped\u201d marker indicating that two or more players have formed a party; and from co-location in the game world (such as if two players tend to visit the same location in the persistent virtual environment\u2014such as the same \u201ctavern\u201d in a city\u2014and optionally overlapping in time). Social interaction information can also be inferred from a player's \u201cfriend list\u201d (a list of past in-game contacts). Social interaction information can also be inferred from indirect interactions such as when players exchange goods through the mediation of an \u201cauction house\u201d or any other in-game marketplace.","The \u2018determine communication source\u2019 procedure  determines the communication source, for example, by determining where the information was acquired (such as from a chat channel within the persistent virtual environment, or from an external forum or newsgroup). Often this information will be provided within the provided social interaction information. Sometimes this information will be deduced by identifying the source of the information.","Some embodiments include the capability (for example, by using natural language processing) to determine whether the communication is between the players themselves or between the on-line entities controlled by the players (non-role playing communication vs. role playing communication).","The \u2018determine audience\u2019 procedure  determines the audience, for example, by tracking which on-line entities are in sufficiently close proximity to a public communication initiated by an on-line entity using a particular command mode (for example via a whisper command, a yell command, or a default communication command).","The interaction data can also be stored, for example, as a series of affiliation matrices where the value at each coordinate (x, y) indicates the amount of a given interaction over a given period of time between players X and Y. This value can be linked to the social interaction information used to produce the affiliation matrix for subsequent in-depth analysis. One skilled in the art will understand that information can also be stored using database techniques.","The \u2018analysis\u2019 process  computes metrics that represent the health of the persistent virtual environment. While the following discussion is directed to examples where the persistent virtual environment is a MMOG, one skilled in the art will understand that the analysis techniques disclosed herein apply to any persistent virtual environment that enables social interaction between the players participating in the persistent virtual environment as on-line entities.","A metric can be classified as a status metric or a predictive metric. A status metric characterizes behavioral information of a set of on-line entities where the behavioral information is related to at least one activity of the on-line entities within the persistent virtual environment. Example status metrics include, without limitation, a prominence metric, a centrality degree metric, a cohesive subgroup metric, a group level equivalence metric, a leadership metric, a strength of ties metric, an interactivity metric, a topic of interaction metric, a role metric, a social accounting metric, a game-play metric, a modeling metric, and an interaction topic metric as well as other metrics. These metrics are subsequently briefly described.","The predictive metric can, for example, evaluate the change in a status metric over time. Example predictive metrics include, without limitation: a chum metric, a compatibility metric, a scheduling metric, a content consumption metric, an environmental balance metric, a survival metric, and an economic metric. \u201cChurn\u201d metrics predict the probability of a player leaving the persistent virtual environment, based on the player's past interaction patterns. Compatibility metrics indicate whether or not a player's playstyle will match a proposed player association or whether the player's playstyle matches that of the player association to which he\/she is a member. Scheduling metrics predict the probability of a player being available for a future joint activity, so that such activities can be planned in advance. Content consumption metrics predict when players will have exhausted the persistent virtual environment's resources, in order to plan timely expansions to the persistent virtual environment. Environmental balance metrics predict the effects of a design change on the persistent virtual environment, such as removing a given \u201cprofession\u201d or certain items from the persistent virtual environment. Economic metrics predict inflation, trade volume, and other variables in order to maintain the balance of trade in the persistent virtual environment. The survival metric indicates the health of a player association.","The predictive metrics can include those that develop a time-series of single or combinations of status metrics (weighted or un-weighted) that represent trends; metrics that represent heuristically determined conditions relevant to the predicted health of the persistent virtual environment; metrics based on a vector of attributes representing characteristics of the on-line entity such that the vectors can be used to classify on-line entities and to determine the characteristics of successful on-line entities; and to determine whether on-line entities have characteristics that are progressing toward or away from the characteristics of successful on-line entities.","The classification of the on-line entities can utilize a Bayesian network, spectral analysis, nearest neighbor techniques or any other classification mechanism.","The predictive metrics can timely measure the social aspects of player interactions in the persistent virtual environment, and measure and\/or monitor the health of the online player community in a persistent virtual environment. By using the predictive metrics, the MMOG provider can alter the persistent virtual environment to encourage desired social interactions and to discourage less desired social interactions.","One skilled in the art of Social Network Analysis will understand that the metrics can be these used in the Social Network Analysis art. One example of what is known in the art of Social Network Analysis is provided by , by Wasserman, 2., & Frost, K. (1994), Cambridge University Press. Some of these metrics are briefly described below. These metrics allow the MMOG providers to understand the role played by each player in the persistent virtual environment. Valuable roles (e.g. leaders holding groups of players together, thereby increasing the quality of their social experience in the persistent virtual environment) can be encouraged with incentives; and problematic roles (for example, players disrupting a group's cohesion) can be eliminated. The following metrics can all assist in detecting these roles.","A \u201cprominence\u201d metric represents the ties to the on-line entity that make the on-line entity particularly visible to other on-line entities in the persistent virtual environment. The prominence metric is computed by evaluating direct and adjacent ties, and also indirect paths involving intermediaries.","A \u201ccentrality degree\u201d metric indicates the amount the other on-line entities recognize that a specific on-line entity is well socially well connected and serves as a major information channel.","A \u201ccohesive subgroup\u201d metric indicates subsets of on-line entities among whom there are relatively strong, direct, intense, frequent or positive ties (for example, mutuality of ties, frequency of ties, frequency of ties among on-line entities within the subgroup as compared to on-line entities who are not within the subgroup). In this context, a \u201ctie\u201d is a way of representing a social relationship between two entities, where the relationship is based on some type of information transfer (symmetric or asymmetric) between the entities.","A \u201cleadership\u201d metric can be computed from standard social network metrics such as prestige and centrality.","A \u201cstrength of ties\u201d metric represents the density of connections within clusters of on-line entities, the size of these clusters, and the overall social network structure.","An \u201cinteractivity\u201d metric represents the average number of utterances, average size of utterance, average length of interactions, number of unique versus repeated utterances and interactions, etc. This metric can be determined relevant to a specific one of, or subset of, on-line entities. It can also be determined relevant to a specific location in the persistent virtual environment.","A \u201csocial accounting\u201d metric indicates an on-line entity's social importance (as determined, for example, from network centrality, rate of advancement, items they own or other heuristically determined characteristic).","A \u201ctopics of interaction\u201d metric can be obtained from text mining of the on-line entity's utterances. their bios, or from the forums, etc. The topics can be determined by using natural language processing. For example, one can perform topic extraction from the corpus of text messages typed by the players based on a thesaurus. One can also build a semantic network by extracting words that frequently co-occur, thereby identifying associations between concepts as expressed by the players (for example, if the words \u201cpaladin\u201d\u2014a character class\u2014and \u201cunbalanced\u201d frequently co-occur, this might be an indication of a design flaw in the persistent virtual environment).","A \u201crole\u201d metric can be developed from combinations of the above metrics. For example, an on-line entity can serve one or more roles. These roles can include \u201chelper,\u201d \u201cexpert,\u201d \u201cphilosopher,\u201d \u201ccomic,\u201d \u201cgriefer,\u201d \u201cfacilitator,\u201d \u201csocializer\u201d, etc.","A \u201cgameplay\u201d metric indicates the number of on-line entities within a given character class, having a given level, within a persistent virtual environment geographical zone, those owing particular articles etc.","The metrics allow time series analysis of aspects of the persistent virtual environment based on where and when on-line entities are virtually present and so enables the MMOG provider to recommend and\/or encourage formation of optimal groupings of on-line entities (for example by encouraging development of a player association or to optimize load across servers based on activities of on-line entities).","The metrics also allow the MMOG provider to model the impact of modifications to the persistent virtual environment by predicting consequences of the modification. In addition, the social accounting metric can be used to 1) prioritize the work of \u201ccustomer service representatives\u201d (the people who handle complaints)\u2014important players get VIP treatment; 2) target key players for retention if they show any sign of leaving persistent virtual environment.","The metrics also allow the MMOG provider to detect and remove griefers or other players who exhibit fraudulent and\/or deviant behavior.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3","FIG. 9","FIG. 10"],"b":["600","303","600","601","600","603","605","607","609","611"]},"Once all the data update events have been posted to the static metric analysis threads, a \u2018wait for static metric analysis threads\u2019 procedure  waits for the static metric analysis threads to complete incorporating the new social interaction information into the metrics computed by the static metric analysis modules implemented by the static metric analysis threads. Once all the static metric analysis threads complete processing, the analysis process  continues to an \u2018iterate over predictive metric analysis modules\u2019 procedure . The \u2018iterate over predictive metric analysis modules\u2019 procedure  iterates each predictive metric analysis thread. A \u2018post data update to predictive metric analysis thread\u2019 procedure  posts a data update event to the iterated thread so that the corresponding predictive metric analysis module can process the new social interaction information in light of changes in the static metric analysis metrics (and\/or in light of the new interaction data).

Some of the diagnostic tools present instrument readings based on one or more of the previously described metrics.","These diagnostic tools allow the MMOG provider to explore the relationships between on-line entities (for example using network graphs such as shown in  through ). The MMOG provider can also choose which interactions to observe at some level of granularity and for what period of time. The diagnostic tools provide the capability of identifying socially influential players and of recommending how the MMOG provider can encourage the identified players to actions that will improve the health of the persistent virtual environment. The tools allow the MMOG provider to investigate the rational and data that supports the tool's recommendation. Other diagnostic tools predict the health of the persistent virtual environment if the recommendations is, or is not, followed.","Some of the diagnostic tools are instruments that provide a high-level reading of the health of the persistent virtual environment or of the player associations within the persistent virtual environment. An example of such an instrument is one that displays the overall interactivity level of the on-line entities within the persistent virtual environment. Another example presents an overview of the more important metrics for the persistent virtual environment. One such metric could be those that are relevant to player associations (for persistent virtual environments where the aggregate health of the player associations correlate with subscriber retention).","The diagnostic tools can also provide warnings and alerts if there are significant changes in the social environment in the persistent virtual environment (for example, if the number of on-line entities classified as \u201cleaders\u201d suddenly drops).","Other diagnostic tools can detect problematic trends. One example would be that of detecting the deteriorating health of a player association, or of providing a list of player associations that are in jeopardy of disappearing. Other diagnostic tools can be used to determine the cause of a player association being in jeopardy and can recommend remedial action for the MMOG provider to improve the situation. Yet other diagnostic tools can monitor and predict subscriber chum and retention rates. Other tools allow MMOG provider to detect and police undesirable social behavior of a player in the persistent virtual environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","1301","1303","1305","1307","1309","1309","1307","1301","1303","1305"]},"The instrumented dashboard  also includes a command bar  that contains one or more controls such as a user activated control  that can be activated by a user to send a selection command to present drill-down information about an aspect of one if the presented instruments. One skilled in the art will understand that there are many ways to select which instrument to provide drill-down information about. These include selecting the instrument and invoking the selection command on the selected instrument, as well as activating a control that invokes the selection command specific to an instrument (such as the user activated control  that specifically drills-down into the guild size instrument ). The instrument image itself can also serve as the user activated control .","The Critical, Danger, and Normal zones on instruments can represent computed thresholds. We perform a regression of several factors over a target-variable (one embodiment, performs a regression of the player association size metric, the player association density metric, and the number of isolated subgraphs in the player association, over a survival-variable to measure the influence of each listed metric over the survival of a player association). Using the equation resulting from the regression, the value of each factor at which the target variable changes is computed. These values are used as thresholds for the instrument (for example in on persistent virtual environment, when the player association size metric is more than 10, all other metric being equal, player associations will survive; when the player association size metric less than 5, player associations will die). These values and metric can be used to prioritize and route customer support requests to the appropriate entity at the MMOG provider who are appropriately empowered to handle the request. The support entities can also use technology described herein to understand the importance to the persistent virtual environment of the player who has made the support request and thus, to respond accordingly.

On selection of the more connected member  in the member selection control  the system will provide a recommendation to the virtual world provider  on how to influence or pressure the more connected member  to continue in the player association.","The marketing department of a MMOG provider initially provides recommended actions Possible recommendation actions would initially be provided using heuristics. For example the initial recommendation actions for increasing player retention could include offering the subscriber: free subscription periods, free items (both in the persistent virtual environment and\/or in the real world), an invitation to a special event, or any other retention incentive). The persistent virtual environment then tracks the trajectory of each player after receipt of the retention incentive and measures the effectiveness of each retention incentive and adjusts its recommendations accordingly (individually to the tracked player and\/or to classes of players).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0114"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 17"],"b":["1600","1601","1613","1601","201"]},"As used herein, a procedure is a self-consistent sequence of steps that can be performed by logic implemented by a programmed computer, specialized electronics or other circuitry or a combination thereof that lead to a desired result.
