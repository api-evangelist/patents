{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61\/354,896 filed on Jun. 15, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","Patient monitoring systems are widely used in the medical field to enable healthcare providers to monitor the condition of patients. Patient monitoring systems that store patient data or interface with medical record databases may be referred to as electronic medical record (EMR) systems.","Some EMR systems automatically monitor clinical events, by analyzing patient data from an electronic health record to predict, detect and potentially prevent adverse events. Patient data may include discharge\/transfer orders, pharmacy orders, radiology results, laboratory results and any other data from services or healthcare provider notes.","An electronic medical record is typically a computerized legal medical record created in an organization that delivers care, such as a hospital or doctor's office. Electronic medical records are often part of a local stand-alone health information system that allows storage, retrieval and manipulation of records.","Existing EMR systems are susceptible to inefficient data entry, inaccurate or incorrect data entry, and tend to distract medical personnel during data entry, especially during critical medical procedures. Accordingly, there is a need to enhance to ability of healthcare providers to more efficiently monitor and control the administration of treatments to medical patients while also performing healthcare data recording.","The application, in various embodiments, addresses the deficiencies of current patient monitoring and management systems by providing systems and methods including a patient management system that enables a caregiver, e.g., anesthesiologist, to more efficiently administer medications while monitoring a patient's status during a medical procedure, such as an operation.","In certain aspects, a system, such as a computer system, displays a user interface for medical personnel to monitor and\/or control the delivery medications such as anesthesia to a patient during a medical procedure. The system may gather patient data and other information from one or more patient monitors, one or more remote patient record information systems, one or more remote medical databases, and analyze various data to provide information for or to enable control of the administration of at least one medication or drug to a patient during a medical procedure such as an operation. The system may gather information during an operation and generate data for an interoperative medical record.","The system may also provide gathered or generated patient data to other medical systems (e.g., patient records, billing, and the like). The system user interface (e.g., GUI) may include user input and information output features that enhance the user's (e.g., anesthesiologist) ability to monitor a patient and control the delivery of medical treatment to the patient. The system may interface with other medical systems such as a hospital patient data system, hospital billing system, doctor billing system, or insurance provider system. The system may gather information from other systems or deliver data recording a medical procedure to another medical record system.","The system may analyze or process certain data being collected so that the quality of the collected data is enhanced, by for example removing redundant data (artifacts) or eliminating irrelevant data so that the system user's time can be more efficiently directed to monitoring the patient. The system may use certain charts or tables and a touch screen to enable convenient user access to data in various portions of the chart. For example, the user interface display may provide a chart that includes intersecting lines (horizontal and vertical) as a user touches the display to more clearly show the user which cell of a chart to be selected.","The system may interface with a video camera and provide a view of a patient on a portion of the user interface to enable the user (e.g., healthcare provider) to monitor the patient while interfacing with the system, e.g., charting patient data. The system may use various information to control the delivery of medication\/drugs to a patient, or to identify drug interaction or allergy issues for a patient. The system may synchronize data from multiple sources. The system may use access control (e.g., biometric authentication) to ensure that only authorized personnel have system access a tandem DMS device advantageously includes first and second DMS filters that utilize separation mechanisms based on two different separation models.","More particularly, in certain aspects, the systems and methods described herein include patient monitoring systems.
