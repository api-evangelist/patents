Cellular operators, however, increasingly prefer offloading cellular traffic on to Wi-Fi\u2122 networks. Global positioning systems (GPS) provide another mechanism for determining geo-location of devices such as a smartphone or tablet computer. Only a limited number of devices, however, support GPS. Also, GPS systems require line-of-sight signals from GPS satellites, which may not be available indoors. Some devices may be capable of connecting to both cellular networks as well as other networks, such as Wi-Fi\u2122 networks. Device geo-location may be useful during emergencies involving a user of the device, such as fire, medical, security, or other emergencies. Device geo-location may also be useful for regulatory compliance or law enforcement purposes.

Measuring the wireless signal strength W at a user device, and using the measured wireless signal strength as a lookup variable in to the graph of  can determine the device distance D. In this example, the wireless access point  has been assumed to provide isotropic performance. In alternative embodiments, however, the yaw and tilt angles with respect to the horizontal earth may have an effect on the wireless signal strength. In such embodiments, more detailed data gathering may be required to determine a device distance from the wireless signal strength, yaw angle, and pitch angle. In general, it is to be understood that the disclosure contemplates that any number of variables other than device distance may affect the wireless signal strength measured at a user device, and the effect of those variables may be considered in ensuring that a device distance can be accurately determined by measuring the wireless signal strength and those variables. For example, variables such as roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the user device and\/or the wireless access point may be measured using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, etc. included in the user device and\/or the wireless access point.","With reference to , the location coordinates of a wireless access point  according to  (represented as P123 (X0, Y0) in ) can be determined from measuring wireless signal strengths W1, W2, and W3 at the three user device locations (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), and (X3, Y3).

Thus,  depicts the geometrical configuration in two-dimensions Cartesian coordinates corresponding to the device configuration of . A triangulation method corresponding to this configuration is explained below. To determine the wireless access point location coordinates (X0, Y0), it can be first recognized that the point P123 (X0, Y0) lies at the intersection of all three circles, C1, C2, and C3, defined respectively by the locations (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), and (X3, Y3) of the user devices and their corresponding device distances D1, D2, and D3 from the wireless access point .

If the location coordinates (X0, Y0) in civic format are later requested for triangulating the location coordinates of another device, a reverse lookup may be performed, whereby location coordinates in LCI format may be retrieved corresponding to the location in civic format.
