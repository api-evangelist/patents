title: System, method and computer program product for mediating notes and note sub-notes linked or otherwise associated with stored or networked web pages
abstract: A system and method of manipulating notes linked to Web pages, and of manipulating the Web pages. These Web pages (or portions of Web pages) can be stored at a Web site or in a local file system. The method of linking notes to Web pages operates by enabling a user to select a portion of a Web page, creating a annotation, linking the annotation to the selected portion, receiving a request from a user viewing the annotation to display the selected portion linked to the annotation, and invoking an application, if the application is not already invoked, and for causing the application to load the Web page and present the selected portion.

Field of the Invention","Generally speaking, the present invention is directed to a system, method, and computer program product of linking notes to data objects. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a system, method, and computer program product of linking notes to Web pages.","2. Related Art","The importance to the modern economy of rapid information and data exchange cannot be understated. This explains the exponentially increasing popularity of the Internet. The Internet is a world-wide set of interconnected computer networks that can be used to access a growing amount and variety of information electronically.","One method of accessing information on the Internet is known as the World Wide Web (www, or the \u201cWeb\u201d). The Web is a distributed, hypermedia system, and functions as a client-server based information presentation system Information that is intended to be accessible over the Web is stored in the form of \u201cpages\u201d on general-purpose computers known as \u201cservers.\u201d Computer users can access a Web page using general-purpose computers, referred to as \u201cclients,\u201d by specifying the uniform resource locator (URL) of the page.","Hyperlinks are a common function of the Internet. A hyperlink is an element in an electronic document that links to another place in the same document or to an entirely different document. Typically, you click on the hyperlink to follow the link. Hyperlinks are one of the most essential ingredients of all hypertext systems, including the Web. As a publishing tool, hyperlinks enable the publisher to define the direction, location, flow and content of the user's path over the Internet. These single direction hyperlinks are part of published content that the user cannot change or comment on. In the Web environment, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the authoring language used to create documents or pages accessible on the Web.","In today's Computer Age, there exists a vast amount of information accessible over the Internet that can be processed by computers. Such information is generally referred to herein as data objects, and more specifically referred to herein as HTML documents or Web pages.","It is often desirable to organize information such that data objects that somehow relate to a particular topic are associated with other data objects that are related to the same topic. Hyperlinks represent a conventional mechanism for associating data objects with other data objects.  illustrates a scenario involving Documents A, B, C, D, and E. Document A is linked to Document B via Hyperlink B. In a similar manner, Document B is linked to Documents C and D, and Document D is linked to Document E. A user follows Hyperlinks B, C, D, and E to traverse through Documents A, B, C, D, and E using a conventional \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d methodology.","As apparent from , Hyperlinks B, C, D, and E form a trail through Documents A, B, C, D, and E. This trail represents the organization of Documents A, B, C, D, and E. However, Hyperlinks B, C, D, and E do not document or explain this trail. Accordingly, it can be said that Hyperlinks B, C, D, and E form an undocumented trail through Documents A, B, C, D, and E.","Consider, for example, Hyperlink B. Hyperlink B merely serves to link Document A to Document B. Hyperlink B does not describe why Document A is linked to Document B. Instead, the explanation or rationale for the linkage of Document A with Document B must be inferred by the user from the contents of Documents A and B.","However, it is often difficult to discern the rationale for the linkage between data objects. This is especially true for data objects which are not directly linked (Documents A and B represent two data objects that are directly linked), but which are indirectly linked (Documents A and E represent two data objects that are indirectly linked). For example, it may be very difficult for a user to determine the rationale for the indirect linkage of Document E to Document A. To discern the rationale for this linkage, it may be necessary for the user to review the contents of Documents A, B. D, and E. This could be a difficult and time-consuming task. Even then, the user may not be able to determine the rationale for the linkage. The user is unable to discern this rationale by reference to Hyperlinks B, D, and\/or E since, as discussed above, these hyperlinks do not convey any information to the user.","In addition, a user will not know of the existence of Document E when following traditional links from Document A until he\/she gets to Document E. This link (from Document A to Document E) may be the only link of interest to the user. The traditional linking mechanism is wasteful, as it requires the user to traverse through Documents B and D in order to arrive at Document E. Also, the user may end the search at Document B or Document D, thereby never getting to Document E. Further, traditional linking mechanisms do not provide a means by which to create links, with contextual information within and between different data objects. This type of linkage would provide the user with critical information as to how and why data objects are internally and externally related. Also, traditional links fail to provide the user with the ability to link the same portion of a data object with multiple links and notes to other data objects as well as to other portions of the same data object with varying contextual information on the rational for the links and user ideas or comments on the portion of the linked data object. Accordingly, there is a need for a mechanism that not only organizes, associates, and links data objects internally and externally, but also conveys contextual information explaining the rationale for such organization, association, and linkage, as well as the users' thoughts regarding the data objects.","Adding Notes to Data Objects","It is often desirable to add notes to data objects. Such notes may include a description of the contents of the data objects, instructions or comments to people working with the data objects, project notes, etc.","Some computer applications allow users to attach notes to data objects. For example, some word processors (such as MICROSOFT WORD and WORD PERFECT) allow users to attach notes to their documents. Typically, the user positions the cursor at the point in the document where he wishes to insert the note. The user then keys in the text for the note. The note is linked to the point in the document where the cursor was positioned.","Some spreadsheet applications (such as MICROSOFT EXCEL) allow users to attach notes to their spreadsheets.  illustrates an example spreadsheet window . The user has attached a note  to cell  of the spreadsheet  via a link . A small icon  located in cell  indicates that a note (in this case, note ) is linked to cell . The user accesses the note  from the spreadsheet  by clicking on the icon .","The note functionality of conventional computer applications (including those described above) is limited in many respects. First, these applications restrict the manner in which users are allowed to associate notes with data objects. For example, these applications permit a note to be associated with only a single element in a data object. See , where note  is associated with only cell . It is not possible to associate note  with multiple cells or to establish intra or inter data object links. Also, notes cannot be associated with partial overlapping portions of data objects. For example, the spreadsheet  in  does not allow a first note to be associated with cells  and , and a second note to be associated with cells  and .","Second, these applications do not allow users to group related notes together. Accordingly, these applications do not permit users to organize their notes.","Third, these applications do not provide a mechanism for documenting the rationale for linking notes to data objects. For example, in , the link  conveys no information that explains the rationale for linking note  with cell . Instead, the user must attempt to discern this rationale from the contents of note  and cell .","Fourth, these applications do not provide a mechanism for establishing intra or inter data object linking, such as between different spreadsheets in EXCEL or linking with a word processor data object or another computer application data object.","The restrictions described above severely diminish the usefulness of notes. Notes are intended to convey information. The ability of notes to convey information is diminished if notes cannot be associated with any portions of data objects, and if notes cannot be organized and structured, and if the rationale for linking notes to data objects is not explicitly conveyed to users.","Accordingly, there is a need for a more flexible and intelligent mechanism for attaching notes to data objects.","Potential Loss of Information","Given these limitations of conventional data organization and note tools, users are not motivated or encouraged to utilize computer related tools to organize work product and data objects that are collected and generated during the performance of a task or project. Instead, such work product and data objects are often maintained in an unorganized state, often scattered about a person's office or haphazardly stored in a makeshift filing system. Also, a person's thinking is not typically documented or recorded. Instead, such thinking remains in the person's head.","Thus, a person's thinking, work product, and data objects that are collected and generated during the performance of a task or project are easily lost (either temporarily or permanently) if the person becomes unavailable, is unable to completely remember his thinking, or loses his work product. The person and the person's employer then suffer from this loss of information.","Accordingly, what is required is a system and method for enabling the organization and recordation of a person or group's thinking, work product, and data objects collected or generated during a project or task. Such organization and recordation serves to institutionalize the person or group's thinking, work product, and data objects, thereby protecting against the unavailability of persons, memory loss, or loss of work product.","Generally speaking, the present invention is directed to a system, method, and computer program product of linking notes to data objects. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a system, method, and computer program product of linking annotations (or notes or sub-notes in a note) to Web pages. The invention enables a user to select a portion of a Web page stored at a Web site or from a local file system (if the portion of the Web page was cached). The invention creates an annotation, and links the annotation to the selected portion. The invention receives a request from a user viewing the annotation to display the selected portion linked to the annotation. In response to this request, the invention makes a connection to the Web site, if a connection is not already created, and causes the Web site to send the Web page and present the selected portion. Also note that if the portion of the Web page was cached and thus stored in a local file system, then the present invention does not need to make a connection to a Web site.","The present invention also relates to organizing, bi-directionally linking, making annotations (or notes and sub-notes) on, and maintaining disparate Web pages. Bi-directional links as described in this application allow the user to determine the relative location of links on Web page of the Internet or an intranet. Bi-directional links as described in this application also allow the user to select a portion or section of the Web page and then make annotations on the portion of the Web page selected. Bi-directional links as described in this application also link the user to the location of the selected Web page from the note or sub-note about the selected Web page. Once the Web page is placed in annotation mode, the existing bi-directional links appear beside the portion of the Web page selected, beside the annotation (or note\/sub-note), and content field of the annotation, and beside the organizational storage of the annotation.","The present invention relates generally to organizing, bi-directionally linking, making annotations (or notes and sub-notes) on, and maintaining disparate Web pages. Specifically, embodiments of the invention relate to a standalone mediator that lets users create, manage, arrange, categorize, search, customize, label, title and otherwise maintain annotations on Web pages available on the Internet without changing or manipulating the location of the Web page.","Further features and advantages of the invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.","1. Overview of the Invention","The present invention is directed to a system, method, and computer program product (CPP) for attaching annotations (or notes and sub-notes) to data objects, and for linking data objects via the use of annotations. In a preferred embodiment, data objects are Web pages. The note capabilities of the present invention can be used to organize, associate, annotate, and link data objects in an intra and\/or inter data object environment with single notes and multiple sub-notes and\/or multiple notes and sub-notes to the same data object portions or different data object portions as required by the needs of the user to institutionalize his\/her knowledge. Additionally, the note capabilities of the present invention can be used to convey information explaining the rationale for such organization, association, and linkage. Accordingly, the present invention represents a system, method, and CPP for using intelligent notes to organize, associate, annotate, and link data objects. The invention can also be used to manipulate these data objects.","As used herein, the term \u201cdata object\u201d refers to any information in any form that can be accessed and\/or processed by a computer. Such information includes data generated and\/or processed by computer applications and computer-related devices such as word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, presentation managers, database managers, financial applications, networking applications, communication applications, sound recorders and processors, video recorders and processors, on-line service applications, scanners, computer aided drafting (CAD) applications, virtual reality applications and environments, etc. The data objects generated and processed by these applications and devices vary widely in subject matter. Also, these data objects come in many forms, such as text files, image files, video files, audio files, computer programs, Web pages, etc. Accordingly, these data objects are disparate in both form and content.","The invention is adapted to memorialize and\/or institutionalize a person's or group's thinking and work product regarding a subject. If a person's or group's thinking and work product are not memorialized or institutionalized, then such thinking and work product may be lost or not accessible when needed if the person or group becomes unavailable, or is unable to remember its thinking, or loses its work product.","The present invention relates generally to organizing, bi-directionally linking, making notes and sub-notes on, and maintaining disparate data objects. A preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to organizing, bi-directionally linking, making notes and sub-notes on, and maintaining disparate Web pages. Specifically, embodiments of the invention relate to a standalone mediator that lets users create, manage, arrange, categorize, search, customize, label, title and otherwise maintain notes on Web pages available on the Internet without changing or manipulating the location of the Web page.","1.1 Marketing Expert Example: Business Internet User","The invention shall initially be described by way of several examples. Consider a scenario where a marketing expert regularly uses the Internet for research to determine if there are products that may compete with his company's software product. Referring to , the marketing expert first discovers company ABC's Web site that contains a Web page  containing a press release detailing the launch of a new ABC software product. The marketing expert notices that the ABC software product appears to directly compete with his company's software product. The marketing expert may or may not record his thinking .","The expert then notices links to other Web pages that provide interesting information including, a more detailed explanation on all ABC products, strategic partners to ABC, major customers of ABC, and entities that have invested in ABC. It is important to note that these Web pages could be either located on the same Web site as Web page , or be located on a different Web site.","The expert first clicks on the link to a Web page  describing ABC products in more detail. The expert notes some additional products that may also compete with his company's software product. The expert may or may not record his thinking .","The expert next requests a Web page  discussing the strategic partners of ABC. The expert recalls that one of the strategic partners listed is currently talking to his company about a joint venture. The expert may or may not record his thinking .","Next, the expert requests a Web page  that contains information relating to ABC's major customers. The expert notes some of the same customers of his company, along with some potential customers. The expert may or may not record his thinking .","Finally, the expert requests a Web page  that has information relevant to ABC's past and current investors. The expert recalls that one of the investors listed has recently declined an offer to invest in his company. The expert may or may not record his thinking . The expert's overall analysis and conclusions involving the ABC company may or may not be recorded .","The scenario described above and shown in  represents a conventional investigation, analysis and decision process. This conventional process may or may not be documented. In particular, the marketing expert's thinking during each step of the process may or may not be documented. Such thinking is represented by blocks , , , , , and . The expert may document such thinking (by writing or dictating notes, for example). However, the expert is just as likely to maintain his thinking only in his head. In this latter case, the expert's thinking will be lost or not accessible when needed if the expert becomes unavailable, or is unable to remember his thinking.","The investigation, analysis, and decision process represented by  will not be fully documented, even if the expert documents his thinking in blocks , , , , , and . In other words, the total work product and thinking resulting from the investigation, analysis, and decision process of  will not be fully documented simply by the documentation of thinking blocks , , , , , and . This is the case for at least two reasons. First, such documentation will be very disorganized. The documentation will not indicate how one note is related to another note. Second, such documentation will include only the expert's thinking (represented by blocks , , , , , and ). The documentation will not include copies of the Web pages upon which such thinking was based or a reference to the exact portion (text excerpt, video section, audio segment, etc.) that is relevant to the expert's thinking and analysis. In instances with voluminous Web pages, the lack of this type of reference or the like prevents the expert from clearly communicating and recording the basis for the analysis. That is, the documentation will not include the Web pages relating to press release , the detailed description of ABC company products , the strategic partners , the major customers , and the past and current investors . The documentation may contain cites to some of these Web pages, but it would be necessary for a person to manually retrieve these Web pages in order to evaluate them. Such manual retrieval is inefficient, as it requires another person to perform the same tasks as the expert. Also, such manual retrieval may not be possible, since particular Web sites and\/or Web pages often become unavailable over time. Further, as noted above, such cites will not be to the exact portion (text excerpt, video section, audio segment, etc.) that is relevant to the expert's thinking and analysis.","The invention addresses and solves the problems illustrated by the conventional investigation, analysis, and decision process of FIG. . The invention is adapted to memorialize and\/or institutionalize the expert's total work product and thinking related to the investigation, analysis, and decision process. By doing so, the invention ensures that the expert's total work product and thinking will survive and be accessible when needed, even if the expert becomes unavailable, or is unable to remember his thinking, or loses the hard copies of his work product.","The operation of the invention is represented by FIG. . The invention allows the expert to create a note  comprising multiple sub-notes , , , , , and . The expert records his thinking in these sub-notes , , , , , and . For example, according to the present invention, the expert reviews the press release  and notices that the ABC software product appears to be very similar to his company's software product. The expert records his thinking regarding the press release  and the potential competition between the ABC software product and the expert's company product sub-note .","The sub-notes , , , , , and  are linked to the relevant portions of the Web pages upon which the expert's thinking is based. Such linkage is represented by links , , , , , and . For example, the expert links sub-note  to the relevant portion of the press release . As another example, recall that the expert looks at ABC's other products  to see if what other competing products may exist. The expert records his thinking regarding the other products in . The expert links sub-note  to that relevant portion of the ABC's other products  containing the competitive products. By linking sub-note  to only the relevant portion of the ABC's other products  pertinent to the expert's thinking recorded in sub-note , the expert creates a documented trail that is more useful and effective at communicating his work product and thinking.","The sub-notes , , , , , and  and the links , , , , , and  collectively represent the expert's total work product and thinking. The sub-notes , , , , , and  and the links , , , , , and  are stored in a computer database. Thus, the invention memorializes and\/or institutionalizes the expert's total work product and thinking.","As will be described below in more detail, the marketing expert can categorize the notes he makes on the Web site(s) by color and by the shape of the bi-directional hyperlink he associates with the part of the Web page he has selected. The expert stores these notes on his own computer and the Web site is left unmarred. At a later time, the expert can revise the content of the notes and then decides which company strategist should receive which copies of the notes and Web pages. The notes he has made on the Web site can be shared in their entirety, by note (a collection of sub-notes), by type (based on a pre-set or user-defined filter), or by sub-note. For example, the expert may decide to send a copy of the notes on strategic partners  to his Vice-President of Marketing, a copy of the notes on major customers  to his Vice President of Sales, and a copy of the notes on past and current investors  to his CEO. He also informs his marketing department that he has stored all of his notes on a public directory for all of the members of the marketing department to read and further develop. The present invention allows the marketing expert to remark on any location on the Internet and choose the people he would like to securely view his notes.","As described in more detail below, the present invention notifies the marketing expert when the Web page has changed in one or both of the following ways. The marketing expert can be notified that the Web page changes its content when the user is notified by e-mail of a change in the data object. The marketing expert can be notified that the Web page has changed its content when he activates a bi-directional link intended to take him from his note or sub-note to the Web page, and the marketing expert will have the option of re-linking his notes to locations on the changed Web page.","1.2 Chef Example: Casual Internet User","A more casual use of the present invention is described next. Consider a scenario where a chef who casually uses the Internet to find recipes receives an email from a customer to look at a particular URL that has an excellent recipe for Creme Brulee. Ordinarily the chef would visit the site, see the information, and perhaps try the recipe. Using the present invention the e-mail from the customer would contain an attachment for viewing the customers note's on the URL. If the chef did not have the current invention on his computer, activating the attachment would give him the option of automatically navigating to a Web site where he can download the application. Also included in the email would be a URL the chef could simply click on to get to the location where he can download the application.","Once the attachment is activated and the present invention's application executes, the Web page of the recipe of interest to the chef appears with all of the customer's notes listed and color-coded. One color for tips about equipment, one color for tricks about making the recipe more successful, and one color for missing steps in the recipe's procedure.","The chef uses this information and tries the recipe. He adds several more tips about equipment and adds a new color for a new category of notes titled Customer Feedback. He then uses the present invention to send this new set of notes to several other chefs and to the customer who sent the original notes. Now all the people that receive the e-mail can view the same URL and the same set of notes and make notes of their own. Some they can store locally, others they can store on a network, and of both sets of notes they can choose which ones or which set of notes to send to others. They may choose to send a single sub-note, several sub-notes, or a full note containing any number of combinations of additional notes and sub-notes.","The chef can save his notes and sub-notes and print them individually or in sets or even related sets based on his own needs. The chef may later receive notes from the people he sent his notes to; he can view those notes on the recipe Web page and include the notes sent to him in his own collection of notes and sub-notes. The invention is preferable implemented using a Web annotation system  (FIG. ). The Web annotation system  is described in the following section.","2. Structure of the Present Invention",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00138","num":"00138"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","502","504","506","509","508","509","508","512","509","508","512"]},"The notes engine  manages the notes database . More particularly, the notes engine  enables users to create, modify, delete, link, view, create hierarchies of annotations (or notes and sub-notes), categorize, classify, view the location or address of the selected Web page, view the name or title of the selected Web page, re-link notes to changed Web pages, and otherwise manipulate the notes and sub-notes in the notes database . Users gain access to the functions supported by the notes engine  via the user interface .","The Web pages engine  manages the Web pages database . More particularly, the Web pages engine  enables users to cache or store, or otherwise maintain, Web pages and parts of Web pages stored in Web pages database  for greater speed in re-loading the Web page when the user returns to the note or sub-note on the Web page. The caching feature of the present invention means that the present invention does not need to make a connection to a Web site. Users gain access to the functions supported by the Web pages engine  via the user interface .","In performing its function, the Web annotation system  drives, controls, manipulates, and otherwise interacts with the applications . For example, the Web annotation system  controls the applications  so as to open Web pages (i.e., access Web sites containing Web pages), display particular portions of Web pages, highlight portions of Web pages using particular fonts, patterns, and\/or colors, display icons and\/or buttons, etc.","Preferably, the present invention achieves this functionality by interacting with applications  that support an interface  defining the interaction between computer applications. In one embodiment of the present invention, the interface  uses the Object Linking Embedded (OLE) standard. The OLE standard is well known and defines the manner in which one software application may drive, control, manipulate, and otherwise interact with another software application. The OLE standard is described in many publicly available documents, such as Microsoft OLE Programmers Reference, Volumes I and II, 1993, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The OLE standard is based on the Component Object Model (COM). The COM enables programmer to develop objects that can be accessed by any COM-compliant application.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the interface  uses JScript and Dynamic HTML (DHTML) standards. Both of these standards are also based on the COM, as the OLE standard discussed above. JScript is Microsoft's extended implementation of ECMAScript (ECMA262), an international standard based on the Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript languages. JScript is implemented as a Windows Script engine. This means that it can be \u201cplugged in\u201d to any application that supports Windows Script, such as Internet Explorer, Active Server Pages, and Window Script Host. It also means that any application supporting Windows Script can use multiple languages, including JScript, VBScript, Perl, and others. JScript can be used for both simple tasks (such as mouseovers on Web pages) and for more complex tasks (such as updating a database with ASP or running logon scripts for Windows NT).","In general, dynamic HTML refers to Web content that changes each time it is viewed. For example, the same URL could result in a different page depending on any number of parameters, such as: geographic location of the user, time of day, previous pages viewed by the user, and profile of the user. DHTML refers to new HTML extensions that will enable a Web page to react to user input without sending requests to the Web server.","It should be understood that the invention is not limited to use with OLE, JScript, or DHTML components. The applications  can be any conventional or implementation specific applications, as long as they have the capability of being externally controlled (in this case, as long as they have the capability of being controlled by the Web annotation system ).","Standard windows operations are mentioned in this disclosure. Such operations include selecting text, opening files, moving between windows, resizing windows, editing documents, etc. Such operations are well known and are described in many publicly available documents, such as Microsoft Word for Windows Users Guide, 1994, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","3. Preferred Implementation of the Present Invention","3.1. A Preferred Environment","In an embodiment of the present invention, components of the present invention (such as the Web annotation system ) are each implemented using a computer system  such as that shown in FIG. . The computer system  includes one or more processors, such as a processor . The processor  is connected to a communication bus . The computer system  also includes a main or primary memory , preferably random access memory (RAM). The primary memory  has stored therein control logic , such as software corresponding to the Web annotation system , the notes database , and the Web pages database .","It should be understood that the notes database  and\/or the Web pages database  are not necessarily stored within a single computer. Instead, the notes database  and\/or the Web pages database  may be distributed among multiple computers. Such distribution of the notes database  and\/or the Web pages database  are described in further detail below.","The computer system  also includes a secondary memory . The secondary memory  includes, for example, a hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage drive , representing a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, a compact disk drive, a program cartridge and cartridge interface (such as that found in video game devices), a removable memory chip (such as EPROM or PROM), etc., which is read by and written to by removable storage unit . As will be appreciated, the removable storage unit  includes a computer usable storage medium having stored therein computer software and\/or data. The removable storage drive  reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit  in a well known manner. Removable storage unit , also called a program storage device or a computer program product, represents a floppy disk, magnetic tape, compact disk, etc.","Computer programs (also called computer control logic) are stored in main memory  and\/or the secondary memory . Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system  to perform the functions of the present invention as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor  to perform the functions of the present invention. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system . The Web annotation system  preferably represents a computer program executing in the computer system .","The computer system  also includes a communication interface . The communications interface  enables the computer system  to communicate and interact with locally or remotely located external devices  via a communications medium . In particular, communications interface  enables the computer system  to send and receive software and data to\/from the external devices . Examples of the communications interface  include a modem, a network interface (such as an Ethernet card), a communications port, etc.","The computer system  also includes a display unit , such as a computer monitor, and one or more input devices, such as a keyboard and a pointing device (such as a mouse, trackball, etc.).","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a system  as shown in , and having the functionality described herein. In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a computer program product having stored therein computer software (having the functionality described herein) for controlling computer systems, such as computer system . In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a system and method for transmitting and\/or receiving computer software (having the functionality described herein) to\/from external devices .","3.2. A Preferred Software Programming Language and Network Architecture","As discussed above, computer programs when executed, enable computer  to perform the functions of the present invention as discussed herein. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is implemented using computer programs written in an object-oriented programming language. Object-oriented programming is a type of programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.","One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify. To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming language (OOPL). C++ and Smalltalk are two of the more popular languages, and there are also object-oriented versions of Pascal. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented using computer programs written in an object-oriented programming language, the present invention can also be implemented using procedural programming languages, etc.","As discussed above, one or more of computers  is connected by a network. A preferred embodiment of the present invention uses a type of network architecture called a peer-to-peer object architecture. Before peer-to-peer object architecture can be understood, a type of network architecture called client\/server architecture must be described. Client\/server architecture is a network architecture in which each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server. Servers are computers or processes dedicated to managing disk drives (file servers), printers (print servers), applications\/functions or network traffic (network servers). In fact, a server is any computer or device that allocates resources for an application. Clients are personal computers or workstations on which users run applications. Clients rely on servers for resources, such as files, devices, execution of functions and even processing power.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00160","num":"00160"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7C"],"b":["702","704","706","706","708","708","708","704","7","708","710","710","710","702","710","708"]},"At this point, as shown in , there is two-way communication between the client and the server (i.e., between the two piers) through comm object  and comm object . Init object  knows which receiver object needs to be created by the server (i.e., receiving pier) to preform the specific task required. Therefore, once this communication is established, init object  sends a request to the server (i.e., receiving pier) to create the specific receiver object. In , switchboard object  receives the request, via comm object , and creates receiver object . Once receiver object  is created, comm object  is relocated to receiver object  in FIG. H. Now, as shown in , init object  and receiver object , via comm object  and comm object , can communicate back and forth until receiver object  completes the task requested by init object .","As stated above, a preferred embodiment of the present invention uses a type of network architecture called a peer-to-peer object architecture. A peer-to-peer object architecture is when each computer in the network has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. This differs from client\/server architectures, in which some computers are dedicated to serving the others. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, all computers  can operate as either a server or a client.","As discussed above, one advantage of using an object-oriented programming language is that it allows programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. This advantage will be further illustrated as the present invention is described in detail.","4. Features and Capabilities of the Present Invention","In one embodiment of the present invention, Web annotation system  is implemented as computer  operating as described in reference to  above. Computer  executes computer programs to enable it to perform the features and capabilities (or functions) of the present invention. Thus, Web annotation system  executes computer programs to perform its functions. As discussed above, the computer programs executed by Web annotation system  are preferably written in an object-oriented programming language and executed in a peer-to-peer object architecture.","An advantage of any object-oriented program, and thus also with computer programs executed by Web annotation system , is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not have to be changed when a new type of object is added. An object includes both the data and functions required to perform a task. Thus, by implementing the functions to be performed by Web annotation system  as objects, created modules do not need to be changed when a new type of object (or function) is added. This implementation of the present invention reduces complexity and thus increases efficiency.","Described above with reference to , is the dynamic steps involved in establishing communication between a client and a server executing an object-oriented program. As Web annotation system  of the present invention executes its various functions, the same dynamic steps involved in communication between the server and client occur for each function as shown in .  shows a generic init object  and a generic receiver object . For each type of function performed by Web annotation system , init object  and receiver object  are replaced by specific init and receiver objects that perform their specific functions.","The types of functions performed by Web annotation system , through the execution of computer software, note\/sub-note organization, linking sub-notes to Web pages, viewing notes, sub-notes and Web pages, editing note\/sub-note organization, and so forth. For simplicity, the figures used to illustrate the individual functions of Web annotation system  do not include switchboard object  and listen object  of FIG. .","The functionality of the present invention implemented as objects shall be further described by reference to FIG. .  is a high level view of the functional objects of the Web annotation system  in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The functional objects are organized in a hierarchical fashion and each functional object contains a data object wrapper that supports a COM interface and a data object. Referring to , the functional objects include a Web annotation system object , a note repository object , a note object , a sub-note object , a content object , an anchor object , a Web page repository object , a Web page folder object , and a Web page object . The content object  stores data that conveys information. This data is user definable and includes at least information that explains the rationale for linking the sub-note object  to a portion of the Web page object . The data stored in the content object  can be any format or combination of formats, such as text, sound, video, image, executable program, tactile (such as braille), etc. The anchor object  is linked by a bookmark link  to a portion of the Web page object . According to the present invention, the bookmark link  is bi-directional.","Each note object  preferably contains data including its title, the date and time of creation, the data and time of last modification, a listing of all of its sub-notes, etc. Each sub-note object  also preferably stores data including its title, the date and time of creation, the data and time of last modification, its content object, its anchor object, privacy settings, etc. The anchor object  contains data indicating the color and which pen was highlighted when the pointer was used to select the selected portion to which the sub-note is linked. The anchor object  also stores data representing the data object that the sub-note object  is linked with. This data may include a URL for non-cached Web pages and a filename for cached Web pages, a frame index array to the frame that contains the annotation, apiece of data (e.g., TextRange bookmark) that describes a text selection on the given frame of the given Web page, pixels that get printed to a screen, etc.","A frame index array is a collection of indexes that specify a frame. For example, a simple Web page may contain only one frame. The present invention would indicate this with an empty frame index array. Another example for a Web page that has three frames, and it is the second frame that is annotated by the present invention, the frame index array contains the number 1. (Note that arrays start with an index of 0). Once the frame is specified, the present invention may utilize at least four different ways to specify the selected text. An preferred way is through the use of a TextRange. A TextRange can be created from the current selection. A TextRange can be persisted to a \u201cbookmark\u201d (such as bookmark link ), which is an opaque piece of data that represents the TextRange. This can be used to store the TextRange at a later time. In another embodiment, the present invention maintains a character offset to the start of the range, and then the number of characters in the TextRange. In yet another embodiment, the present invention maintains a collapsed TextRange bookmark to start the selected text or portion, and the number of characters in the TextRange. In yet another embodiment, the present invention maintains a collapsed TextRange bookmark to the start of the selected text or portion, and another collapsed TextRange bookmark to the end of the selected text.","Conceptually, note repository object , note object , sub-note object , content object , and anchor object  make up the notes database  (FIG. ). Likewise, Web page repository object , Web page folder object , and Web page object  conceptually make up Web pages database .","The user interface  creates, updates, and deletes objects in the Web annotation system  preferably using the COM interfaces. In order to do this, the user interface  must first gain access to a functional object through the top level object, namely the Web annotation system object . The Web annotation system object  can return to the user interface  the note repository object  and\/or the Web page repository object . Once the user interface  has either the note repository object  or the Web page repository object , it can use either of these (based on its interface) to: navigate to other objects, create child objects, remove child objects, and modify child objects.","Each of the functional objects - shown in  preferably follows a pattern of implementation as shown in FIG. . In , the user interface  uses a COM interface  to access a generic functional object  (same as described above). The functional object  contains a data object wrapper  that supports the COM interface  and a data object  that can be stored in either a flat file  or a database . The functional object  uses the data access interface  to access the data object . In theory, the data access interface  could go across a network connection to access the data object , or it could access the data object  stored physically on the same computer. The present invention includes a multitude of functions which enable it to achieve the advantages discussed herein. Many of these functions are discussed in the following sections.","4.1 Note\/Sub-Note Organization","The present invention supports a note\/sub-note hierarchy, where a note may include zero or more sub-notes. This is shown in , for example, where Note A includes Sub-notes A, B, and C. Note B includes Sub-notes B and C (dashed line B is discussed below), Note C includes Sub-notes B, D, and E, and Note D includes Sub-notes E and F.","The note\/sub-note hierarchy is useful for organizing information. In particular, the note\/sub-note hierarchy allows users to group together related sub-notes for organization purposes. Related sub-notes may be grouped together under one note.","The note\/sub-note hierarchy is extendable to multiple levels. For example, related notes can be grouped together under a note grouping. In essence, a note itself is also an implementation of a note grouping because a note can contain other notes (or sub-notes). In , for example, Notes A and B are grouped together under Note Grouping A. Notes B, C, and D are grouped together under Note Grouping B. The sharing of Note B between Note Grouping A and Note Grouping B is one embodiment of the present invention. In another embodiment, notes and\/or sub-notes are not shared. It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the three level hierarchy shown in the example of FIG. . The invention is extendable to more than three levels.","The note\/sub-note hierarchy of the invention is very flexible. Multiple note groupings may include the same note. For example, both Note Groupings A and B include Note B. Also, multiple notes may include the same sub-note. For example, Notes A, B, and C include Sub-note B.","The note\/sub-note hierarchy is defined by users. That is, users define which notes are contained in note groupings, and which sub-notes are contained in notes. The invention includes tools for enabling users to define and modify the note\/sub-note hierarchy (such tools are discussed below).","4.2 Linking Sub-Notes To Web Pages","The present invention allows users to link sub-notes to portions of data object, preferably Web pages. In , for example, Sub-note A is linked to a portion of Web Page A via link . As discussed above, a Web page (or data object) represents any information in any form that can be accessed and\/or processed by a computer via the Internet. The Web pages generated and processed by these applications and devices vary widely in subject matter. Also, these Web pages (or data objects in general) come in many forms, such as text files, image files, video files, audio files, computer programs, HTML documents, etc. Accordingly, these Web pages are disparate in both form and content.","Users can navigate from sub-notes to Web pages via the links. For example, a user can navigate from Sub-note A to Web Page A via link .","The links between sub-notes and Web pages are bi-directional. Thus, in addition to being able to navigate from sub-notes to Web pages via the links, users can also navigate from Web pages to sub-notes via the links. For example, a user can navigate from Web Page A to Sub-note A via link .","A note or sub-note may be linked to all or any portion of a Web page. (In the discussion contained herein, attributes of sub-notes also apply to notes.) Multiple sub-notes may be linked to portions of the same Web page. This is true, whether the sub-notes are in the same or different notes. These Web page portions may be completely overlapping, partially overlapping, or non-overlapping. Also, the sub-notes in a note may be linked to portions of a single Web page, or to portions of one or more Web pages.","A Web page may be linked to one or more sub-notes (these sub-notes may be in the same note, or in multiple notes). In , for example, Web page A is linked to Sub-notes A, C, and D.","Users can navigate from sub-notes in a first note to sub-notes in a second note via common Web pages. In , for example, a user can navigate from Sub-note A in Note A to Sub-note D in Note C via Web Page A, which is linked to both Sub-note A (via link ) and Sub-note D (via link ).","The linking capabilities of the present invention shall be further described by reference to an example scenario presented in FIG. . The Web annotation system  in the example of  includes notes A and B (these notes are stored in the notes database , which is not explicitly shown in FIG. ). Each note  includes a plurality of sub-notes .","Each sub-note  is linked to a Web page . Each Web page  is associated with one or more applications . A Web page  is associated with an application  if the application  is capable of accessing and\/or processing the Web page . More particularly, each sub-note  is linked to a portion  of a Web page . A portion  may include all or part of a Web page . Portions  in the same Web page  that are linked to sub-notes  may be distinct (non-overlapping), may completely overlap, or may partially overlap.","For purposes of illustration, it is assumed herein that each Web page is associated with a single computer program application. This association between Web pages and applications may be established in any well known manner, such as by file extension. For example, all files having a \u201cwpd\u201d extension are as a default associated with the WORD PERFECT word processing application, all files having a \u201cwks\u201d extension are as a default associated with the LOTUS 1-2-3 spreadsheet application, all files having a \u201cdb\u201d extension are as a default associated with the PARADOX database application, etc. These default associations between Web pages and applications are preferably user definable. Preferably, users may override these default associations at the time that a sub-note is linked with a Web page, or at any time thereafter.","A note  may contain sub-notes  that are linked to portions  of a single Web page , or multiple Web pages . These Web pages  may be associated with a single application , or with multiple applications . For example, note A includes sub-notes A, B, C that are linked to portions A, C, B, respectively, of Web pages A, B that are associated with application A. Note A also includes a sub-note D that is linked to portion D of object C associated with application B.","Multiple sub-notes  in the same or different notes  may be linked to the same portion  of a Web page . For example, sub-notes D and F are linked to portion D of object C.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a note  is not a Web page. In another embodiment of the present invention, a note  represents a Web page. Accordingly, a sub-note  may be linked to a portion of a note . For example, sub-note E is linked to portion F of note B. Portion F includes sub-note G.","Each sub-note  includes a content data that is used to convey information. The content data are user definable. Preferably, the content data includes at least information that explains the rationale for linking the sub-note  to the portion  of the Web page . For example, the content field  could include a description of how the portions  linked to the sub-notes  in the note  are related to one another. The content field  can be any format or combination of formats, such as text, sound, video, image, executable program, tactile (such as braille), etc.","The mechanism for linking portions  of Web pages  with sub-notes  is generally represented in  as links . According to the present invention, this linking mechanism  is bi-directional. Thus, a user viewing portion B of Web page A can issue a command to view sub-note C. Also, a user viewing sub-note D can issue a command to automatically launch application B, load Web page C, and view portion D.","The linking mechanism  of the present invention enables users to easily traverse through related Web pages , and through sub-notes . For example, a user could command the Web annotation system  to display the note A. From note A, the user could move from sub-note A to portion A and back again, from sub-note B to portion B and back again, etc. Accordingly, the notes  and sub-notes  represent a trail through portions  in Web pages .","The lining mechanism  of the present invention enables users to access portions  of Web pages  in any order. This represents random access technology. For example, a user can access in any order the portions  of Web pages  linked to the sub-notes  in the note A. In this respect, the invention is superior to conventional mechanisms for linking documents, such as that shown in , where documents must be accessed in a predefined order. Such conventional mechanisms represent sequential or linear access technology. Thus, the trail through documents provided by the linking mechanism  of the present invention is much more flexible and user-friendly than the trail provided by conventional linking mechanisms.","One or more notes can be grouped together under one note grouping. A note grouping table  or other database construct is used to keep track of which notes are in which note groupings. In the example of , notes A and B are in Note Grouping A. Each note  preferably includes information that identifies which Note Grouping it is in, such that it is possible to traverse from a note to a note grouping, and vice versa. This is described further below. Further levels of organization are also supported by the invention, using the same or extensions of the organizational constructs (note groupings, notes, sub-notes, links, etc.) discussed herein.","The note\/sub-note hierarchy feature and the linking feature of the invention as described above collectively provide at least two ways to organize information, and to memorialize\/institutionalize a person or group's thinking and work product. First, the Web annotation system  provides a note\/sub-note hierarchy. The note\/sub-note hierarchy allows users to group together related sub-notes for organization purposes. That is, related sub-notes may be grouped together under one note. The grouping together of related sub-notes conveys to a certain extent the rationale for the linking together of Web pages .","Second, the Web annotation system  provides a means for explicitly documenting the trail through Web pages  as established by the linking mechanism . Such documentation is achieved by the sub-notes . As discussed above, each sub-note  includes a content field  () that is used to convey information. The content field  preferably includes at least information that explains the rationale for linking the sub-note  to the portion  of the Web page . Thus, the rationale for the trail established by the linking mechanism  is explicitly explained by the information contained in the sub-notes .","Note that there is no guarantee that a Web page stored on a Web site is not changed or even deleted. Thus, there is no guarantee that the information stored by the present invention for the linked portion of a Web page is valid if the user does not use the caching function provided by the present invention. If the user does not use the caching function, there are ways in which the present invention checks to ensure a Web page has not changed, including utilizing a checksum, comparing the \u201clast modified\u201d date that is returned on the Web page access to the \u201clast modified\u201d date that the present invention is expecting.","4.3 Examples of Note\/Sub-Note Organization and Linking Sub-Notes To Web Pages","The note\/sub-note hierarchy feature and the linking feature of the invention shall now be further described in this section by the use of examples.

In the present invention, the term \u201cmenu\u201d is used to describe property sheets, herein. Referring to , from the file menu , the user can access functions provided by the Web annotation system  for manipulating notes and sub-notes. These functions include creating a new note, creating a new sub-note, importing a note or sub-note, exporting a note or sub-note, sending notes and sub-notes to another person, printing the notes and sub-notes, and exiting the Web annotation system . Here, the user is able to send via e-mail a copy of portions of the note database  to other users by using a \u201csend to\u201d command in the file menu .

This causes the Web annotation system  to display Note A and the associated sub-note in the notes\/Web page directory window  and the notes text window .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00228","num":"00228"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 227"],"b":["21","1210","1110","11","2202","1208","502","1208","2202","1210","1110","502","1110","1112","1110","1110","1112","1212","2206","1214","2208","2202","2204","502","2204","2208","2202","2204","2208"]},"Note that this second sub-note is added to existing Note A, because Note A was being displayed when the user selected text . Also note that selected text  overlaps with selected text . The present invention allows portions in a Web page that are to be linked with sub-notes to be distinct, to partially overlap, or to completely overlap. Such functionality of the invention enables users to precisely associate sub-notes with portions in Web pages.","Sub-notes in a note can be linked to portions of Web pages associated with different applications. This is done in a similar manner as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,079, incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the invention can be used to mark or \u201cbookmark\u201d text based and non-text based Web pages for fast reference and retrieval.","As will be apparent from the foregoing, the Web annotation system  can operate with any application that supports the interface  (FIG. ). The interface  preferably uses the JScript and DHTML standards. Both of these standards are also based on the COM. It should be understood, however, that the Web annotation system  is not limited to use with the JScript and DHTML standards. The Web annotation system  can be used with any standard that allows one software application to interact with another.","4.4 Viewing Notes, Sub-Notes, and Data Objects","In a preferred embodiment, the present invention supports a view mode for displaying the contents of the notes database  that is designed to be like a sheet of paper that the user can write his notes on. Other view modes that the present invention supports include a note centric view, an object centric view, and a link centric view, all of which are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,079.","The view mode designed to be like a sheet of paper is further described with reference to FIG. . The present invention maintains the notes in the order in which the user created them (unless reordered by the user as will be described below). Referring to , the order in which the user created the notes is maintained in the notes\/Web page directory window  and the notes text window . Note that this is true, regardless of the order of the links and their associated text in the Web page window .","4.5 Editing Note\/Sub-Note Organization","The invention includes many flexible features and functions for modifying and replicating the note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchy. These are described below.","4.5.1 Modification","The invention enables users to modify the note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchy. In other words, the invention enables users to switch or copy notes from one note grouping to another, or switch or copy sub-notes from one note to another.","One way in which a user can modify the note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchy is move sub-note from one note to another by using well known copy\/cut and paste operations (via the cut, paste, and delete commands on the edit menu  (FIG. )). Also, a user can change the linkage and\/or order between sub-notes and Web page portions by clicking and dragging the linking buttons.","4.5.2 Replication","A great deal of time and effort may go into the creation of a note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchical database. Typically, a database is specific to a particular task or project. However, it is often the case that parts of a database are applicable to another task or project. For efficiency purposes, users would like to reuse a database generated for one project to the extent possible in another project. Users may also want to e-mail copies of notes and sub-notes to other users. The invention provides powerful tools for enabling a user to identify and replicate portions of an existing database that may be relevant to another project. These replicated portions constitute the foundation of a new hierarchical database.","In some cases, a user may already know which parts of a database are pertinent to another project. In such cases, the user may select those parts and replicate (copy) them to a new database. Here, the user may select just those parts and e-mail a copy of them to one of more users. As discussed above with reference to FIG.  and file menu , the user is able to send via e-mail a copy of portions of the note database  to other users by using a \u201csend to\u201d command in the file menu . If the user sends an e-mail to another user, the recipient gets copies of all of the notes and Web pages necessary to display the information that is sent. The user can also save AWN (Aurigin Web Note) files. These files can be generated using the \u201cexport\u201d command in the file menu . Here, the \u201csent to\u201d command simply mails an AWN file to the other user.","In other cases, the user does not know which parts of a database are pertinent to another project. In these cases, the user can use the invention's searching capabilities to identify note groupings, notes, sub-notes, and\/or Web page portions that are relevant to this other project. The user can then replicate these identified note groupings, notes, sub-notes, and Web page portions to a new database.  illustrates a new database that was created based on a search conducted on the example database of FIG. . The invention supports searching based on key words, date\/time of creation\/modification, creator, icon tags, color, shape, Web page title, note title, content, etc. The searching capabilities of the invention are discussed below.","4.6 User Interface","As discussed above, the Web annotation system  includes a user interface . Referring to , the user interface  enables a user  to interact with the notes database  and source material , representing Web pages (these Web pages may be stored in Web pages database ). The user  interacts with the user interface  so as to create note groupings, notes, and sub-notes, establish and modify the note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchy, establish and modify the links between sub-notes and Web page portions, and in all other ways interact with the notes database  and the source material .","It is very important that the user interface  provide the user  with an easy to use (i.e., user friendly) interface to the notes database , the source material , and to the features and functions provided by the Web annotation system . If the user interface  is user friendly, then the user  is more likely to utilize the Web annotation system  to document his thinking and work product.","The user interface  may be implemented using any user interface tools, approaches, techniques, technology and\/or applications that currently exist, or that will be developed in the future. In one embodiment, the user interface  is implemented as a computer based graphical user interface (GUI). Example screen shots from this GUI are shown in .","In another embodiment, the user interface  is implemented in whole or in part using virtual reality (VR) technology. Significant VR technology has been developed, and more is currently being developed. Virtual reality is discussed in many publicly available documents, such as , edited by Alan Wexelblat, Academic Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, and , Sams Publishing, Carmel, Ind., 1993 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entities.","It should be understood, however, that the invention is adapted and intended to operate with other user interface technology that currently exists, or that will be developed in the future.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00250","num":"00250"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 26"],"b":["2602","2602","2604","2604"]},"In the example of , the user selects a book  from a library . The user opens the book  until a passage  of interest is found. The user selects this passage  and then links this passage  to a sub-note  in Note A. Such linkage may automatically occur upon the selection of the passage  (since such selection results in the creation of sub-note , and in the creation of the link between sub-note  and the passage , as described above). Alternatively, the user can link passage  with sub-note  by moving the hand  from the passage  to the sub-note .","The user can enter comments into the sub-note  using any input mechanism or procedure, such as typing on a real or virtual keyboard, audibly dictating the comments, etc.","Any of the displays and screen shots discussed herein, such as those shown in , can be displayed and manipulated in the VR world. The user can manipulate the items and objects in those displays via the VR hand  or any other virtual construct, instead of or in addition to a computer (physical or virtual) keyboard and mouse. The combination of the Web annotation system  with virtual reality creates a very powerful, user friendly application.","In the discussion herein, the user is often said to issue a command, press a button, select an option from a menu, review a computer display, input\/key in information or commands, or perform some other type of action that requires interaction with the computer. It should be understood that, according to the present invention, such interaction can be achieved using any type of user interface, including a conventional computer interface (using a keyboard and mouse, for example), or a virtual reality interface, as just described above.","4.7 Security","In one embodiment of the present invention, security is not addressed. Yet in another embodiment, the invention may include many functions, features, and capabilities to maintain the security of the information contained in the note database . These security features can generally be categorized as follows: (1) security on individual note groupings, notes, sub-notes, links, and objects; and (2) security of the note database  as a whole. These two security features are discussed below.","4.7.1 Security on Individual Note Groupings, Notes, Sub-notes, Links, and Web pages","A person, group, or organization may wish to limit access to note groupings, notes, sub-notes, links, and\/or Web pages. Only people or groups who satisfy some specified criteria would have access to such note groupings, notes, sub-notes, links, and\/or Web pages. The present invention supports features for securing individual note groupings, notes, sub-notes, links, and Web pages.","A note grouping, note, sub-note, link, or Web page may be secured based on a number of criteria, including creator, owner, password, security level, or any other well known security criteria. For example, if a sub-note is secured based on the creator criteria, then only the creator may access the sub-note. If a sub-note is secured based on password, then only persons who have the correct password may access the sub-note. If a sub-note is secured based on security level, then only persons having the appropriate security level will have access to the sub-note.","In one embodiment, a person or group who satisfies the current security criteria for a note grouping, note, sub-note, link, or Web page may modify the security criteria for the note grouping, note, sub-note, link, or Web page. In other embodiments, only persons or groups who have satisfy a specified, alternate security criteria (such as administrators) may change existing security criteria.","If a note grouping is secured, then only persons who satisfy the specified criteria may gain access to the note grouping, and the notes, sub-notes, and connectors\/links contained in the note grouping.","If a note is secured, then only persons who satisfy the specified criteria may gain access to the note, and the sub-notes and connectors\/links contained in the note.","If a sub-note is secured, then only persons who satisfy the specified criteria may gain access to the sub-note, and the link contained in the note.","If a link (that links a sub-note to a Web page portion) or a connector (that establishes the note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchy) is secured, then only persons who satisfy the specified criteria may gain access- to and traverse the link\/connector.","This effect of security is illustrated in the example of FIG. . Note A is displayed in a note window . It is assumed that Note A is not secured, or that the current user satisfies the security criteria associated with Note A. Note A includes Sub-notes A, B, and C. It is assumed that Sub-notes A and B are not secured, or that the current user satisfies the security criteria respectively associated with Sub-notes A and B. Accordingly, Sub-notes A and B are displayed. Sub-note C is secured. However, the current user does not satisfy the security criteria of Sub-note C. Thus, Sub-note C is not displayed.","It is assumed that the current user satisfies the security criteria respectively associated with link . Thus, the link  is active. The current user may manipulate and traverse link . Thus, the Web page associated with link  is displayed in application window . The current user does not satisfy the security criteria of link . Thus, link  is inactive. The current user may not manipulate or traverse link . Thus, the Web page associated with link  is not displayed. It is irrelevant whether the current user does or does not satisfy the security criteria of link . In either case, link  is inactive since its Sub-note C is inactive (in other embodiments, the security state of a link is separate and distinct from the security state of its sub-note).","4.7.2 Security on the Note Database as a Whole","According to some embodiments of the present invention, the notes database  is stored in a single computer. In other embodiments of the present invention, the notes database  is distributed among multiple databases. Procedures and technology for distributing the notes database , and for working with the distributed notes database , will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).","In some circumstances, the distribution of the notes database  is advantageous for implementation, performance, and robustness reasons. The motivations and advantages of distributed database systems in this regard are well known.","According to the present invention, the notes database  is also distributed for security reasons. In some situations, it is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and secrecy of the notes database . Distributing the notes database  aids in this effort, and it ensures that the inadvertent or improper disclosure of one part of the notes database  maintained at one site does not result in the disclosure of the other parts of the notes database  at other sites.","In some cases, it is critical that the linkage information contained in the notes database  be kept secret. The present invention utilizes techniques in addition to the data distribution approached described above to secure the linkage information in the notes database . These additional techniques also relate to data distribution.","In particular, the present invention preferably partitions the notes database  into a note information database  and a note\/object linking information database . The note\/object linking information database  contains the linkage information that specifies how sub-notes are linked to Web page portions. The note information database  includes all information about notes and sub notes except for the linkage information.","The note information database  is distributed among a first set of sites. The note\/object lining information database  is distributed among a second set of sites. The first and second sets of sites may be the same, may be completely different, or may be partially the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00274","num":"00274"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["2406","2804","2808","2408","2806","2810","2812","2820"]},"The invention uses other techniques for securing the notes database . In some embodiments, for example, all or part of the notes database  is encrypted. For example, references contained in the note information database  to the note\/object linking information database  are encrypted using any well known encryption mechanism or algorithm, such as key encryption. Encryption of the notes database  is further described below.","4.8 Search Capabilities","The invention supports powerful search features for identifying note groupings, notes, sub-notes, links, and\/or Web pages that satisfy user supplied search criteria. Users can perform key word searches, searches based on date\/time of creation or modification, searches based on icon tagging (icons can be predefined or user defined), searches based on creator or owner, searches based on security\/privacy levels, color, shape, Web page title, etc. Preferably, sub-notes are indexed and searchable. Also, fields (predefined or user defined) within note groupings, notes, and sub-notes are indexed and searchable.","The user can limit the search to a user-defined path through the note\/sub-note hierarchy (for example, the user can limit the search to a path that starts with a user specified note grouping, note, sub-note, link, etc.).","The operation of the search capabilities of the present invention are described further below.","5. Notes Database","A detailed implementation of the notes database  according to an embodiment of the present invention shall now be described. As stated above, with reference to , the notes database  (as well as the Web pages database ) are implemented as functional objects. Conceptually, note repository object , note object , sub-note object , content object , and anchor object  make up the notes database . The content object  stores data that conveys information. These data are user definable and includes at least information that explains the rationale for linking the sub-note object  to a portion of the Web page object . The data stored in the content object  can be any format or combination of formats, such as text, sound, video, image, executable program, tactile (such as braille), etc. The anchor object  is linked by a bookmark link  to the Web page object . According to the present invention, the bookmark link  is bi-directional.","Each note object  contains data including its title, the date and time of creation, the data and time of last modification, a listing of all of its sub-notes, etc. Each sub-note object  also contains data including its title, the date and time of creation, the data and time of last modification, its content object, its anchor object, privacy settings, etc. The anchor object contains data including the color and which pen was highlighted when the pointer  was used to select the selected portion to which the sub-note is linked, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00283","num":"00283"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 8","FIG. 5"],"b":["508","504","502","504","802","802","504","804","814","504","804","814"]},"In , the note repository object  includes three note objects, namely a note A object A, a note B object B, and a note C object C. The note A object A is comprised of two sub-note objects, namely sub-note object A and sub-note object B. The sub-note object A comprises a content object A and an anchor object A. The sub-note object B comprises a content object B and an anchor object B.","The note B object B is also comprised of two sub-note objects, namely sub-note object C and sub-note object D. The sub-note object C comprises a content object C and an anchor object C. The sub-note object D comprises a content object D and an anchor object D.","The note C object C is comprised of three sub-note objects, namely sub-note object E, sub-note object F, and sub-note object G. The sub-note object E comprises a content object E and an anchor object E. The sub-note object F comprises a content object F and an anchor object F. The sub-note object G comprises a content object G and an anchor object G.","In order to more fully explain the notes database  (and the relationship between notes and portions of Web pages of the present invention), an example Web pages database  is also shown in FIG. . As stated above with reference to , Web page repository object , Web page folder object , and Web page object  conceptually make up Web pages database . In , Web page repository object  includes two Web page folders, namely Web page folder object A and Web page folder object B. The Web page folder object A comprises a Web page object A, a Web page object B, and a Web page object C. The Web page folder object B comprises a Web page object D and a Web page object E.","Bookmark links will next be discussed with reference to FIG. . Note that in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the bookmark links are bi-directional links. A bookmark link A links together the sub-note object A (and its content object A) with the portion of a Web page it relates to, namely a portion of the Web page object E. A bookmark link B links together the sub-note object B with a portion of the Web page object D. In a similar manner, a bookmark link C also links together the sub-note object C to a portion of the Web page object D. Note that sub-note object B and sub-note object C are both linked to the same Web page object D. The portion of Web page object D that sub-note object B and sub-note object C are linked to can be the same portion, can be different portions, or can be two portions that overlap.","A bookmark link D links together the sub-note object D with a portion of the Web page object C, a bookmark link E links together the sub-note object E with a portion of the Web page object B, a bookmark link F links together the sub-note object F with a portion of the Web page object B, and finally, a bookmark link G links together the sub-note object G with a portion of the Web page object A.","The notes database  could be implemented in ways other than that shown in , and described above. In particular, the notes database  could be implemented using any well known data structure or organization. Various data structures are described in many publicly available documents, such as Niklaus Wirth, , Prentice Hall, 1976, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","6. Operation of the Invention","The operation of the present invention shall now be described with reference to a flowchart  shown in FIG. . Flowchart  illustrates the manner in which a user interacts with the Web annotation system  to organize Web pages, and to manipulate notes attached to portions of Web pages.","Such user interaction with the Web annotation system  is preferably achieved through interaction with a user interface  that forms part of the Web annotation system . As apparent from the discussion below, the user interface  of the present invention is very powerful and flexible. In particular, the user interface  allows users to access the functionality of the Web annotation system  in any number of ways. Accordingly, the operational steps shown in flowchart  and in other flowcharts discussed below represent one way (i.e., one operational sequence) of accessing the functions provided by the Web annotation system . Users may access and traverse the functions provided by the Web annotation system  in any number of other ways via interaction with the menus provided by the user interface . Such other ways (Le., such other operational sequences) will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).","In step , the user issues a command to an operating system executing in the computer system . The user may issue this command via a keyboard or a well known point-and-click approach, or via a body gesture, thought, or voice command when using a VR user interface, or via any other well known means for entering a command.","If the user issued a command to launch an application, then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to create a new note\/sub-note, and this command was issued using the file menu , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to create a new note\/sub-note, and this command was issued using a pen (such as pen A in ) or VR hand  or the like, then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to view a note, and this command was issued by selecting a linking button in a Web page, then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to search a note, and this command was issued from the view menu  or search button , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to e-mail a copy of a portion of notes database , and this command was issued from the file menu , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to find a specified text in the current Web page via edit menu , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to modify the privacy\/security settings associated with a note grouping, note, sub-note, or link, then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to edit one or more notes via the edit menu  or by clicking on the appropriate area in the notes text window , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to show sub-notes in the notes\/Web page directory window  via view menu , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to toggle between viewing notes or Web pages in the notes\/Web page directory window  via view menu , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to change or view options via the view menu window , then control line  is taken. If the user issued a command to change or view properties via the view menu window , then control line  is taken. These control flows and commands are discussed below.","6.1 Launch an Application","If the user in step  issued a command to launch an application, then step  is performed.","In step , the operating system in the computer system  invokes the user-specified application in a well known manner. The application is preferably a Web browser, but may also be a word processing application, a spread sheet application, a database application, a communication application, a video\/audio processing application, a financial application, etc. The invoked application displays an application window. Typically, the user commands the application to load a Web page, and uses the application to process the Web page.","In the user interface environment of the present invention, control from step  may then flow to any number of directions. In some cases, control flows back to step , as shown in FIG. .","6.2 Create a Note\/Sub-note (From the File Menu)","One way for the user to issue a command to create a new note or sub-note is to open the file menu  (by pressing the file menu button ), and then select the \u201cNew Note\u201d function or the \u201cNew Sub-Note\u201d function. In response to this command, the Web annotation system  performs the steps of flowchart  in FIG. .","In step , the notes engine  of the Web annotation system  determines whether a note is currently highlighted in the computer display (i.e., the display unit ). That is, the notes engine  determines whether a note is currently active. If a note is not currently highlighted or active, then step  is performed. Otherwise, step  is performed.","In step , the notes engine  determines whether the user has issued a command to highlight a different note (i.e., deactivate the note that was currently being highlighted). The user issues such a command if he wishes to insert the new sub-note in a new note, as opposed to the currently active note. If the notes engine  determines that the user has not issued a command to deactivate the note that is currently being highlighted, then step  is performed (described below). In step , the note currently being highlighted is called the active note for reference purposes. Otherwise, step  is performed.","In step , the notes engine  closes or deactivates the note.","In step , the notes engine  creates a new note. As represented by a flowchart  in , the notes engine  creates a new note by creating and storing a new note object (such as note object  in ) in the notes database  (step ). The notes engine  adds the new note object to the note repository object  (step ). Procedures for adding data to an object are well known. The notes engine  in step  initializes the new note object by storing its title in the note object (this name is preferably entered by the user). At this point, the Web annotation system  may also prompt the user for security\/privacy settings for the new note object. Any security\/privacy settings input by the user are also stored in the new note object.","Also at this point, the Web annotation system  may receive from the user a command identifying a notes group (either existing or new) to which the Web annotation system  should add the new note object. If the user provides this information, then the Web annotation system  modifies the note grouping table  () accordingly.","Referring again to , also in step , the user interface  displays the new note (i.e., note object) in the notes\/Web page directory window  and the notes text window . The new note is called the active note for reference purposes.","In step , the notes engine  creates a new sub-note. As indicated in a flowchart  in , the notes engine  creates a new sub-note by creating a new sub-note object (such as sub-note object  in ) in step . In step , the notes engine  generates a sub-note identifier for the new sub-note object. The sub-note identifier is unique among all sub-note objects. The sub-note identifier may be composed of the title of the note (i.e., the active note) concatenated with the current date\/time stamp. Other procedures for deriving the sub-note identifier could alternatively be used.","In step , the notes engine  stores the sub-note identifier in the sub-note object. The notes engine  also stores information identifying the new sub-note object in the note object. In step , the notes engine  adds the new sub-note object to the active notes object's sub-note objects. At this point, the notes engine  may also receive a command from the user indicating the privacy\/security setting of the new sub-note object. If the user enters this information, then the notes engine  stores the privacy\/setting of the new sub-note object in the sub-note object.","Referring again to , the user interface  in step  enables the user to link the new sub-note to a portion of a Web page. It may be necessary for the user to open the Web page in a well known manner prior to the performance of step . Alternatively, the Web page may already have been opened by the user. In any case, in step , the user selects one of the pen buttons  in order to obtain a pen. The user then uses this pen to activate the pointer  (in the manner discussed above) to select a portion of the Web page. Procedures for selecting portions of Web pages are well known. The procedure for selecting a portion of a Web page is dependent on the application associated with the Web page. The notes engine  commands the application associated with the Web page to color code the selected portion using the color associated with the pen.","In step , the notes engine  links the selected portion of the Web page object to the new sub-note object. In step , the notes engine  updates the displays of the Web page and the active note so as to graphically reflect this linkage. The notes engine  performs steps  and  in the manner shown in a flowchart  of FIG. .","In step , the notes engine  stores information identifying the Web page in the sub-note object. This information may be the file name of the Web page, for example. The notes engine  may also store in the sub-note object information identifying the application associated with the Web page. The notes engine  may obtain the information to be stored in the sub-note object by querying the application associated with the Web page.","In step , the notes engine  stores in the new sub-note object information that identifies the location of the selected portion in the Web page. If the Web page is a text document, for example, then this information may comprise page and line information. The notes engine  preferably obtains this location identification information by querying the application associated with the Web page. Also in step , the notes engine  stores in the sub-note object information that indicates the range of the selected portion in the Web page.","As discussed above, in some embodiments the object identifier data, the location identifier data, and the range data are partitioned into the note\/object linking information database  (along with any link privacy settings). All other information is stored in the note information database .","In step , the notes engine  stores in the sub-note object's anchor object the pen data that identifies the pen that the user used in step  to select a portion of the Web page. Preferably, the notes engine  stores pen data identifying the color of the pen, and the symbol associated with the pen. In one embodiment of the present invention, the notes engine  may store privacy\/security settings information for the sub-note and\/or the link, if the user enters this information.","In step , the notes engine  commands the application associated with the Web page to display a linking button proximate or adjacent to the selected portion. The linking button is displayed using the color of the pen used to select this selected portion, and using the symbol associated with this color (see FIG. ). The notes engine  associates the sub-note identifier for the new sub-note with this linking button. In this manner, the notes engine  can locate the new sub-note if the user presses the linking button (such operation is described below).","In step , the notes engine  displays a linking button (identical to that described in step ) in the notes\/Web page directory window  and the notes display window  for the note.","Referring again to , the user interface  in step  enables the user to enter information in the appropriate area in the notes display window  for the new sub-note. Such information can be of any format, such as text, sound, video, tactile, computer program, etc. The notes engine  stores this inform ation in the content object (such as content object  of ) of the new sub-note's object. The user may also enter privacy settings at this time for the note, sub-note, or link. The notes engine  stores any such information entered by the user in the appropriate locations of the sub-note object.","6.3 Create a Note\/Sub-note (Using a Pen)","Another way for the user to issue a command to create a new note or sub-note is to press one of the pen buttons , and then use the resulting pointer  to select a portion of the Web page currently being displayed. A new sub-note is then created and linked to this selected portion. This approach does not require the user to use the file menu . The operation of the Web annotation system  in accordance with this approach is re presented by a flowchart  shown in FIG. .","In step , the user selects one of the pen buttons  in order to obtain a pen. The user then uses this pen to activate the pointer  (in the manner discussed above) to select a portion of the Web page. The notes engine  commands the application associated with the Web page to color code the selected portion using the color associated with the pen.","In step , the notes engine  of the Web annotation system  determines whether a note is currently highlighted in the computer display (i.e., the display unit ). That is, the notes engine  determines whether a note is currently active. If a note is not currently highlighted or active, then step  is performed. Otherwise, step  is performed.","In step , the notes engine  determines whether the user has issued a command to highlight a different note (i.e., deactivate the note that was currently being highlighted). The user issues such a command if he wishes to insert the new sub-note in a new note, as opposed to the currently active note. If the notes engine  determines that the user has not issued a command to close the note that is currently being displayed, then step  is performed (described below). (In step , the note currently being displayed is called the active note for reference purposes.) Otherwise, step  is performed.","In step , the notes engine  deactivates the note.","In step , the notes engine  creates a new note. As represented above with reference to , the notes engine  creates a new note by creating and storing a new note object (such as note object  in ) in the notes database  (step ). The notes engine  adds the new note object to the note repository object  (step ). The notes engine  in step  initializes the new note object by storing its title in the note object (this name is preferably entered by the user). At this point, the Web annotation system  may also prompt the user for security\/privacy settings for the new note object. Any security\/privacy settings input by the user are also stored in the new note object. Also in step , the user interface  displays the new note (i.e., note object) in the notes\/Web page directory window  and the notes text window . The new note is called the active note for reference purposes.","In step , the notes engine  creates a new sub-note. As indicated above with reference to , the notes engine  creates a new sub-note by creating a new sub-note object (such as sub-note object  in ) in step .","In step , the notes engine  links the selected portion of the Web page to the new sub-note (in the manner discussed above).","In step , the notes engine  updates the displays of the Web page and the active note so as to graphically reflect this linkage (in the manner discussed above).","The user interface  in step  enables the user to enter information in the appropriate area in the notes display window  for the new sub-note (in the manner discussed above). Such information can be of any format, such as text, sound, video, tactile, computer program, etc. The notes engine  stores this information in the content object (such as content object  of ) of the new sub-note's object. Any security\/privacy settings entered by the user are also stored.","6.4 View Note (By Selecting a Linking Button in a Web Page)","One way for the user to issue a command to view an existing sub-note is to select (using the well known point-and-click approach) the linking button displayed proximate to the portion of the Web page that is linked to the sub-note. For example, in , the user can issue a command to view Sub-note A by selecting the linking button  next to the portion  of the Web page that is linked to Sub-note A. The operation of the Web annotation system  in this regard is represented by a flowchart  in FIG. .","In step , the user selects the linking button displayed proximate to the portion of the Web page of interest. For illustrative purposes, suppose that the user clicked on the linking button  corresponding to portion  of the Web page titled \u201caurigin.com\u201d (FIG. ).","In step , the notes engine  in response to this user action identifies the note and sub-note corresponding to linking button . The manner in which the notes engine  performs step  is represented by a flowchart  in FIG. . In step , the notes engine  identifies the sub-note identifier that is associated with the liking button . The linking button  preferably has stored with it the sub-note identifier (or some other type of reference or address to a sub-note). In step , the notes engine  searches in a well known manner through the notes database  until it locates the sub-note having the sub-note identifier determined in step . For illustrative purposes, assume that the notes engine  in step  determines that Sub-note B (see ) has the sub-note identifier determined in step .","In step , the notes engine  determines whether security\/privacy criteria associated with the link (corresponding to the linking button), the sub-note (identified in step ), and the note (identified in step ) are satisfied. The notes engine  retrieves this security\/privacy criteria information from the associated note node and sub-note node, and then compares the retrieved security\/privacy criteria information to the situation at hand. For example, if the security\/privacy criteria is keyed to the current user's password, then the notes engine  compares the password of the current user (which the current user previously entered, or is now asked to enter) with that retrieved from the note and\/or sub-note. If the security\/privacy criteria is not satisfied, then the user cannot view the note and\/or sub-note. If this is the case, then an error message is displayed in step . If the security\/privacy criteria is satisfied, then control flows to step .","In step , the notes engine  determines whether the note that includes the sub-note identified in step  is currently being displayed in the computer display. In the example discussed above, the notes engine  in step  determines whether Note B is currently being displayed in the computer display. If Note B is currently being displayed in the computer display, then control flows to step  (described below). Otherwise, step  is performed.","In step , the notes engine  displays in a notes display window  the note that includes the sub-note identified in step .","In step , the notes engine  scrolls through the note in the notes display window  until the sub-note identified in step  is displayed in the notes display window .","6.5 Search a Note","Referring again to , if the user issued a command to search a note, and this command was issued from the view menu  or search button , then control line  is taken. The operation of the Web annotation system  in accordance with function is represented by a flowchart  shown in FIG. . In step , the user clicks on the search button  or indicated via the view menu  that he would like to search notes for a specific text string.","In step , a search window is displayed. In step , the user types in the search window the text string to be searched for by the present invention. In step , the present invention searches the notes database  (specifically the content object  of each sub-note object  (FIG. )) for the indicated text string. In step , if the text string is not found, then control passes to step  where the present invention displays to the user that no matches were found. Alternatively, the control passes to step .","In step , the notes engine  scrolls through the note in the notes display window  until the sub-note identified in step  is displayed in the notes display window . In step , the notes engine  also displays the associated Web page.","6.6 E-mail Notes to a Recipient","Referring again to , if the user issued a command to e-mail a copy of a portion of notes database , and this command was issued from the file menu , then control line  is taken. The operation of the Web annotation system  in accordance with function is represented by a flowchart  shown in FIG. . In step , the user clicks indicates via the file menu  (by using the \u201csend to\u201d command) that he would like to e-mail a copy of a portion of notes database  and any associated Web pages to another user. In step , the present invention displays an e-mail window to the user.","In step , the user utilizes the e-mail window to indicate to the Web annotation system  the notes\/sub-notes he wants sent to an e-mail recipient. In step , the user indicates the recipient's e-mail address to the present invention. The user can also save AWN (Aurigin Web Note) files. These files can be generated using the \u201cexport\u201d command in the file menu . Here, the \u201csent to\u201d command simply mails an AWN file to the other user.","In step , the Web annotation system  generates an attachment that contains a copy of all of the notes\/sub-notes and their associated Web pages. Also in step , the Web annotation system  sends the attachment to the e-mail recipient.","In step , if the e-mail recipient's machine already has a copy of the present invention, control passes to step . Alternatively, control passes to step . In step , the present invention indicates to the recipient where he can download a copy of the present invention to his machine. Control then passes to step . In step , when the recipient clicks on the attachment sent by the present invention, the present invention automatically loads in the application to display the Web pages.","6.7 Find Specified Text in the Current Web Page","The user initiates a search for a text string in the current Web page by selecting the \u201cFind\u201d command in the edit menu . The operation of the Web annotation system  while performing searching is represented by a flowchart  in FIG. . In step , the user interface  enables the user to enter search criteria. The user enters the text string to search. The user can limit the search criteria by indicating whether to match \u201cwhole words only,\u201d case, and\/or how to search (up or down the Web page). In step , the notes engine  searches through the text of the current Web page (as limited by the user) to locate any and all text strings that satisfy the search criteria. In step , the user interface  highlights the first text string located in the current Web page. If no text strings are found, the present invention indicates this to the user.","6.8 Modify Privacy\/Security Settings","Flowchart  in  represents the operation of the invention when enabling the user to modify the privacy\/security settings associated with a note grouping, note, sub-note, or link.","In step , the user selects a note grouping, note, sub-note, or link using any of the selection procedures discussed herein.","In step , the Web annotation system  verifies that the privacy\/security criteria associated with the selected item is satisfied. Such verification is described above. If the privacy\/security criteria is not satisfied, then the user is not allowed to modify the privacy\/security settings. In this case, an error message is displayed in step . If the privacy\/security criteria is satisfied, then in step  the user is allowed to enter new privacy\/security settings for the selected item. This new privacy\/security setting is then stored.","6.9 Edit One or More Notes","The present invention allows users to modify the sub-notes that are in notes. For example, a user may rearrange the ordering of sub-notes within a note. The user can delete sub-notes from a note. The user can also copy (replicate) or move sub-notes from one note to other notes. The user can also move, delete, or otherwise modify the notes that are in the note groups. The user can also modify the linkage between sub-notes and Web page portions. In other words, the invention allows the user to easily modify the note grouping\/note\/sub-note hierarchy by processing step  (FIG. ). Such operation of step  is further illustrated by reference to FIG. .","A user rearranges sub-notes in a note, or moves\/copies sub-notes between notes by selecting the desired sub-notes, and then dragging and dropping the selected sub-notes to the desired locations. In , for example, assume that the user wishes to move sub-note  so that it is displayed between sub-notes  and . In this case, the user selects sub-note  in a well known manner, and then drags selected sub-note  until it is located between sub-notes  and . The user then drops sub-note  between sub-notes  and  in a well known manner. This can be done in both notes\/Web page directory window  and the notes text window .","Suppose that the user wishes to move sub-note  to Note B. In this case, the user selects sub-note  in a well known manner, and then drags selected sub-note  until it is positioned over Note B. The user then drops sub-note  into Note B. This is done in only the notes\/Web page directory window .","The user modifies the notes within a note group and the linkage between sub-notes and Web page portions in a similar manner.","In response to such user commands, the notes engine  moves\/copies sub-notes between the sub-note objects, modifies the note grouping table , and\/or modifies the linkage information in the sub-note nodes.","6.10 Show Sub-Notes","Referring again to , if the user issued a command to show sub-notes in the notes\/Web page directory window  via view menu , then control line  is taken. Such operation is further described with reference to flowchart  in FIG. . In step , the user indicates to the present invention to show the content of the sub-notes in the notes\/Web page directory window  by selecting the \u201cShow Sub-notes In Tree\u201d command in the view menu .","6.11 Toggle Between Notes and Web Pages View","If the user issued a command to toggle between viewing notes or Web pages in the notes\/Web page directory window  via view menu , then control line  is taken. Such operation is further described with reference to flowchart  in FIG. . In step , the user can toggle between displaying the notes tree or Web pages tree in the notes\/Web page directory window  by either selecting the \u201cNotes\u201d command or the \u201cWeb Pages\u201d command in the view menu .","6.12 Change or View Options","If the user issued a command to change or view options via the view menu window , then control line  is taken. Such operation is further described with reference to flowchart  in FIG. . In step , the user can select either the sub-notes page  or the caching page  by selecting the options menu  (FIG. ). Referring to , the sub-files file  provides the user with options on how the sub-notes are displayed. For example, the sub-notes can be shown in the tree in the notes\/Web page directory window  (as described above with the sub-notes button ), the contents of the sub-note can be displayed beside the title of the note in the tree, and the title and\/or URL of the Web page that the sub-note is linked to can be display in the tree. The caching option, when checked, in the caching page  indicates to the present invention to cache Web pages in the Web pages database  for faster retrieval of the Web pages by the present invention.","6.13 Change or View Properties","If the user issued a command to change or view properties via the view menu window , then control line  is taken. Such operation is further described with reference to flowchart  in FIG. . In step , the user selects the properties function from the view menu  and a properties menu  () is displayed. Referring to , the properties menu  has a note page . Here, the title of the note is displayed (and can be changed by the user), the date and time it was created, and the date and time it was last modified.","7. Applications of the Invention","The invention is applicable to any application that would benefit from the enhanced organization of information. Such applications include, but are not limited to: (1) law related projects, such as licensing studies, litigation efforts, opinions of counsel (such as patentability, patent validity, and patent infringement studies); (2) scientific and\/or engineering related projects, such as research and development projects; (3) electronic text books, handbooks, user manuals, encyclopedias, and other electronic reference works, including multimedia reference works; (4) auditory and visual documents; (5) virtual library; (6) review course, such as legal bar review course, business review courses, CPA courses, medical review courses, etc.; (7) virtual classrooms; (8) business-related Internet to research; and (9) casual Internet use.","Other applications of the invention will be apparent based on the discussion contained herein. Two such applications are discussed in some detail below.","7.1 Movie Production","The invention is applicable to the entertainment industry, such as the motion picture industry. The invention could be used to organize the great amounts of information that is collected and generated during the development of a movie and stored on the Internet. This scenario is represented in simplified form in FIG. .","Generally, a movie is developed in three phases: a pre-production phase, a production phase, and a post production phase. The present invention could be used to organize, memorialize, and institutionalize the information collected and generated during these phases. Specifically, a note  could be created for the pre-production phase. Also, a note  could be created for the production phase, and another note  could be created for the post production phase.","The pre-production note  could include sub-notes that link to Web pages used to research the movie's topic. For example, suppose the movie involved lions. One sub-note, called Sub-note A, could be linked to a chapter in a book  dealing with lions stored on a Web page. Another sub-note, Sub-note B, could be linked to a segment of a video  pertaining to lions stored on a Web page. Other sub-notes, such as Sub-notes C-E, could be linked to drafts  of the script on Web pages. These sub-notes could include comments\/edits on the drafts . Other sub-notes (not shown) could be linked to other pre-production related objects, such as contracts with actors, travel itineraries, budget reports, purchase orders for costumes and props, etc.","The production note  could include sub-notes that are linked to production Web pages, such as the final draft of the script , various scenes , various takes , clips, shots, frames, etc. Such scenes , takes , clips, shots, and frames would be in a form useable by a computer.","The post production note  could include sub-notes that are linked to post-production Web pages, such as the theatrical production  of the movie, the video production  of the movie, the movie soundtrack, etc.","There are many advantageous for using the present invention to create movies. First and perhaps foremost, the present invention will lend order to the creation of a movie and to the memorialization and documentation of the movie production. Accordingly, movie production will be more efficient and effective.","Second, the use of the invention to create movies will create great marketing opportunities. Currently, there is limited distribution of movies and their related materials. For most movies, only the theatrical version and perhaps the home video version are sold and distributed. Limited source materials (such as the \u201cMaking of\u201d type publications) are available to the public.","The present invention allows any and all versions of any given movie to be easily packaged, distributed and sold. One need only copy the pertinent notes, sub-notes, and Web pages to a computer readable medium (such as one or more compact disks), and distribute and sell copies of the computer readable medium to the public.","Also, for movie historians and other interested parties, the materials that were used to create the movie (such as the pre-production information and the production information) can be easily packaged, distributed, and sold. Again, one need only copy the pertinent notes, sub-notes, and Web pages to a computer readable medium, and distribute and sell copies of the computer readable medium to the public.","Further, the use of the invention will enable movie aficionados to create their own versions of a movie. This is the case, since the soundtrack, scenes, takes, clips, shots, and\/or frames are stored as Web pages, and are linked to sub-notes. Such personalized movie making packages can be easily packaged, distributed, and sold. Again, one need only copy the pertinent notes, sub-notes, and Web pages to a computer readable medium, and distribute and sell copies of the computer readable medium to the public.","7.2 Bar Review Program","The invention could be used to create attorney bar review course materials. These materials could be used as a supplement to a traditional bar review course, or as an alternative to a bar review course.","A portion of an example notes database  for a bar review course is shown in FIG. . Bar review course materials typically include a number of sample tests. According to the present invention, a note is associated with each question of each sample test. For example, note  is associated with Question . Sub-note A is linked to the portion  of a sample test Web page  that corresponds to Question . Sub-note B is linked to the portion  of the sample test Web page  that corresponds to the answer to Question .","Suppose that Question  pertains to an area of Torts law. Question  note  may also include a Sub-note C that is linked to a portion  of a torts text  in an electronic legal library . This portion  deals with the substantive torts law of Question . A student may find it very useful to study this portion  when working with Question .","The notes database  could also include a torts note  that the deals specifically with torts. This torts note  could have sub-notes, such as Sub-notes G and H, that are linked to portions of the torts text . Sub-notes G and H could have commentary on these portions of the torts text . The Question  note  could then have a Sub-note D that points to Sub-note G in the torts note . Sub-note G points to the same portion  in the torts text  pointed to by Sub-note C (typically, the Question  note  would include Sub-note C or Sub-note D, but not both). Notes dealing with questions other than Question  could then point to the sub-notes in the torts note , as necessary, thereby enhancing reusability.","The notes database  could also include a case analysis note  that includes sub-notes that point to cases in electronic case reporters . These sub-notes could include commentary and analysis of such cases. The Question  note  could include a Sub-note E that is linked to a Sub-note F in the case analysis note . This Sub-note F is linked to a case  that deals with the issues of Question . Students may find it useful to review this case  when working with Question .","8.
