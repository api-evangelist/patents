title: Ultra wide bandwidth spread-spectrum communications system
abstract: An ultra wide bandwidth, high speed, spread spectrum communications system uses short wavelets of electromagnetic energy to transmit information through objects such as walls or earth. The communication system uses baseband codes formed from time shifted and inverted wavelets to encode data on a RF signal. The combination of short duration wavelets and encoding techniques are used to spread the signal energy over an ultra wide frequency band such that the energy is not concentrated in any particular narrow band and is not detected by conventional narrow band receivers so it does not interfere with those communication systems. The use of pulse codes composed of time shifted and inverted wavelets gives the system according to the present invention a spatial resolution on the order of 1 foot which is sufficient to minimize the negative effects of multipath interference and permit time domain rake processing.

Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to a radio communications system, particularly to a wireless digital communications system, and more particularly to an ultra wide bandwidth (UWB), spread-spectrum, wireless digital communications system.","2. Description of the Prior Art","There are numerous radio communications techniques for digital data. Most recently, wireless digital communications have been applied to mobile telephone systems, pagers, remote data collection, and wireless networking of computers as well as other applications. One of many books on the subject is \u201cWireless Digital Communications, Modulation & Spread Spectrum Applications,\u201d by Kamilo Feher. This book and others deal with conventional modulation of a carrier with, for example, phase or frequency shift keying (i.e. FSK, MSK, GMSK, BPSK, DBPSK, QPSK, O-QPSK, FQPSK, \u03c0\/4-DEQPSK). The American and Japanese cellular standard, for example, uses \u03c0\/4-DEQPSK. These systems have used either time division multiple access (TDMA) or code division multiple access (CDMA) in order to share the aggregate bandwidth between multiple users. They use either FHSS (frequency hop spread spectrum) or the CDMA codes to spread the spectrum. There remains a need, however, for higher data rates to be accommodated, with simultaneous ability to communicate through barriers such as buildings, walls, or even through soil or through tunnels. The spectrum that is capable of penetrating walls and soil (i.e. frequencies below about 3 GHz), however, is in use. Therefore, there is a need to have a communication system that can coexist in that part of the spectrum where penetration occurs. Current spread-spectrum and narrowband systems cannot coexist with other narrow bandwidth users of the same spectrum due to mutual interference.","Too much interference is impinged on the other users, who themselves cause too much interference to the communication system. Typically, high-speed links operate on microwave carriers that are easily blocked by terrain and intervening objects. Prior techniques are based on modulating a carrier frequency. Such a framework assumes that all components, (e.g. the antenna) have a reasonably flat frequency response over the bandwidth used and therefore do not affect the waveform. The present invention does not. They also assume that there are several to many cycles of the carrier between transitions (e.g. zero crossings) in the modulating waveform. Again, the present invention does not. It is this fact allows the present invention to simultaneously operate at low frequencies, yet -resolve multipath, and maintain high data rates. This combination has substantial benefits be low frequencies both penetrate lossy media, and minimize reflections off objects because they become smaller relative to the wavelength. But conventional systems typically have less than 10% bandwidth, and therefore have poor resolution at low frequencies. Furthermore, in contrast to current techniques, the present invention is optimized to not only be robust to multipath, but to take advantage of it.","Other UWB systems have been based on producing and receiving short one-to two cycle impulses at a relatively low duty cycle. Examples include deRosa (U.S. Pat. No. 2,671,896), Robbins (U.S. Pat. No. 3,662,316), Morey (U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,795), Ross and Mara (U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,054), and Fullerton and Kowie (U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,927). Impulses on the order of Ins are emitted at a 1 to 10 MHz rate, giving rise to a 100:1 to 1000:1 duty cycle. Due to this poor duty cycle, it is difficult to impossible to generate significant average power efficiently, or in an integrated circuit, because the peak voltages are higher than breakdown voltage of state-of-the-art low voltage CMOS and Bipolar processes. The waveform used in the present invention is, instead, an essentially continuous wave. The prior-art systems also use pseudo-random time intervals between unchanging (essentially identical) pulses, for the purpose of spreading the spectrum conveying information, are used in each of these systems. By contrast, the present invention, while allowing the pulse position to be randomized, communicates information by changing the pulse shape. Yet another difference is interference. The present invention does not require pulse position modulation to make the output power spectrum smooth. Instead, the spectrum is smoothed by the modulation of the pulse shape.","It is an object of the present invention to construct an ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) high-speed digital communications system that directly produces short, spatially compact, electromagnetic wavelets, (or impulses, or energy packets). The wave-shape of these wavelets is tailored to propagate in free space and communicate information, for example, through use of inverted or non-inverted copies. It is an object of the present invention to communicate information by sending sequences of these impulses, where the spectrum is constrained by both the selection of the sequence coding, and the shape of the wavelet. It is also an object of the present invention to construct an UWB high-speed digital communications system that penetrates through obstructing objects (e.g. walls), or media (e.g. earth). It is also an object of the present invention to construct an UWB high-speed digital communications system that not only tolerates significant multipath, but can take advantage of it. It is also an objective of the present invention to operate in the presence of interference from other users of the same spectrum, yet with little interference to those other users. It is also an object of the present invention to provide the above objectives in a device that can be largely constructed with a large-scale semiconductor integrated-circuit (LSI).","The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description. In the description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which there is shown by way of illustration and not of limitation a preferred embodiment. Such description does not represent the full extent of the invention, but rather the invention may be employed in different arrangements according to the breadth of the invention.","The present communication system is a departure from conventional narrower band transmission systems in that it uses baseband transmission of codes built from time shifted and inverted replicas of short RF pulses rather than a modulated carrier. It is innovative compared to other pulsed waveform systems because it exploits phase as well as time position to create the transmit waveform. This feature allow s the system to smoothly vary the peak to average power ratios of both the spectrum and the time domain waveforms and to generate larger collections of codes.","Typical pulse durations are on the order of 100 to 1000 picoseconds with bandwidths of roughly 1 GHz to 8 GHz respectively. The combination of short duration pulses and the coding techniques used spread the signal energy over such a broad frequency band that little energy appears in any narrowband user's band. The result is that the UWB transmitted signal is below the detection threshold of conventional narrowband receivers.","The system makes it practical to transmit information at very high data rates through walls, tunnels, buildings, and other obstructions using signals with high enough spatial resolution to resolve the obstructions that lead to multipath fading in conventional systems.","Multipath occurs when time delayed and attenuated copies of the transmitted waveform arrive at the receiver simultaneously. In urban environments this is due in large part to reflection and transmission of architectural features, e.g. walls, floors, ceilings, and windows.","When the range resolution of the receiver is large compared to the multipath differences, constructive and destructive interference occurs which reduces system performance. This is multipath fading. If, on the other hand, multipath components are resolved by the receiver, then no interference occurs, and the multipath components can be used to improve system performance.","The range resolution of the receiver is roughly inverse to the bandwidth of the transmit signal. So, 10 MHz systems have range resolution of",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","res"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["c","BW"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"3","mo":["\u00d7","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mn":["10","8"]},"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mtext":"\/"}],"mi":["m","sec"]},{"mn":"10","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"MHz"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"30","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"."}}}}}}}},"likewise, a 100 MHz system has 3 meter (10 foot) resolution, and a 1 GHz system has resolution on the order of 0.3 meters (1 foot). Since architectural features (walls, floors, etc.) are separated by distances that are on the order of 10 feet, systems that resolve them well require resolution that is order of 1 foot.","The pulse codes built by the present system are composed of biphase modulated and time shifted replicas of an underlying short wavelet pulse. The receiver compresses the transmitted pulse code using a matched filter (correlation processing). The width of the compressed pulse that results is nominally that of a single pulse. This gives the prototype system spatial resolution that is on the order of one foot\u2014sufficient to avoid the negative effects of multipath, and to allow time domain rake processing.","Theory","The present ultrawideband (UWB) short pulse (SP) communication system uses baseband transmission of codes built from time shifted and inverted replicas of short RF pulses. No carrier is used. Typical pulse durations are on the order of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, and typical bandwidths are greater than 1 GHz. Below, is a short review of time and frequency domain issues related to the UWB communication system. Top level views of the transmitter and receiver are given in  and .","Time Domain","A waveform with good bandwidth and derivative properties is the Gaussian monocycle, which is formulated by taking the first derivative of a Gaussian. It has the form of a ramp with a Gaussian envelope\n\n()=\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The pulse's duration is a function of the constant k, which controls the rate of decay of the Gaussian envelope.  illustrates the case where the constant k has been selected to generate a pulse duration of roughly 1.5 nanoseconds. Equations (3) to (5) relate the pulse duration to bandwidth.","Circuits for generating these signals include: avalanche transistors; step recovery diodes (SRD) in comb filter circuits; and high speed logic and transistors. The present system currently uses a pulse forming network of high speed discrete logic together with signal conditioning.","Frequency Domain","An important property of UWB signals is the relationship between pulse duration and bandwidth. In general, the narrower a pulse is made in time, the broader the frequency band over which its energy is spread. Thus, if energy per Hertz is fixed, wider bandwidth pulses transmit more energy than narrower ones. From this perspective, shorter in time is always better.","Other criterion effecting the selection of pulse duration include the propagation properties of the band that results. In general, the lower frequencies, HF (3-30 MHz), VHF (30-300 MHz), and UHF (300-1000 MHz) have been shown to have superior materials (building and foliage) penetration relative to higher frequency bands. A good compromise for in-building operation is to span the VHF and UHF bands. This represents a trade-off of energy spreading against the propagation model and engineering feasibility.","To tie pulse duration to bandwidth, consider the Gaussian monocycle of (1). Its frequency domain representation is also Gaussian, and is given by",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"S","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03c9"}},{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03c9","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"k"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mi":["\u03c0","k"]}},"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"k"}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"The spectrum of a 1 GHz Gaussian monocycle that spans the VHF and UHF bands is shown in .

The problem of synchronizing the transceiver clocks amounts to finding the unknown time delay that corresponds to the maximum of the correlation.  illustrates that the correlation peak is exceedingly narrow. This narrowness gives the UWB communications system the ability to operate in the midst of multipath, because the multipath can be resolved.","Sliding Correlator DLL (Delay Locked Loop)","While we generally do not form the entire correlation function on a single sequence, we can form single terms of it and then slide the position (or lag) of that single term from sequence to sequence. This technique is known as a sliding correlator. We use the sliding correlator for clock acquisition, clock tracking, and data detection. We also use the sliding correlator to scan for the location of the highest signal. This location changes dynamically due to objects moving in the environment, or to motion between the transmitter and receiver, as in mobile applications. A sliding correlator forms inner products\u2014signal multiplication (mixing) followed by integration\u2014of the received signal and the local code at different relative time delays.","A simple method of clock acquisition (determining the unknown delay) is to increment the time delay through a code length, while looking for the inner product with the largest absolute value. In spread systems this is often called turning the code wheel. Once the delay is selected, the sign and magnitude of the inner product are used for the bit detection statistic.","Clock tracking is implemented with a delay locked loop (DLL). Because the correlation is symmetric, the receiver can use the difference between a leading and lagging inner product to track the transmit clock. When the receiver is synchronized, the difference goes to zero. Otherwise, the difference is positive or negative depending on whether the timing is leading or lagging.","Radio Frequency Interference","From the perspective of UWB systems, narrowband interference dominates the noise in urban environments. Because the UWB SP signal is \u201cshort in time\u201d and \u201clong in frequency\u201d it is highly distinguishable from conventional narrowband signals which are \u201clong in time\u201d and \u201cshort in frequency\u201d.  illustrates the power spectral density at an Alexandria, Va. laboratory. The differences between these signal types are exploited to develop RFI extraction (radio frequency interference) algorithms to improve UWB transmissions. The authors have already developed and demonstrated RFI extraction algorithms that achieve up to 20 dB SNR improvement.  illustrate the results of the developed RFI extraction algorithm on collected data.","In the detailed descriptions we describe the operation of the UWB short pulse transmitter and receiver. Both cases begin with expressions for the key waveforms generated, and then relate their elements to the circuits.","Transmitter","A block diagram of the transmitter is shown in .

Mathematically, the binary data d(t) are represented by a stream of equispaced impulses, one per data bit, indexed by k.  is an example for the data d=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], as a stream of positive and negative going impulses, one per data bit, where the mapping {0, 1}\u2192{\u22121,1} has been applied","Data Whitening and Differential Encoding","There are two special conditions on the data. The first is that the data must be pre-whitened, or scrambled. This means that it has been processed such that its spectrum is nominally flat. The reason for requiring this is that, by the convolution theorem, the spectrum of the transmit signal (13) is the product of the spectrums of the pulse S(\u03c9), the code H(\u03c9), and the data D(\u03c9). That is,\n\n(\u03c9)=(\u03c9)(\u03c9)(\u03c9).\u2003\u2003(14)\n","Since the code and the pulse are both generated by the transmitter such that H(\u03c9)) and S(\u03c9) are nominally flat over the bandwidth of the system, the spectrum of the output will go as the spectrum of the data. That is, if the spectrum of the data is white over some interval, then the output will be white over that interval. Consider that if the data were constant, say all ones, then d(t) would be a train of unit impulses Tperiodic, resulting in line spectra at frequency bins spaced by \u0192=1\/T, all the transmit energy would be concentrated at multiples of \u0192, and the outcome would be interference with any narrowband user at those frequencies. Referring to , block  applies this data scrambling to the data. It also can apply forward error correction coding (FEC), such as combinations of interleaving, Reed-Solomon block codes, and convolutional codes. Many books are available on the topic of FEC.","The second condition is that the data must be differentially encoded. The reason for this constraint is that the transmit waveform is arbitrarily inverted by the environment. The result is that the receiver cannot tell if a non-inverted wavelet or an inverted wavelet was transmitted, but it can tell if two are alike or opposite. Differential encoding allows the receiver to recover the data in that manner. It is applied in block . By employing differential encoding of the data prior to transmission, we can use phase information as well as pulse position to create pulse codes.","Digital Codes & Modulation","In this system the data are transmitted by biphase modulation of codes rather than modulation of a carrier. Block  generates a cyclical stream of pseudo-random bits representing the digital code. Each time the cycle repeats, synch signal  triggers differential encoder  so that alignment of the data modulation on  can occur. Exclusive or gate  modulates the digital code on  to produce the modulated code sequence on .  gives an alternative block diagram of a circuit capable of performing the modulation. These circuits produce the data modulated code, independent of the pulse waveform.

Although  show only one rake channel, it is the intent that several rake channels would operate simultaneously."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sup":"th "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"sup":"nd "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10","sub":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 16","sub":"k"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 17","sub":"n"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 16","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 21A-21B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 29A-29B","FIGS. 2A-2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 34"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
