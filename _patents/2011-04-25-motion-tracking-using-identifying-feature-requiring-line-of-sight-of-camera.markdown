{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to automatically tracking a moving entity with a video camera.","Moving entities, such as humans, animals, or objects, may be tracked with video cameras (e.g., surveillance cameras). For example, many surveillance cameras are equipped with pan, tilt, zoom, and motion tracking capabilities and may be used to track moving entities in the vicinities of the cameras over some periods of time.","Many existing surveillance cameras are equipped with pan, tilt, zoom, and motion tracking capabilities. For example, most motion tracking cameras are programmed to either track any movements (e.g., activities in a parking lot) or track fast moving entities (e.g., vehicles driving down a street). However, they often lack the ability to track moving entities by specification. That is, existing motion tracking technologies can be programmed to track moving entities in general but cannot be programmed to track a specific target entity.","Particular embodiments program a video camera to track a specific entity, which may be referred to as a target entity. The target entity is identified by an identifying feature. The video camera, once programmed to track the target entity with the identifying feature, is able to track the target entity while the target entity is in the vicinity of the video camera (e.g., within the range of the video camera), even when the target entity remains stationary (i.e., not moving).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["210","220"]},"Particular embodiments may program a video camera with an identifying feature of a target entity, as illustrated in STEP  of . In particular embodiments, an entity may be a human, an animal, or an object of any type. The target entity is the entity that is to be tracked by the video camera. For example,  illustrates an example video camera . There are several entities  in the vicinity of camera . One of these entitles (e.g., entity -A) may be selected as the target entity.","There may be various types of identifying features that may be associated with a target entity (e.g., target entity -A). In particular embodiments, an identifying feature associated with the target entity may require that the target entity is in the line of sight of a camera (e.g., camera ) in order for the camera to be able to track the target entity. For example, the identifying feature may be a barcode or Quick Response (QR) code, such that camera  may be programmed to track an entity with the barcode or QR code attached to it. A QR code is a matrix barcode or two-dimensional code readable by QR barcode readers or cameras. As another example, the identifying feature may be a uniform (e.g., a jacket or a hat) or a badge, such that camera  may be programmed to track an entity (e.g., a person) wearing the uniform (e.g., an employee wearing a company uniform) or badge. As a third example, the identifying feature may be a color (e.g., red), such that camera  may be programmed to track a red or mostly red entity (e.g., a red ball or a child wearing a red outfit). As a fourth example, the identifying feature may be a pattern (e.g., checkerboard pattern), such that camera  may be programmed to track an entity having such a pattern. In fact, any identifying feature may be used to identify a target entity.","Alternatively, in particular embodiments, an identifying feature associated with the target entity does not require that the target entity is in the line of sight of a camera (e.g., camera ) in order for the camera to be able to track the target entity. In this case, even if the target entity is behind or obscured by another entity (e.g., a piece of furniture or a wall), the camera is still able to track the target entity. For example, the identifying feature may be a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag, such that camera  may be programmed to track an entity with the RFID tag attached to it. As another example, the identifying feature may be a specific radio frequency, such that camera  may be programmed to track an entity transmitting a signal at the specific radio frequency. As a third example, the identifying feature may be a specific wireless signal (e.g., a Bluetooth signal), such that camera  may be programmed to track an entity transmitting the specific wireless signal. Again, any identifying feature may be used to identify a target entity.","In particular embodiments, there may be a software application associated with the camera, through which the identifying feature of the target entity may be programmed into the camera. The software application may be implemented using a suitable programming language and the instruction code may be stored in a computer-readable, non-transitory, and tangible storage medium. In particular embodiments, the camera itself may include processors, memories, and other hardware components so that the software application may be executed on the camera. In this case, the camera may support the additional functionalities of a computing device. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the camera may be coupled to a computing device (e.g., a desktop or notebook computer). In this case, the computing device may host the software application and manage the operations of the camera. For example, in , camera  is coupled to a computer . Computer  and camera  may be connected through wire lines (e.g., Ethernet) or wirelessly.","In particular embodiments, a user may select the identifying feature of the target entity and program the identifying feature into the camera through, for example, the software application associated with the camera. In particular embodiments, the camera may locate and acquire the target entity using the identifying feature, as illustrated in STEP  of . How the camera locate and acquire the target entity often depends on what the identifying feature is. For example, if a RFID tag is attached to the target entity, then there may be a RFID reader incorporated in the camera, which may be used to read the RFID tag. If a barcode or QR code is attached to the target entity, then there may be a barcode reader incorporated in the camera, which may be used to read the barcode or the QR code. Alternatively, the camera, optionally with the associated software application, may be able to recognize the QR code pattern. If the identifying feature of the target entity is a color, a pattern, a uniform, a badge, etc., the camera may take digital images of the entities in its vicinity, and the software application may process the digital images using, for example, various image recognition or pattern recognition algorithms to identify the target entity with the identifying color, pattern, uniform, badge, etc. As another example, the target entity may have a transmitter for transmitting a radio signal at a specific frequency or a specific type of radio signal (e.g., a Bluetooth signal). In this case, the camera may incorporate a receiver for receiving the radio signal, and the software application may identify the target entity that transmits the signal at the specific frequency or the specific type of signal.","In particular embodiments, once the target entity is located (e.g., acquired by the camera), the camera may track the target entity, even while the target entity is moving, using the identifying feature, as illustrated in STEP  of . In particular embodiments, the camera may track the target entity using the identifying feature in manners similar to those described above. For example, if a RFID tag is attached to the target entity, then the RFID reader incorporated in the camera may be used to read the RFID tag. If the entity moves, the RFID tag attached to the target entity also moves with the target entity. The RFID reader incorporated in the camera may be used to read the RFID tag from time to time or periodically, and thus locate the moving target entity, as long as the RFID tag attached to the target entity is within the range of the RFID reader incorporated in the camera. As another example, if a barcode or QR code is attached to the target entity, then the barcode reader incorporated in the camera may be used to read the barcode or QR code from time to time or periodically. Again, if the entity moves, the barcode or QR code attached to the target entity also moves with the target entity. The barcode reader incorporated in the camera may be used to read the barcode or QR code, and thus locate the target entity, as long as the barcode or QR code attached to the target entity is within the range of the barcode reader incorporated in the camera. As a third example, if the target entity is identified by a pattern or color, then when the target entity moves, the camera may follow the identifying pattern or color, and thus locate the target entity. The camera may take digital images of the target entity periodically, and the associated software application may process the digital images for image or pattern recognition in order to locate the target entity.","Because the target entity is identified by an identifying feature (e.g., RFID tag, barcode or QR code, color, pattern, radio signal, etc.), the camera is able to track the target entity regardless of whether the target entity is moving or stationary. As a result, the camera is able to continuously film the target entity while the camera tracks the target entity. If there are other entities that are moving in the vicinity of the camera or of the target entity, because these other entities do not possess the identifying feature, the camera may ignore them and concentrate on specifically tracking and filming the target entity instead.","As described above, in particular embodiments, an identifying feature (e.g., a RFID tag or a radio signal) does not require that the target entity is in the line of sight of the camera. In this case, even when the target entity is obscured by another entity, the camera is still able to track the target entity while the target entity is not in the line of sight of the camera, although the camera may not be able to film the target entity while the target entity is not in the line of sight of the camera. For example, the RFID reader incorporated in the camera is still able to read the RFID tag attached to the target entity even when target entity is obscured by another entity. As another example, the radio receiver incorporated in the camera is still able to detect and receive the radio signal transmitted by the transmitter attached to the target entity even when target entity is obscured by another entity.","Alternatively, in particular embodiments, an identifying feature (e.g., a barcode or QR code, a color, or a pattern) requires that the target entity is in the line of sight of the camera. For example, if a barcode is attached to the target entity, the camera or the barcode reader incorporated in the camera is only able to read the barcode while the camera or the barcode reader can scan the barcode. In this case, when the target entity moves behind and is obscured by another entity, the camera may lose track of the target entity. When this happens, for example, the camera may point at the last location before the target entity is obscured by another entity for some time. When the target entity reemerges from behind the other entity, the camera may reacquire the target entity. Alternatively, the camera may scan its vicinity from time to time to check whether the target entity is again in the line of sight of the camera, and if so, the camera may reacquire and resume tracking the target entity.","In particular embodiments, at a given time, the location of the target entity may be determined, as illustrated in STEP  of . In particular embodiments, the software application associated with the camera may determine the location (e.g., the coordinates) of the target entity based on the identifying information received from the target entity. For example, if the target entity transmits a radio signal, this signal may be used to triangulate the current location of the target entity at a given time. As another example, if the target entity is attached with a RFID tag or a barcode or QR code, the RFID or barcode reader incorporated in the camera may collect information that may be used to determine the current location of the target entity at a given time.","In particular embodiments, the camera may continue tracking and filming the target entity until another identifying feature is programmed into the camera (e.g., by a user). If the camera loses track of the target entity for some reason (e.g., the target entity moves out of the range of the camera or is obscured by another entity), the camera may scan its vicinity and when possible (e.g., the target entity moves back in the range of the camera or is not longer obscured by another entity), reacquire and resume tracking and filming the target entity using the identifying feature in manners, for example, similar to those described above when the camera first acquire the target entity.","In particular embodiments, each target entity may have a unique identifying feature that is not possessed by other entities in the vicinity. This unique identifying feature may be programmed into a specific camera so that the camera may track the target entity. In particular embodiments, if multiple entities within an area need to be tracked at the same time (i.e., there are multiple target entities), each target entity may be tracked and filmed using a different camera. In this case, the unique identifying feature of each target entity may be programmed into a separate camera, and each camera may track the specific target entity whose unique identifying feature is programmed into it individually.","Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  illustrates an example computer system .
