Modules, however, are not to be interpreted as software which is not implemented on hardware, firmware, or recorded on a processor readable recordable storage medium (i.e., modules are not software per se). It is noted that the modules are exemplary. The modules may be combined, integrated, separated, and\/or duplicated to support various applications. Also, a function described herein as being performed at a particular module may be performed at one or more other modules and\/or by one or more other devices instead of or in addition to the function performed at the particular module. Further, the modules may be implemented across multiple devices and\/or other components local or remote to one another. Additionally, the modules may be moved from one device and added to another device, and\/or may be included in both devices.","Role-based access control module  may request creation of one or more accounts with one or more SaaS. Role-based access control module  may create one or more profiles. Each of the one or more profiles may provide permissions for either a specific object or a set of objects. For each role that represents a specific job function, role-based access control module  may assign a specific set of permissions profile applicable to that role. For each role, role-based access control module  may create at least one account on the SaaS provider. It should be appreciated that many accounts may be created for a particular role to enable multiple users to login at the same time. As used herein, these accounts may be referred to as \u201cpseudo accounts.\u201d In effect, one or more pseudo accounts may serve as one or more slots associated with a particular role for an account at the SaaS provider.","In some embodiments, a user may have hold one role for a specific application. Here, when the user switches application, the user may assume a different role and may perform an action specific to that role. However, this may not always be the case.","In some embodiments, roles for each pseudo account may differ for each user across various applications. For example, an employee may have employee-level access in one SaaS application and may be a system administrator for another SaaS application.","One benefit with role-based access control using dynamic shared accounts across multiple applications may be that if any updates to the various roles needed to occur, access privileges may be adjusted through adjustments in the pseudo account level. Any user associated with that particular role would receive a corresponding change in accessibility and privilege to their user account. This may provide greater flexibility, efficiency, and reliability.","Identity module  may provide a user interface to a plurality of users in an organization. For example, rather than directly logging in to an individual account at the SaaS application, a user may log into via this user interface. Identity module  may provide, among other things, various features, including, but not limited to single sign-on, user identification, authentication and authorization, and\/or role-based verification.","One benefit with using identity module  may be that users seeking access to one or more SaaS applications may be allowed, e.g., via a single sign on procedure, to access one or more accounts on a plurality of SaaS applications without logging in multiple times. Again, this may provide greater flexibility and efficiency.","Dynamic account mapping module  may map each user who logs in via identity module  to one or more pseudo accounts. Mapping to these pseudo accounts may be dynamic. As described above, since there may be a limited number of pseudo account created for each role at each SaaS, dynamic account mapping module  may be able to assign one or more users to access to each SaaS based on an availability of each pseudo account or take other priority measures.","Error logging and reporting module  may produce logs, reports, or other information associated with providing role-based access control using dynamic shared accounts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","402","310","402","404","406","408"],"sub":["1","2","n","1","2","n "]},"For example, SaaS 1 may be a sales service, such as SalesForce.com, SaaS 2 may be an accounting service, such as Concur Expense Reporting, and SaaS N may be a GoogleDocs document service, where N may be an integer. There may be accounts created at SaaS 1 with the following corresponding roles: R1-1, R1-2, and R1-3. R1-1 may be directed to a sales manager role, R1-2 may be directed to a sales representative role, and R1-3 may be directed to public view role. There may be accounts created at SaaS 2 with the following corresponding roles: R2-1, R2-2, and R2-3. R2-1 may be directed to a finance role, R2-2 may be directed to a manager role, and R2-3 may be directed to an employee role. There may be accounts created at SaaS 3 with the following corresponding roles: RN-1, RN-2, and R1-n. RN-1 may be directed to a full editor role, RN-2 may be directed to a partial editor role, and RN-n may be directed to read-only role, where n may be an integer.","When a user Ulogs in via the account management module , user Umay have sales manager privileges at SaaS 1, finance privileges at SaaS 2, and full editor access at SaaS N. In this example, user Umay be an executive at a particular corporation who has full or almost full access to all the SaaS applications.","User Umay also log in via the account management module . While user Umay have sales manager access to SaaS 1, user Umay have only employee access in SaaS 2 and partial editor access in SaaS N. As a result, depending on an employee's role in an organization, his or her user-level access to one or more SaaS applications may be preconfigured accordingly in the accounts management module .","User Umay also log in at the same time that user Uand user Uare logged in. In one scenario, Umay also have sales manager privileges to SaaS 1. However, since user Uand user Uare already logged in to the only two pseudo accounts created for that role, R1-1, user Umay not have access to SaaS 1 as a sales manager at that time. In some embodiments, user Umay be denied access. In other embodiments, user Umay be asked to wait. In yet other embodiments, user Umay be granted access to another role that would provide equal or lesser access privileges than R1-1. For example, user Umay be offered access to R1-2 instead. Here, user Umay accept since user Umay only need to access information on SaaS 1 that both sales managers and sales representatives can access.
