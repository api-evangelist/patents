As such, test equipment for hydrophone applications is arranged in various locations relative to the units of the equipment undergoing testing. Common difficulties encountered while performing the tests include measuring the various distances between and amongst acoustic sources and reference hydrophones and the units under test. Errors in measurement of the distance affect the accuracy of the measurements made, and thus degrade equipment performance when the equipment is not optimally calibrated. Furthermore, relative motion among the acoustic source, reference hydrophone and the unit under test affects the accuracy of the measurements made.","Accordingly, it is a primary object and general purpose of the present invention to increase the accuracy of empirical measurements.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an efficient method for using information contained within empirical measurements to increase the accuracy of the empirical measurements.","In accordance with the present invention, calibration processing is used to calibrate acoustic vector sensor data collected at close range. For example, vector sensor data (collected at close range) includes data collected with source-to-receiver separations ranging from one-tenth to approximately two acoustic wavelengths. The calculations substantially account for the acoustic impedance of a spherically diverging wave front; where the curvature is sufficiently pronounced to cause substantial errors in resulting measurements in the calculations. The processing uses information contained within the vector sensor data to increase the accuracy of the vector sensor data. Thus, there is provided a processor for calibrating acoustic vector sensor data collected at close range (as well other ranges).","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , a diagram of a test system is illustrated and referenced by numeral . The test system  includes an acoustic source  for providing a source of propagated acoustic waves. Reference hydrophone  is arranged having a source-to-receiver distance of approximately two to four meters. Both the acoustic source  and the reference hydrophone  are submerged at an example depth of approximately 14.5 meters.","Vector sensor  is, for example, an acoustic vector sensor module (unit under test) that is arranged in Test Setup A at a first location that is approximately two meters from both the acoustic source  and the reference hydrophone ; thus forming an equilateral triangle with each side being two meters in length. Vector sensor is arranged in Test Setup B at a second location that is approximately two meters from the vector sensor  and four meters from the acoustic source . The vector sensor in various embodiments may be the vector sensor  moved to a new location or may be a different vector sensor, such as a vector sensor arranged with other vector sensors in a towed sensor array.","Self-localizing near field data processor  is arranged to receive a reference sample set of collected data from the reference hydrophone  and is arranged to receive a sensor sample set of collected data from the vector sensor  (and optionally the vector sensor ). The near field data processor  is also arranged to determine a range difference error in response to a comparison of the reference sample set of collected data and the sensor sample set of collected data. The near field data processor  uses the range difference error to correct at least partially an estimated range of the source-to-sensor distance. Thus,  describes an example data collection geometry used to calibrate equipment that includes the vector sensors  and ","The relative positions of one or more acoustic sources (e.g., the acoustic source ), one or more reference hydrophones (e.g., the reference hydrophone ), and one or more vector sensors (e.g., the vector sensors  and ) in the illustrated data collection geometry are variable in accordance with the teachings disclosed herein. For example, the data collection geometry can be used to test performance of a towed array of acoustic vector sensors that arranged using a variety of materials and manufacturing approaches. As discussed below, the performance of a given configuration is determined using the complex sensitivity of the scalar and vector channels of acoustic vector sensors installed in the test system .","Calibration waveforms used for these experiments typically include gated, continuous wave signals ranging from 100 to 1000 Hz. Nominal pulse widths range from 35 to 50 milliseconds. Typical pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) are often approximately two to four Hertz. The sensor module is typically rotated through a full rotation to fully sample the dipole response pattern of the vector channel and to determine the orientation. Calibration wave forms are thus transmitted throughout a portion or all of a rotation of a vector sensor. Data is collected throughout the rotation.","A typical objective of each test is to collect data in an acoustic near field that is used to compute the frequency-dependent, complex sensitivity of the scalar and vector sensor data channels for a given configuration. The complex sensitivity is computed using acoustic (scalar pressure) and vector (acceleration) channels in an acoustic vector sensor that provide data collected in the acoustic near field. As used herein, an acoustic near field exists at source-to-receiver separations that are sufficiently short such that the specific acoustic impedance of the wave front is not well-approximated by the plane wave impedance. Thus, analyses of data collected in the near-field may show inconsistencies when compared against analyses of data collected having physically (and accurately) measured geometries.","Calibration calculations that depend on data collected in the near field are often sensitive to range measurement errors in the acoustic near field because a given error in the measured source-to-receiver range produces an error in the computed sensitivity magnitude that varies as a function of the inverse of the absolute source-to-receiver range. The impact of range measurement errors are thus magnified in the acoustic near field.","Calibration calculations that depend on data collected in the near field are also often sensitive to range measurement errors in the acoustic near field because the specific acoustic impedance is a strong function of the wave number-range product (kr) in the acoustic near field. As a result, calculation of the reference vector field quantities based on scalar reference measurement (e.g., using a reference hydrophone) is normally critically dependent on having an accurate physical measurement of the source-to-receiver ranges. The dependencies are especially critical when the imaginary part of the complex acceleration sensitivity (e.g., phase response) is used where the specific acoustic impedance varies rapidly as a function of the wave number-range product (kr).","Conventional methods for the calibration of acoustic vector sensor towed arrays have operated on data collected at nominal source-to-receiver separations of approximately fifty meters. At these ranges the specific acoustic impedance of the field produced by a compact acoustic source at intermediate frequencies (100<f<1000 Hz) is well-approximated by the plane wave impedance. Typical wave number-range products (kr) for these tests have a range from 30 to 440. However, array calibrations conducted using these methods show that the vector channels of point sensors include an erroneous phase response characteristic that is not consistent with the phase of the incident acoustic vector field. Subsequent developmental testing on short sensor modules (which is representative of typical towed arrays arranged using given techniques) can be conducted at source-to-receiver separations of two to four meters. At these ranges and frequencies (0.85\u2266kr\u226615); the acoustic field is not well-approximated using plane wave modeling.","Calibration calculations are disclosed herein for processing acoustic vector sensor data collected at close range. In an embodiment, vector sensor data collected at close range includes data collected with source-to-receiver separations ranging from one-tenth to approximately two acoustic wavelengths. Thus, calculations are disclosed (that are suitable for the calibration of test articles), substantially account for the acoustic impedance of a spherically diverging wave front, where the curvature is sufficiently pronounced to cause substantial errors in resulting measurements in the calculations. The calculations in the disclosed embodiment assume that the aperture of the acoustic source is compact with respect to an acoustic wavelength produced by the acoustic source.","The acoustic field generated by a compact acoustic source includes a scalar field. The scalar field presented to the reference hydrophone and the vector sensor is represented using Equation [1], (in which the assumed harmonic time dependence has been suppressed):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["p","ref"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["P","o"]},{"mi":["r","ref"]}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"j"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["kr","ref"]}}},"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"and","msub":{"mi":["p","uut"]}},{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["P","o"]},{"mi":["r","uut"]}]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"j"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["kr","uut"]}}}}],"mo":"="}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Pis the acoustic pressure at the reference hydrophone;","Pis the acoustic pressure at the unit under test;","Pis the acoustic pressure at a reference distance from the source;","ris the source-to-reference hydrophone range;","ris the source-to-unit under test range (acoustic vector sensor); and","k is the acoustic wave number.","The complex pressure sensitivity of the reference hydrophone and the vector sensor are represented as the ratio of the voltage output by the sensor to the acoustic pressure at the sensor (Equation [2]):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["M","ref"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["v","ref"]},{"mi":["p","ref"]}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"and","msub":{"mi":"M","msub":{"mi":"uut","mn":"0"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":"v","msub":{"mi":"uut","mn":"0"}},{"mi":["p","uut"]}]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"where:","Mis the complex sensitivity of the reference hydrophone;","Mis the complex sensitivity of the vector sensor scalar (hydrophone) channel, in which the sensitivity and voltage for the scalar channel of the vector sensor (hydrophone) is indicated with the subscript \u201c0\u201d to identify the measured field variable as a tensor of order zero;","vis the complex voltage measured on the reference hydrophone; and","vis the complex voltage measured on the vector sensor scalar.","Combining Equations [1] and [2] provides the complex sensitivity of the vector sensor hydrophone (e.g. the scalar channel) provided as Equation [3].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"M","msub":{"mi":"uut","mn":"0"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["M","ref"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"v","msub":{"mi":"uut","mn":"0"}},{"mi":["r","uut"]}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"msub":[{"mi":["v","ref"]},{"mi":["r","ref"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}]},"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["r","uut"]},{"mi":["r","ref"]}],"mo":"-"}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"The complex exponential of Equation [3] compensates for the phase between the reference and the vector sensor hydrophone when the source-to-receiver paths are unequal.

Allocation of the error equally between the two may be implemented by setting \u03b7=\u00bd.","The use of \u03b7 allows experimental conditions to be taken into account. For example, the locations of the source and reference hydrophone can be controlled by a permanent fixture. In addition, the mean range difference error can be observed to change between data collection runs when the unit under test is removed, modified and reinstalled. The time-varying part of the range difference error is correlated to the rotation of the unit under test about its longitudinal axis of the unit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the range difference errors are due to the placement and manipulation of the unit under test. As a result, the control parameter \u03b7 can be set to allocate the difference error to the unit under test (\u03b7=1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 5"],"b":["50","52","54","52","54","56","58","56"]},"The collected data illustrated in the plot  is subsequently processed using the calibration equations disclosed in Equations [9] and [10].","The methods described herein can be used to track the range measurement error on a \u201cping-by-ping\u201d basis. That is, for each gated acoustic signal, a range measurement error can be determined for each of the sensors used to receive the gated acoustic signal. Thus, for a given data set, range difference errors are used to compute the range correction term (\u03b4r) for the calibration equations for each sensor. The range difference errors can also be selectively allocated to the test fixture and\/or the unit under test (by using the control parameter \u03b7). Calibration results for the scalar measurements and one vector channel are illustrated in  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["60","62","64","66","62","68","60","66"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["70","72","74","76","72","78","70","76"]},"The error bars in  and  represent plus and minus one standard deviation in the estimated parameter. As shown by the curve , the hydrophone phase error is nearly zero (as was indicated in the derivation of the range error difference error correction given above). In an embodiment, the linear phase between the reference and unit under test hydrophones was assumed to result from time delay\/propagation path length differences. The remaining (non-linear) phase difference was allocated to the unit under test (using parameter \u03b7).","In various embodiments of the invention, accurately measured distances between the source-to-reference and source-to-unit under test are used to verify range corrections (based on self-localizing methods and systems disclosed herein) of acoustic data.","For example, one embodiment uses the self-localizing disclosed herein while performing the data collection task in the acoustic near field relates to the requirement to collect data that is free of surface reflections. A method of increasing the time between the initial arrival of a calibration waveform, and the arrival of the surface reflection is to increase the depth at which the test is conducted while simultaneously decreasing the source-to-receiver range. Therefore, even in a large body of water (which generally entails additional expense over smaller test facilities) that can support data collection in the acoustic far field, it may be desirable to work in the near field in order to maximize the collection of data that adequately approximates free field propagation conditions.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only.
