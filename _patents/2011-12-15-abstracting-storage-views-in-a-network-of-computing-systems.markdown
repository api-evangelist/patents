No. 12\/551,486 filed on Aug. 31, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,090,833 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates generally to network management.","Most entities such as companies and universities operate large networks of computing systems. These networks are typically made up of a wide variety of computing systems, such as servers providing various services and individual computing systems. As such, the computing systems in the network varying greatly in the hardware and software contained in the computing systems. Additionally, the computing systems in the network are often located in different physical locations. For example, a company may operate a network which spans multiple geographic regions (e.g. cities, countries, continents) and multiple regions in a single geographic region (e.g. multiple office building, different floors in the office building, different offices in the office building).","One or more system administrators are tasked with the job of tracking and maintaining the computing systems in the network. This involves diagnosing and fixing problems in the computing systems, insuring that the systems are properly configured, and the like. This involves also installing and maintaining the software programs running in the network. In order to install the software programs and ensure that the programs run properly after installation, the system administrators must know details about the storage devices of the computing systems of the network. The system administrators must know the details so that the administrator can ensure that the storage devices have the adequate resources and performance to support the software programs to install. However, the network typically contains many different types of storage devices which are configured in variety of schemes. As such, the systems administrators must expend significant time and effort identifying the storage devices in the network.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing a network of computing systems and devices. More particularly, a storage tool can provide an abstract view of the storage systems of the network that allows for identification and utilization of the storage systems based on performance and capabilities of the storage systems.","According to embodiments, an administrator system, located in a network of computing systems, can be configured to include a storage tool. The storage tool can be configured to determine and provide an abstract view of storage systems in a network of computing system. The storage tool can be configured to utilize the abstract view in order to identify the storage systems based on the performance and capabilities of the storage systems without regard to the configuration of the storage system, storage devices in the storage system, or the details of the storage devices.","According to embodiments, the storage tool can be configured to identify storage systems contained in the network and determine the performance and capabilities of the storage systems. To identify the storage systems, the storage tool can be configured to query the network, directly, or communicate with a network management system to locate the storage systems of the network. During identification, the storage tool can be configured to collect details of the storage systems such as location and identification of the storage systems (network address of storage systems or computing systems containing the storage systems), a type of the storage systems (individual storage device, array of storage devices), configuration of the storage systems (e.g. scheme of the array of storage devices), information about storage devices contained in the storage systems (manufacturer, model, interface type, etc.), and available storage of the storage systems.","According to embodiments, once the storage systems are identified, the storage tool can be configured to determine overall performance and capabilities metrics of each storage system. The overall performance and capabilities metrics can include any conventional metric that describes how the storage system performs in storing data and the capabilities of the storage system. For example, the storage tool can determine failure rate, mean time to data loss (MTTDL), mean time to recovery (MTTR), unrecoverable bit rate error (UBE), write cache reliability, redundancy, space efficiency, storage system configuration (e.g. RAID level or supported RAID level) and the like for each storage system. In order to determine the overall performance and capabilities metrics, the storage tool can be configured to maintain a device record and a configuration record. The device record can include standard performance and capabilities metrics for storage devices from various manufacturers. The configuration record can include standard performance and capabilities metrics for various configurations of storage systems and can include factors that define how various configurations of storage systems affects the standard performance and capabilities metrics of the storage devices in the storage systems.","According to embodiments, to determine the overall performance and capabilities metrics of a particular storage system, the storage tool can be configured to search the device record and retrieve the standard performance and capabilities metrics of each storage device in the particular storage system. Additionally, the storage tool can be configured to search the configuration record and retrieve the standard performance and capabilities metrics for the configuration of the particular storage system and the factors that define how the configuration of the particular storage system affects the standard performance and capabilities metrics of the storage devices in the storage systems. For the particular storage systems, the storage tool can be configured to select the retrieved standard performance and capabilities metrics and\/or apply the retrieved factors to the retrieved standard performance and capabilities metrics to determine the overall performance and capabilities metrics for the particular storage system.","According to embodiments, once the overall performance and capabilities metrics are determined for the storage systems, the storage tool can be configured to store the overall performance and capabilities metrics of the storage systems with the details of the storage systems in an inventory record. The inventory record can include, for each storage system, the details of the storage systems such as location and identification of the storage systems, type of the storage systems, configuration of the storage systems, information about storage devices contained in the storage systems, available storage of the storage systems, and the overall performance and capabilities metrics.","According to embodiments, the storage tool can be configured to identify storage systems based on the overall performance and capabilities metrics. The storage tool can be configured to receive a request to identify storage systems that meet one or more overall performance and capabilities metrics. To determine the storage systems that meet the one or more overall performance and capabilities metrics, the storage tool can be configured to search the inventory record and identify storage systems that meet the one or more overall performance and capabilities metrics. The storage tool can be configured to provide a report of the identified storage systems to an originator of the request.","By utilizing the storage tool, the administrator system can provide robust tools for identifying storage systems based on desired performance and capabilities. Consequently, an administrator or program attempting to identify storage is not required to know the details of the storage systems in the network. As such, the services tool can reduce the time and effort of managing the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","100","100"]},"In embodiments, the network system  can include a number of computing systems connected by one or more networks .
