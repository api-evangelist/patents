With minor changes, the method of the present invention is applicable for controlling the left-right up-down movements of the cursor. The control mechanism only requires operations with a few keys to achieve the desired control result.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["2","2","2","20","21","22","23","20","1","23","2"]},"The processing unit  at least comprises a CPU and a RAM. The screen  preferably is a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The storage unit  is a flash memory or other non-volatile storage device.","The input unit  generates different signals to the processing unit  corresponding to different operations. In the embodiment, the input unit  is a key module of the electronic device , such as a keypad on a mobile phone or a keypad on a TV remote controller. Such keypad preferably comprises three keys, i.e. a back key , a next key  and an enter key  (or OK key). If required, the input unit  may further comprises other keys, for example an up key , a down key  or a delete key, a space key (not shown in the diagrams) etc. When the user press a back key , a next key , an enter key , a up key  or a down key  once, the input unit  correspondingly generates a first signal, a second signal, a third signal, a fourth signal or a fifth signal to the processing unit .","The input unit  can be a wheel module having a wheel (not shown in the diagrams. When a user operates wheel by moving the wheel forward once, moving the wheel backward once, and pressing the wheel once, the input unit  correspondingly generates the first signal, the second signal, and the third signal to the processing unit .","The input unit  also can be an eye control module for detecting the eye movement (not shown in the diagrams), for example a CEye Eye Control Module from the Tobii Company. Each time a user moves the eye balls to the right once, moves the eye balls to the left once, and blinks the eyes once, the input unit  correspondingly generates the first signal, the second signal, the third signal to the processing unit .","The input unit  also can be a voice recognition input module for recognizing voice instructions. When a user makes instructions such as \u201cup\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d, \u201cinput\u201d etc., the input unit  correspondingly generates a first signal, a second signal, a third signal to the processing unit .","The input unit  can further be a human motion sensing input module. When a user waves the hands up once, waves the hands down once, and claps the hands once, the input unit  correspondingly generates the first signal, the second signal, the third signal to the processing unit .","The processing unit  executes actions according to the input control application , the actions comprising:","a) Obtain a member group. The member group has members lined up orderly. The group member are lined up based on numerical order (\u201c1\u201d\u02dc\u201c9\u201d), on alphabetical order of upper case English letter (\u201cA\u201d\u02dc\u201cZ\u201d), or alphabetical order of lower case English letter (\u201ca\u201d\u02dc\u201cz\u201d), or Mandarin Phonetic Symbol (\u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d), or a predetermined lined-up symbols (for example punctuation marks), or the stroke count of Chinese characters (or radical words of Chinese characters), or horizontal coordinates of the screen  (for example (0,0)\u02dc(1024,0), or vertical coordinates of the screen  (for example (0,0)\u02dc(0,768)). The order of the members in the member group is not limited to sequential order, for example the member group having three members (0,0), (512,0) and (1024,0) located on the same horizontal line. Preferably, the group members in the member group can be switched with the members of other groups, for example, from the number group to the upper case English letter group, which is detailed in the following. Wherein, one of the group members is predetermined as the selection member, preferably the member in the middle or the member after the middle is determined as the selection member. For example, if there are 10 members, which are numbers \u201c0\u201d\u02dc\u201c9\u201d, in the current member group, the member in the exact middle does not exist. Accordingly; the \u201c4\u201d before the middle or the \u201c5\u201d after the middle is determined to be the selection member. For another example, if there are only 5 members from \u201c0\u201d\u02dc\u201c4\u201d in the current member group, then \u201c2\u201d is the member in the exact middle, which is required to be determined as the selection member. In addition, the member order can be determined by users. For example, line up the frequently used members next to the selection member, and line up least frequently members away from the selection member.","b) Upon receiving the signals from the input unit , selectively execute one of the following operating steps:","The first operating step: when the signal is the first signal generated after pressing the back key , the members currently lined-up after the selection member in the member group are excluded from the member group. Preferably, the selection member is excluded from the member group too. Next, determining if there is only one member left in the current member group. If the determination result is \u201cNo\u201d, the member in the middle or before the middle or after the middle is determined to be the select member; and if the determination result is \u201cYes\u201d, executes an input operation according to the last member, for example the last member is entered in an editing column displayed on the screen .","The second operating step: when the signal is the second signal generated after pressing the next key , the members currently lined-up before the selection member are excluded from the member group, preferably, the selection member is excluded from the member group too. Next, determining if there is only one member left in the current member group. If the determination result is \u201cNo\u201d, the member in the middle or before the middle or after the middle is determined to be the select member; if the determination result is \u201cYes\u201d, executes an input operation according to the last member, for example the last member is entered in an editing column displayed on the screen .","The third operating step: when the signal is the third signal generated after pressing the enter key , the selection member in the current member group is entered into the editing column.","Next, the above mentioned input control application is illustrated in an example inputting Chinese texts. The member group and the editing column are displayed in the screen  as the member group  and the editing column  are displayed in the  and . A group in the member group  has members from \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d offered for user selection. The \u201c\u201d is lined up in the middle is predetermined as the selection member. Preferably, the selection member is highlighted so that the user can recognize easily.","First, the first member which the user desires to input is \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d is the member lined up before the selection member \u201c\u201d. Naturally, the user may perceive to search backwards and press the back key  according to the perception, which triggers the input unit  to generate a first signal to the processing unit . The processing  unit executes the above mentioned first operating step, i.e. excluding the selection member \u201c\u201d and all the members \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d which are lined up after the selection member \u201c\u201d as shown in . Next, the processing unit  determines that there are several members in the member group . Then, \u201c\u201d is determined to be the new selection member. There are 17 members left \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d 17 members left in the current member group , \u201c\u201d is lined up in the middle between \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d, accordingly, \u201c\u201d is determined as the new selection member.","The \u201c\u201d which the user desires to input is still lined up before the current selection member \u201c\u201d, the user further presses the back key  once to trigger the input unit  to generate a first signal to the processing unit . The processing unit  again executes the first operating step. Consequently, there are only members \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d left in the member group , and \u201c\u201d lined up after the middle is determined as the new selection member as shown in the .","At the time, \u201c\u201d which the user desires to input is after the selection member \u201c\u201d in the current member group. The user may perceive to search backward. The user presses the next key  once according to the perception which triggers the input unit  to generate a second signal to the processing unit . The processing unit  executes the above mentioned second operating step, i.e. excluding the selection member \u201c\u201d and the members \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d currently lined-up before the selection member \u201c\u201d as shown in . Then, \u201c\u201d which is lined-up in the middle in the member group  is determined as the new selection member.","The selection member in the member group  then is the first member \u201c\u201d which the user desires to input. At the time, the user presses the enter key  once which triggers the input  to generate a third signal. The processing unit  receives the third signal and correspondingly executes the above mentioned third operating step, i.e. the selection member \u201c\u201d is entered in the editing column . Thus, the user completes inputting the first member \u201c\u201d.","Provided the first member which the user desires to input is \u201c\u201d instead of \u201c\u201d or \u201c\u201d, and the actions move to the scenario shown in . Because \u201c\u201d is lined up after \u201c\u201d, the user presses next key  once to generate a second signal, the processing unit  correspondingly executes the second operating step based on the second signal to exclude \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d are both excluded in . At this point, the processing unit  determines there is only one member \u201c\u201d in the member group  and \u201c\u201d is directly entered in the editing column . Thus, the user the user completes inputting the first member \u201c\u201d.","Provided the first member which the user desires to input is \u201c\u201d instead of \u201c\u201d, and the actions move to the scenario shown in . Because \u201c\u201d is lined up before \u201c\u201d and the user presses the back key  once to generate a first signal, the processing unit  correspondingly executes the first operating step based on the first signal to both exclude \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d in . At this point, the processing unit  determines there is only one member \u201c\u201d in the member group  and \u201c\u201d is directly entered in the editing column . Thus, the user the user completes inputting the first member \u201c\u201d.","The above actions further comprises a change step. When the last member or the selection member in the member group  is entered in the editing column , the processing unit  executes a change step used for switching members in the member group  with new members in another group, and determining a member in the middle, before the middle or after the middle as the selection member. The new member and the member in the current editing column  is associated, for example associated phonetically. For example, in , when \u201c\u201d is entered in editing column , the processing unit  switches the members in the member group  with a new member, the new member is from a group of the members associated phonetically with \u201c\u201d such as ,  . . .  etc., the member lined-up in the middle \u201c\u201d is determined as the selection member and highlighted. Next, the user proceeds with inputting the second member according to the process mentioned above and the process is not repeated hereto.","In , two members \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d are entered in the editing column  respectively. When \u201c\u201d is entered in the editing column , as mentioned previously, the processing unit  executes a change step to enable the member group  to list new members associates with \u201c\u201d, wherein \u201c\u201d is a final, and the new member corresponds to a tone symbol: the first member is \u201cspace\u201d representing the first tone, the second to the fourth member respectively are \u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d representing respectively the second\u02dcfourth tone, and \u201c\u201d which is lined up after the middle is determined as the selection member. In the embodiment, the new member and the member \u201c\u201d in current editing column  are associated phonetically. Next, the user proceeds with inputting the third member according to the process mentioned above and the process is not repeated hereto.","In , the user proceeds to inputting the third member \u201c\u201d. When \u201c\u201d is entered into the editing column , as mentioned previously, the processing unit  executes a change step to enable the member group  to list new members associates with \u201c\u201d. Because \u201c\u201d is a complete segment of the Mandarin Phonetic Symbol, the new member corresponds to a Chinese homophone character and \u201c\u201d which is lined up in the middle is determined as the selection member. In the embodiment, the new member and the member \u201c\u201d in the current editing column  are phonetically associated. Next, the user proceeds with inputting the fourth member according to the process mentioned above and the process is not repeated hereto.","In , the user proceeds with inputting the fourth member which is a Chinese character \u201c\u201d. When \u201c\u201d is entered in the editing column , as mentioned previously, the processing unit  executes a change step. Different from the above mentioned, because the first Chinese character is inputted at this point, the processing unit  executes the change step to change from the member group  to the previous members \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d and determines the a member in the middle or before the middle or after the middle as the selection member. In the embodiment, \u201c\u201d which is lined up in the middle is predetermined as a selection member. The above mentioned input control application further comprises a replace step used for simultaneously executing executes a replace step upon the processing unit  executing the above mentioned change step, wherein the member immediately entered in the editing column  replaces the member in the editing column . In the embodiment, \u201c\u201d replaces \u201c\u201d in the editing column . Next, the user proceeds with inputting the second Chinese character according to the process mentioned above and the process is not repeated hereto.","In the embodiment mentioned above, the user only uses three keys, i.e. the back key , the next key  and the enter key  for inputting the Chinese character in the electronic device .","Next, the above mentioned input control application is illustrated in an example inputting numbers. In the embodiment, the member group is hidden and not displayed on the screen , and the members in the member group are two digit numbers \u201c99\u201d\u02dc\u201c00\u201d. The selection member is determined as the maximum or the minimum numbers, for example \u201c99\u201d or \u201c00\u201d. The selection member is directly entered and displayed in a editing column on the screen . The editing column comprises one or several sub columns . Each sub column  displays a number among \u201c0\u201d\u02dc\u201c9\u201d. The quantity of the sub columns  corresponds to the length of the member. For example, if members in the member group are \u201c0\u201d\u02dc\u201c9\u201d, only one sub column  is displayed, and if the members in the member group are \u201c000\u201d\u02dc\u201c999\u201d, threes sub columns  are displayed, and so on. In terms of the generating method of a sub column , in the embodiment, a sub column  is generated according to the above mentioned first signal, i.e. the user presses the back key  once, the processing unit  correspondingly generates a sub column  displayed on the screen .","Provided the member which the user currently desires to input is a number \u201c48\u201d. Because the member is a two digit number, the user has to presses the back key  twice for generating two sub columns  correspondingly in order to form the editing column on the screen . Next, the user has to press the next key  representing the editing column is generated. In the embodiment, the members \u201c99\u201d\u02dc\u201c00\u201d in the member group are lined up by descending order. The predetermined selection member is the first number \u201c99\u201d in the member group, and \u201c99\u201d is entered in the editing column on the screen  accordingly. Then the actions moves to inputting the following member (numbers).","Because the member \u201c48\u201d to input currently is lined up after the current selection member \u201c99\u201d, the user may perceive to search backward, and press the next key  according to the perception, which triggers the input unit  to generate a second signal to the processing unit . The processing  unit executes the above mentioned second operating step, i.e. excluding the selection member \u201c99\u201d and all the members lined up before the selection member, and then the processing  unit determines the member in the middle or before the middle or after the middle in the member group as the new selection member which is displayed in the editing column . Nonetheless, the members are lined up by descending order, the first member is 99 and there is no member lined up in front of \u201c99\u201d. Accordingly, only \u201c99\u201d is excluded in the second operating step executed, the members left in the member group are \u201c98\u201d\u02dc\u201c00\u201d. It should be noted that \u201c49\u201d is lined up before the middle of \u201c98\u201d\u02dc\u201c00\u201d. After the processing unit  executes the second operating step, the \u201c49\u201d is determined to be the new selection member. In the embodiment, the selection member \u201c49\u201d is directly entered in editing column , as shown in .","Next, the user perceives to search backwards because \u201c48\u201d is lined up after \u201c49\u201d, the user presses the next key  once, and the result is that there are only members \u201c48\u201d\u02dc\u201c00\u201d left in the member group (\u201c49\u201d and the members \u201c98\u201d\u02dc\u201c50\u201d before \u201c49\u201d are excluded), and the \u201c24\u201d in the middle is determined as the new selection member.","At this point, the member to input \u201c48\u201d is lined up before the current selection member \u201c24\u201d, the user perceives to search backward, and press the back key  according to the perception, which triggers the input unit  to generate a first signal to the processing unit . The processing  unit executes the above mentioned first operating step, i.e. excluding the selection member \u201c24\u201d and all the members \u201c23\u201d\u02dc\u201c00\u201d lined up after the selection member, and there are only members \u201c48\u201d\u02dc\u201c25\u201d left in the member group. Then, the processing  unit determines the member \u201c36\u201d after the middle in the member group as the new selection member as shown in . The user presses corresponding keys following the same logic flow, and the members left in the member group are less and less. Following the operating steps, the selection member is then determined as \u201c42\u201d (at this point, there are only 12 members \u201c48\u201d\u02dc\u201c37\u201d left in the member group) \u25a1\u201c45\u201d (at this point, there are only 6 members \u201c48\u201d\u02dc\u201c43\u201d left in the member group) \u25a1\u201c47\u201d (at this point, there are only 3 members \u201c46\u201d\u02dc\u201c48\u201d left in the member group). As shown in , when the selection member is \u201c45\u201d and the ten digit of all other members are also \u201c4\u201d, then \u201c4\u201d is determined as the number of first sub column . The processing unit  highlights the \u201c4\u201d representing \u201c4\u201d is locked and does not respond to key operations.","When the selection member in the member group is \u201c47\u201d, the user perceives to search backward and presses the back key  once, there is only \u201c48\u201d left in the member group. Because \u201c48\u201d is the last member, \u201c8\u201d is then determined as the number in the second sub column . The processing unit  highlights the \u201c8\u201d representing \u201c8\u201d is locked and does not respond to key operations. Thus, the member \u201c48\u201d is entered in the editing column , as shown in , which means the user has completed inputting the number \u201c48\u201d.","In the embodiments shown from  to , the user uses two keys, i.e. the back key  and the next key  for inputting the number in the electronic device .","In addition, according to the above mentioned description, the member group can be con to display or not display on the screen . There are many members displayed in the beginning and the member count in the member group decreases as the user operating with pressing keys. The member count decreases by half after each operation step, the selection member or the last member is entered and displayed in the editing column  or on the screen .","In , the screen  displays another type of the member group  with the content similar to the above mentioned member group . Different from the above, the members in the above mentioned member group  are regular member, yet the members in the member group  comprises several regular members  (for example \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d) also comprises several switch members  (the members in the grey background in the diagram). The user perform selection operations among regular members  according to the above mentioned description, and the selected or the last regular member  is entered in the editing column . Same with the regular members , the switch members  are also provided for user selection, and the selection operations are identical with the above mentioned embodiment. However, the last selected switch member  is not entered in the editing column ; instead, it is switched with the regular member  in the member group .","Accordingly, in the embodiments shown in  to , the above mentioned inputting operations should be changed to: determining if the last member is one of the switch members . When the determining result is \u201cNo\u201d, the last member (which is a regular member ) is entered in the editing column . When the determining result is \u201cYes\u201d, the members of the member group  are switched for including the group of regular members  which corresponds to a switch member  and the remaining switch members . The above mentioned third operating step should be changed to: when receiving a third signal from the input unit , determining if the selection members in the current member group  has a switch member .

The operating method is identical with the embodiment above, which is completed by operating the keys of the input unit . For example, the next key  is pressed to generate the first signal which is received by the processing unit . If there are several members in the member group , the members before the selection member  are excluded. In , for example, the switch members \u201c@Y\u201d, \u201c8\u201d, and the regular members \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d are completely excluded or partly excluded, and the new selection member  is determined among remaining members. For another example, when the back key  is pressed to generate the second signal which is received by the processing unit . If there are several members in the member group , the members after the selection member  are excluded. For example, in , the regular members \u201c\u201d\u02dc\u201c\u201d, and the switch member \u201cE\u201d and \u201ce\u201d are completely excluded or partly excluded, and the new selection member  is determined among remaining members. For another example, when the enter key  is pressed and to generate the third signal which is received by the processing unit . If the current selection member  is a regular member , the regular member  is entered in the editing column ; and if the current selection member  is a switch member , the screen  switches to display all regular members  correspond to and represent the switch member .","In  to , when the member count of total members in the member group  exceeds a predetermined value, the members are not able to display on the screen  in one row, the members are displayed in a plurality of rows on the screen  (for example an upper and a lower rows). When the processing unit  receives the first signal or the second signal, the members lined up before or after the selection member  are excluded in rows as the unit. Thus, the user presses the keys to generate the first signal or the second signal and the processing unit  executes the corresponding operating step according to the signals, then there is one row of members displayed on the screen  at the end, which is helpful visually to the user to locate the position of the member the user desires to input.","In  to , an embodiment is used for illustrating inputting a number \u201c4\u201d and an upper case English letter \u201cE\u201d. First, as shown in , the member group  displayed on the screen  is a member group, and a regular member (the number \u201c4\u201d) is predetermined as the selection member . At this point, the user only needs to press the enter key  to enter the selection member (the number \u201c4\u201d) in the editing column , as shown in , at this point, the input of one member is completed; so again all members are displayed on the member group .","Next, the user desires to switch the member group  to the regular members  of upper case English letter. Because the members corresponds to \u201cE\u201d the switch member , \u201cE\u201d is lined up after the predetermined selection member , the user only needs to intuitively press the next key , the processing unit  receives the first signal corresponding to the next key , and then excludes all members before the selection member , and leaves all the members lined up after the selection member , as shown in , then determines a new selection member A (i.e. the number \u201c8\u201d). Because \u201cE\u201d the switch member  is still lined up after the selection member A, the user has to again press the next key . At this point, the processing unit  excludes all the members before the selection member A, and determines a new selection member B, as shown in . At this point, \u201cE\u201d the switch member  is determined as the selection member B. Accordingly, the user directly presses the enter key  to trigger the processing unit  to execute the third operating step corresponding to the third signal, i.e. switching to the upper case English letter corresponding to the \u201cE\u201d switch member  on the screen  as shown in .","Next, because the user desires to input the letter \u201cE: which is lined up before the predetermined selection member  in the member group . The user intuitively presses the back key , the processing unit  receives the second signal corresponding to the back key , and then excludes all members after the selection member , and leaves all the members lined up before the selection member , as shown in , then determines a new selection member C. At this point, the selection member C is the regular member (the upper case English letter \u201cE\u201d) the user desires to input, the user directly presses the enter key , the processing unit  to trigger the processing unit  to execute the third operating step corresponding to the third signal, and enters the selection member C (the upper case English letter \u201cE\u201d) in the editing column , as shown in . At this point, all members are displayed again in the member group  on the screen .","Compare to the prior art, the technology disclosed in the present invention is suited to use in compact electronic devices, only a few input signals are required to complete the operating steps, which makes the input process fast and intuitive, and reduces the time spent on searching for the inputting text. In addition, the present invention provides an easy method to switch between different input text.","In addition, when members are excluded in the above mentioned member group, the user may press the up key  to generate a fourth signal, the processing unit  restores the members excluded previously, and the members are displayed in the member group again. Further, if a member is entered in the above mentioned editing column, and there is no members excluded in the member group, At this point, if the user presses the up key  to generate the fourth signal, the processing unit  deletes the member previously entered in the editing column. In short, the up key  has functions to restore members and delete members. Furthermore, if a member is entered in the above mentioned editing column, and the member group and there is no members excluded in the member group. At this point, if the user presses the enter key , the processing unit  receives the signal corresponding to the enter key , then transfer the member in the editing column outbound, for example: transfer to a textbox.","Under the scenario where the members of the member group are the coordinates of the screen , the coordinates predetermined as the selection members are cursor coordinates on screen . For example, provided the resolution of the screen  is setup as 1024\u00d7768 and the cursor is in the center point of the screen  with the coordinates as (512,384). At this point, an Application Programming Interface (API) from the operating system provide resource to obtain coordinates of the center point (512,384) and two coordinates (0,384) and (1024,384) which is at the same horizontal line of the coordinates (512,384). At this point, the members in the member group are (0,384), (512,384), (1024,384) and other coordinates (x,y) which derive from the calculation of the three coordinates given y=384, wherein (512,384) is the selection member. Under the specific scenario, the processing unit  executes the first operation step according to the first signal received. Then, the members in the member group become (0,384), (255,384) and (511,384). Because (512,384) and the coordinates after (512,384) are excluded, and (255,384) in the middle is determined as the selection member. At this point, the processing unit  moves the cursor to the selection member (255,384), which equals to that the cursor moves horizontally to the left along a horizontal line for a distance which is about the half of the distance between two coordinates (0,384) and (1024,384) to the user. When the processing unit  executes the first operation step for a second time, the members in the member group become (0,384), (127,384) and (254,384). The (127,384) in the middle is determined as the selection member, and the cursor moves to the selection member (127,384), which equals to that the cursor moves horizontally to the left along a horizontal line for a distance which is about the half of the distance between two coordinates (0,384) and (254,384) to the user. When the processing unit  executes the second operation step for a second time according to the second signal received, the members in the member group become (128,384), (191,384), (254,384). Because (127,384) and all the coordinates before (127,384) are excluded, and (191,384) in the middle is determined as the selection member. At this point, the processing unit  moves the cursor to the selection member (191,384), which equals to that the cursor moves horizontally to the right along a horizontal line for a distance which is about the half of the distance between two coordinates (128384) and (254,384) to the user, and so on. After the processing unit  repeats executing the first operation step, the members in the member group in the end become (128,384), (129,384) and (130,384), and (129,384) is the selection member. After the processing unit  then again executes the second operation step once, there is only one member (130,384) in the member group because the selection member (129,384) and the coordinates before (128,384) are excluded. At this point, the processing unit  determines that there is only one member (130,384) in the member group, and then executes an input operation which is restoring the members in the member group, and determines the last member to be the selection member. At this point, the members in the member group are (0,384), (130,384), (1024,384) and other coordinates (x,y) which derive from the calculation of the three coordinates given y=384, wherein (130,384) is the selection member and at this point the cursor is at (130,384).","According to the above description, when the members in the member group are coordinates on the same horizontal line, the cursor is allowed to move to the left and to the right by using the above mentioned input method and the moving distance is the half of the last moving distance. If the members in the member group are coordinates on the same vertical line, the above mentioned first operation step is changed to the fourth operation step, the second operation step is changed to the fifth operation step. The fourth operation step is: when the signal is the fourth signal generated upon the up key  is pressed, the members after the selection member in the member group are excluded. Preferably, the selection member is also excluded. Then, determining if there is only one member left in the member group. If the determining result is \u201cNo\u201d, the member in the middle or before the middle or after the middle in the member group is determined as the new selection member; if the determining result is \u201cYes\u201d, executing an input operation, for example restoring the members in the member group and the last member replaces the member which is preciously the selection member. The fifth operation step is: when the signal is the fifth signal generated upon the down key  is pressed, the members before the selection member in the member group are excluded. Preferably, the selection member is also excluded. Then, determines if there is only one member left in the member group. If the determining result is \u201cNo\u201d, the member in the middle or before the middle or after the middle in the member group is determined as the new selection member; if the determining result is \u201cYes\u201d, executing an input operation, for example restoring the members in the member group and the last member replaces the member which is preciously the selection member.","In  to , the input control application  is further configured for controlling the cursor movement. Substantially, the processing unit  controls the moving direction and moving distance of the cursor  on the screen  according to moving signals generated upon pressing the back key , the next key , the down key  and the up key . If the moving signal is a left moving signal (i.e. the above mentioned first signal), the cursor  is controlled to linearly move to the left. If the signal is a right moving signal (i.e. the above mentioned second signal), the cursor  is controlled to linearly move to the right. If the signal is a up signal (i.e. the above mentioned fourth signal), the cursor  is controlled to linearly move upwards. If the signal is a down signal (i.e. the above mentioned fifth signal), the cursor  is controlled to linearly move downwards. The distance of the first horizontal linear movement of the cursor  is the half of the distance between the starting coordinates of the cursor and the horizontal boundary (left boundary or right boundary) of the screen . Then the distance of following horizontal distance is the half of the last moving distance. The distance of the first vertical linear movement of the cursor  is the half of the distance between the starting coordinates of the cursor  and the vertical boundary (upper boundary or lower boundary) of the screen . Then the distance of following vertical distance is the half of the last moving distance.","For example, as shown in , a user desires to move the cursor on the screen  from the starting point A to an ID column  on the screen . Because the ID column  is located above the cursor , the user may perceive to intuitively press the up key  to generate the up signal. The processing unit  receives the up signal, and then controls the cursor  to linearly move upwards from the starting point A to the new position B, as shown in . This is the first vertical movement of the cursor . The moving distance of the cursor  is D2 (D1\/2), which is the half of the distance D1 between the starting point A and the upper boundary U of the screen .","Next, as shown in , the ID column  is currently located below the position B of the cursor . The user further presses the down key  to generate the down signal. The processing unit  receives the down signal, and then controls the cursor  to linearly move downwards from the position B to the new position C. The moving distance is half of the last moving distance, which is [(D1\/2)\/2=D1\/4]. At this point, the position C of the cursor  overlaps with the position of the ID column , which means, the user completes the operation to move the cursor  to the ID column .","Preferably, after the cursor  moves to the ID column , if the processing unit  further receives the generated signal after the enter key  is pressed, the processing unit  transfer the ID column  to a status ready to receive input, and displays the member group on the screen , and removes the cursor , as shown in , wherein English letters are displayed in the member group  for selection, the operating process is described in the above and is not repeated hereto.","As shown in , the user next desires to move the cursor  to a password column . The user again presses the enter key , and then the cursor  is displayed on the screen  again. Next, the user controls the cursor  to move to the password column  according to the operations mentioned above.","In , the user presses a key  in the screen . Because the key  is located at the right side of the cursor , at this point, the user presses the next key  and generates the right moving signal. The processing unit  controls the cursor  to move to the right from the starting point D to a new position E according to the right moving signal. The moving distance is the half of the distance D2 between the starting point D and the right boundary R of the screen . At this point, the location E of the cursor  overlaps with the position of the login key , the user presses the enter key  to generate the confirm signal, the processing unit  triggers the login key  according to the confirm signal.","In addition, when the processing unit  receives any moving signal, and the distance which the cursor  expects to move is zero, the processing unit  proceeds to reset procedure, which makes the moving distance of the cursor  become the half of the distance between the current coordinates (starting point) and one of the boundaries of the screen  were the boundary can be an upper boundary, lower boundary, left boundary or right boundary, depending on the moving direction of the cursor .","In any case, one would understand that the present invention contains industrial applicability in view of the teachings of the forgoing description. Further, the present invention contains novelty because no prior art has been found to be the same with the present invention. Still further, the present invention contains non-obviousness because no prior art has been found to be similar to the present invention.
