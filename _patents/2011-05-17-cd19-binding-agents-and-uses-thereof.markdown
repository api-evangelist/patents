No. 12\/253,895, filed Oct. 17, 2009, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional App. No. 60\/981,206 filed Oct. 19, 2007; and U.S. Provisional App. No. 60\/019,214 filed Jan. 4, 2008; and U.S. Provisional App. No. 61\/080,169 filed Jul. 11, 2008, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","This application includes a sequence listing submitted herewith as a text file named \u201cSeqlist018891004030PC.txt\u201d created on Oct. 15, 2008, and containing 73,602 bytes. The material contained in this text file is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","This invention, inter alia, relates to CD19 binding agents and methods of using such CD19 binding agents for treating disease.","In humans, B cells can produce an enormous number of antibody molecules. Such antibody production typically ceases (or substantially decreases) when a foreign antigen has been neutralized. Occasionally, however, proliferation of a particular B cell will continue unabated and can result in a cancer known as a B cell lymphoma. B-cell lymphomas, such as the B-cell subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, are significant contributors to cancer mortality. The response of B-cell malignancies to various forms of treatment is mixed. Despite the medical importance, research in B-cell mediated diseases such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma has produced only a small number of clinically usable data and conventional approaches to treat such diseases remain tedious and unpleasant and\/or have a high risk of relapse. For example, although high dose chemotherapy as a primary treatment for high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma can improve overall survival, about 50% of the patients still die of this disease. Devesa et al., 79: 701 (1987). Moreover, low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma-like chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma are still incurable. This has stimulated the search for alternative strategies like immunotherapy. Antibodies directed against cell surface molecules defined by CD antigens represent a unique opportunity for the development of therapeutic reagents.","The majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemias are of the B-cell lineage. Freedman, 4: 405, 1990. This type of B-cell malignancy is the most common leukemia in the Western world. Goodman et al., 22: 1, 1996. The natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia falls into several phases. In the early phase, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an indolent disease, characterized by the accumulation of small mature functionally-incompetent malignant B-cells having a lengthened life span. Eventually, the doubling time of the malignant B-cells decreases and patients become increasingly symptomatic. While treatment can provide symptomatic relief, the overall survival of the patients is only minimally affected. The late stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by significant anemia and\/or thrombocytopenia. At this point, the median survival is less than two years. Foon et al., 113: 525 (1990).","B cells express cell surface proteins which can be utilized as markers for differentiation and identification. CD19 is a pan-B cell membrane glycoprotein that is expressed from early stages of pre-B cell development through terminal differentiation, regulating B lymphocyte development and function. Expression of CD19 was identified on most cancers of lymphoid origin, on the vast majority of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and on leukemias, including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM). Despite major improvements in the treatment of NHL and CLL patients, the majority will continue to relapse and salvage regimens with non-cross resistant compounds are required to improve patient survival. A need exists in the art for improved methods of treatment. The present invention addresses this and other needs.","The invention provides, inter alia, CD19 binding agents and methods of using them. In some aspects, the binding agents comprise the amino acid sequence(s) of a humanized heavy chain variable region and\/or a humanized light chain variable region and specifically bind to human CD19. In some embodiments, the CD19 binding agent is an antigen-binding antibody fragment that specifically binds to human CD19. The antibody fragment can be, for example, a Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), Fv fragment, a diabody, a linear antibody, an scFv, or an scFv-Fc.","In some aspects, the CD19 binding agent has a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or immunomodulatory effect on CD19-expressing cells. Such an effect can be mediated, for example, by the depletion or inhibition of the proliferation or differentiation of CD19-expressing cells. In some embodiments, the CD19 binding agent can mediate effector function. In some embodiments, the CD19 binding agent is conjugated to a therapeutic agent (e.g., a ligand-drug conjugate compound). In other embodiments, the CD19 binding agent is unconjugated, i.e., not conjugated to a therapeutic agent (for example, an anti-CD19 naked antibody).","The present invention provides, inter alia, ligand-drug conjugate compounds wherein the ligand unit is a CD19 binding agent of the present invention. The ligand-drug conjugates can be used, for example, to treat an immune disorder or cancer.","Cancers to be treated by the methods of the present invention include CD19-expressing cancers, including, for example, B-cell lineage malignancies such as, for example, B cell lymphomas or B cell leukemias, including, but not limited to, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Also provided are methods for killing tumor cells expressing CD19 and methods for inhibiting the proliferation or differentiation of tumor cells expressing CD19. Such methods can include administering to the cells a CD19 binding agent that specifically binds to and can, for example, kill or inhibit the proliferation or differentiation of cells expressing human CD19. In some embodiments, an anti-CD19 full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent will be administered. In some other embodiments, a ligand-drug conjugate (e.g., a CD19 binding agent (e.g., a full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof) conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent) will be administered. In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention will be effective for depleting B cells, e.g., periphery; spleen, mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes.","The present invention encompasses methods for inducing the depletion of B cells, e.g., peripheral B cells, which are associated with an immune disorder. Such methods can include administering to the cells a CD19 binding agent. In some embodiments, an anti-CD19 full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent will be administered. In some other embodiments, a ligand-drug conjugate (e.g., a CD19 binding agent (e.g., a full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof) conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent) will be administered. In some embodiments, the immune disorder is rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis or inflammatory bowel disease.","Also provided by the present invention is the use of a CD19 binding agent in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of disease. In some embodiments, an anti-CD19 full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent will be used. In some other embodiments, a ligand-drug conjugate (e.g., a CD19 binding agent (e.g., a full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof) conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent) will be used.","Also provided by the present invention is the use of a CD19 binding agent in the manufacture of a medicament for the depletion of B cells. In some embodiments, an anti-CD19 full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent will be used. In some other embodiments, a ligand-drug conjugate (e.g., a CD19 binding agent (e.g., a full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof) conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent) will be used.","Also provided by the present invention is the use of a CD19 binding agent in the manufacture of a medicament for the killing or inhibition of the proliferation or differentiation of CD19-expressing cells. In some embodiments, an anti-CD19 full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent will be used. In some other embodiments, a ligand-drug conjugate (e.g., a CD19 binding agent (e.g., a full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof) conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent) will be used.","In another aspect, pharmaceutical compositions are provided in which the composition comprises a CD19 binding agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition will comprise an anti-CD19 full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent. In some other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition will comprise a ligand-drug conjugate (e.g., a CD19 binding agent (e.g., a full length antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or derivative thereof) conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent).","In another aspect, methods of manufacturing ligand-drug conjugate compounds are provided. In one aspect, a CD19 binding agent is conjugated to a cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agent either directly or through a linker, as described more fully below.","The present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the following detailed description, non-limiting examples of specific embodiments, and the appended figures and sequence listing.","The present invention provides, inter alia, CD19 binding agents that specifically bind to human CD19. Specifically, the present inventors have designed humanized BU12 antibodies and ligand-drug conjugate compounds comprising humanized BU12 antibodies.","In certain aspects, the CD19 binding agents of the present invention comprise at least one of the CDR regions of the antibody mBU12. In certain aspects, the CD19 binding agents comprise all six of the CDR regions of the mBU12 antibody. In some embodiments, the CDR regions have at least one, at least two, or at least three conservative amino acid substitutions of a CDR of antibody mBU12.","In certain aspects, the CD19 binding agents of the present invention comprise an antibody heavy chain variable region and\/or an antibody light chain variable region, including derivatives thereof.","In some aspects, the compositions and methods relate to antibodies, including antibody derivatives, that bind to CD19. In certain aspects, the anti-CD19 antibodies and derivatives comprise the amino acid sequence of a humanized heavy chain variable region and\/or a humanized light chain variable region of antibody BU12, including derivatives thereof. In certain aspects, the anti-CD19 antibodies and derivatives comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or all six of the CDR regions of antibody mBU12. In some embodiments, the anti-CD19 antibodies include at least one immunoglobulin constant region domain, or an entire constant region of an antibody, such as a human constant region or, optionally, a functionally active portion thereof. In some embodiments, the antibody constant region or domain(s) is of the IgG class. In some embodiments, the antibody constant domain is IgG1, IgG2, or IgG1V1.","In certain aspects, the compositions and methods relate to antibodies, including antibody derivatives, that bind to CD19 and are conjugated to cytotoxic, cytostatic and\/or therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, the antibodies have altered glycosylation patterns.","For clarity of disclosure, and not by way of limitation, the detailed description of the invention is divided into the subsections which follow.","When a trade name is used herein, reference to the trade name also refers to the product formulation, the generic drug, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) of the trade name product, unless otherwise indicated by context.","The terms \u201cCD19 binding agent\u201d and \u201canti-CD19 binding agent\u201d as used herein refers to a molecule, e.g., protein, that specifically binds to CD19. Examples can include a full length anti-CD19 antibody, a fragment of a full length anti-CD19 antibody, or other agent that includes an antibody heavy and\/or light chain variable region, and derivatives thereof.","The terms \u201cspecific binding\u201d and \u201cspecifically binds\u201d mean that the CD19 binding agent will react, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding target, CD19 and not with the multitude of other antigens. Typically, the C19 binding agent binds with an affinity of at least about 1\u00d710M, and preferably 10M to 10M, 10M, 10M, or 10M and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen.","As used herein, the term \u201cfunctional,\u201d in the context of a CD19 binding agent, indicates that the binding agent is capable of specifically binding to CD19.","The terms \u201cinhibit\u201d or \u201cinhibition of\u201d as used herein means to reduce by a measurable amount, or to prevent entirely.","The term \u201cdeplete,\u201d in the context of the effect of a CD19 binding agent on CD19-expressing cells, refers to a reduction in the number of or elimination of the CD19-expressing cells.","\u201cNative antibodies\u201d and \u201cnative immunoglobulins\u201d are defined herein as heterotetrameric glycoproteins, typically of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two light (L) chain and two heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is covalently linked to a heavy chain by a disulfide bond to form a heterodimer. The heterotetramer is formed by covalent disulfide linkage between the two heavy chains of such heterodimers. Although the light and heavy chains are linked together by a disulfide bond, the number of disulfide linkages between the two heavy chains varies by immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at the amino-terminus a variable domain (V), followed by three or four constant domains (C1, C2, C3, and\/or C4, as appropriate for the antibody type), as well as a hinge (J) region between C1 and C2. Each light chain has two domains, an amino-terminal variable domain (V) and a carboxy-terminal constant domain (C). The Vdomain associates non-covalently with the Vdomain, whereas the Cdomain is commonly covalently linked to the C1 domain via a disulfide bond. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains (see, e.g., Chothia et al., 1985186:651-663).","The term \u201chypervariable\u201d refers to certain sequences within the variable domains of an immunoglobulin that differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and contain residues that are directly involved in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its specific antigenic determinant. Hypervariability, both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains, is concentrated in three segments known as complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable loops (HVLs). The locations of the CDRs are defined by sequence comparison in Kabat et al., 1991, In: 5Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., whereas HVLs are structurally defined according to the three-dimensional structure of the variable domain, as described by Chothia and Lesk, 1987196:901-917. As defined by Kabat, CDR-L1 is positioned at about residues 24-34, CDR-L2 at about residues 50-56, and CDR-L3 at about residues 89-97 in the light chain variable domain. CDR-H1 is positioned at about residues 31-35, CDR-H2 at about residues 50-65, and CDR-H3 at about 95-102 in the heavy chain variable domain.","The three CDRs within each of the heavy and light chains are separated by framework regions (FR). From the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus of the heavy and light chain variable domains, the FRs and CDRs are arranged in the order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The largely \u03b2-sheet configuration of the FRs brings the CDRs within each of the chains to close proximity to each other as well as to the CDRs from the other chain. The resulting conformation contributes to the antigen binding site (see, e.g., Kabat et al., 1991, NIH Publ. No. 91-3242, Vol. I, pages 647-669), although not all CDR residues are necessarily directly involved in antigen binding.","FR residues and Ig constant domains are typically not directly involved in antigen binding, but may contribute to antigen binding or mediate antibody effector function. Some FR residues can have a significant effect on antigen binding in at least three ways: by noncovalently binding directly to an epitope, by interacting with one or more CDR residues, and by affecting the interface between the heavy and light chains. In some embodiments, the constant domains mediate various Ig effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and\/or antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).","The light chains of vertebrate immunoglobulins are assigned to one of two clearly distinct classes, kappa (\u03ba) and lambda (\u03bb), based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain. By comparison, the heavy chains of mammalian immunoglobulins are assigned to one of five major classes, according to the sequence of the constant domains: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. IgG and IgA are further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, and IgG; and IgA, and IgA, respectively. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of the classes of native immunoglobulins are well known.","The terms \u201cantibody\u201d, \u201canti-CD19 antibody\u201d, \u201chumanized anti-CD19 antibody\u201d, and \u201cvariant humanized anti-CD19 antibody\u201d are used herein in the broadest sense and specifically encompass full-length and native antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (including full-length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments thereof, such as variable domains and other portions of antibodies that exhibit a desired biological activity (e.g., CD19 binding). The terms \u201canti-CD19 antibody fragment\u201d, \u201chumanized anti-CD19 antibody fragment\u201d, and \u201cvariant humanized anti-CD19 antibody fragment\u201d refer to a portion of a full-length anti-CD19 antibody in which a variable region or a functional capability is retained, for example, specific CD19 epitope binding. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, a Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), Fd, Fv, scFv and scFv-Fc fragment, a diabody, a linear antibody, a minibody and a multispecific antibody formed from antigen-binding antibody fragments. Antibody fragments are specifically included within the definition of \u201cantibody\u201d.","The terms \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d or \u201cmAb\u201d refer to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies; that is, the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic determinant, also referred to as an epitope. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d is indicative of a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies directed to the identical epitope and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. Monoclonal antibodies can be made by any technique or methodology known in the art; for example, the hybridoma method first described by K\u00f6hler et al., 1975256:495, or recombinant DNA methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). In another example, monoclonal antibodies also can be isolated from phage antibody libraries, using techniques described in Clackson et al., 1991352: 624-628, and Marks et al., 1991222: 581-97.","The term \u201cchimeric\u201d antibody, as used herein, refers to a type of monoclonal antibody in which a portion of or the complete amino acid sequence in one or more regions or domains of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with, homologous to, or a variant of, the corresponding sequence in a monoclonal antibody from another species or belonging to another immunoglobulin class or isotype, or from a consensus sequence. An example of a chimeric antibody is one which has a variable region derived from a non-human monoclonal antibody and a human IgG immunoglobulin constant region. Chimeric antibodies include fragments of such antibodies, provided that the antibody fragment exhibits the desired biological activity of its parent antibody, for example binding to the same epitope (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., 198481:6851-6855). Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See, e.g., Morrison, 1985229:1202; Oi et al., 19864:214; Gillies et al., 1989125:191-202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397.)","A \u201csingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d antibody fragment is a single chain Fv variant comprising the Vand Vdomains of an antibody in which the domains are present in a single polypeptide chain and which is capable of recognizing and binding antigen. The scFv polypeptide optionally contains a polypeptide linker positioned between the Vand Vdomains that enables the scFv to form a desired three-dimensional structure for antigen binding, (see, e.g., Pl\u00fcckthun, 1994, In , Vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315).","The term \u201cdiabody\u201d refers to a small antibody fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Each fragment contains a heavy chain variable domain (V) concatenated to a light chain variable domain (V) to form a V-Vor V-Vpolypeptide. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the linked V-Vdomains are forced to pair with complementary domains of another chain, creating two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully, for example, in EP 0 404 097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 199390:6444-6448.","The term \u201clinear antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that has a pair of tandem Fd segments (V-C1-V-C1) that form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific, as described in Zapata et al., 19958(10):1057-1062.","A \u201chumanized\u201d antibody for the purposes herein is an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof which is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and which comprises a framework region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin.","Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are referred to herein as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d antibody domain, particularly a variable domain. An import residue, sequence, or antibody has a desired affinity and\/or specificity, or other desirable antibody biological activity as discussed herein.","In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and sometimes two, variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence from, e.g., a consensus or germline sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin Fc region, typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In certain aspects, the antibody will contain both the light chain variable region as well as the heavy chain variable region. The antibody also may include the C1, hinge (J), C2, C3, and\/or C4 regions of the heavy chain, and the Cregion of the light chain, as appropriate.","The humanized antibody will be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including IgG, IgG, IgGand IgG, and IgA, and IgA. The choice of which immunoglobulin class or isotype will depend, in part, on the desired effector function. For example, the ability of human immunoglobulins to mediate CDC and ADCC\/ADCP is generally in the order of IgM\u2248IgG\u2248IgG>IgG>IgGand IgG\u2248IgG>IgG\/IgM\/IgG, respectively. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype, and selecting particular constant domains to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art. The humanized antibody may or may not have effector function.","The FRs and CDRs of the humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the import CDR or the consensus FR may be altered by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or FR residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the import antibody. Typically, such changes will not be extensive. Usually, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental FR and CDR sequences, more often 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or at least 99%.","A \u201ctherapeutic agent\u201d is an agent that exerts a cytotoxic, cytostatic, and\/or immunomodulatory effect on cancer cells or activated immune cells. Examples of therapeutic agents include cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, cytostatic agents, and immunomodulatory agents.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.","A \u201ccytotoxic effect\u201d refers to the depletion, elimination and\/or the killing of a target cell(s). A \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d refers to an agent that has a cytotoxic and\/or cytostatic effect on a cell. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., I, I, Y, and Re), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, and fragments thereof.","A \u201ccytostatic effect\u201d refers to the inhibition of cell proliferation. A \u201ccytostatic agent\u201d refers to an agent that has a cytostatic effect on a cell, thereby inhibiting the growth and\/or expansion of a specific subset of cells.","The term \u201clabel\u201d refers to a detectable compound or composition that is conjugated directly or indirectly to a binding agent (e.g., an antibody). The label may itself be detectable (e.g., a radioisotope label or a fluorescent label) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze a chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition that is detectable. Labeled CD19 binding agents can be prepared and used in various applications including in vitro and in vivo diagnostics. Useful labels include diagnostic agents such as contrast agents (such as for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography or ultrasound, e.g., manganese, iron or gadolinium).","An \u201cisolated\u201d nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.","The term \u201ccontrol sequence\u201d refers to a polynucleotide sequence necessary for expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences suitable for use in prokaryotic cells include, for example, a promoter, operator and ribosome binding site sequences. Eukaryotic control sequences include, but are not limited to, promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. These control sequences can be utilized for expression and production of CD19 binding agents in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.","A nucleic acid sequence is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, a nucleic acid presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the nucleic acid sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers are optionally contiguous. Linking can be accomplished, for example, by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors, linkers or other methods known in the art can be used.","The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a polymer of amino acids and its equivalent and does not refer to a specific length of a product; thus, \u201cpeptides\u201d and \u201cproteins\u201d are included within the definition of a polypeptide. Also included within the definition of polypeptides are \u201cantibodies\u201d as defined herein. A \u201cpolypeptide region\u201d refers to a segment of a polypeptide, which segment may contain, for example, one or more domains or motifs (e.g., a polypeptide region of an antibody can contain, for example, one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs)). The term \u201cfragment\u201d refers to a portion of a polypeptide preferably having at least 20 contiguous or at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the polypeptide.","Unless otherwise indicated by context, a \u201cderivative\u201d is a polypeptide or fragment thereof having one or more non-conservative or conservative amino acid substitutions relative to a second polypeptide (also referred to as a \u201cvariant\u201d); or a polypeptide or fragment thereof that is modified by covalent attachment of a second molecule such as, e.g., by attachment of a heterologous polypeptide, or by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and the like. Further included within the definition of \u201cderivative\u201d are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (e.g., unnatural amino acids and the like), polypeptides with unsubstituted linkages, as well as other modifications known in the art, both naturally and non-naturally occurring.","An \u201cisolated\u201d polypeptide is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. An isolated polypeptide includes an isolated antibody, or a fragment or derivative thereof.","In certain embodiments, the polypeptide will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lowry method, and in other aspects to more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. \u201cIsolated antibody\u201d includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present.","The term \u201cheterologous,\u201d in the context of a polypeptide, means from a different source (e.g., a cell, tissue, organism, or species) as compared with another polypeptide, so that the two polypeptides are different. Typically, a heterologous polypeptide is from a different species.","In the context of immunoglobulin polypeptides, or fragments thereof, as defined above, \u201cconservative substitution\u201d means one or more amino acid substitutions that do not substantially reduce specific binding (e.g., as measured by the K) of the immunoglobulin polypeptide or fragment thereof to an antigen (e.g., substitutions that increase binding, that do not significantly alter binding, or that reduce binding by no more than about 40%, typically no more than about 30%, more typically no more than about 20%, even more typically no more than about 10%, or most typically no more than about 5%, as determined by standard binding assays such as, e.g., ELISA).","The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cpercent identity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. To determine the percent identity, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=# of identical positions\/total # of positions (e.g., overlapping positions)\u00d7100). In some embodiments, the two sequences are the same length.","The term \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d in the context of two nucleic acids or polypeptides, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that have at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% identity, or at least 99% identity (e.g., as determined using one of the methods set forth infra).","In the context of CD19 binding agents of the present invention, a protein that has one or more polypeptide regions substantially identical to one or more antigen-binding regions (e.g., a heavy or light chain variable region, or a heavy or light chain CDR) of an anti-CD19 antibody retains specific binding to an epitope of CD19 recognized by the anti-CD19 antibody, as determined using any of various standard immunoassays known in the art or as referred to herein.","The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, 199087:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, 199390:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid encoding a protein of interest. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein of interest. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., 199725:3389-3402. Alternatively, PSI-Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. Another non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, CABIOS (1989). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Additional algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the art and include ADVANCE and ADAM as described in Torellis and Robotti, 199410:3-5; and FASTA described in Pearson and Lipman, 198885:2444-8. Within FASTA, ktup is a control option that sets the sensitivity and speed of the search. If ktup=2, similar regions in the two sequences being compared are found by looking at pairs of aligned residues; if ktup=1, single aligned amino acids are examined. ktup can be set to 2 or 1 for protein sequences, or from 1 to 6 for DNA sequences. The default if ktup is not specified is 2 for proteins and 6 for DNA. Alternatively, protein sequence alignment may be carried out using the CLUSTAL W algorithm, as described by Higgins et al., 1996266:383-402.","Optionally, any two antibody sequences can be aligned, for example to determine percent identity, by using the Kabat numbering system so that each amino acid in one antibody sequence is aligned with the amino acid in the other sequence that has the same Kabat number. After alignment, if a subject antibody region (e.g., the entire mature variable region of a heavy or light chain) is being compared with the same region of a reference antibody, the percentage sequence identity between the subject and reference antibody regions is the number of positions occupied by the same amino acid in both the subject and reference antibody region divided by the total number of aligned positions of the two regions, with gaps not counted, multiplied by 100 to convert to percentage.","\u201cEffector cell\u201d as used herein refers to a cell that expresses a surface receptor for the Fc region of an immunoglobulin (FcR). For example, cells that express surface FcR for IgGs including Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RI (CD64) can act as effector cells. Such effector cells include monocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and eosinophils.","The term \u201cantibody effector function(s)\u201d as used herein refers to a function contributed by an Fc region(s) of an Ig. Such function can be effected by, for example, binding of an Fc effector region (s) to an Fc receptor on an immune cell with phagocytic or lytic activity or by binding of an Fc effector region(s) to components of the complement system. The CD19 binding agents of the present invention may or may not have effector function.","A \u201cdisorder\u201d, as used herein, and the terms \u201cCD19-associated disorder\u201d and \u201cCD19-associated disease\u201d refer to any condition that would benefit from treatment with a CD19 binding agent described herein.

Specific examples of disorders are disclosed infra.","B cell malignancies also referred to as B-cell lineage malignancies are treatable by the methods of the present invention. The term B cell malignancies include any malignancy that is derived from a cell of the B cell lineage.","The terms \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201ctherapy\u201d, and the like, as used herein, are meant to include therapeutic or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder leading to any clinically desirable or beneficial effect, including, but not limited to, alleviation or relief of one or more symptoms, regression, slowing or cessation of progression of the disease or disorder. For example, treatment can include a decrease or elimination of a clinical or diagnostic symptom of a CD19-expressing disorder after the onset of the clinical or diagnostic symptom by administration of an anti-CD19 antibody or other CD19 binding agent to a subject. Treatment can be evidenced as a decrease in the severity of a symptom, the number of symptoms, or frequency of relapse.","Except when noted, the terms \u201csubject\u201d or \u201cpatient\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to mammals such as human patients and non-human primates, as well as experimental animals such as rabbits, dogs, cats, rats, mice, and other animals.

In certain embodiments, the subject will have a refractory or relapsed CD19 expressing cancer. Subjects of the present invention include those that have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.","A subject with a refractory CD19 expressing cancer is a subject who does not respond to therapy, i.e., the subject continues to experience disease progression despite therapy.","A subject with a relapsed CD19 expressing cancer is a subject who has responded to the therapy at one point, but has had a reoccurrence or further progression of disease following the response.","The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to the amount of a CD19 binding agent or ligand-drug conjugate that is sufficient to inhibit the occurrence or ameliorate one or more clinical or diagnostic symptoms of a CD19-associated disorder in a subject.

CD19 Binding Agents","The methods described herein encompass the use of CD19 binding agents and ligand-drug conjugate compounds wherein the ligand unit is an anti-CD19 binding agent that specifically binds to CD19. The CD19 binding agent can be, for example, an anti-CD19 antibody, an anti-CD19 antigen-binding fragment, or other CD19 binding agent comprising the amino acid sequence of a humanized antibody heavy and\/or light chain variable region, or derivative thereof.","In certain aspects, the CD19 binding agents of the present invention include a heavy and\/or light chain variable domain, the heavy and light chain variable domains each have (a) a set of three CDRs identical or substantially identical to the corresponding CDRs of mAb mBU12, and (b) a set of four variable region framework regions identical or substantially identical to framework regions from a human immunoglobulin.","The present invention encompasses embodiments wherein the framework regions chosen for the heavy chain variable region of the CD19 binding agents of the present invention are the human germline Vexons V2-70 or V4-31 and the human germline J4 exon for the humanized FR4 sequence. In some embodiments, the human germline J1, J2, J3, J5, or J6 exon is used in place of the human germline J4 exon for the humanized FR4 sequence.","The present invention encompasses embodiments wherein the framework regions chosen for the light chain variable region of the CD19 binding agents of the present invention are the human germline Vexons V-L6 or VA10 and the human germline J2 exon for the humanized FR4 sequence. In some embodiments, the human germline J1, J3, J4, or J5 exon is used in place of the human germline J2 exon for the humanized FR4 sequence.","The present invention encompasses embodiments wherein mouse donor residues are reintroduced into the sequence of the framework region of the CD19 binding agents. Such residues can include, for example, reintroduction of the mouse donor residue at one or more of positions 75, 79, 81, 82, 82A, 82B, 82C and 89, according to the Kabat numbering system, of the V2-70\/J4 germline, positions 24, 27, 29, 71, 75, 78, 79, and 89, according to the Kabat numbering system, of the V4-31\/J4 germline, positions 2, 40, 41, 42, 69, 70, 71, 72, and 83, according to the Kabat numbering system, of the V-L6\/J2 germline, and positions 2 and 71, according to the Kabat numbering system, of the VA10\/J2 germline. Additional mouse donor residues at alternate positions can be reintroduced into the sequences.","The present invention emcompasses embodiments wherein the CD19 binding agents described herein have amino acid sequence modification(s) in the acceptor human germline exon in addition to the reintroduction of mouse donor residues as well as amino acid sequence modification(s) in the hypervariable regions. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and\/or other biological properties of an antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of CD19 binding agents can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into an antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and\/or insertions into and\/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of an antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. Substitutions may be conservative or non-conservative substitutions. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of an antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.","A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the CD19 binding agent that are favored locations for mutagenesis is called \u201calanine scanning mutagenesis\u201d as described by Cunningham and Wells 244:1081-1085 (1989). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed variants are screened for the desired activity.","Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and\/or carboxyl-terminal fusions as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated.","Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the CD19 binding agent are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally-occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:","(1) hydrophobic: met, ala, val, leu, ile;","(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;","(3) acidic: asp, glu;","(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;","(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and","(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.","Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Conservative substitutions will entail exchanging members of the same class.","One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues. In some embodiments, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent binding agent from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g., 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the binding agent and the antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and binding agents with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.","In some embodiments, CD19 binding agents of the present invention (e.g., anti-CD19 antibodies or derivatives thereof) have modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fc\u03b3 receptors. In some aspects, CD19 binding agents of the present invention include binding agents (e.g., anti-CD19 antibodies or derivatives thereof) that have modifications in amino acid residues that are involved in the binding interaction between the Fc domain and one or more Fc\u03b3 receptors. In some embodiments, CD19 binding agents of the present invention include binding agents (e.g., anti-CD19 antibodies or derivatives thereof) that have modifications in amino acid residues that are involved in the interaction between the anti-Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 97\/34631, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","In some embodiments, the binding of a target binding agent to one or more Fc\u03b3 receptors can be impaired using one or more antibody engineering approaches known in the art. In some embodiments, the binding of a target binding agent to one or more Fc\u03b3 receptors can be impaired by reducing the target binding agent's effector functions using one or more antibody engineering approaches known in the art. Illustrative, non-limiting examples for such approaches are provided below.","Fc\u03b3 receptor binding is mediated through the interaction of a region of an antibody with an Fc gamma (Fc\u03b3) receptor (Fc\u03b3R). The Fc region or domain refers to the region(s) of an antibody constant region (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is involved in the binding interaction of the Fc region to one or more Fc\u03b3 receptors (e.g., Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RIIb (CD32b) or Fc\u03b3RIIIa (CD16). Both the glycosylation status and primary amino acid sequence of the IgG Fc region have functional effects on the Fc region-Fc\u03b3R interaction.","Substitution of particular amino acid positions in the Fc region of IgG isotype constant regions are known to have functional effects on the ability of an antibody to bind to one or more Fc\u03b3 receptors. See, e.g., Shields et al., 2001276:6591-6604, and Canfield and Morrison, 1991173:1483-1491. The Fc region includes, for example and not for limitation, amino acid residues in the hinge region and the C2 domain. Substitution of one or more amino acid residues in the Fc region or portion of an IgG constant region with non-conservative amino acids can be expected to alter, i.e., reduce or increase the affinity of the Fc region-Fc\u03b3R interaction. Methods for introducing non-conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art.","Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in or in proximity to the Fc region or portion of an IgG constant region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. Such interchain disulfide bond formation can be expected to cause steric hindrance, thereby reducing the affinity of the Fc region-Fc\u03b3R binding interaction. The cysteine residue(s) introduced in or in proximity to the Fc region of an IgG constant region may also serve as sites for conjugation to therapeutic agents (i.e., coupling cytotoxic drugs using thiol specific reagents such as maleimide derivatives of drugs). The presence of a therapeutic agent can be expected to cause steric hindrance, thereby reducing the affinity of the Fc region-Fc\u03b3R binding interaction. Methods for introducing cysteine residues in antibodies or derivatives thereof are well known in the art.","Alternatively or additionally, one or more N-linked glycosylation sites may be introduced in or in proximity to the Fc region of an IgG constant region, thereby allowing post-translational glycosylation in this region. Such N-linked glycosylation can be expected to cause steric hindrance, thereby reducing the affinity of the Fc region-Fc\u03b3R binding interaction. Methods for introducing N-linked glycosylation sites in an antibodies or derivatives thereof are well known in the art.","A systemic substitution of solvent-exposed amino acids of human IgG1 Fc region has generated IgG derivatives with altered Fc\u03b3R binding affinities (Shields et al., 2001276:6591-604). For example, when compared to parental IgG1, a subset of these derivatives involving substitutions at Thr256\/Ser298, Ser298\/Glu333, Ser298\/Lys334, or Ser298\/Glu333\/Lys334 to Ala demonstrate increases in both binding affinity toward Fc\u03b3R and ADCC activity (Shields et al., 2001276:6591-604; Okazaki et al., 2004336:1239-49). In contrast, when compared to parental IgG1, a subset of these derivatives involving substitutions at Glu233 to Pro\/Leu234 to Val\/Leu235 to Ala and Gly 236 deletion, Pro238 to Ala, Asp265 to Ala, Asn297 to Ala, Ala 327 to Gln, or Pro329 to Ala demonstrate decreases in binding affinities to all Fc\u03b3R; the Asp265 to Ala substitution also resulted in decreased ADCC activity (Shields et al., 2001276:6591-604). Amino acids in the hinge region and the C2 domain have been shown to contribute to high affinity of human IgG for Fc\u03b3R (Canfield and Morrison, 1991173:1483-1491). These amino acid positions, or amino acids in proximity thereto, involved in mediating the Fc region-Fc\u03b3R binding interaction are potential targets for replacement by non-conservative amino acids and\/or introduction of one or more cysteines, and\/or introduction of one or more N-linked glycosylation sites.","The in vivo half-life of an antibody can also impact on its effector functions. In some embodiments, it is desirable to increase the half-life of an antibody to modify its therapeutic activities. In some embodiments, it is desirable to decrease the half-life of an antibody to modify its therapeutic activities. FcRn is a receptor that is structurally similar to MHC Class I antigen that non-covalently associates with \u03b22-microglobulin. FcRn regulates the catabolism of IgGs and their transcytosis across tissues (Ghetie and Ward, 200018:739-766; Ghetie and Ward, 200225:97-113). The IgG-FcRn interaction takes place at pH 6.0 (pH of intracellular vesicles) but not at pH 7.4 (pH of blood); this interaction enables IgGs to be recycled back to the circulation (Ghetie and Ward, 200018:739-766; Ghetie and Ward, 200225:97-113). The region on human IgGinvolved in FcRn binding has been mapped (Shields et al., 2001276:6591-604). Alanine substitutions at positions Pro238, Thr256, Thr307, Gln311, Asp312, Glu380, Glu382, or Asn434 of human IgGenhance FcRn binding (Shields et al., 2001276:6591-604). IgGmolecules harboring these substitutions are expected to have longer serum half-lives. Consequently, these modified IgGmolecules may be able to carry out their effector functions, and hence exert their therapeutic efficacies, over a longer period of time compared to unmodified IgG.","In some embodiments, the binding agents of the present invention having impaired binding to one or more Fc\u03b3R retain, at least to some extent, the ability to bind FcRn. In some embodiments, the binding agents, which have impaired binding to one or more Fc\u03b3R, retain the ability to bind FcRn. The ability of an antibody or derivative thereof or other binding agent to bind to FcRn can be measured by techniques known in the art (e.g., Shields et al., 2001276:6591-604).","A CD19 binding agent modified with respect to effector function may, in some embodiments, have improved internalization capability and\/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al. 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. J. Immunol. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research 53:2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230 (1989).","In certain embodiments, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region in order to affect the binding interaction of the Fc region with the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor.

In some embodiments, an amino acid substitution of the native amino acid to a cysteine residue is introduced at amino acid position 332, according to the Kabat numbering system.","In some embodiments, to further increase the serum half life of a CD19 binding agent of the present invention, a salvage receptor binding epitope of the binding agent may be modified as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term \u201csalvage receptor binding epitope\u201d refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo scrum half-life of the IgG molecule. Alternatively, the serum half-life of a CD19 binding agent may be increased by modifying the Fc region of an antibody (e.g., IgG constant domain) with respect to binding to Fc gamma (Fc\u03b3) receptors, as described infra.","Antibodies may be glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (see, e.g., Jefferis and Lund, 199765:111-128; Wright and Morrison, 199715:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins can affect the protein's function (see, e.g., Boyd et al., 199632:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, 199029:4175-4180), and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (see, e.g., Jefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 19967:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. For example, it has been reported that in agalactosylated IgG, the oligosaccharide moiety \u2018flips\u2019 out of the inter-C2 space and terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues become available to bind mannose binding protein (see, e.g., Malhotra et al., 19951:237-243). Removal by glycopeptidase of the oligosaccharides from CAMPATH-1H (a recombinant humanized murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody which recognizes the CDw52 antigen of human lymphocytes) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells resulted in a complete reduction in complement mediated lysis (CMCL) (Boyd et al., 199632:1311-1318), while selective removal of sialic acid residues using neuraminidase resulted in no loss of DMCL. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect ADCC. In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of \u03b2(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (see, e.g., Umana et al., 199917:176-180).","Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.","Glycosylation derivatives of antibodies are derivatives in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. Certain antibodies of the present invention have altered glycosylation patterns. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody, changing the composition of glycosylation (i.e., glycosylation pattern), the extent of glycosylation, or the like. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention have reduced core fucosylation.","Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody can be conveniently accomplished, for example, by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made, for example, by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites). Similarly, removal of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by amino acid alteration within the native glycosylation sites of the antibody.","The amino acid sequence is usually altered by altering the underlying nucleic acid sequence. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally-occurring amino acid sequence derivatives) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, or cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared derivative or a non-derivative version of the antibody.","The glycosylation (including glycosylation pattern) of antibodies may also be altered without altering the amino acid sequence or the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g., antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, significant variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected. See, e.g., Hse et al., 1997272:9062-9070. In addition to the choice of host cells, factors which affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes, and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism, including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261; and 5,278,299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered, e.g., made defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.","The glycosylation structure of antibodies can be readily analyzed by conventional techniques of carbohydrate analysis, including lectin chromatography, NMR, mass spectrometry, HPLC, GPC, monosaccharide compositional analysis, sequential enzymatic digestion, and HPAEC-PAD, which uses high pH anion exchange chromatography to separate oligosaccharides based on charge. Methods for releasing oligosaccharides for analytical purposes are also known, and include, without limitation, enzymatic treatment (commonly performed using peptide-N-glycosidase F\/endo-\u03b2-galactosidase), elimination using harsh alkaline environment to release mainly O-linked structures, and chemical methods using anhydrous hydrazine to release both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides.","The following table provides a summary of the regions of chimeric and humanized BU12 to which each sequence identifier (SEQ ID NO.)

A humanized antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region of SEQ ID NO:9 and a light chain variable region of SEQ ID NO:17 has all six intact CDRs from the mouse BU12 antibody and entirely human variable region framework amino acids. In contrast to many other humanized antibodies, such an antibody has useful binding affinity to its antigen even without any further substitutions. However, such an antibody also provides a starting point for making variants. Some such variants comprise a heavy chain variable region having at least 90% sequence identity (spanning its entire length) to SEQ ID NO:9 and a light chain variable region having at least 90% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:17. Some variants have no more than 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acids that differ from SEQ ID NO:9 in the heavy chain variable region and no more than 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acids that differ from SEQ ID NO:17 in the light chain variable region.","Some variants differ from the above antibody by substitution of one or more amino acids in the variable region framework relative to SEQ ID NO:9 or SEQ ID NO:17. The substitution can be with an amino acid occupying the corresponding position (unless otherwise indicated positions are by Kabat numbering) in the heavy or light chain variable region respectively of the BU12 antibody (sometimes referred to as a donor antibody). Substitutions with donor amino acids often increase the affinity of the resulting humanized antibody for its antigen by conferring a framework conformation in the humanized antibody more closely resembling that in the donor mouse antibody. A donor substitution at position L83 is particularly advantageous in increasing affinity as shown in  (compare light chain G with the substitution and A without the substitution). Other positions differing between SEQ ID NO:9 and the BU12 heavy chain in which donor substitutions can be performed include, for example, H24, H27, H29, H71, H75, H789, H79, and H89 in which, after donor substitution, the positions are occupied by F, F, L, K, S, V, F, and A respectively. Light chain variable region framework positions differing between SEQ ID NO:17 and the BU12 light chain include positions L2, L40, L41, L42, L69, L70, L71, L72 and L83 occupied by N, S, S, T, N, S, H, F, and V respectively in the mouse BU12 light chain. The effect of many of these substitutions on antibody affinity is also shown in . It can be seen that some of these substitutions or combinations of substitutions increase affinity. Some preferred heavy chain substitution include one or more of H71, H75, H78 and H79 occupied by K, S, V, and F respectively after donor substitution. Some preferred light chain substitutions include one or more of positions L2, L69, L71, L72 and L83 occupied by N,N, H, F, and V respectively after donor substitution. None of the tested substitutions or combinations of substitutions caused an unacceptable loss of affinity.","How many donor substitutions to include reflects a balance of competing considerations. In general, substitutions which significantly increase affinity are desirable. However, minimizing the total number of variable region framework substitutions is also advantageous in reducing potential immunogenicity. A humanized antibody having no substitutions in the heavy chain variable region framework and a L83 donor substitution of the light chain variable region framework represents a preferred balance between maximizing affinity and minimizing immunogenicity. Many other permutations are possible.","As well as or instead of donor substitutions, a variable region framework amino acid can be substituted with the amino acid occupying the corresponding position in another human antibody sequence or a consensus of human antibody sequences (see, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 7,022,500). The rationale for such a substitution is often to substitute a relatively rare amino acid in human immunoglobulin sequences with a more common amino acid for that position with a view to reducing immunogenicity. In humanized antibodies in which the variable region frameworks are provided by germline sequences, such substitutions are possible but generally not necessary because germline sequences lack rare amino acids that may be introduced by somatic mutation.","Variable region framework amino acids can also be substituted with amino acids that are neither donor amino acids or consensus amino acids. Such substitutions are preferably conservative amino acid substitutions. Although many substitutions have little effect on affinity, they may increase immunogenicity and thus in general are not preferred.","Substitution of one or more CDR residues or omission of one or more CDRs is also possible. Numerous antibodies have been described in the scientific literature in which one or two CDRs can be dispensed with for binding. Padlan et al., FASEB Journal 9: 133-139 (1995) analyzed the contact regions between antibodies and their antigens, based on published crystal structures, and concluded that only about one fifth to one third of CDR residues actually contact the antigen. Padlan et al. termed these residues SDR (for specificity determining residues). Padlan also found many antibodies in which one or two CDRs had no amino acids in contact with an antigen. Likewise, Vajdos et al (Journal of Molecular Biology, vol. 320, pp. 415-428 (2002) reported that CDR1 of the light chain of an antibody against ErbB2 was not involved in binding. Such teaching has been applied to antibody humanization by, for example, Iwahashi et al., Mol. Immunol. 36:1079-1091, (1999), who showed that they could graft only L1 and L3, or L2 and L3, of the CR49 murine antibody onto a human framework and retain high affinity interaction with the antigen. Similarly, Tamura et al, Journal of Immunology, 2000, 164:1432-1441 (2000) reported that light chain CDRs 1 and 2 could be dispensed with entirely in a humanized anti-carcinoma antibody, as could several residues in the remaining CDRs. The substitution of certain regions within CDRs is based on the same principle as omitting dispensable CDRs, namely that only a small subset of CDR residues, the SDR's, actually contact antigen.","CDR residues not contacting antigen can be identified based on previous studies (for example residues H60-H65 in CDRH2 are often not required), from regions of Kabat CDRs lying outside Chothia CDRs, by molecular modeling and\/or empirically. If a CDR or residue(s) thereof is omitted, it is usually substituted with an amino acid occupying the corresponding position in human acceptor sequence supplying the variable region framework sequences (in this example, VH4-31\/JH4 for the heavy chain and VL-L6 JK2 for the light chain). The number of such substitutions to include reflects a balance of competing considerations Such substitutions are potentially advantageous in decreasing the number of mouse amino acids in a humanized antibody and consequently decreasing potential immunogenicity. However, substitutions can also cause changes of affinity, and significant reductions in affinity are preferably avoided. Positions for substitution within CDRs and amino acids to substitute can also be selected empirically. Empirical substitutions can be conservative or non-conservative substitutions. However, in general empirical substitutions do not have the advantage of mouse to human substitutions in reducing immunogenicity. Empirical substitutions can increase or decrease affinity of the resulting humanized antibody.","In general humanized antibodies with satisfactory binding affinity to CD19 and lack of substantial immunogenicity can be obtained by individual screening of variants made according to the above principles and\/or in accordance with the present examples. However, very large numbers of variants can be simultaneously screened using a display selection method such as phage display (see (Dower et al., WO91\/17271; McCafferty et al., WO92\/001047; and Winter, WO92\/20791). The same considerations apply mutatis mutandis in designing variants of other humanized antibodies or antibody chains disclosed herein. For example, SEQ ID NO:2 provides an alternative starting point to SEQ ID NO:9 for design of heavy chain variants. SEQ ID NO:2 comprises the three heavy chain CDRs of the BU12 antibody with a fully human variable region framework sequence of the VH2-70 and JH4 genes. SEQ ID NO:26 provides an alternative starting point to SEQ ID NO:17 for design of light chain variants. SEQ ID NO:26 comprises the three light chain CDRs of the BU12 antibody in a fully human framework sequence of the A10 and JK2 genes. Specific heavy chain variable region framework positions for potential substitution and the amino acids to substitute into such positions are indicated in the table \u201cnon-homologous FR residues BU12 v.s VH431) in Example 1. Specific light chain variable region framework positions for potential substitution in SEQ ID NO:26 are indicated in the table \u201cNono-homologous FR residues BU12 VL vs. L6 and A10\u201d in Example 2.","The present invention encompasses embodiments wherein the heavy chain variable region further comprises a leader sequence.

Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (see, e.g., Milstein et al., 1983305:537-39). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of different antibody molecules, of which one has the correct bispecific structure. Similar procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 199110:3655-59.","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion typically is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C2, and C3 regions. In some embodiments, the fusion includes a first heavy-chain constant region (C1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In an example of this approach, the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 94\/04690, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","For further discussion of bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 1986121:210; Rodrigues et al., 1993151:6954-61; Carter et al., 199210:163-67; Carter et al., 19954:463-70; Merchant et al., 199816:677-81.

In certain embodiments, an anti-CD19 antibody derivative comprises an anti-CD19 antibody (e.g., an intact antibody, an antigen-binding fragment or conservatively substituted polypeptide) and at least one polypeptide region or other moiety heterologous to the anti-CD19 antibody. For example, an anti-CD19 antibody can be modified, e.g., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule, such that the covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody derivative from specifically binding to CD19 via the antigen-binding region or region derived therefrom, or, if desired, the effector region or portion thereof from specifically binding Fc receptor. Typical modifications include, e.g., glycosylation, deglycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, and the like. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc.","In some embodiments, the antibody derivative is a multimer, such as, for example, a dimer, comprising one or more monomers, where each monomer includes (i) an antigen-binding region of an anti-CD19 antibody, or a polypeptide region derived therefrom (such as, for example, by conservative substitution of one or more amino acids), and (ii) a multimerizing (e.g., dimerizing) polypeptide region, such that the antibody derivative forms multimers (e.g., homodimers) that specifically bind to CD19. In typical embodiments, an antigen binding region of an anti-CD19 antibody, or a polypeptide region derived therefrom, is recombinantly or chemically fused with a heterologous protein, wherein the heterologous protein comprises a dimerization or multimerization domain. Prior to administration of the antibody derivative to a subject for the purpose of treating or preventing CD19-expressing cancers, the derivative is subjected to conditions that allow formation of a homodimer or heterodimer. A heterodimer, as used herein, may comprise identical dimerization domains but different CD19 antigen-binding regions, identical CD19 antigen-binding regions but different dimerization domains, or different CD19 antigen-binding regions and dimerization domains.","Typical dimerization domains are those that originate from transcription factors. In one embodiment, the dimerization domain is that of a basic region leucine zipper (\u201cbZIP\u201d) (see, e.g., Vinson et al., 1989246:911-916). Useful leucine zipper domains include, for example, those of the yeast transcription factor GCN4, the mammalian transcription factor CCAAT\/enhancer-binding protein C\/EBP, and the nuclear transform in oncogene products, Fos and Jun. (See, e.g., Landschultz et al., 1988240:1759-64; Baxevanis and Vinson, 19933:278-285; O'Shea et al., 1989243:538-542.) In another embodiment, the dimerization domain is that of a basic region helix-loop-helix (\u201cbHLH\u201d) protein. (See Murre et al., 198956:777-783. See also Davis et al., 199060:733-746; Voronova and Baltimore, 199087:4722-26.) Particularly useful hHLH proteins are myc, max, and mac.","In yet other embodiments, the dimerization domain is an immunoglobulin constant region such as, for example, a heavy chain constant region or a domain thereof (e.g., a C1 domain, a C2 domain, and\/or a C3 domain). (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,027; 5,336,603; 5,359,046; and 5,349,053; EP 0 367 166; and WO 96\/04388.)","Heterodimers are known to form between Fos and Jun (Bohmann et al., 1987238:1386-1392), among members of the ATF\/CREB family (Hai et al., 19893:2083-2090), among members of the C\/EBP family (Cao et al., 19915:1538-52; Williams et al., 19915:1553-67; Roman et al., 19904:1404-15), and between members of the ATF\/CREB and Fos\/Jun families (Hai and Curran, 199188:3720-24). Therefore, when a CD19 binding agent is administered to a subject as a heterodimer comprising different dimerization domains, any combination of the foregoing may be used.","In other embodiments, an anti-CD19 antibody derivative is an anti-CD19 antibody conjugated to a second antibody (an \u201cantibody heteroconjugate\u201d) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980). Heteroconjugates can be formed, for example, between an antibody that binds to CD19 and an antibody that binds to a surface receptor or receptor complex that mediates ADCC, phagocytosis, and\/or CDC, such as CD16\/Fc\u03b3RIII, CD64\/Fc\u03b3RI, killer cell activating or inhibitory receptors, or the complement control protein CD59. In one embodiment, the binding of the portion of the multispecific antibody to the second cell surface molecule or receptor complex enhances the effector functions of an anti-CD19 antibody.","Antibodies and other binding agents can be assayed for specific binding to CD19 (e.g., human CD19) by any of various known methods. Immunoassays which can be used include, for example, competitive and non-competitive assay systems. Such assays are routine and well-known in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds., (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 4th ed. 1999); Harlow and Lane, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999.))","Further, the binding affinity of a CD19 binding agent (e.g., anti-CD19 antibody or derivative thereof) to CD19 and the off-rate of a binding agent-CD19 interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled CD19 (e.g., H or I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled CD19, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled CD19. The affinity of the antibody for CD19 and the binding off-rates can then be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, CD19 is incubated with the antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., H or I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. Alternatively, the binding affinity of an antibody to CD19 and the on- and off-rates of an antibody-CD19 interaction can be determined by surface plasmon resonance. In some embodiments, the anti-CD19 antibodies or derivatives thereof can be targeted to and accumulate on the membrane of a CD19-expressing cell.","CD19 binding agents (e.g., anti-CD19 antibody or derivative thereof) can be produced by methods known in the art for the synthesis of proteins, typically, e.g., by recombinant expression techniques. Recombinant expression of an antibody or derivative thereof typically involves construction of an expression vector containing a nucleic acid that encodes the binding agent. A vector for the production of the protein molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques known in the art. Standard techniques such as, for example, those described in Sambrook and Russell, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 3rd ed., 2001); Sambrook et al., (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2nd ed., 1989); (Ausubel et al., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 4th ed., 1999); and Glick and Pasternak, (ASM Press, Washington, D.C., 2nd ed., 1998) can be used for recombinant nucleic acid methods, nucleic acid synthesis, cell culture, transgene incorporation, and recombinant protein expression.","For example, for recombinant expression of an anti-CD19 antibody, an expression vector may encode a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. An expression vector may include, for example, the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464), and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain. The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques, and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the anti-CD19 antibody. In typical embodiments for the expression of double-chain antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains can be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule.","A variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic host-expression vector systems can be utilized to express a CD19 binding agent (e.g., anti-CD19 antibody or derivative thereof). Typically, eukaryotic cells, particularly for whole recombinant anti-CD19 antibody molecules, are used for the expression of the recombinant protein. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO; e.g., DG44), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus, is an effective expression system for the production of anti-CD19 antibodies and derivatives thereof (see, e.g., Foecking et al., 198645:101; Cockett et al., 19908:2). CD19 binding agents can also be expressed using the CHEF system. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,809.)","Other host-expression systems include, for example, plasmid-based expression systems in bacterial cells (see, e.g., Ruther et al., 19831, 2:1791; Inouye and Inouye, 198513:3101-3109; Van Heeke and Schuster, 198924:5503-5509); insect systems such as, e.g., the use of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) expression vector in cells; and viral-based expression systems in mammalian cells, such as, e.g., adenoviral-based systems (see, e.g., Logan and Shenk, 198481:355-359; Bittner et al., 1987153:51-544).","In addition, a host cell strain can be chosen that modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation, and cleavage) of the protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript and gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include, for example, CHO, VERO, BHK, HeLa, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, and W138.","A stable expression system is typically used for long-term, high-yield production of a recombinant CD19 binding agent. For example, cell lines that stably express the anti-CD19 antibody or derivative thereof can be engineered by transformation of host cells with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites) and a selectable marker, followed by growth of the transformed cells in a selective media. The selectable marker confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the DNA into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. A number of selection systems can be used, including, for example, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, which can be employed in tk, hgprt or aprt cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate; gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid; neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology can be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al., eds., in the series of laboratory technique manuals, 1987-1999 1994-1999 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.); Kriegler, (Stockton Press, N.Y., 1990); (Dracopoli et al. eds., John Wiley and Sons, N.Y., 1994, Chapters 12 and 13); and Colberre-Garapin et al., 1981150:1.","The expression levels of an antibody or derivative can be increased by vector amplification. (See generally Bebbington and Hentschel, , Vol. 3 (Academic Press, New York, 1987).) When a marker in the vector system expressing an anti-CD19 antibody or derivative thereof is amplifiable, an increase in the level of inhibitor present in host cell culture media will select host cells that have increased copy number of a marker gene conferring resistance to the inhibitor. The copy number of an associated antibody gene will also be increased, thereby increasing expression of the antibody or derivative thereof (see, e.g., Crouse et al., 1983, Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257).","Where a CD19 binding agent comprises both a heavy and a light chain, the host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors, the first vector encoding the heavy chain protein and the second vector encoding the light chain protein. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain proteins. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing, both heavy and light chain proteins. In such situations, the light chain is typically placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (see, e.g., Proudfoot, 1986322:52; Kohler, 198077:2197). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once a CD19 binding agent has been produced (e.g., by an animal, chemical synthesis, or recombinant expression), it can be purified by any suitable method for purification of proteins, including, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange or affinity chromatography (such as, for example, Protein A chromatography for purification of antibodies having an intact Fc region)), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. An anti-CD19 antibody or derivative thereof can, for example, be fused to a marker sequence, such as a peptide, to facilitate purification by affinity chromatography. Suitable marker amino acid sequences include, e.g., a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), and the \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., 198437:767), and the \u201cflag\u201d tag.","Typically, the CD19 binding agent is substantially purified (e.g., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). In some embodiments, the CD19 binding agent is at least about 40% pure, at least about 50% pure, or at least about 60% pure. In some embodiments, the CD19 binding agent is at least about 60-65%, 65-70%, 70-75%, 75-80%, 80-85%, 85-90%, 90-95%, or 95-98% pure. In some embodiments, the CD19 binding agent is approximately 99% pure.","Further CD19 binding agents can include fusion proteins (i.e., proteins that are recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated, including both covalent and non-covalent conjugation) to heterologous proteins (of typically at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or at least 100 amino acids). In some embodiments, such a CD19 binding agent includes the amino acid sequence of a humanized heavy and\/or light chain variable region that specifically binds to CD19 and optionally an immunoglobulin effector region or a functional equivalent thereof. As used herein, a functional equivalent of an immunoglobulin effector region binds to an Fc receptor on an immune cell with phagocytic or lytic activity, or the immunoglobulin effector region binds to one or more components of the complement system. The linkage of the CD19 binding portion to the heterologous protein is not necessarily direct, but may occur through a linker sequence(s).","For example, a CD19 binding agent can be produced recombinantly by fusing a humanized variable region in frame with a sequence coding for a heterologous protein. The heterologous protein optionally can include an effector region or a functional equivalent thereof and may provide one or more of the following characteristics: promote stable expression; provide a means of facilitating high yield recombinant expression; and\/or provide a multimerization domain.","A CD19 binding agent can be identified using any method suitable for screening for protein-protein interactions. Typically, proteins are initially identified by their ability to specifically bind to CD19. Among the traditional methods which can be employed are \u201cinteraction cloning\u201d techniques which entail probing expression libraries with labeled CD19 in a manner similar to the technique of antibody probing of \u03bbgt11 libraries. By way of example and not limitation, this can be achieved as follows: a cDNA clone encoding CD19 can be modified at the C-terminus by inserting the phosphorylation site for the heart muscle kinase (HMK) (see, e.g., Blanar and Rutter, 1992256:1014-18). The recombinant protein is expressed in and purified on a GDP-affinity column to homogeneity (Edery et al., 198874:517-25) and labeled using \u03b3P-ATP and bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Mo.) to a specific activity of 1\u00d710cpm\/\u03bcg, and used to screen a human placenta \u03bbgt11 cDNA library in a \u201cfar-Western assay\u201d (Blanar and Rutter, 1992256:1014-18). Plaques that interact with the CD19 probe are isolated. The cDNA inserts of positive \u03bb plaques are released and subcloned into a vector suitable for sequencing, such as pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.).","One method which detects protein interactions in vivo is the two-hybrid system. One version of this system has been described (Chien et al., 199188:9578-82) and is commercially available from Clontech (Palo Alto, Calif.).","Ligand-Drug Conjugate Compounds","The present invention provides, inter alia, ligand-drug conjugate compounds for targeted delivery of drugs. The inventors have made the discovery that the ligand-drug conjugate compounds have potent cytotoxic and\/or cytostatic activity against B cells expressing CD19. The ligand-drug conjugate compounds comprise a Ligand unit covalently linked to at least one Drug unit. The Drug units can be covalently linked directly or via a Linker unit (-LU-).","In some embodiments, the ligand drug conjugate compound has the following formula:\n\nL-(LU-D)\u2003\u2003(I)\n","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof; wherein:","L is the Ligand unit, i.e., CD19 binding agent of the present invention, and","(LU-D) is a Linker unit-Drug unit moiety, wherein:","LU- is a Linker unit, and","-D is a drug unit having cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against a target cell; and","p is an integer from 1 to about 20.","In some embodiments, p ranges from 1 to 10, 1 to 9, 1 to 8, 1 to 7, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 1 to 2. In some embodiments, p ranges from 2 to 10, 2 to 9, 2 to 8, 2 to 7, 2 to 6, 2 to 5, 2 to 4 or 2 to 3. In other embodiments, p is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. In some embodiments, p is 2 or 4.","In some embodiments, the ligand drug conjugate compound has the following formula:\n\nL-(A-W\u2014Y-D)\u2003\u2003(II)\n","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof;","wherein:","L is the Ligand unit, i.e. CD19 binding agent; and","-A-W\u2014Y\u2014 is a Linker unit (LU), wherein:","-A- is a Stretcher unit,","a is 0 or 1,","each \u2014W\u2014 is independently an Amino Acid unit,","w is an integer ranging from 0 to 12,","\u2014Y\u2014 is a self-immolative spacer unit,","y is 0, 1 or 2;","-D is a drug units having cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against the target cell; and","p is an integer from 1 to about 20.","In some embodiments, a is 0 or 1, w is 0 or 1, and y is 0, 1 or 2. In some embodiments, a is 0 or 1, w is 0 or 1, and y is 0 or 1. In some embodiments, p ranges from 1 to 10, 1 to 9, 1 to 8, 1 to 7, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 1 to 2. In some embodiments, p ranges from 2 to 8, 2 to 7, 2 to 6, 2 to 5, 2 to 4 or 2 to 3. In other embodiments, p is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. In some embodiments, p is 2 or 4. In some embodiments, when w is not zero, y is 1 or 2. In some embodiments, when w is 1 to 12, y is 1 or 2. In some embodiments, w is 2 to 12 and y is 1 or 2. In some embodiments, a is 1 and w and y are 0.","The drug loading is represented by p, the average number of drug molecules per Ligand, e.g., antibody in a molecule. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drugs (D) per Ligand. The average number of drugs per ligand in preparation of conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of Ligand-Drug-Conjugates in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous Ligand-Drug-conjugates where p is a certain value from Ligand-Drug-Conjugates with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. In exemplary embodiments, p is from 2 to 8.","The generation of ligand-drug conjugate compounds can be accomplished by any technique known to the skilled artisan. Briefly, the ligand-drug conjugate compounds comprise a CD19 binding agent as the ligand unit, a drug, and optionally a linker that joins the drug and the binding agent. A number of different reactions are available for covalent attachment of drugs and\/or linkers to binding agents. This is often accomplished by reaction of the amino acid residues of the binding agent, e.g., antibody molecule, including the amine groups of lysine, the free carboxylic acid groups of glutamic and aspartic acid, the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine and the various moieties of the aromatic amino acids. One of the most commonly used non-specific methods of covalent attachment is the carbodiimide reaction to link a carboxy (or amino) group of a compound to amino (or carboxy) groups of the antibody. Additionally, bifunctional agents such as dialdehydes or imidoesters have been used to link the amino group of a compound to amino groups of an antibody molecule. Also available for attachment of drugs to binding agents is the Schiff base reaction. This method involves the periodate oxidation of a drug that contains glycol or hydroxy groups, thus forming an aldehyde which is then reacted with the binding agent. Attachment occurs via formation of a Schiff base with amino groups of the binding agent. Isothiocyanates can also be used as coupling agents for covalently attaching drugs to binding agents. Other techniques are known to the skilled artisan and within the scope of the present invention.","In certain embodiments, an intermediate, which is the precursor of the linker, is reacted with the drug under appropriate conditions. In certain embodiments, reactive groups are used on the drug and\/or the intermediate. The product of the reaction between the drug and the intermediate, or the derivatized drug, is subsequently reacted with the CD19 binding agent under appropriate conditions.","Each of the particular units of the ligand-drug conjugate compounds is described in more detail herein. The synthesis and structure of exemplary linker units, stretcher units, amino acid units, self-immolative spacer unit, and drug units are also described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003-0083263, 2005-0238649 and 2005-0009751, each if which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.","Linker Units","Typically, the ligand-drug conjugate compounds comprise a linker region between the drug unit and the ligand unit. In some embodiments, the linker is cleavable under intracellular conditions, such that cleavage of the linker releases the drug unit from the ligand in the intracellular environment. In yet other embodiments, the linker unit is not cleavable and the drug is released, for example, by antibody degradation.","In some embodiments, the linker is cleavable by a cleaving agent that is present in the intracellular environment (e.g., within a lysosome or endosome or caveolea). The linker can be, e.g., a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long or at least three amino acids long. Cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin, all of which are known to hydrolyze dipeptide drug derivatives resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see, e.g., Dubowchik and Walker, 199983:67-123). Most typical are peptidyl linkers that are cleavable by enzymes that are present in CD19-expressing cells. For example, a peptidyl linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B, which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a Phe-Leu or a Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly linker (SEQ ID NO: 52)). Other examples of such linkers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. In a specific embodiment, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit linker or a Phe-Lys linker (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, which describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the val-cit linker). One advantage of using intracellular proteolytic release of the therapeutic agent is that the agent is typically attenuated when conjugated and the serum stabilities of the conjugates are typically high.","In other embodiments, the cleavable linker is pH-sensitive, i.e., sensitive to hydrolysis at certain pH values. Typically, the pH-sensitive linker hydrolyzable under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is hydrolyzable in the lysosome (e.g., a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal, ketal, or the like) can be used. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,368; 5,824,805; 5,622,929; Dubowchik and Walker, 199983:67-123; Neville et al., 1989264:14653-14661.) Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. In certain embodiments, the hydrolyzable linker is a thioether linker (such as, e.g., a thioether attached to the therapeutic agent via an acylhydrazone bond (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,929).","In yet other embodiments, the linker is cleavable under reducing conditions (e.g., a disulfide linker). A variety of disulfide linkers are known in the art, including, for example, those that can be formed using SATA (N-succinimidyl-5-acetylthioacetate), SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate), SPDB (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)butyrate) and SMPT (N-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyl-dithio)toluene), SPDB and SMPT (See, e.g., Thorpe et al., 198747:5924-5931; Wawrzynczak et al., In (C. W. Vogel ed., Oxford U. Press, 1987. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,935.)","In yet other specific embodiments, the linker is a malonate linker (Johnson et al., 199515:1387-93), a maleimidobenzoyl linker (Lau et al., 1995--3(10):1299-1304), or a 3\u2032-N-amide analog (Lau et al., 1995--3(10):1305-12).","In yet other embodiments, the linker unit is not cleavable and the drug is released by antibody degradation. (See U.S. Publication No. 20050238649 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes).","Typically, the linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, \u201cnot substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,\u201d in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, typically no more than about 15%, more typically no more than about 10%, and even more typically no more than about 5%, no more than about 3%, or no more than about 1% of the linkers, in a sample of ligand-drug conjugate compound, are cleaved when the ligand-drug conjugate compound presents in an extracellular environment (e.g., in plasma). Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined, for example, by incubating with plasma the ligand-drug conjugate compound for a predetermined time period (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 hours) and then quantitating the amount of free drug present in the plasma.","In other, non-mutually exclusive embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization. In certain embodiments, the linker promotes cellular internalization when conjugated to the therapeutic agent (i.e., in the milieu of the linker-therapeutic agent moiety of the ligand-drug conjugate compound as described herein).

Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of a Ligand Drug conjugate can be measured by: exposing mammalian cells expressing a target protein of the Ligand Drug conjugate in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays can be used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the Ligand Drug conjugate.","For determining whether a Ligand Drug conjugate exerts a cytostatic effect, a thymidine incorporation assay may be used. For example, cancer cells expressing a target antigen at a density of 5,000 cells\/well of a 96-well plated can be cultured for a 72-hour period and exposed to 0.5 \u03bcCi of H-thymidine during the final 8 hours of the 72-hour period. The incorporation of H-thymidine into cells of the culture is measured in the presence and absence of the Ligand Drug conjugate.","For determining cytotoxicity, necrosis or apoptosis (programmed cell death) can be measured. Necrosis is typically accompanied by increased permeability of the plasma membrane; swelling of the cell, and rupture of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis is typically characterized by membrane blebbing, condensation of cytoplasm, and the activation of endogenous endonucleases. Determination of any of these effects on cancer cells indicates that a Ligand Drug conjugate is useful in the treatment of cancers.","Cell viability can be measured by determining in a cell the uptake of a dye such as neutral red, trypan blue, or ALAMAR\u2122 blue (see, e.g., Page et al., 19933:473-476). In such an assay, the cells are incubated in media containing the dye, the cells are washed, and the remaining dye, reflecting cellular uptake of the dye, is measured spectrophotometrically. The protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) can also be used to measure cytoxicity (Skehan et al., 199082:1107-12).","Alternatively, a tetrazolium salt, such as MTT, is used in a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation by detecting living, but not dead, cells (see, e.g., Mosmann, 198365:55-63).","Apoptosis can be quantitated by measuring, for example, DNA fragmentation. Commercial photometric methods for the quantitative in vitro determination of DNA fragmentation are available. Examples of such assays, including TUNEL (which detects incorporation of labeled nucleotides in fragmented DNA) and ELISA-based assays, are described in 1999, no. 2, pp. 34-37 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).","Apoptosis can also be determined by measuring morphological changes in a cell. For example, as with necrosis, loss of plasma membrane integrity can be determined by measuring uptake of certain dyes (e.g., a fluorescent dye such as, for example, acridine orange or ethidium bromide). A method for measuring apoptotic cell number has been described by Duke and Cohen, Current Protocols in Immunology (Coligan et al. eds., 1992, pp. 3.17.1-3.17.16). Cells also can be labeled with a DNA dye (e.g., acridine orange, ethidium bromide, or propidium iodide) and the cells observed for chromatin condensation and margination along the inner nuclear membrane. Other morphological changes that can be measured to determine apoptosis include, e.g., cytoplasmic condensation, increased membrane blebbing, and cellular shrinkage.","The presence of apoptotic cells can be measured in both the attached and \u201cfloating\u201d compartments of the cultures. For example, both compartments can be collected by removing the supernatant, trypsinizing the attached cells, combining the preparations following a centrifugation wash step (e.g., 10 minutes at 2000 rpm), and detecting apoptosis (e.g., by measuring DNA fragmentation). (See, e.g., Piazza et al., 199555:3110-16).","The effects of Ligand Drug conjugates can be tested or validated in animal models. A number of established animal models of cancers are known to the skilled artisan, any of which can be used to assay the efficacy of a Ligand Drug conjugate. Non-limiting examples of such models are described infra. Moreover, small animal models to examine the in vivo efficacies of Ligand Drug conjugates can be created by implanting human tumor cell lines into appropriate immunodeficient rodent strains, e.g., athymic nude mice or SCID mice.","Ligand Unit","The Ligand unit (L) has at least one functional group that can form a bond with a functional group of a Linker unit. Useful functional groups that can be present on a Ligand unit, either naturally, via chemical manipulation or via engineering, include, but are not limited to, sulfhydryl (\u2014SH), amino, hydroxyl, carboxy, the anomeric hydroxyl group of a carbohydrate, and carboxyl. In some embodiments, a Ligand unit functional group is a sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl group is typically a solvent accessible sulfhydryl group, such as a solvent accessible sulfhydryl group on a cysteine residue. Sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reduction of an intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bond of a Ligand. Sulfhydryl groups also can be generated by reaction of an amino group of a lysine moiety of a Ligand using 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) or another sulfhydryl generating reagent.","In some embodiments, one or more sulfhydryl groups are engineered into a Ligand unit, such as by amino acid substitution. For example, a sulfhydryl group can be introduced into a Ligand unit. In some embodiments, a sulfhydryl group is introduced by an amino acid substitution of serine or threonine to a cysteine residue, and\/or by addition of a cysteine residue into a Ligand unit (an engineered cysteine residue). In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is an internal cysteine residue, i.e., not located at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the Ligand moiety.","In an exemplary embodiment, a cysteine residue can be engineered into an antibody heavy or light variable region (e.g., of an antibody fragment, such as a diabody) by amino acid substitution. The amino acid substitution is typically introduced into the framework region and is located distal to the epitope-binding face of the variable region. For example, the amino acid substitution can be at least 10 angstroms, at least 20 angstroms or at least 25 angstroms from the epitope-binding face or the CDRs. Suitable positions for substitution of a cysteine residue can be determined based on the known or predicted three dimensional structures of antibody variable regions. (See generally Holliger and Hudson, 200523(9):1126-1136.) In exemplary embodiments, a serine to cysteine amino acid substitution is introduced at amino acid position 84 of the Vregion and\/or position 14 of the Vregion (according to the numbering system of Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th edition, (Bethesda, Md., NIH) 1991).","To control the number of Drug or Linker unit-Drug units attached to a Ligand unit, one or more cysteine residues can be eliminated by amino acid substitution. For example, the number of solvent accessible cysteine residues in an immunoglobulin hinge region can be reduced by amino acid substitution of cysteine to serine residues.","In some embodiments, a Ligand unit contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7 or 8 solvent-accessible cysteine residues. In some embodiments, a Ligand unit contains 2 or 4 solvent-accessible cysteine residues.","Compositions and Methods of Administration","The CD19 binding agents and ligand-drug conjugate compounds can be in any form that allows for the compound to be administered to a patient for treatment of a CD19-associated disorder. Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the CD19 binding agents and ligand-drug conjugate compounds. Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, and subcutaneous routes. Administration can be, for example by infusion or bolus injection. In certain preferred embodiments, administration of both the chemotherapeutic agent and the antibody-drug conjugate compound is by infusion. Parenteral administration is the preferred route of administration.","The CD19 binding agents and ligand-drug conjugate compounds can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more pharmaceutically compatible ingredients. For example, the pharmaceutical composition typically includes one or more pharmaceutical carriers (e.g., sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like). Water is a more typical carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients are known in the art. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. The formulations correspond to the mode of administration.","In typical embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the pharmaceutical can also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the pharmaceutical is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the pharmaceutical is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be, for example, provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.","The amount of the compound that is effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges.

Incremental quantities of DTNB (217 nmol, then 303.8 nmol) were added to re-oxidize antibody disulfides, thereby reducing the drug loading level to an assayed level of 4.1 drugs\/Ab.","The partially reduced mAb (97 mg, 647 nmol) was conjugated with MMAF by addition of 795 \u03bcL of DMSO to the approximately 9.0 mL of mAb solution, followed by 203.1 \u03bcl of a 19.1 mM DMSO solution of the following compound, maleimidocaproyl-Val-Cit-MMAF (3.88 \u03bcmol).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0623","num":"0623"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00034","num":"00034"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00034","he":"39.96mm","wi":"149.69mm","file":"US08242252-20120814-C00034.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The conjugation reaction was allowed to proceed for 100 minutes at 0\u00b0 C. Residual maleimidocaproyl-Val-Cit-MMAF was quenched by addition of 194 \u03bcL of 100 mM N-acetyl cysteine. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against 4 L of PBS three times using a 25000 MWCO membrane at 4\u00b0 C. to remove DMSO, unreacted or quenched drug, and other small-molecule contaminants resulting from the conjugation process, and concentrated. The product contained 4.1 drugs\/Ab.","Materials and Methods","Flow cytometric analysis to determine CD19 and CD21 expression levels on tumor cell lines: To evaluate CD19 and CD21 copy numbers on tumor cell lines, cells were incubated for 30 minutes on ice with PE-conjugated murine anti-CD19 and anti-CD21 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.), washed with cold staining medium and evaluated with a Becton Dickison FACScan flow cytometer. Quantitative determination of CD19 and CD21 on the cell surface was determined using a DAKO QiFiKit flow cytometric indirect immunofluorescence assay and murine antibodies as described by the manufacturer (DAKO A\/S, Glostrup, Denmark).","Saturation binding studies to determine binding affinity: Cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcg\/ml hBU12 or hBU12-vcMMAE for 0.5 h at 4 C, and washed. One set of cells was transferred to 37\u00b0 C. and harvested at selected timepoints. For detection, a secondary PE-conjugated antibody was used and the amount of remaining surface-bound antibody determined by flow cytometry. Alternatively, cells were incubated on ice with AlexaFluor488-labeled hBU12 antibody or drug conjugates for 1 h, washed with cold PBS, and binding assessed with a Becton Dickison FACScan flow cytometer. The apparent Kd values were determined using the One Site Binding algorithm from Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.).","CD19 internalization kinetic studies: To generate radiolabeled antibody-drug conjugates, custom synthesized [3H]-vcMMAE (24.7 Ci\/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, Calif.) was used to prepare the radiolabeled hBU12-vcMMAE conjugate. Calculations of radioactivity were made. The amount of free drug found inside of the cells from 1 mL of culture was added to the amount of free drug detected in 1 mL of culture medium and this value was used to determine the concentration of total drug released in the cell culture. Triplicate results were averaged and the standard deviation for those values was calculated using the STDEVPA function in Microsoft Excel.","Lysosomal co-localization studies of hBU12 and hBU12-ADCs: Ramos cells were incubated with 1 ug\/ml hBU12 or hBU12-ADCs on ice or for 20 minutes or 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C. After the incubation, the cells were washed with cold PBS to remove unbound antibody or ADC and then fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix\/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). The antibody and ADCs were detected with AlexaFluor-488 labeled goat anti-human IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). Lysosomal compartments were visualized by staining with AlexaFluor647-labeled LAMP-1 antibody (mouse CD107, BD Biosciences). Nuclear compartments were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Fluorescence images were acquired with a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope.","Cytotoxicity and Growth Arrest Assays: Tumor cells were incubated with hBU12 and the drug conjugates for 96 h. Cell viability was measured by Alamar Blue (Biosource International, Camarillo, Calif.) dye reduction as previously reported (Doronina, 2003 #1834). Cells were incubated for 4 h with the dye and dye reduction measured on a Fusion HT fluorescent plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.). Results are reported as IC50, the concentration of compound needed to yield a 50% reduction in viability compared to vehicle-treated cells (control=100%). For growth arrest and apoptosis studies, cells were first treated with the antibody and ADCs and then processed using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Pharmingen), according to the manufacturer's directions. For analysis of cell cycle position following exposure to ADCs, the cells were labeled for 20 minutes with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Nascent DNA synthesis was detected using an anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) and total DNA content was detected with propidium iodide (PI). Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry.","In vivo model of subcutaneous lymphomas and disseminated human leukemias: Localized, subcutaneous and disseminated models of B cell lymphomas were established in SCID mice. For the subcutaneous model, 5\u00d710lymphoma cells were implanted into the right flank of female mice. hBU12 and -ADCs or a control compound were administered when tumor volumes reached 100 mm. Tumor size was monitored at least twice weekly. To establish disseminated disease, 1\u00d710Nalm6 cells or RS4;11 cells in 0.2 ml PBS were injected into the lateral tail vein of C.B.-17 SCID mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, Ind.). Mice were treated with test compounds 7 days after cells injection and monitored at least twice per week. Mice were terminated when they exhibited signs of disease including weight loss of 15-20%, hunched posture and lack of grooming, cranial swelling and hind limb paralysis. Treatment schedules are as indicated in the figure legends.","Statistical analysis: Tumor quadrupling or triplication times (as indicated) were chosen as time to endpoint (TTE), which were determined by using a non-linear regression analysis for exponential growth of each individual tumor growth data set from each experimental animal. The tumor quadrupling time was calculated based on the tumor volume at the beginning of treatment. Animals that did not reach the endpoint were assigned a TTE value equal to the last day of the study. % TGD (tumor growth delay) reflects the delay in reaching TTE relative to control treated tumors, which was determined by using the formula: % TGD=[(T\u2212C)\/C]\u00d7100, where T and C are the median times in days for treated and control groups, to reach TTE, using the start of treatment as day 1. Statistical analysis and graphic presentations were conducted using Graphpad Prism Software version 4.01 (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.). Median tumor growth curves show group median tumor volumes as a function of time. The Log rank test was used to analyze the significance of the differences between TTE of treated and control tumor groups, with differences deemed significant (*) at 0.01<P<0.05, and highly significant (**) at P<0.01. In a CR response, the tumor volume is less than 13.5 mmfor three consecutive measurements during the course of the study. A durable response (DR) is defined as complete absence of palpable tumor during the entire experiment. Standard Pearson correlation analysis (two tailed) was employed, using a 95% confidence interval, to determine significant correlations between CD19 and CD21 expression levels and in vitro cytotoxicity.","Development of Rituxan resistant Ramos and Raji tumors: Parental cells were implanted into 40 SCID mice at a concentration of 5\u00d710cells per mouse. 2 days following cell implant, mice were treated with rituximab at 8 mg\/kg every other day for a total of 9 doses. Out of the 40 mice, roughly 6 developed tumors, when the tumors were approximately 300-400 mm3, the mice were euthanized and the tumors were collected aseptically. Tumors were made into a single cell suspension through disassociation through a nylon filter. While in culture the cells were continuously exposed to various levels of rituximab up to 100 ug\/ml. Cell viability was verified several times per week. After one week in culture the cells were implanted into 30 SCID mice. Two days after implant the mice were treated with rituximab at 12 mg\/kg in the schedule as before. The in vitro and in vivo selection was repeated once more in 10 SCID mice. The resulting tumors were processed into single cell suspension and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The Raji R2 and Raji H4 cell lines were generated as described in Czuczamn et al., 2008; 14:1561-1570.","Pharmacokinetic characteristics of hBU12-vcMMAE(4) conjugates: Single doses of hBU12-vcMMAE were administered intra-peritoneally to na\u00efve SCID mice. The scrum samples were collected at scheduled intervals over a period of 11 weeks to obtain composite pharmacokinetic profiles. The samples were analyzed for antibody drug conjugate concentrations by a qualified multiplex bead-capture assay using an anti-MMAE antibody. The pharmacokinetic analysis was done using non-compartmental and compartmental methods.","Results","Lack of correlation between CD19 and CD21 expression and potency of hBU12-vcMMAE against ALL, CLL and NHL tumor cell lines grown in culture: In order to determine the potency of hBU12-vcMMAE, CD19 positive lymphoma and leukemia cells representing Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphomas (FL), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were exposed to increasing concentrations of hBU12-vcMMAE. In addition, the cell surface copy numbers of CD19 and CD21 were determined in order to study a potential correlation between expression of these genes with anti-tumor activity. Potent cytotoxic activity of the hBU12-vcMMAE conjugate was noticed in 15 out of 17 CD19 positive tumor cell lines tested. The T-cell lymphoma cell line Jurkat was used as CD19 negative control cell line. The absence of activity of hBU12-vcMMAE on these control cells suggested that the anti-tumor activity was target dependent. A lack of significant correlations between ADC potency and the levels of CD19 (p=0.45, R2=0.038) and CD21 (p=0.55, R2=0.028) expression was noticed (data not shown). In addition, similar potent cytotoxic effects of hBU12-vcMMAE against ALL cell lines were found. In sum, the data demonstrates that CD19 and CD21 expression levels and the tumor subtypes are insufficient to predict the sensitivities of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines towards auristatin based ADCs.","Internalization kinetics and intracellular trafficking of hBU12-vcMMAE in NHL cell lines: A critical parameter previously shown to determine the anti-tumor effects of certain auristatin based ADCs is the ability of the target antigen to internalize and to translocate to the lysosomal compartment following ligation by the antibody. To study these processes, CD21 low (Ramos and SUDHL-4) and CD21 high tumor cell lines (Raji, Daudi) were incubated with hBU12-vcMMAE and the internalization kinetics by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was determined. As shown in , hBU12 and hBU12-vcMMAE conjugates internalized rapidly in CD21 low Ramos cells, and >50% of the compounds internalized within 60 minutes post incubation. Somewhat slower internalization kinetics of hBU12-vcMMAE were found in CD21 high Raji and Daudi cells. However, the small differences in internalization kinetics did not significantly affect potency, and comparable 1050 values between CD21 low Ramos cells and CD21 high lymphomas were found. Combined, the findings demonstrate that the internalization kinetics of hBU12-vcMMAE on different tumor cell lines does not correlate with cytotoxicity in vitro. Intracellular trafficking of hBU12 and hBU12-vcMMAE conjugates in NHL cell lines was investigated. For this purpose, CD21 low Ramos and SUDHL4 cells were incubated with either naked antibody or hBU12-vcMMAE. Co-immunofluorescence studies revealed that the majority of internalized hBU12 localized to lysosomes, starting as early as 15 minutes post incubation. Comparable subcellular translocation of hBU12 and conjugates to the lysosomal compartment was observed between CD21 low Ramos or HT and CD21 high Daudi and Raji cells (data not shown). Combined, the findings demonstrate that internalization kinetics alone are insufficient to explain the differences in hBU12-vcMMAE potencies against different NHL cell lines.","Free drug release by hBU12-vcE in rituximab sensitive and resistant, CD21 high and low lymphoma cell lines: MMAE interferes with microtubule stability in the cytoplasmic compartment and thus, the amounts of active, free MMAE drug released in tumor cells is critical for anti-lymphoma effects. To investigate theses aspects, CD21 high Daudi and CD21 high, rituximab resistant Raji R2 and Raji 4H cells were incubated with hBU12-vcMMAE and the levels of free drug released with CD21 low Ramos cells were compared. The cellular release of free, active drug was quantified by combining the radioactivity that was retained within cells and that had escaped into the supernatant over time. There was no difference in free drug release between CD21 low cells (Ramos) and CD21 high cells (Daudi). Therefore, it is unlikely that variations in free drug release account for the >50 fold differences in the IC50 values between these different lymphoma cell lines. In conclusion, high CD21 levels may only minimally interfere with the intracellular release of free drug from internalized hBU12-vcMMAE.","Efficacy of hBU12 conjugates in models of NHL and ALL hBU12-vcMMAE was tested in single dose and multi dose experiments using different NHL cell lines xenografted into SCID mice ( and data not shown). When tested against Burkitt's lymphoma, 7\/8 durable responses were observed at the 3 mg\/kg hBU12-vcMMAE dose, administered q4dx4 ()). When tested against DOHH2 tumor (Follicular lymphoma), significant inhibition of tumor growth rates as illustrated by 2\/10 DRs at the 3 mg\/kg dose level () were observed. When tested against SUDHL4 lymphomas (DLBCL), there was also a significant inhibition of tumor growth rates (). In the disseminated RS4;11 model representing ALL, a significant increase in survival of mice treated with hBU12-vcMMAE was observed, resulting in a delay of disease onset from \u02dc45 days in control or untreated animals to >90 days in mice treated with 3 mg\/kg of vcE conjugates (). Similar observations were made when testing hBU12-vcMMAE in a second model of disseminated ALL (Nalm6), where single dose administration resulted in 30-60% durable responses ). Combined, these data demonstrate potent anti-tumor effects of hBU12-vcMMAE in different models of NHL and ALL, irrespective of their CD21 expression status.","Antitumor activity hBU12-vcE against rituximab resistant lymphomas: In order to develop a preclinical models that mimic the refractoriness of NHL tumors to rituximab treatment, Ramos tumor cells were generated that were rendered refractory by repeated in vitro and in vivo passaging of tumor cells in mice, concurrent with rituximab treatment as described in materials and methods. To determine the expression levels of CD20 and CD19, cells from R-Ramos tumors were isolated and comparable levels of CD20 and CD19 expression in rituximab resistant Ramos tumors were found (). Compared with high doses of rituximab (12 mg\/kg, q4dx4), hBU12-vcMMAE treatment resulted in a significant difference in % tumor growth delay (TGD) between the parental and rituximab resistant tumors. Importantly, similar antitumor activities by hBU12-vcMMAE in rituximab sensitive and resistant cell lines were found, suggesting that the mechanism rendering NHL cells resistant to rituximab does interfere with hBU12-vcMMAE potency. To further validate these findings, hBU12-vcMMAE was tested in conjunction with two additional, rituximab resistant NHL cell lines described previously (Raji 2R and 4RH 27;  and data not shown), and both cell lines were shown to express similar levels of CD19 and CD20 compared to the parental clone. In support of the previous findings testing rituximab resistant Ramos tumors, hBU12-vcMMAE treatment induced similar durable response compared to the rituximab sensitive parental Raji clone. In conclusion, potent anti-tumor activities for CD19-ADCs on rituximab resistant cell lines were observed.","The ability of the humanized anti-CD19 antibody hBU12 to induce CDC, ADCC and ADCP against human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines was investigated. Potent ADCC and ADCP was found and ADCC was slightly reduced when hBU12 was conjugated to the vcMMAE drug linker. When tested on activated, human primary B-cell isolates, direct anti-proliferative effects of the hBU12 and conjugates was observed. A lack of CDC anti-tumor effects was noticed for all hBU12 compounds. To determine the relevance of effector cell mediates activities for therapeutic activity of hBU12, human lymphoma and leukemia cells were implanted either subcutaneously into SCID mice or via tail vein injections (disseminated model). The most potent anti-tumor effects were observed in disseminated models, consistent with the notion that the access of effector cells to the tumor cells is less limiting in the disseminated model (). In order to identify the nature of the cells mediating anti-tumor effects, effector cell ablation experiments were conducted in a disseminated model of NHL (Ramos). NK cells, neutrophils or macrophages were selectively depleted and the effects on tumor growth inhibition of hBU12 in tumor bearing mice were measured. Ablation of macrophage and neutrophils almost completely abolished the anti-tumor effects of hBU12, while depletion of NK cells was associated with a moderate decrease in activity. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that hBU12 induced anti-tumor effects via effector cell mediated ADCP and ADCC activities.","Material and Methods","For in vivo depletion studies, rabbit anti-asialo-GM-1 antibody was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Richmond, Va.), rat anti-mouse-Gr-1 antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, Calif.). Liposome-encapsulated clodronate (CEL) was prepared as previously described (Van Rooijen and Sanders 1994). Clodronate was a gift of Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Tumor-bearing mice were depleted of effector cells using specific antibody or CEL as described previously (Van Rooijen and Sanders 1994; van Rooijen and Sanders 1997; McEarchern, Oflazoglu et al. 2007). Natural killer (NK) cells were depleted by i.p. injection of anti-asialo-GM 1 (1.25 mg\/kg). Mice were given a total of 3 doses once every 5 days, beginning the day of tumor cell implantation. Macrophages were depleted by i.p. injection of CEL (100 \u03bcl\/10 gr) on the day of tumor injection and every 3 days thereafter for a total of 5 doses. Cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of splenocytes, lymph nodes and blood (data not shown).","SEQ ID NO:1:","Met Gly Arg Leu Thr Ser Ser Phe Leu Leu Leu Ile Val Pro Ala Tyr Val Leu Ser","SEQ ID NO:2:","(CDR regions are underlined.
