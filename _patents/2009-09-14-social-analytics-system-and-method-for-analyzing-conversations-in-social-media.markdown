No. 11\/680,537, filed Feb. 28, 2007, now abandoned which application claims the benefit of and priority to Provisional Application No. 60\/777,975, filed on Feb. 28, 2006, which applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention is generally related to techniques to analyze conversations within a conversational network. More particularly, the present invention is directed to analyzing the influence of social media content and its publishers within a conversational network.","The Internet is increasingly used as a platform for social media. Web logs (blogs) and wikis are two common forms of social media. However, more generally social media may also include interactive aspects, such as voting, comments, and trackback and take many different forms. Referring to , social media generally describes online technologies and practices that people use to share opinions, insights, experience and perspectives with each other. Examples of social media include social networks, blogging systems, media sharing platforms, online forums, and meme aggregators.","Social media is based on widely available tools that provide users the ability to create links and trackbacks that tend to foster and describe their trust relationships. There are several aspects of social media that foster trust relationships. One aspect of social media that fosters trust relationships in social media is the level of dedication of individual publishers. Publishing social media content is an expression of unique interest in a topic. Individuals participating in a conversation around this content invest time to read, trackback, tag, rate, and\/or comment on what is being shared. The level of dedication of the publishers of social media and individuals participating in conversation around it is one factor that promotes trust within social media. The trust relationships also develop due to the ability of individuals participating in a conversation to comment about postings to add context and correct errors. Additionally, social media permits links to be established between publishers. The links between publishers foster the spread of ideas and also permits rapid feedback within the community. Moreover, in social media influential and\/or trusted publishers and other participants in the conversation can lend their weight to the veracity of the postings of other publishers, via links, comments, voting and the like. In the blogosphere, for example, an influential blogger can include links in a posting to other blogs, which increases the influence of the linked blog post on a discussion.","One aspect of social media is that it is highly conversational in nature. As used in this patent application, an individual conversation in social media is a networked discussion about a specific topic between social media publishers. A conversation can also include an interaction between at least one social media publisher and conventional online media, such as an online news source like CNN. A conversational network is comprised of the individuals, sites, and pages participating in online discussions about all topics. A conversation within the network is about a specific topic. An individual publication corresponds to a post that is a single piece of media that can be located by a permalink and which may also contain additional links. An individual publisher is a person or entity that posts social media (e.g., the person or entity associated with one or more permalinked posts).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["150","152","152","152","154","153","156","156","158","166","158","158","153"]},"Conventional Internet search tools have proven inadequate for examination of conversations within social media in terms of understanding the interactions within a dynamic conversation. Conversations in social media can propagate and amplify with astonishing speed. However, the information destination-oriented implementation of conventional Internet search engines does not permit many characteristics of conversations in social media to be adequately understood.","A traditional Internet search engine has a crawling strategy for indexing a broad cross-section of the Internet likely to be of interest to general purpose users. Search engines typically generate results for a query that are described as relevant based on the search criteria and distributed on a curve from \u201cmost relevant\u201d to \u201cleast relevant,\u201d which can be drawn on a relevancy curve, as in . Thus as a hypothetical example, consider again the example of . If a user inputs a search query into a conventional search engine with query terms \u201cApple Laptop Exploding\u201d they might receive 500,000 hits ranked by relevance. A conventional search engine would present a relevant result by seeking pages on which the search term occurs most frequently and also take into account some other relevance factors to rank the hits. Google's Page Rank algorithm, for example, concatenates the number of sites pointing to each page with relevant search terms to identify the site most pointed to by the greatest number of sites with high numbers of inbound links, using those pointers as a proxy for reliability of the data on the page. If so many other sites point to the page, it must be the most correct result for the search, the reasoning goes. This approach skews results to the top of the power curve in  giving sites that produce large numbers of articles and which are pointed to by other sites a disproportionate influence on the results, often long after the site stops producing new relevant content. Thus, for example, referring again to the hypothetical example of , a conventional search engine might give a disproportionate relevance to old articles about laptop batteries.","Another problem of the conventional search engines is that they can be gamed. Consider, for example, the Google search engine. Google is primarily a ranking of web pages based on volumetric analysis. Google's Page Rank calculates the rank of information on a page in response to a search query by concatenating the number of explicit links from other pages associated with the search topic to an undisclosed number of degrees (pages pointing to other pages through a Uniform Resource Identifier, or \u201cURI\u201d), the concept of authority in information has been built on the volumetric notion that the greater the number of links pointing to a given page the more likely it is to be correct. This approach can be gamed by launching sites that point to a page in order to raise its authority (hence, Google must constantly adjust its indexing algorithms to prevent gaming) and suffer from historical skewing-sites. Volumetric determination of authority is prone to many errors and can be skewed by many factors that do not contribute to the user's understanding of how the information reached its current form and authority.","There are various modifications of conventional search engine technology that have been proposed. For example, search engines have been developed which examine popularity of links by timeframe. Determining the popularity by number of links pointing at a page within a given timeframe, such as two week or a month from the current data, limits historical skewing. However, this improvement is still inadequate to understand a conversation in social media. The number of links within the given time frame may be general, including all links to a site, and topic-specific, including just links that deal with a target search phrase. As a consequence, sites which have general links will be over-weighted, and as a result will drown out topic-specific conversation.","Conventional search engines also have another limitation in that they typically do not completely index social media. That is, the index in a conventional search engine does not capture sufficient information to properly represent and\/or analyze a conversation. Conventional search engines are designed as general purpose engines to search the entire Web and have crawling policies that typically do not adequately index social media. One limitation is that conventional search engines rely on crawling of sites directly or capturing new information via Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds to generate indices, which limits the reach of search in several important ways.","First, one limitation of conventional crawling is that recency overwhelms context. No Web index is complete, the best represent perhaps 20 percent of the information on the Web, because the contents of pages must be captured by crawling sites from home page through the last archive page in order to be comprehensive. Because of limited resources and the more general focus of most search indices, crawls tend to cover only a part of the total contents of many Web sites; a crawler, for example, may only look at pages that are three pages below the home page of a site. Since the most recent information tends to reside on archival pages that may be more than three links deep on a site, a site's coverage of a topic will be judged only on the content of the most recent postings rather than the entire body of work the site represents, which underweights sites that are deeply focused on a few narrow topics, such as \u201cIT Management\u201d or \u201cLegal Practice\u201d when other sites become interested in those topics over a short period of time.","Second, another limitation of conventional crawling is that social media often limits the comments exposed through RSS, which means that conventional crawlers may not adequately index social media. In particular, few blogs expose their comments through RSS and those that do tend to separate the comments from the RSS feeds of main postings, eliminating or making far more difficult the analysis of comments in relation to topics discussed on the site. This undercuts the indexer's ability to track cross-linking of discussions within comments and minimizes the role of communities that exist around particular sites when measuring the discussion of topics.","Third, another limitation of conventional crawling is that there is a ping dependence. Indices that rely solely on RSS feeds depend on bloggers and publishers to \u201cping\u201d the index server (that is, which send an Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call (XML-RPC) command asking the index to review recent changes on the target site). Because there are many such indices and more appearing all the time, pinging has actually fragmented the market and forced search companies to form a coalition to share pings, distributing updated posting information to all members. Ping-based systems that are not supplemented by direct crawls of sites do not successfully capture all activity on and around sites in networked conversations.","The various drawbacks of conventional search tools severely limits the capability of individuals to analyze conversations in social media. At one level, conventional search engines will often produce too many hits. For example, a conventional search engine, such as Google, may produce millions of hits from a simple query in which a few search terms are input. On the other hand, a conventional search engine may fail to identify many web postings, due to the previously described problems associated with RSS feeds and the fact that conventional search engines index only a fraction of the Web.","An even more serious weakness of conventional search engines is that a conventional search engine does not provide information directly relevant to understanding the dynamics of a conversation in social media. In particular, the prior art search technology does not provide a capability to understand how conversations in social media are influenced and does not provide an understanding of potential trusted points of entry into a conversation.","Therefore, in light of the previously described problems, the apparatus, method, system, and computer readable medium of the present invention was developed.","A system analyzes social media, where the social media includes content posted in an online content universe distributed on the Internet. A conversation monitoring module monitors conversations in the social media, where an individual conversation is a networked discussion of postings published on the Internet for a particular topic. A social analysis module analyzes content associated with a conversation for social relationships indicative of the evolution of the conversation. In one embodiment the social analysis module includes an influence engine that determines the influence of postings in a selected conversation. In one embodiment, the influence engine determines the influence of postings and publishers who have multiple posts within a selected conversation. In one implementation a trust filter is provided to perform trust filtering of the online content universe and a conversation index is generated of posts published in the social media around trusted relationships.","One embodiment of a method includes generating a conversation index of posts published in an online social media around trusted relationships. The conversation index is analyzed based on a user-defined topic definition of a selected conversation, where the selected conversation is a networked discussion between social media publishers about a particular topic based on the user-defined topic definition. The influence of posts in the selected conversation is determined. In one embodiment, the influence of posts and publishers within the selected conversation is determined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["210","202","204","206","208","202","210","220","222","226","224","230","232","236","239","240","250","252","252","245","256"]},"Determining factors that influence a conversation is useful in many contexts. The output of the influence engine may be used for different applications  such as a brand, product and reputation monitoring application module ; online advertising targeting and delivery application module ; a publisher content network application module  to enable a user to navigate between influential pages based on a set of influencers and publishers about a specific topic as determined by the influence engine; a search engine optimization controls application module ; and influencer relationship management panels application module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["210","230","240","222"]},"In one embodiment, a particular conversation is identified based on a user-defined input topic\/target. As an illustrative example, in on embodiment a set of keywords, Boolean operators, and a URI (or set of URIs) may be input by a user to define a topic of a conversation that a user wishes to explore. A search is then performed of the conversation index, where the conversation index is a searchable index of web conversations that includes topical information, such as relevance; and relationships between publishers, such as relationships between corporate sites, social and mainstream media. The conversation index  accounts for implicit and explicit web user actions which drive the influence of social media posts and publishers. The influence engine  calculates influence in social media networks based on various factors, such as relevance, occurrence, attention, popularity, and traffic. The results may, for example, be used to determine a ranking of influencers for a specific conversation, a social map that is a visual representation of relationships between posts and other participants within a conversation, a neighborhood of relationships around a social media post, or other outputs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["252","252","316","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","318"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["332","334","336","338"]},"In one embodiment, neighbors are assigned to groups based on attributes such as the relevancy of a neighbor (relevant\/irrelevant), permalink\/non-permalink, and dated\/undated. Within a group of neighbors, contributions are summed to generate a group value. In one embodiment, the contribution of each neighbor to the influence of the document is based on contributions of relevant permalink dated neighbors , contributions of relevant non-permalink dated neighbors , contributions of relevant permalink undated neighbors , contributions of relevant non-permalink undated neighbors , contributions of irrelevant, dated neighbors , and contributions of irrelevant, undated neighbors . The contribution of each neighbor to a group sum is a function of the neighbor's relevance, its own page popularity and page-site popularity, and may also include the recency of the neighbor. A time decay function may be used to reduce the contribution of older content of neighbors based on publication date. Neighbors in a group may be grouped secondarily by a site identification with a \u201csame site decay\u201d function applied to their contributions to reduce the contribution of large quantities of links from the same site (large numbers of machine generated links do not reflect trust relationships and hence should be given little weight). The same site decay function may also be applied to document sorted descending by their recency and page popularity to ensure that the most recent and popular neighbors from the same site contribute the most to the final influence score. A weighting function is used to weight the contributions of the neighbors and from the aspects of the documents itself to determine a raw influence score for the document. When all candidate documents have been assigned a raw influence score, a normalized influence score is computed for all documents.","Additional aspects, embodiments, and benefits of the present invention will now be described in more detail in the following sections. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art throughout the following sections that the discussions refer to different implementations and applications of the previously described system as additional examples for the purposes of illustration and description.","One aspect of the present invention is that the influence of different documents\/publishers can be quantitatively measured and compared and analyzed versus time. Influence can be measured for an individual post of a conversation. For example, an individual can make a one-time post and the influence of the post on a conversation measured. Additionally, aspects of the influence of a publisher who has made a number of posts about a certain topic can also be measured.","One aspect of the present invention is that influence can be measured over time. As illustrated in , the difference in influence at time one (t) and time two (t) allows the present invention to track the changing number of connections around a particular idea, as expressed in text on a Web page or, through language processing systems that may be connected to the system, such as audio and video sources. Over time, this allows the system of the present invention to single out sources whose influence is waxing or waning, allowing applications  to choose when and where to engage the conversation. For example, objective criteria may be selected, such as a threshold level of influence or a rate of change of influence. This permits a decision to me made when and where to engage the conversation. For example, an influential publisher and a time for engaging the influential publisher may be identified. Conversely, the objective criteria may be utilized to make decision not to engage a conversation, such as if influence in a conversation begins to decrease.","The present invention can also be extended to support more advanced techniques of influence analysis. In one embodiment multi-dimensional tracking is supported. In this embodiment the system also views the market in many dimensions rather than as one topical vector defined by a single search parameter. This provides deep insight into how, when two complementary conversations intersect in a single blog posting, article or other Web site, they can suddenly accelerate dramatically by achieving a geometrically larger audience through a mathematically expanded discussion. In , two different conversations are being tracked. They are about different topics, \u201ca+b\u201d and \u201cc,\u201d until time two (02), when Conversation A adds the topic in Conversation B to its text. This happened in summer 2005, when blogger Jeff Jarvis, who blogs often on the fact that bloggers are not taken seriously when they criticize companies (in this case, the argument \u201cc,\u201d which is a frequent topic of discussion among bloggers) linked the idea to his personal complaints about the lack of customer service support from Dell Computer (\u201ca+b\u201d). The conversational momentum increased at time  (\u201ct\u201d in ), leading to significantly more linking between sites discussing Dell, blogs and the media.","One embodiment of the present invention supports predictive analysis. The ability to identify emerging communities of discussion gives the present invention a unique capability to generate predictions of the velocity and influence of ideas and individual contributors in a current discussion using variables entered into what-if scenarios by an end-user. This embodiment provides if-then scenario-building features that allow users to examine how social networks may be expected to behave based on previous behavior and the potential impact of topic crossover as illustrated in , B, and C.","In one embodiment, retrospective crawling is supported.  illustrates in more detail an example of a process that may be used to assemble a chronological history of discussion and social relationships  for conversation index . In this example, a \u201cPersuadio Market Intelligence\u201d (PMI) system  crawls Web and ping data . The system  is used to extract content, hyperlinks, and perform additional analysis, such as analyzing scripts, forms, and layout tags to identify data created, the type of data, and social links . As illustrated in , the content of individual sites is examined to distinguish when information appeared, what format it was produced in (e.g. blog posting, news article, comment about an article or blog posting), and construct a navigable history of social exchanges within the data. Relationships between people and organizations that created the data are reconstructed revealing how ideas flowed between different sites, were amplified by individual participants and what changes in perception were reflected in discussions of the target topic.","One embodiment of the present invention permits conversations in social media to be analyzed in ways not possible with conventional Internet search engines. Prior art search and blog monitoring tools focus on historical displays of the volume of discussion about a particular topic based on conventional relevance scores, which is typically presented only as a histogram. Search matches based solely on conventional relevance matching does not expose which participants accelerated a conversation or what pages\/postings increased the number of sites in a conversation about the topic through linking and social influence. Historical data, particularly about the previous interests of participants and social relationships, provides the foundation for extrapolating future behavior as well as records of the role of influencers in commercial brand perception.","Unlike traditional search engines, one embodiment of the present invention does not treat the whole Internet as a set of documents ranked on a single power curve. Instead, it dissects conversations based on a topic. Additionally, conversations may be dissected based on existing social relationships based on historical data, and the component elements of documents and authors it is tracking to produce a more refined power curve that includes relevant sites, which can be described as an \u201cattention lens.\u201d For example, conversations may be going on about \u201croad taxes in Lakewood,\u201d which could refer to any number of cities in different states\u2014none of the conversations is relevant to the others, but they are treated as a single subject by traditional search engines. By isolating the specific Lakewood through a calibration process that produces an initial attention lens, including analysis of the location of participants sites, the language of the postings, the names of key players in the conversation, and the expansion or contraction of link relationships over time can provide a very granular view of the influence within that discussion.","As sites and documents join or leave a conversation, they can be filtered by the linking of sites in the attention lens to reflect the changing velocity and reach of the conversation. A conversation expanding rapidly, either in terms of participants joining or the frequency of postings on the target topic, has an increased probability of spilling over into other communities to become prominent subjects of conversation. One embodiment of the present invention thus monitors not a single power curve summarizing the whole conversation about all topics taking place on the Net, but instead identifies many small power curves, tracking the activity of each conversation discretely and cross-over between conversations over time to provide useful explanations of why conversational patterns, influence and reach are changing.","Another embodiment of the present invention supports the capability to examine discussions longitudinally, even retrospectively by extracting time\/date information from archival content, so that benchmarks of influence may be established against which future conversational reach, velocity and influence may be measured. Through repeated crawls, the changes are sought in the amount of influence individual postings and articles have within discussions, providing extensive insight into what individual participants care most about, what they are likely to respond to and the probability that they may be drawn into discussion about a particular topic.","Unlike other search engines and blog monitoring services, an embodiment of the present invention provides users the ability to reconstruct the history of a discussion from existing postings. In one embodiment the system's search features and Hyper Text Markup Language\/Extensible Markup Language (HTML\/XML) parsing capabilities allow it to extract a hierarchy of information about each document a crawl finds, including the domain, site, page, posting body and time-created, as well as individual comments that may appear on a page of text, whether a blog or a news story which includes a discussion thread. The system breaks down the components of the page based on when information was added, providing a threaded view of conversations within a single site and across multiple sites. Even where there are no explicit connections between sites, the system's ability to examine when ideas entered conversations allows for analysis of un-attributed influence (e.g., a quoted passage that appears on a second site without a link to the source site).","Additionally, unlike a conventional search engine, one embodiment of the present invention begins with a conversation index  optimized for searching conversations in social media. As previously described, the conversation index of the present invention preferably utilizing trust filtering to improve the quality content within the conversation index. Additionally, as described below in more detail, in one embodiment of the present invention additional variations on conventional crawling techniques are supported to index comments and other aspects of conversations which are not typically indexed by conventional search engines.","As previously described, the Social Analysis Module  utilizes tools to analyze a conversation. These tools utilize various definitions based around an understanding of a social network having trusted relationships, which will now be defined in more detail. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that for a particular implementation, the definitions may vary from those described below, which are merely exemplary. However, what is important is the recognition that social analysis metrics may be developed based on an understanding of a social network which permits aspects of a conversation in social media to be objectively quantified and compared to determine key influencers and other aspects of the conversation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","7"]},"The social network illustrated in  is a useful starting point to understand different ways that the relationships can be characterized. Characterization of the relationships, in turn, may be useful to identify indicators of a trust relationship and\/or a trusted network. As previously described, social media tends to foster trust relationships in which content is self-correcting. For example, blogs with an audience are a priori relatively expert in the areas being linked to and they in turn link to other blogs in the same area whose authors are also generally fanatical about stamping out misinformation. By the same token, good ideas presented in a blog tend to get amplified immediately due to the trust relationship. By carefully defining aspects of the relationships in a social network, such as that illustrated in , various attributes of trust relationships can be assigned definitions which permit influence and other aspects of the social network having trust relationships to be quantified and mapped.","An agent is a participant in a conversational exchange, which may be a person, a document or file stored on the Internet, or a document or audio\/video record that can be analyzed to identify relationships and thematic influences. In , each node has an associated agent.","A degree is a unit of social measurement denoting a one-step connection between two agents in a network. First-degree relationships include all sites with a direct connection to a site; second-degree relationships are two steps from the central or target site in a social network analysis. In , node  has a first degree relationship with nodes  and . Node  has a second degree relationship with nodes , , and .","When used to describe computer-mediated social relationships a link is a hyperlink or other pointer embedded in the body of a Web site or page that can be followed, by clicking or activating the connection, by network users from one file or page to another on the network. When used to describe other social relationships, a link may be a spoken or written reference to another person or an idea, as expressed in text or in audio or video content.","Links have directionality. Some node relationships are one-way relationships in regards to how the nodes point to each other about a particular topic. For example, nodes  and  provide inbound links (inlinks) to node  and receive no links from node . Other nodes have two-way relationships. For example, nodes  and  have a two-way relationship because they point to each other's content about a particular topic.","There is a hierarchy of content. The system preferably delineates between files, articles and pages on a Web site or network server, including an individual posting on a Weblog or online journal, treating each as an individual component of the conversation (\u201chierarchy component\u201d) using a hierarchy of domains, sites, pages, posts, and comments. A domain is the top-level domain name of a site or network server, such as \u201cblogger.com\u201d or \u201cbuzzlogic.com,\u201d which may include many individual sites or blogs. A site is a unique network destination based on a URI with a sub-domain of the domain name (e.g. \u201cblogs.buzzlogic.com\u201d) or a subdirectory that denotes an individual site or blog (e.g., \u201cblogger.com\/mitchblog\u201d or \u201ccnn.com\/andersoncooper\u201d). Pages are an individual document that is part of a site or stored on a network server identified by a URI describing the full path to the file. Posts are individual components of a Weblog or other display interface that displays multiple entries based on user identity, time of day or date. Comments are textual, audio or video responses attached to a page or post by visitors to a site, such as reader responses on a newspaper Web site or a Weblog.","Links are characterized as either outbound links or inbound links. An outbound hyperlink, network pointer or thematic reference in a recording or on a site, page, post or comment. A inbound link is hyperlink, network pointer or thematic reference in a recording or on a site, page, post or comment that indicates a relationship with the target site, page, post or comment.","Agents are characterized as either active or inactive. An active Agent is an agent or site currently engaged in publishing about a specified subject within a user-defined timeframe.","A social network analysis has a distribution of points in a map. A center can thus be defined as the target domain, site, page or post that defines the central point of a social network analysis or map.","The relevance of content can be defined by a focal exclusivity factor. Focal exclusivity is a value between zero (0) and one (1) that describes the relevance of a site, page, post, or comment based on the total number of matches to the search term(s) compared to other semantically important terms. It is calculated by extracting the search term(s) and other repeating terms in the target hierarchy component and dividing the number of occurrences of the search term(s) by the total number of semantically important repeating terms.","Relationships can be characterized by a social strength. The social strength is a value that describes the strength of the relationship between two sites, people or ideas, based on the number of one-way and reciprocal links that connect them. The social strength of a relationship may be displayed on a scale as part of an index of all social relationships or used to calculate the median or average strength of a social relationships maintained by the agent in order to assess the relative importance of individual relationships.","Relationships can be characterized by a social weight (influence). A social weight is a value that expresses the cumulative strength of all relationships a domain, site, page, posting or comment based on a calculation with a user-defined weight for each variable:\n\n(sum(social_weight_of inbound_links)*user-defined weight[value=0>1]+count(inbound links)*user-defined weight[value=0>1)+count(outbound_links)*user-defined weight[value=0>1])+focal exclusivity*user-defined weight[value=0>1].\n","Content can be characterized by the degree to which it associates either a positive or negative characterization to the conversation. A tone factor can be defined as a value between one (1) and negative one (\u22121) describing the ratio of positive and negative terms associated with the target search term(s). Tables are maintained of positive and negative words for each workspace. Each positive word is counted as 1, each negative word is counted as \u22121. As a default, the sum of the values for the positive and negative words is found by searching each hierarchy component for all positive and negative words. This sum is then divided by the total words found to normalize the value to the range of +1 to \u22121. Proximity values, describing how closely search term(s) and tone terms co-occur, can be added to Tone.","A site can be ascribed a value indicative of the likelihood that the site will engage in a discussion. A susceptibility factor is defined as a value between zero (0) and one (1) that describes the likelihood that a site will engage in a discussion about the target search term(s) that is derived by the total number of occurrences of the search term(s)s and related terms divided by the total number of pages, posts or comments created during a user-specified timeframe.","The rate at which new agents join a calculation can be characterized. A velocity factor is a value between zero (0) and one (1) that expresses the frequency with which new agents are joining a conversation that is calculated by counting the total number of pages, posts or comments that match the search term(s), subtracting the previous crawl's total matches to arrive at the number of new agents.","In one embodiment influence is characterized by a value that expresses the conversational correlation between two or more agents about a specified subject. Influence may be calculated using factors such as relevance (how closely the text of a post by a publisher matches a user's query), occurrence (a count of the number of relevant posts published over time by a publisher), attention (a score of relevance, and recency of inbound linking to an item in the conversation); popularity (total number of inbound links), and traffic (score the number of web users referred to y influencers, the number of page views they accumulate, and\/or other actions they take).","An influencer is defined as site, page or posting that has a social weight greater than the median for a selected population of agents. An influencer may or may not be related to target search terms, as some sites consistently lead the conversation by promoting conversation.","It is desirable to characterize how conversations are amplified. An amplifier is defined as a site, page or posting that has a first-degree outbound social weight (all other variables unweighted or \u201c0\u201d [zero]) greater than the median for a given target URI. An amplifier may or may not be related to the target search terms, as some sites consistently widen conversations by repeating messages. A topic Amplifier is defined as a site, page or posting that is an Amplifier (see above) and contains the target search terms and that repeats or points to the messages of an influencer.","Leadership can be defined. When describing the relationship between two agents, the leader is a site, page or posting that receives more inbound links.

However, one implementation of the present invention is as a hosted service. Referring to , B, C, and D, one embodiment of the present invention is as a hosted service utilizing a server previously described in provisional application 60\/777,975 as the \u201cPersuadio server\u201d . The arrows and lines in , B, C, and D are used to illustrate different modes of operation of the hosted service. In one embodiment the hosted service is used to monitor, map, measure, and engage conversations. Full-text linking of relationships of social media is preferably indexed to support generating a description and analysis of a networked conversations. As previously described, input criteria (e.g., keywords and URIs) may be input by a user to define a topic of conversation. The service then monitors the conversation using the social analysis tools. The evolution of the conversation can be mapped and measurements generated of various metrics, such as influence or a list of influencers. Engagement in a conversation is preferably supported, where an engagement is one or more posts and\/or publishers where a user has entered the conversation. For example, engagement may occur via targeted advertisements or by identifying influential individual publishers for direct contact. The hosted service has applications such as managing crises, launching products, promoting brands, public relations, marketing, competitive intelligence, and monitoring problems associated with products. In one embodiment a Persuadio client application  includes a dashboard (described later in this application in more detail) to guide users around conversations, influencers and content. The client application  may, for example, support setting up alerts to notify users when the volume of conversation suddenly increases or other variances are exceeded or when a specific publisher (e.g., a specific blogger) joins a conversation. The dashboard may also generate a visual representation of a conversation network of social media, such as a social map of relationships between posts and other participants within a conversation.","In this example, the Persuadio server  implements the previously described conversation monitoring and social analysis. The Persuadio server  has several different applications. One application is to provide data to an ad server  for ad placement  to determine when and where to place ads in blogs, web sites, or other social media. Another application is to provide data that may be passed on to a Persuadio client application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7A"],"b":"704"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7B"],"b":["702","712","702","714","713","704"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7C"],"b":["702","722","702","714","734","736"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 7D","FIG. 7D"],"b":["702","702","742","742","742","742"]},"The hosted service is preferably implemented as a scalable system and method for collecting data, calculating social metrics and expressing those metrics to describe conversational networks where individuals and entities exchange Web links, attention and other information about specific topics.

Additionally, as previously described the influence engine may use information on how document are linked to neighbors (directly or indirectly through intermediate links) to determine an influence score. It is therefore desirable to perform calibrations and optimizations of the crawling and social analysis.","An exemplary calibration methodology, crawl methodology, and social analysis methodology will now be described in more detail with reference to . Some of the aspects of a practical system include calibration, crawl methodology, and social analyzers.","A calibration process includes an initial series of crawls to develop a focused index of representative influential sites that define a conversational market. The calibration process utilizes a Web crawler, or \u201cspider\u201d application  and search engine-based analyzers working from a database-driven collection of query phrases. A database provides the storage volume for results of the current and historic crawls. An HTML\/XML parser  implements a process that uses hints stored in a database to extract the hierarchy and chronology information from the raw data in the crawl database. A LINKLOGGER  implements a process that extracts and records all Source URI\u2192Target URI relationships, recording them in crawl database.","The system can configure a research crawl based on a variety of user-selected inputs to define an initial target search. One example of a user-selected input is to define an initial target search based on single URI using the \u201clink:\u201d search command to capture all sites linking to the site-level URI of the target. Alternately, a user may provide a network of target URI's to define an initial target search. The initial target search is further limited by searching for target terms. As an illustrative example, a search for pages matching target terms may include 32 different search indices with public or private application programming interfaces. The system may be configured to begin its crawling based on a defined number of results after eliminating redundant URIs and normalizing the ranking scores used in different indices to a single scoring system. In the exemplar described herein, the system selects 1,000 results.","Exemplary Calibration Process","An exemplary calibration process includes five calibration steps.","In a first calibration step (Step 1), using the initial target data set, the system begins by placing a collection of seed Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) on a queue, prioritized by the relevance of the page. A separate process pulls the most relevant URL from the queue and crawls all of its outlinks, continuing to place URLs on the queue until it crawls two degrees away from relevant URLs. In addition, the system uses backward link references to discover all links pointing to a page on the queue and retrieves those URLs, adding them to the queue by priority of the child page.","In a second step of calibration (Step 2), the system analyzes the content and code of documents captured in the 1degree crawl [see above] using the HTML\/XML Parser . It breaks down the content into component parts based on a hierarchy (domain, site, page, posting, comment) using code parsing hints stored in the database. Additionally, the system extracts time stamp information to establish the chronology of the information, tracking the date and time when components of the hierarchy were created (a page may have postings or comments created after the page creation date, for example). The components of the hierarchy with social characteristics to be tracked by the system are sites, pages, posting and comments.","The system also extracts all outbound links and creates an index of the creators (page creator, author, poster or commenter) identities, which are associated with source URIs (e.g., the URI of the commenter's blog), which can be crawled in the next step of the analysis.","Based on the user-specified timeframe of the calibration, the system may or may not collect content created and posted to the Internet on or before a user-defined date. If it does collect historical data, this is stored in the crawl database.","Data stored in fields based on THE XML PROTOCOL, all URI types may be listed in a single entry, the lowest in the hierarchy being the target URI described by other fields in the database for this entry\/row.

The total number of new participants at all levels of the hierarchy during the timeframe is subtracted from the total new participants in the previous period equal to the user-defined timeframe. If there are more new participants in the most recent timeframe, the product will be a negative number, which must be converted into a positive number in order to divide it by the total of the previous timeframe to produce a percentage value between zero [0] and one [1]. If there are fewer participants in the most recent timeframe, the product will be a positive number, which must be converted into a negative number in order to divide it by the total of the previous timeframe to produce a negative percentage value between zero [0] and negative-one [\u22121].","One aspect of conversations in social media is that conversations can rapidly propagate and be amplified. In many applications it is desirable to support the capability of an end-user to monitor and engage highly dynamic conversations. As an illustrative example, a marketing person may want to know what is happening every day to influence a conversation about a particular product. As another example, in the case of a product defect, a company executive may want to understand how influence is dynamically changing. It is therefore useful to support a capability to provide a run time view of influencers for a specific conversation being queried. Additionally, in some applications it is desirable to automatically generate a view of influencers for an end-user on a scheduled basis, such as generating a daily view of influencers for a conversation.","As people publish new social media and trackback, tag, or vote on social media, the network of content grows. In one implementation, the conversation index is updated in a fashion that reflects those changes at query time. That is, the conversation index is updated as social media is published within the conversation index. As previously described, in one embodiment the calibration process performs research crawls for a conversation network. Scheduled crawls (e.g., daily crawls) may be performed to update the conversation index and recalibrations may be performed to update the content and links in the conversation index. Business rules may be employed to direct spiders to examine both new and existing social media content which are part of the conversation network. In any case, by updating the content and links in the conversation index for a particular conversation network, a list of influencers can be generated at query time. As will be described below in more detail, user interfaces may be provide to display a list of influencers at query time and\/or according to a schedule.","Note that a conventional search engine cannot be used to generate a list of influencers at query time. As previously described, a conventional search engine does not generate a conversation index from which influencers can be determined Additionally, a conventional search engine essentially rely on static snapshots of content that freezes metadata around each document.","As previously described, one application of the present invention is to generate a map which is a visual representation of a networked conversation. In one embodiment of the system, relationship coordinates and social weight are used to display a map of two degrees of the social network surrounding a single URI. The map shows only links, not the strength of relationships, traffic flow and or other characteristics of the social relationships between sites as illustrated in . Users can generate a map by typing a URL in an address bar of a compatible Web browser or via a user bookmark to generate a map for a site open in the browser. The map's Java-based interface allowed users to mouse over any node in the map to see its name of the site displayed in the \u201cSite:\u201d field just above the zoom in (\u201c+\u201d) and zoom out (\u201c\u2212\u201d) buttons in the upper left corner of the map. As the user mouses over the nodes in the map, they can active links between sites. Double-clicking any node in the map opens a new browser window and displays the Web site. This provides a simple way to browse the neighborhood around any site. The maps open with the site chosen in the center, with the sites it was directly connected to arrayed around that site in a circle. Second-degree connections\u2014the sites connected to the first-degree sites but not to the URI mapped\u2014are around the first-degree sites to which they are linked. Maps of popular sites could be quite dense and the Fengshuinate box can be checked to see the map of how all the sites are interconnected by rearranging the map to show the most central sites in the network. Unchecking Fengshuinate froze the map in its new arrangement. Clicking once on any node in the map would reorient the map around that node. The user could also browse all the sites in the map by clicking the \u201cJump to:\u201d menu, which displayed a list of all the sites in the map\u2014selecting a site in the Jump to: menu oriented the map around that site. Changing the map would may make it expand outside the available window. Clicking the \u201cFit\u201d button to resize the map automatically. The \u201cRecenter\u201d button place the map back in the middle of the window, with the current target URI.","As previously described, one application of the present invention includes generating a dashboard user interface. In one implementation, strong ties in the map are highlighted, as illustrated in . In this exemplar the map displays the strongest pairwise connections in the social network as heavier lines than others displaying connections between sites. This allows users to see at a glance where the strongest person-to-person connections within a social network are located. The dashboard also illustrates how additional analytical results may be layered into the display. In this case the top influencers , top media sites, top blog sites, top amplifiers, top new participants (described as \u201cnew hits\u201d), top sites where conversations are crossing over with other topics, and top sites where there is no crossover with other topics, to allow the user to browse quickly to find individual sites of interest. This map is also navigable, allowing users to click on a node to reorient the map around so that they can explore how the node relates to other traffic, particularly with strong connections. The drop-down menus listing top influencers, amplifiers, etc., allow the user to open a new map oriented on the site they select. Additionally, the lists provide graphical arrows to indicate whether the site listed in rising or falling in the category.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0216","num":"0227"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"The design of this dashboard is intended to help marketers reduce the complexity of conversational information. Unlike other systems that track the appearance of search terms on sites and in blogs, the dashboard provides filters that allow users reduce the population of participants to those with the greatest influence, ability to increase the velocity of information and other factors.
