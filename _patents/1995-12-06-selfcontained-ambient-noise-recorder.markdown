No. 08\/394,106, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,714 to an ACOUSTIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING SYSTEM by Dr. David H. Shonting filed on 24 Feb. 1995.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to instrumentation apparatus for receiving acoustic signals in a range of depths of approximately 5 to 100 meters beneath the ocean surface and providing a set of data outputs from which wind velocity and rainfall rate at the surface may be derived.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The traditional torpedo-launching submarine has historically operated relatively independently of sea surface conditions. Although high sea states can cause severe rolling when the keelless submarine attains periscope depth, sea surface conditions interfere less with torpedo launch at deeper depths. With the advent of submarine-launched missiles, environmental parameters, sea state and wind speed have become much more relevant and can adversely impact these newer submarine operations. High sea states are a concern when the submarine requires near-surface launch, because severe rolling can limit or prevent missile deployment, i.e., problems arise which are associated with manipulating, loading and possible launcher jamming of these large weapon systems.","Certain classes of missiles can be vulnerable to the effect of high sea and wind conditions immediately after exiting launcher tubes as they ascend and exit through the sea surface. The Harpoon missile for example has suffered fatal damage to control surfaces by dynamic pressures associated with the orbital motions of larger waves. The Tomahawk cruise missile can also suffer launch failure as a direct result of inadequate knowledge of wind conditions. This missile, during its in-water, rapid, rocket-driven ascension, is relatively unaffected by wave dynamics, but upon exiting the sea surface, it becomes a light aircraft, whose lift is determined by its relative air speed. An inadvertent downwind launch in a greater than 20 m\/s (40-knot) wind speed could mean loss of critical lift and a sudden, unplanned return to the sea. Thus, it is important to establish a viable method for submarines to monitor sea conditions prior to launch operations.","One such technique entails acoustic sensing of sea surface conditions. Wind, wave whitecaps and precipitation are important sources of the ambient sound in the ocean and each of these phenomenon has a unique acoustic signature which can be recorded and used as a basis to develop models to predict sea surface conditions.","Establishing a viable submarine monitoring capability requires a clear understanding of the sound spectrum and intensity levels produced by the various sea surface phenomena. The sources of sound in the ocean are both natural and man-made, displaying large variations in frequency, geographic location, and time. The ambient sound spectrum can be conveniently divided into three bands. In each, the acoustic energy tends to be supplied by a dominant source with overlap at the edges. The low band from 10 to 400 Hz is mostly associated with machinery of shipping or small boat traffic and coastal industry. The mid band from 400 Hz to 40 kHz is contributed principally by oceanographic\/meteorological (i.e., geophysical) phenomena at the sea surface. The high band above 40 kHz is mostly low level energy associated with high wave number turbulence and molecular motions. To a lesser extent, in certain local areas, there is a contribution into the mid and high bands by fish noises and cavitation from high speed propellers.","The focus is on the mid range of frequencies for the monitoring of sea surface conditions. The sound spectrum in this mid band (400 Hz to 40 kHz) appears to be produced by the following phenomena:","a) interactions of wind pressure fluctuations at the sea surface;","b) splash impact and bubble formation associated with whitecapping; and","c) rain, hail, or snow impacting the sea surface.","Each of the above phenomena are by themselves complex, dynamical processes, largely turbulent in nature. Portraying the associated sound-producing mechanisms requires precise measurements and analysis to sort out the effects.","Studies of geophysical ambient sound have attempted to obtain relationships between the sound and wind speed, whitecapping (i.e., bubble formation) and rain rate. Results, however, are largely empirical and far from quantitative due to the inaccurate data obtained from the hydrophones. The general empirical relation is given as:\n\nlog,log()+\u2003\u2003(1) where\n\n","from the hydrophones, and","A and B are quasi constants depending on the sound source, range of frequencies and the range of intensities for either U or R.","The value A (a slope) may vary with wind\/wave conditions, e.g., at wind speeds below 6\u20137 m per second, wind pressure fluctuations should be the prime sound source; at higher speeds, multiple contributions occur from whitecap splashing and bubbles, hence increased slope is expected.","In general, the wind and wave sound falls off with frequency at about 6 dB per octave, but the rolloff is not necessarily monatonic because new spectral peaks are seen when whitecaps form. Rain sound falls off with frequency, except for a distinct resonant peak occurring around 15 kHz, owing to a droplet\/bubble formation at impact. Wind shows the strongest correlation with sound, showing records from 4.3\u201314.5 kHz with correlation coefficients of the sound pressure levels with log-wind speed ranged from 0.92\u20130.96. Rain, on the other hand, generates the highest\/loudest signals in its normal ranges attaining up to 60 dB for heavy downpour.","Assessment of the true correlation of the ambient sound with its sources (i.e., wind speed, waves and rainfall) requires precise measurement of the surface phenomena made at the immediate location of the sound observations. A significant obstacle quantifying relationships, such as equation 1, has been the lack of a suitable system for obtaining field measurements relating sound to surface effects with the full range of intensities of wind and wave conditions.","A wide variety of devices have been used to monitor and measure sea conditions such as wave height and wave direction. U.S. Pat. No. 3,336,800 to Appleby, Jr. et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,375,715 to Hodges et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,765,236 to Erdely; U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,838 to Buckler; U.S. Pat. No. 3,899,668 to Tucker, Jr.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,983,750 to Kirkland; U.S. Pat. No. 4,515,013 to Hue; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,885 to Lindstrom illustrate various devices for measuring waves.","The Appleby, Jr. et al. patent discloses a submarine-based acoustic system for measuring wave height and direction. The system employs continuous upward echo ranging to obtain distance measurements from the submarine to the sea surface to provide an indication of wave height and direction. The Hodges et al. patent uses a similar system where acoustic signals are directed toward the sea surface from below the sea surface. The return acoustic signals are used to indicate the slope of the sea surface above the transducers generating the acoustic signals.","The Erdley patent relates to an apparatus for measuring swell frequency and propagation direction of an ocean wave. The apparatus includes a water level indicator which is partially submerged and a ballast. A flexible connection is provided to an anchoring device. The data logger incorporates a magnetic compass and a counter.","The Buckler patent, illustrating yet another device for determining wave height, includes a buoy having an antenna which when oscillating on the wavy sea surface, causes its electronic circuitry to transmit bursts of RF signals, the pulse repetition rate varying directly in proportion to the accelerations of the buoy. Ship-borne apparatus is provided to receive the RF signals and analyze them to determine wave height. The Tucker patent, similar in principle to the Buckley system, relates to a device for electronically analyzing waves.","The Kirkland patent illustrates a water-wave height or fluid level measuring system having a partially submerged support capacitance mast attached to a float on the water surface. A radio frequency transmitter is mounted on the mast and its signals, being analogs of the wave height or other fluid level, are communicated to remote locations.","The Hue patent relates to a buoy having accelerometers and magnetometers for measuring characteristics of an ocean swell.","The Lindstrom patent relates to a submerged small angle field-of-view optical radiometer which passively measures ocean surface wave heights and statistics remotely. The radiometer measures varying underwater radiant light field and correlates that light field to surface wave heights. The device is connected to onshore or inboard electronics. The sensors can be mounted on the sea floor or on a submerged platform such as a submarine.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,172,255 to Barrick et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,128 to Lawson et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,996,533 to May et al. relate to devices for measuring and\/or monitoring surface motions associated with waves. The Barrick device uses radar to remotely sense near surface ocean currents in coastal regions. In operation, the radar detects velocity fluctuations associated with ocean waves. The Lawson patent describes an acoustic current meter in which two channels have acoustic paths oriented at right angles to each other to measure orthogonal components of current velocity associated with wave arbital motions. The May patent relates to a device for mapping ocean currents with a single radar.","Still other devices illustrate systems for measuring environmental conditions such as wind and rainfall. U.S. Pat. No. 4,143,547 to Balser and U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,268 to Caron illustrate such devices. U.S. Pat. No. 3,455,159 to Gies illustrates a nautical weather station which includes an instrumented buoy, a weighted cable attached to each buoy, and one or more submerged pressure cases attached at various depths to the cable. Both the submerged sensor package and buoys are equipped with weather and other environmental sensors. The weather data is FM transmitted from each buoy to remote receiving stations on interrogation.","Still other devices for measuring environmental and oceanographic data are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,743 to Clifford et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,936,895 to Talkington; U.S. Pat. No. 5,303,207 to Brady et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,805,160 to Ishii et al.","Field measurements relating sound to surface-generating effects of wind, waves and rainfall has produced chiefly, only empirical relations (such as equation 1) devoid of physics. The lack of accurate field measurements has been due in part to the fact that the sound measurements taken to correlate with surface effects are made at relatively large distances, of often several kilometers, from the bottom-mounted or mid-depth hydrophones. The acoustic signal is thus obtained at a point in the ocean relatively distant from the surface area of generation, which itself is ill defined. Because of this \u201cfar-field geometry\u201d, individual surface effects are spatially smoothed out, i.e., such measurements fail to spatially resolve noise radiated from small-scale phenomena such as breaking wave crests and turbulent wind gusts and hence produce low or questionable correlations. As a result, little can be inferred about the physical sound-generating mechanism at the surface or the geometry of the generating area.","Another obstacle to obtaining the true correlations has been that most acoustic time series data obtained from near-surface hydrophones have been heavily smoothed over periods of at least one to several hours. As happens with deep hydrophone records, this smoothing can suppress\/filter or mask possibly important smaller-scale fluctuations of sound sources associated with wind gusts, breaking waves or passages of wind squalls or rain cells. Moreover, the analysis of the time variability of the ambient sound field associated with the sea surface effects has perhaps been neglected in favor of establishing smooth predictive relationships from averaged data and hence high resolution sampling has been neglected or sacrificed. This results in analyses that have been relatively crude and often lacking in precise spectral characterization of acoustical signatures of the individual sound generators.","Clearly, the correlation of ambient sound with its generating sources is meaningful only to the degree that the true local source producing the sound is identified and simultaneously monitored. The problem of proximity of the sound sources from the hydrophone occurs with wind, and especially, rainfall noise correlations. To wit, due to the difficulty of measuring rainfall at sea, its measurement is often made on land many kilometers from the hydrophones. This can render the correlations at best, biased, and at worst meaningless, since the rainfall is seldom uniform over such separation distances. Rain and sound comparison measurements have been made with hydrophones at 5\u201335 m depths with rain locally measured, but these were in shallow lakes, thereby placing bottom-mounted hydrophones close to the source of the noise generating mechanisms.","Thus, more appropriate measurements are needed to better understand the physical mechanisms of the generation of ambient sound at the sea surface. A prior art apparatus for doing this is an inexpensive, totally self-contained, stand alone unit, which constitute an easily deployed ambient sound-recording system for taking rapidly sampled near-surface measurements of ambient sound. More particularly, it takes measurements of sound associated with rapidly changing wind and rainfall events measured in close proximity. This is disclosed in a paper by David Shooting and Foster Middleton entitled \u201cNear-Surface Observations of Wind and Rain-Generated Sound Using the SCANR: An Autonomous Acoustic Recorder\u201d in the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, Vol. 5, No. 2, April, 1988.","The totally self-contained, stand alone unit disclosed in the Shooting and Middleton paper is an acoustic monitoring system used by oceanographic personnel of the Department of the Navy, which is hereinafter referred to as the First Generation, Self-Contained Ambient Noise Recorder Unit , (or simply \u201cSCANR-I unit \u201d), which is shown in ,  and .  depicts the externally visible components of SCANR-I unit , which incorporates a low-noise hydrophone  configured for suspension from a surface buoy. The hydrophone , enclosed in a neoprene boot, is attached to a stainless steel support bridle  and mounted upright with its cable  leading to a pressure case , which in turn houses recording electronics and a battery pack. The pressure case  is connected to the hydrophone cable  by a 4-pin, water-tight connector .","The hydrophone employed in the SCANR has a free-field voltage sensitivity of \u2212174 db\/\/1 v\/uPa over the temperature range of 3\u201320\u00b0 C., remaining very flat from 0.1 to 35 kHz. The directivity response in the plane about the hydrophone's longitudinal axis over 15\u201322 kHz was omnidirectional to within 0.5 dB; hence, its longitudinal axis was mounted vertically to provide horizontal receiving symmetry. The hydrophone and pressure case were capable of withstanding static pressures up to 1700 m depth (70 atm).","The signal processing (including recording) components of SCANR-I unit , shown in , depict the output from a hydrophone preamplifier  delivered to three bandpass filters ,  and , centered at 15, 20, and 25 kHz respectively, with the 20 kHz band convertible to a broad bandpass from 5\u201340 kHz. The frequencies were chosen because they occur in bands of efficient wind, wave and rain noise generation, as well as being above most ship traffic and coastal industrial noise frequencies.","The output of each filter , , and  was passed through an ac\/rms converter chip , , and  with an 800 ms integration time. The voltages were sampled at 1 minute intervals, digitized as 10-bit words (i.e., 1\/1024 resolution) and recorded on a Memodyne digital cassette deck . The SCANR-I unit  was powered by 24 D-cells which sustained the three channels at a 1 minute sampling rate for 7\u20138 days. Upon retrieval of the unit , data from the Memodyne cassette  is transferred to a portable computer and stored on disk for subsequent processing and analysis.","A mooring arrangement for suspending a SCANR-I unit  at mid-depths on the continental shelf from a moored buoy is depicted in . Unit  is suspended from a standard strobe float  via a 5\u2013100 m stainless steel cable . This permits the contained hydrophone  to receive a near-surface acoustic energy isotropically from the upper hemisphere. A 20 m buoyant polypropylene line  enables the strobe float , a second tethered wave or meteorological buoy , and a third float  to remain afloat at a desired distance. The buoy  shown in  is an Endeco direction wave buoy  which provides a complete set of wave height, wave direction and ambient sound data at a single location. However, this buoy  can be eliminated if so desired. The strobe float  and buoy  are maintained in a desired location through the attachment of the third float  to a 2 cm diameter nylon 2-1 scope line  and a Danforth chain . The third float  prevents the SCANR-I unit  from becoming tangled around the nylon scope line  by positioning the line  at a distance from the unit . All metal shackles connecting the vertical stainless steel tether cable are taped so as to minimize surface noise as the surface float bobs up and down in the wave field. As an alternative to this mooring arrangement, the SCANR-I unit  can be suspended from a fixed platform or a free-drifting surface float.","Investigations of correlation between natural surface phenomenon and underwater ambient sound were conducted over the period November 1984 and May 1986 in Narragansett Bay, R.I. during which both wind and rainfall data were obtained. A SCANR-I unit  was suspended at 3\u20134 m depths from the end of 75 m long pier which extended north-westward from a sloping beach on Aquidneck Island. This point of observation had a depth of 12 m and maximum wind fetches of 12\u201315 km from the northwest and 6\u20137 km from the southwest. Wind and rainfall were monitored simultaneously with the ambient noise recordings at narrow bands centered at 15 and 25 kHz and a broadband. Wind speed and direction were directly recorded continuously with an R.M. Young Aerovane, while rainfall rate was measured with an AES tipping bucket system on a rooftop tower located 2.2 km south of the observation pier. The wind data was obtained on a strip chart recorder while the rainfall rate was logged on a period processor and digitally recorded on a Compaq computer disk memory.","A correlation of 0.97 of the 15 kHz band with wind-speed was obtained for a 24 hour period with winds ranging from 0.2\u201315 m\/s. At higher sustained winds (12\u201315 m\/s), a pronounced decrease occurred in sound pressure, which decrease appears due to increased absorption of the sound generated at the surfaces by the whitecap-produced bubble layer. Use of direct sound pressure output, in lieu of logarithmic sound levels, best showed the immediate acoustic response to changes of the wind field and rainfall rates associated with passing squalls. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient between the 15 kHz band and rain rate was only 0.068. The rain-noise correlations were rendered imprecise, in part, due to the horizontal separation of the rain gauge from the hydrophone (over 2 km) and, in part, because of the differences in the sampling of the rain gauge (at a point location) vis-a-vis the SCANR hydrophone collecting acoustic energy over a large area. Rain-produced sound attained 35 dB increase within 2\u20133 minutes during a passing line squall, which was tracked with an MIT weather radar at Cambridge, Mass. some 100 km distance.","The SCANR-I unit  system proved useful for observing the near-surface ambient sound field at both broad and narrow bands up to 30 kHz. It is easily deployed and retrieved while nearby observations are made of wind speed, whitecapping intensity and rainfall rate. By means of the foregoing correlation technique, it was found that the prior art SCANR-I had three major drawbacks. First, the filter network of the sound recording system for measurement of ambient sound associated with rapidly changing wind and rainfall events requires improved spectral resolution since certain phenomenon causing the ambient sound may produce more spectral peaks, e.g., rainfall causing 15 kHz maximum peak. This high resolution is needed for a better exploration of the various sound sources in the ocean. Second, the longevity of the battery needs to be improved to allow a longer sampling life. Third, the data memory capacity needs to be increased to accommodate a larger supply of data.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved self-contained ambient noise recorder which addresses the shortfalls of the SCANR-I system.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a self-contained ambient noise recorder which addresses the shortfalls of the SCANR-I system.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a self-contained ambient noise recorder as above having improved spectral resolution.","It is yet a further object of the above invention to provide a self-contained ambient noise recorder as above having an improved battery arrangement.","The foregoing objects are attained by the improved self-contained ambient noise recorder of the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for receiving acoustic signals in a range of depths of approximately 5\u2013100 m beneath the ocean surface and providing a set of data outputs from which wind velocity and rainfall rate at the surface may be derived. It comprises an omnidirectional hydrophone for substantially isotropical reception of acoustic energy from its upper hemisphere and for providing an output signal representative of wind velocity and rainfall rate at the surface. It contains a preamplifier for amplifying the output signal of the omnidirectional hydrophone, and means for processing the preamplified signal connected to the output of the preamplifier. The processing includes a wideband filter connected to the output of the preamplifier means for passing a band of signals in a spectral range not less than approximately 400 Hz and not more than approximately 40 kHz. The processing means further includes first, second and third signal processing channels connected to the output of the wideband filter. The outputs of the three channels are periodically sampled and recorded.","Other details of the apparatus of the present invention, including further objects and advantages, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.","Referring now to , the improved SCANR instrumentation apparatus  in accordance with the present invention has an omnidirectional hydrophone  which is supported by a bridle assembly  and which is attached to an instrument pressure case . The pressure case  is connected to the hydrophone cable  by a 4-pin, water tight connector . It contains the battery pack and the signal processing (including recording) electronics. The SCANR-II unit preferably incorporates an ITC model 6050C hydrophone. The hydrophone, pointing upward, receives acoustic energy approximately isotropically from the upper hemisphere. The hydrophone can be used at depths to 500 m (50 atm), although for most applications, it will be deployed approximately 5 to 100 m beneath the ocean surface. The hydrophone  produces output voltage signals which are representative of the wind velocity and rainfall rate at the surface.","The internal electronic components of the SCANR-II processor  are shown in . The components are mounted on two standard wire-wrap boards such as the MUPAC board. The SCANR-II processor  operates on a 4 MHz clock which is programmed into an EPROM chip  in the conventional manner of emulation of a counter. The incoming signal from the hydrophone is preamplified and passed through a 2nd order Butterworth bandpass filter . The filter  is preferably adopted to pass a band of signals in a spectral range not less than approximately 400 Hz and not more than approximately 40 kHz. The filter  preferably has a passband of about 16 Khz between its upper and lower \u22123 dB cutoff points. For example, the \u22123 b cutoff points are at approximately 1.0 and 16.0 kHz respectively. The output of the filter  is split into three channels with two of the channels running parallel through a first narrow band notch filter  and a second narrow band notch filter . The notch filter  has a center-of-notch-frequency at the lower of two significantly separated predetermined frequencies in the approximate frequency range of 10\u201340 kHz. The notch filter  has a center-of-notch-frequency at the higher of the two significantly separated predetermined frequencies. Preferably, filter  has a center-of-notch-frequency of about 15 kHz; while filter  has a center-of-notch-frequency of about 25 kHz. The outputs of the narrow band notch filters  and , along with a third direct unfiltered signal  forming the third channel, run into RMS chips  where the voltage signals are converted to DC voltage signals and finally into a multi-channel 8-bit A\/D converter . The output from the converter  is fed to a microprocessor .","The microprocessor  comprises a timing and control central processing unit (CPU) which is preferably based on a Z-80 microprocessor manufactured by the Zilog Company. The microprocessor  interfaces with external memory chips forming a nonvolatile data storage static RAM , the above described multi-channel A\/D converter , a serial input\/output chip , three Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) chips  and a battery  to make up a microcontroller. All Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS) are Compatible Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to minimize power consumption.","The improved SCANR narrow band filters  and  and wideband filter  are preferably calibrated as follows: a fixed input voltage of 20.3 (peak voltage) sine wave is applied at 2 to 3 kHz increments from 0 to 35 kHz to each of the 15 kHz and 25 kHz narrow band filters  and  and to the wideband filter . This produces the output voltages shown in \u2013. The widths of the lower and upper \u22123 dB points give bandwidths of about 2.5 kHz, about 4.5 kHz and about 16.0 kHz for the 15 kHz, 25 kHz and wideband filters, respectively. The respective gain multipliers which are provided in each of the three effective channels, i.e. (i) input to hydrophone to output of the 15 kHz notch-type narrow band filter channel, (ii) input to hydrophone to output of the 25 kHz notch-type narrow band filter channel, and (iii) input to hydrophone to output of the approximate 1.0 to 16.0 kHz wideband Butterworth filter; are preferably in the approximate ratios 2:2:1, i.e. ,  and .","Referring to , the microprocessor  receives operational instructions from the three 64 Kb erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) chips . One EPROM is preferably used for data acquisition and two EPROMS are preferably used for terminal communication. Data can be stored on either an 8 K\u00d78-bit (64 K) or a 32 K\u00d78-bit (256 K) Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) , which contains a lithium battery to retain data in the memory chip whenever the supply voltage falls below the operational threshold, is turned off, or if the chip is removed from the board.","An auxiliary microprocessor-based system (not shown), which resides in the microprocessor , may be used to offload the data, via an RS-232 interface , from the memory chip  to a laptop PC  for subsequent analysis. Data, downloaded in the laboratory ICS, and needed solely for outside communications, are removed to minimize power consumption.","In the event of a system hangup, a hardware reset switch connected to the microprocessor  is provided to restart the program. The data RAM  is addressed through a series of counters which are incremented by the microprocessor  so that if a system reset occurs, the data RAM  address does not get reset and no data is overwritten. The data is written in four byte blocks; the first block is an identification number and the remainder are 8-bit values of the 15 kHz, 25 kHz and wideband RMS data. When the highest desired value is reached, the counters are reset to zero and held there so that no further data taking occurs. The counters can be reset only by a toggle switch located on the board.","Power is provided to the entire system by two battery packs which form the battery . The first battery pack consists of eleven Ni-Cad 7.2 volt rechargeable individual units configured to provide three independent supplies of +14, \u221214 and 21.6 volts for use by the analog board which processed the voltage analog signal from the hydrophone. All eleven individual batteries are configured in parallel and can be charged as one group. The second battery pack consists of twenty-eight Ni-Cad 1.2 volt individual units configured to provide 17 volts to a dc-to-dc converter, which in turn provides a steady regulated 5 volt supply to the microprocessor and the supporting electronics. Both battery packs can be charged as a group by use of voltage dividers in line with the charging electrodes.","The procedure for data logging is as follows. The system is turned on and everything is reset. After an elapsed time, determined by the programmed chip, the microprocessor  turns on the relays to power the analog board and the hydrophone. A 10 second delay allows the RMS circuits  to fully energize and stabilize. The digitized values from the A\/D converter  are read in by the microprocessor  and the relays are turned off. The microprocessor  then transfers the data to the data RAM , confirms the transfer, then counts down to the next sampling time. The process repeats until the last data RAM address is filled. Circuitry prevents the relays from being turned on once the data RAM  has been filled. The sampling time is arbitrarily selected. A one minute interval is preferred for the sampling time since it is capable of capturing the pertinent meteorological events of windspeed, breaking wave occurrence and rainfall rate.","Upon retrieval of the SCANR-II unit, the digital data is extracted by means of the RS-232 serial communications interface  connected to the microprocessor . An example of the use of the SCANR-II unit is the gathering of acoustic information for comparison to environmental data obtained by above-the-ocean-surface instrumentation to provide empirical tables for estimating windspeed and rainfall rate. Once offloaded, the digitized RMS  data is converted to sound pressure levels which can then be plotted and compared to environmental data.","It is to be understood that SCANR-II units, may be deployed in the same manner in which the SCANR-I unit  is deployed beneath the surface of the ocean (as shown in  and discussed above). Thus, the SCANR-II unit can be suspended from a moored surface buoy, a fixed platform or a free-drifting surface float.","The improved SCANR unit of the present invention provides better, more efficient signal processing. The novel filter network therein has improved spectral resolution since certain phenomenon causing the ambient sound may produce more spectral peaks, e.g., rainfall causing 15 kHz maximum peak. This high resolution provides a better exploration of the various sound sources in the ocean.","The two battery packs provide a longer recording term. The prior SCANR unit battery lasted from 4\u20137 days, whereas the improved battery packs allow data to be recorded from 7\u201314 days.","Still further, the SCANR unit of the present invention has increased data memory capacity. This is achieved through the use of high density memory chips.","The SCANR unit of the present invention may be used in an acoustic and environmental monitoring system such as that shown in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.
