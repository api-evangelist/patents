For the sake of simplicity, hereinafter, these media will be called \u201cdata carriers\u201d.","Such a data carrier comprises data, e.g., in the form of computer software to be loaded into a computer of a user who bought it. However, in practice, often the data available on such a data carrier can be read many times whereas the producer of the data wishes to be paid again for every new loading in another computer. Nowadays, buyers are often signing a kind of contract promising not to infringe the copyright associated with the data. However, that is not a technical hindrance to illegal copying of the data. In practice, large-scale checking of illegal copies at the premises of, especially, end-users is almost impossible.","Therefore, it is an object to provide technical means that provide a strong protection against illegal copying of data on the data carrier.","In accordance with the present invention such illegal copying may be prevented with a computer-readable medium provided with a memory area for storing data and a distinct microprocessor comprising a communication interface for communication with an external device, a memory unit and a processor unit connected to both the communication interface and the memory unit.","With such a device, the intellectual property rights of data, albeit music, pictures or executable software stored on mass produces digital data carriers can be upheld effectively at little additional costs. The microprocessor is used to carry out protecting functions as to the data stored on the data carrier. This protection may relate to the number of times the data may be loaded in a computer, who is authorized to load the data in a computer, etc.","Such a protection may, e.g., be implemented by a computer-readable medium as defined above, wherein the data comprises a first data portion which is arranged to be read by a computer arrangement and to be decrypted by the computer arrangement using at least one cryptographic key provided at least one condition is met, and the processor unit being arranged to communicate with the computer arrangement through the communication interface in order to check whether the condition is met and to generate the cryptographic key for the computer arrangement once the condition is met.","Moreover, the data may comprise a second data portion comprising key related data necessary for the processor unit to generate the at least one cryptographic key.","The computer-readable medium may have a circular shape with a center of rotation and the communication interface being an antenna symmetrically shaped about the center of rotation.","One of the conditions to be met may be user authentication and, then, the processor unit is arranged to receive authentication information through the communication interface and to establish user authentication based on the authentication information received.","Alternatively, or additionally, one of the conditions to be met is period of time the data may be read and decrypted by either the computer arrangement or an other computer arrangement, the period of time being part of the data.","Moreover, alternatively, or additionally, one of the conditions to be met is maximum number of times the data may be read and decrypted from the computer-readable medium, the maximum number of times being monitored by the processor unit.","In a further embodiment, the processor unit in the computer-readable medium is arranged for carrying out the decrypting based on executable codes received through said communication interface. Once again, the processor unit is, then, preferably, arranged to validate these executable codes, e.g., by means of a specific key stored in the memory unit.","In one embodiment, the computer-readable medium is provided with a physical structure connected to the processor unit, the processor unit being arranged to check physical integrity of the physical structure and stop operating as soon as the processor unit establishes that the physical integrity is violated.","The invention also relates to a computer arrangement arranged to communicate with a computer-readable medium, the medium being provided with a memory area for storing data and a distinct microprocessor comprising a communication interface, a memory unit and a processor unit connected to both the microprocessor interface and the memory unit, the computer arrangement being provided with a processor, a memory connected to the processor, a first interface unit connected to the processor for communicating with the memory area of the computer-readable medium and a second interface unit connected to the processor for communicating with the microprocessor unit through the communication interface.","The invention also relates to a method of reading and decrypting data from a computer-readable medium, the medium being provided with a memory area for storing data and a distinct microprocessor comprising a communication interface, a memory unit and a processor unit connected to both the communication interface and the memory unit, the method comprising the following steps:","(a) receiving at least one cryptographic key from the processor unit;","(b) reading a first data portion from the memory area in the computer-readable medium","(c) decrypting first data portion using the at least one cryptographic key.","The invention also relates to a data carrier provided with a computer program and to a computer program product for carrying out such a method.","Moreover, the invention relates to a method of giving access to data stored on a computer-readable medium, said medium being provided with a memory area storing said data and a distinct microprocessor comprising a communication interface, a memory unit and a processor unit connected to both said communication interface and said memory unit, wherein said data comprises a first data portion which is arranged to be read by a computer arrangement and to be decrypted by said computer arrangement using at least one cryptographic key provided at least one condition is met, said method including the steps of\n\n","The invention also relates to a data carrier provided with a computer program and to a computer program product for carrying out such a latter method.","The invention relates to digital data storage devices in which digital data, possibly organized in distinctly referably sections, is stored. The data may be retrieved in some form by a computer system and then used by a user.  schematically shows some key elements.  shows a circular shaped data carrier , like a CD, or CD-ROM, having data stored in a memory area . The data may comprise both executable codes once loaded in a computer and non-functional data, like text, music and pictures.","In accordance with the invention, the data carrier  is provided with a microprocessor .  shows a circular antenna  as communication interface for a microprocessor unit not shown in .  shows an example of the micro-processor  comprising a processor unit  connected to the antenna  and a memory . The antenna preferably comprises one or more circular loops arranged such that they are centered about the center of rotation of the data carrier . The memory  may comprise any kind of memory like RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, etc. allowing the processor unit  to carry out its functions.","Preferably, the processor unit  itself is embedded in the data carrier structure such that it is tamper-resistant. Together with memory , it may be implemented as a single-chip microprocessor of a similar type as used in smart cards. As shown in , in case of a circular data carrier designed to rotate during reading, like a CD or CD-ROM, the microprocessor  is preferably located such that its center of gravity coincides with the center of rotation of the data carrier .","Preferably, the data carrier comprises an embedded physical structure  connected to the processor unit . The physical structure  is, e.g., made of one or more wire loops, the presence of which being detectable by the processor unit . If the microprocessor unit  is disconnected from the physical structure , e.g., either by removing the microprocessor  from the data carrier  or by damaging the data carrier , the processor unit  will detect that and will not be able anymore to carry out its protection function anymore. To that end, the processor unit  may detect the resistance of wire loops. Alternatively, the physical structure  may have some predetermined capacitance or inductance or any kind of (complex) impedance that can be detected by the processor unit . With such an additional structure , one cannot use the microprocessor  anymore after having removed it from the data carrier . Only reverse engineering could then provide knowledge about the content of the microprocessor . However, this content may be unique for each different microprocessor  such that reverse engineering will never be worthwhile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["11","16","8","18","20","22","16","14","8","14","8"]},"In some embodiments, the computer arrangement  may comprise a smart card reader  connected to the processor  and arranged to read a smart card .","The processor  is shown to be connected to a laser unit  as an interface to read data from (and possibly write to) the data carrier . Of course, in case another kind of data carrier then a CD or CD-ROM is used, also another kind of interface  must be used. A groove  is provided to allow the laser unit  to move in a radial direction across the data carrier , as is known to persons skilled in the art.","Apart from the interface , the box  comprises another interface unit  that is arranged to allow the processor  to communicate with the processor unit  on the data carrier  when it is inserted into the box  to its reading position in which data may be read from the memory area  on the data carrier  by laser unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["24","26","28","3","24","3","24"]},"Instead of a CD\/CD-ROM as shown in  or a cassette as shown in , any other known type of data carrier, such as floppy disk, may be applied to carry out the present invention.","The processor unit  embedded in the data carrier  is programmed to control read and\/or write access of the processor  to the data carrier memory area . To that end, the processor unit  is, preferably, arranged to generate one or more secret, cryptographic keys which are, e.g., initialized at the final stages of manufacturing of the data carrier  with its processor unit . The one or more keys are, preferably, unique to the data carrier and may be simply stored in memory  of the microprocessor  or be calculated by the processor unit , as will be explained hereinafter. Below, for the sake of simplicity of the description, it will be assumed that only one key is used.","At least a portion of the data in memory area  is stored after being encrypted by the key. In one embodiment, the key is directly stored in memory  of the microprocessor . However, the processor unit  may be arranged to calculate the correct key based on one or more other (master) keys in memory  using key related data retrieved from memory area  on the data carrier . With reference to , such key related data will be read from the memory area  by processor  from the computer arrangement , preferably, without using any additional authorization mechanism, and then be transferred to the processor unit  through the communication interface . By using key related data stored in memory area  to allow processor unit  to calculate the necessary key using its own master key from memory unit , the encryption algorithms used to conceal data to be protected on the data carrier  can be selected to use very long keys, like in one-time pad calculations which require keys of the same length as the protected data.","When the processor  of the computer arrangement  is instructed by a user, through its input means , , to read protected (encrypted) data from data carrier , it will request the processor unit  to generate the correct key. The processor unit  will send its key from memory  or calculate the correct key based on the key related data as indicated above and send the key to the processor . As indicated in step  of  the processor  will receive this key. Then, the processor  reads data from the memory area  of data carrier , step . As shown in step , the processor  will use the key to decrypt data read from the data carrier  and store the decrypted data in its memory . Instructions as to how to communicate with the data carrier  may be loaded from the data carrier  to the processor  in any way known to the person skilled in the art, e.g., by loading an execute file from data carrier  to processor .","In practice, the generation of the key by the processor unit  will be dependent on whether or not one or more conditions have been met. This is further explained in .","One such condition may be the time period that the data in the data carrier  may be read and decrypted after a predetermined date loaded in memory  of the microprocessor . The data may e.g. be a demonstration computer program which may be used during three months after which decryption will automatically be blocked.","Another condition may be the maximum number of times the data may be read from data carrier  and decrypted by processor  or any other processor external to data carrier . To that end, the microprocessor  may store such a maximum number and check whether the number of times it is requested by a computer arrangement to provide the key exceeds that maximum number. For instance, in many cases an end-user is allowed to read and decrypt the data twice, i.e., once for regular purposes and once for back up. In such cases, the maximum number equals 2.","In general, as shown in , for checking the condition to be met the computer arrangement  and the data carrier  start communicating in step . In order to enhance security the condition is preferably checked by processor unit  of the data carrier , step . Only if the condition is met the processor unit  will generate the required key and send it to the processor  of the computer arrangement , step .","In order to be sure that both the key and the decryption algorithm are never entirely known to the computer arrangement protection and control over data use may be achieved by interaction between the processor unit  and the processor  such that the processor unit  performs additional computations necessary for the decryption algorithm. For effective operation with respect to speed of performance, such additional computations for decryption can be performed on a selected part of the data to be protected, e.g., every first 100 bytes of each retrieved 20 kbytes. To this end,  shows the situation that part of the encrypted data from the data carrier  is transferred to the processor unit  by computer arrangement .","Protection may further be enhanced by introducing an authentication mechanism of the user. Then, only when the user proves his\/her authenticity to the processor unit  the latter will provide the correct key. To that end, passwords or user codes input by the user through one of the input means ,  can effectively be used. Such a pass word or user code must then correspond to a password or user code stored in memory .","Alternatively, a password acceptance algorithm based on additional authentication data stored in the data carrier  may be used. Such authentication data may be read by processor  from the data carrier  and be transferred to the microprocessor  (see ). A password input by a user may, e.g., be checked by the processor unit  as being valid upon checking whether or not it belongs to a dictionary of acceptable words stored as such authentication data in the data carrier  possibly complemented with rules for combining them, the rules being stored as an authentication key in memory .","User identification may also be carried out by using the smart card reader  and smart card  that belongs to a user who knows a password associated with the smart card .","As a further alternative, the smart card reader  may be arranged to read smart card  provided with an electronic purse facility and the processor unit  may be arranged to allow decryption of data from the data carrier  only when a predetermined amount of money has been paid through the electronic purse. A payment facility through the Internet is another option for paying in advance of any next decryption step.","The protection mechanism illustrated above may be expanded to providing different sets of keys for different sets of data on the data carrier.","The copy of the data to be protected and loaded in the computer memory  may be provided with a digital watermark calculated by the microprocessor  during the process of loading the data into the computer . The calculation algorithm used by the processor  to provide the watermark is derived from the data carrier . Alternatively, either a part of or the entire watermark is calculated by processor unit  and sent to the processor . The watermark may include the time of loading, user identity information or any other information to uniquely identify a stored copy of the loaded data. The watermark may use data elements of the data itself such that the data itself will at least be partly damaged if somebody tries to remove the watermark. The watermark serves as an identifier to locate the source of illegal copies of the data.","The processor  is shown to be one block. However, if preferred, the processor  may be implemented as several sub-processors communicating with one another each dedicated to perform a predetermined task. Preferably, the processor  is (or the sub-processors are) implemented as a computer with suitable software. However, if desired, it (or they) may be implemented as dedicated digital circuits.","The software running on the processor unit  of the data carrier  and on the processor  of the computer arrangement  may, prior to loading, be stored on a data carrier like a CDROM or may be distributed through a telecommunication connection (for instance entirely or partly wireless) like the Internet."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Hereinafter, the invention will be explained with reference to some drawing which are intended to illustrate the invention and not to limit its scope.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 and 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
