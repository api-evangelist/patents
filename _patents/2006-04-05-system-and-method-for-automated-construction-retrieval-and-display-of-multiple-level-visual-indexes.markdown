title: System and method for automated construction, retrieval and display of multiple level visual indexes
abstract: A method for displaying a multiple level visual index representing data records, comprises storing a plurality of data records and receiving a request to access the stored data records. The method continues by using index parameters to generate a multiple level visual index for the stored data records to be accessed. The method concludes by transmitting a graphical representation of the generated multiple level visual index.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to the field of data processing, particularly to a system and method for the automatic construction, retrieval, and display of multiple level visual indexes representing keyed data located in a database.","Conventional database management systems use indexing to facilitate user access to keyed data. Keys may be unique to particular files or records (social security number, vehicle identification number (\u201cVIN\u201d), etc.) or non unique (dates, student grades, etc.), and may have significance solely to the intended user of the application (e.g., a VIN to a car salesman using a dealership inventory application).","In large databases, a user query may cause thousands of keyed data records to be returned, slowing access to the desired data while the user filters and scrolls through the list of returned data. Furthermore, in network-based applications, rendering large amounts of data on the client computer is impractical and the increased network traffic and server usage greatly reduces system efficiency. Applying the search\/filter\/results methods used in Internet search engines, in which the user executes filter queries and accesses a virtual number of results pages one page at a time, requires, for a large result set, the examination of hundreds of pages before the desired record or file is located. Existing single level indexes are of extremely limited use for subdividing large amounts of data to allow for efficient location of desired data. For example, Sun's single-level Java Help Facility, which has separate indexes for the letters \u201cA\u201d thru \u201cZ\u201d, generates 3100 entries when the letter \u201cA\u201d is clicked.","In view of the problems and shortcomings associated with user interfaces for the retrieval, display, and interaction with very large result sets, the invention herein disclosed provides an efficient, user-friendly system and method for displaying keyed data using multiple level visual indexes. In one embodiment, a visual index facility creates index files for sorted data records on a database using pre-established index parameters. In another embodiment, the visual index facility creates index files using dynamically generated index parameters, depending on the size of the result set and the number of records\/indexes that can be displayed on the user interface at one time. In yet another embodiment, the user interface is a client computer and the database is located on a server. In still another embodiment, the client is a computer running a web browser and the database is located on a server.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description and the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3"]},"Even data sets larger than the 10,000 students of the above example\u2014which uses a three-level index of depth \u2014may be rapidly navigated using appropriately constructed multiple level visual indexes, where the user may execute only one click more than the number of index levels to reach the required data. For example, a two-level index of depth  can index 21,952 data items, a three-level index of depth  can index 20,736 data items, a three-level index of depth  can index 810,000 data items, and a three-level index of depth  can index 2,560,000 data items. As explained in detail below, the index generation parameters\u2014which include (1) the number of index levels to be generated; (2) the depth of each index level; and (3) the maximum number of data entries for each data file generated\u2014may be supplied by the user or generated dynamically by the visual index facility based on the number of data records to be accessed and the number of records that can be displayed on the client's screen, and optimized so that the user does not have to scroll through lists of data or indexes.","Implementation of the visual index facility provides that the data to be accessed contains a unique key field and that this key field has meaning to the user of the application. Non-unique key fields, such as date and student grades, are not amenable to the creation of visual indexes, whereas unique key fields that have meaning solely to the user of the application, e.g., the car salesman accessing inventory via VIN number, are amenable to implementation of visual indexes.","In one embodiment, the visual index facility may be implemented in a client browser\/server configuration with a data file generated from the index file in a markup language such as Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d). An application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) may then be applied to read the data from the data file of returned data. The API may be the Simple API for XML (or \u201cSAX\u201d) parser that handles XML data as a single, continuous stream of data and does not require the entire XML file to be stored in memory. The visual index is displayed to the user of the client computer using hypertext markup language (\u201cHTML\u201d) transmitted from the server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","120","140"]},"If it is determined, at block , that no data access query was supplied, then a determination is made, at block , whether or not a sorted result set has separately been supplied. (The user may have run their own access routines to create a sorted result set.) If no such result set was supplied, then the method returns an error condition at block .","Once it has been determined that a sorted result set is available\u2014either supplied by the user  or generated by the data access module \u2014a further determination is made, at block , whether index generation parameters have been supplied by the user. If no index generation parameters have been supplied, at block , they are generated based on the size of the result set and, if known, the client's screen size. In one embodiment, the parameter generation algorithm is biased to produce depths corresponding to approximately two thirds of the client's screen size, minimizing the need for the user to scroll when selecting indexes for expansion.","Once control parameters (index generation parameters) have been established, at block , a routine is called to generate the index file based on the current result set size. Next, at block , a routine is called to generate the data file(s) associated with the index file. The format and relationship between the index file and data file(s) is described in more detail below with reference to . Finally, at block , the method returns a \u201csuccess\u201d status.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","260","270"]},"Once block , the retrieval of the child index and all its siblings, or block , the retrieval of the data records for a leaf index, have been invoked, at block , a determination is made whether or not to format the results as a simple vector of text strings or as HTML formatted for output as images within a graphical tree diagram. According to the result of this determination, the index or data records may be used to create a vector of text records, at block , and the formatted vector returned at block , or the index or data records may be formatted for output as HTML text with image bitmaps describing the graphical tree, at block , and HTML text returned at block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","350","370","300","302","304","302","306","308","320","324","310","322","372","370"]},"As shown in , an \u201cidx\u201d element has two attributes. The \u201cx\u201d attribute  identifies the index and may be used by a client program to request retrieval of the children of a specific index. The \u201cd\u201d attribute  identifies where the data for the current index range is stored in data file . In this example, the value of the \u201cd\u201d attribute, \u201c2352\u201d will map  directly to the \u201cid\u201d attribute, \u201c2352\u201d  corresponding to the data file's \u201cdat\u201d elements. The \u201cidx\u201d element  contains a text string, \u201caether . . . affable,\u201d that represents the range of \u201cidx\u201d elements (in a non leaf node) or data file \u201cdat:\u201d elements (in a leaf node) associated with this index.","The visual index file  provides a hierarchy of visual indexes having pointers to one or more of data files  and . The elements \u201cd\u201d of index file \u201cidx\u201d points to a range of data file \u201cdat\u201d elements . The XML representation of data file  contains a single root element  containing 1 to N child \u201cdat\u201d elements . These \u201cdat\u201d elements do not have children. Each \u201cdat\u201d element will have an \u201cid\u201d attribute . The \u201cid\u201d attribute corresponds to the index file's \u201cidx\u201d elements \u201cd\u201d attribute. The content stored in the \u201cdat\u201d element  is application dependent.","A single visual index file  may have a maximum number of data entries, as defined by the index generation parameters, as shown in  at block . For example, if the maximum data file size is defined as , with 2548 data elements requiring indexing, there will be a total of 6 data files.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["400","405","410","415"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["510","530","515","535"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["602","630","602","625","610","635"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["730","732","705","710","715","730","735"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"840"},"A user of either a client personal computer  or wireless device  sends a request in HTTP format to a Web server application  that utilizes the visual index facility  for the creation and display of specified visual indexes.
