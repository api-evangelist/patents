The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.","The present disclosure relates generally to methods of integrating hardware and software for common weapons and sensor control. Multiple stand-alone systems may create overcrowding and overworking of operators. Current stand-alone systems may require entering the same data multiple times and may require porting data across multiple systems. In view of the foregoing, there is a need for an integrated command and control system including a software library to integrate weapons and sensor command and control.","Aspects of the invention may provide a modular and reusable framework for rapid integration of software and hardware on a distributed and autonomous system for common weapons control that may be on different vehicles and different platforms. The invention may also include common operational and tactical procurement of sensory and camera information.
