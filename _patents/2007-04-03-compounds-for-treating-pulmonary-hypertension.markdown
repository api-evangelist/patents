Nevertheless, the following general preparative methods are presented to aid the reader in synthesizing the KDR inhibitors, with more detailed particular examples being presented below in the experimental section describing the working examples.","All variable groups of these methods are as described in the generic description if they are not specifically defined below. When a variable group or substituent with a given symbol (i.e. R, R, R, G, G, G, or G) is used more than once in a given structure, it is to be understood that each of these groups or substituents may be independently varied within the range of definitions for that symbol. As defined above, the compounds of the invention contain ring units each of which may independently bear between 0 and 5 substituents G, G, or G, which are not defined as H. By contrast, it is to be noted that in the general method schemes below, the G, G, or Gsubstituents are used as if their definition includes H, to show where such G, G, or Gsubstituents may exist in the structures, and for ease in drawing. No change in the definition of G, G, or Gis intended by this non-standard usage, however. Thus, only for purposes of the general method schemes below, G, G, or Gmay be H in addition to the moieties set forth in the definitions of G, G, or G. The ultimate compounds contain 0 to 5 non-hydrogen groups G, G, or G.","Within these general methods the variable M is equivalent to the moiety",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0207"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00034","num":"00034"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00034","he":"6.10mm","wi":"27.43mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00034.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Within these general methods the variable Qis equivalent to the moiety",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0209"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00035","num":"00035"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00035","he":"12.02mm","wi":"17.78mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00035.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Within these general methods the variable Qis equivalent to the moiety",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0211"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00036","num":"00036"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00036","he":"12.02mm","wi":"17.78mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00036.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"It is recognized that compounds of the invention with each claimed optional functional group cannot be prepared with each of the below-listed methods. Within the scope of each method optional substituents are used which are stable to the reaction conditions, or the functional groups which may participate in the reactions are present in protected form where necessary, and the removal of such protective groups is completed at appropriate stages by methods well known to those skilled in the art.","General Method A\u2014The compounds of formula I-A in which X, M, and Qare defined as above, Y is \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014S\u2014, or \u2014NH\u2014, and Rand Rtogether with the carbons to which they are attached form a fused 5-membered ring aromatic heterocycle, hal is halogen (Cl, Br, F, or I but preferably Cl, Br or F) are conveniently prepared according to a reaction sequence as shown in Method A. Thus, a heterocycle of formula II in which R is lower alkyl can be made by one skilled in the art according to the corresponding published procedures in the reference table. In the cases of thiophene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (table entry 1) and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (table entry 10), the carboxylic acids are converted to methyl or ethyl esters by treatment with the corresponding alcohol and catalytic mineral acid (typically sulfuric acid) at reflux. The diester of formula II is treated with hydrazine hydrate to furnish intermediate III (for specific reaction conditions see Robba, M.; Le Guen, Y. 1970 12 4317). Compound III is treated with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous oxybromide, phosphorous pentabromide, or phosphorous pentachloride to yield dihalo intermediate IV. The dichloro or dibromo intermediates can be converted to the difluoro intermediate (when desired) by reaction with hydrogen fluoride. By using iodo reagents such as potassium iodide or tetrabutyl-ammonium iodide in subsequent steps, the iodo intermediate is formed in the reaction mixtures without being isolated as a pure substance. Dihalo intermediate IV is treated with a nucleophile of formula V in refluxing alcohol or other suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or the like to furnish the intermediate of formula VI. Such condensations can also be done in a melt free of solvent and can be catalyzed by acids such as HCl or bases such as triethylamine or 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The compound of formula VI is reacted with compounds of formula VII in a suitable aprotic solvent such as DMSO, DMF or solvent free often with a basic catalyst such as DBU or CsCO, or a crown ether such as 18-crown-6 at temperatures usually between room temperature and reflux to furnish invention compound of formula I-A. It is understood that the nature of the starting materials will dictate the choice of suitable solvents, catalyst (if used) and temperature by one skilled in the art. Intermediates of formula V and VII are often commercial or are conveniently prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. For example see Martin, I., et al. 1995 49 230 for the preparation of VII in which Y is \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014 and Qis 4-pyridyl substituted by a 2-aminocarbonyl group (2-CONH).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0214"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00037","num":"00037"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00037","he":"113.28mm","wi":"75.95mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00037.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0215"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"REFERENCE TABLE FOR PREPARATION OF"},{"entry":"STARTING MATERIAL II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00038","num":"00038"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00038","he":"13.80mm","wi":"21.59mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00038.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"For diacid: Heffner, R.; Joullie, M. . .. 1991 21(8&9) 1055.

Several classifications systems for pulmonary hypertension have been published, including the Evian Nomenclature and Classification of pulmonary hypertension (PH) (1998) and the Revised Nomenclature and Classification of PH (2003). See, Lewis et al., 2004, 126 73-10, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Any disease PH listed in these classification schemes can be treated, managed, or prevented in accordance with the present invention. Risk factors and diagnostic criteria for PH are described in McGoon et al., 126, 14-34, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The following list is the 2003 classification proposed at the Third World Conference on Pulmonary Hypertension: PAH, IPAH, FPAH, collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts (large, small, repaired or nonrepaired), Portal hypertension, drugs and toxins, other (glycogen storage disease, gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy), associated with significant venous or capillary involvement, pulmonary venous hypertension, pulmonary capillary heman-giomatosis, pulmonary venous hypertension, left-sided atrial ventricular heart disease, left-sided valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxemia, COPD, interstitial lung disease, sleep-disordered breathing, alveolar hypoventilation disorders, chronic exposure to high altitude, PH due to chronic thrombotic and\/or embolic disease, thromboembolic obstruction of proximal pulmonary arteries, thromboembolic obstruction of distal pulmonary arteries, pulmonary embolism (tumor, parasites, foreign material), sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, lymphangiomatosis, compression of pulmonary vessels (adenopathy, tumor, fibrosing mediastinitis)","Any of the above-mentioned disorders can be associated with an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, including, subjects having, e.g., congenital heart disease (e.g., Eisenmenger syndrome); left heart disease; pulmonary venous disease (e.g., fibrosis tissue narrowing or occluding pulmonary veins and venules); pulmonary arterial disease; diseases causing alveolar hypoxia; fibrotic lung diseases; Williams syndrome; subjects with intravenous drug abuse injury; pulmonary vasculitis (such as Wegener's, Goodpasture's, and Churg-Strauss syndromes); emphysema; chronic bronchitis; kyphoscoliosis; cystic fibrosis; obesity-hyper-ventilation and sleep apnea disorders; pulmonary fibrosis; sarcoidosis; silocosis; CREST (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon; esophageal motility disorder; sclerodactyl), and teleangiectasia) and other connective tissue diseases.

The term \u201cmanaging\u201d encompasses preventing the recurrence of pulmonary hypertension in a patient who suffered from pulmonary hypertension.","Administration","Compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be administered in any form by any effective route, including, e.g., oral, parenteral, enteral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, topical, transdermal (e.g., using any standard patch), ophthalmic, nasally, local, non-oral, such as aerosol, inhalation, subcutaneous, intramuscular, buccal, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, intra-arterial, and intrathecal, etc. They can be administered alone, or in combination with any ingredient(s), active or inactive.","Preference is given to an oral administration.","Compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be converted in a known manner into the usual formulations, which may be liquid or solid formulations e.g. without limitation normal and enteric coated tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, solution, suspensions, syrups, solid and liquid aerosols and emulsions.","Examples of solid formulations for oral administration are described in U.S. provisional application No. 60\/605,752.","The combinations of the present invention can be administered at any time and in any effective form. For example, the compounds can be administered simultaneously, e.g., as a single composition or dosage unit (e.g., a pill or liquid containing both compositions), or they can be administered as separate compositions, but at the same time (e.g., where one drug is administered intravenously and the other is administered orally or intramuscularly). The drugs can also be administered sequentially at different times. Agents can be formulated conventionally to achieve the desired rates of release over extended period of times, e.g., 12-hours, 24-hours. This can be achieved by using agents and\/or their derivatives which have suitable metabolic half-lives, and\/or by using controlled release formulations.","The drug combinations can be synergistic, e.g., where the joint action of the drugs is such that the combined effect is greater than the algebraic sum of their individual effects. Thus, reduced amounts of the drugs can be administered, e.g., reducing toxicity or other deleterious or unwanted effects, and\/or using the same amounts as used when the agents are administered alone, but achieving greater efficacy.","Compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be further combined with any other suitable additive or pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such additives include any of the substances already mentioned, as well as any of those used conventionally, such as those described in (Gennaro and Gennaro, eds, 20th edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000); (Lachman et al., eds., 3rd edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 1986); (Swarbrick and Boylan, eds., 2nd edition, Marcel Dekker, 2002). These can be referred to herein as \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carriers\u201d to indicate they are combined with the active drug and can be administered safely to a subject for therapeutic purposes.","In addition, compounds or drug combinations of the present invention can be administered with other active agents or other therapies that are utilized to treat any of the above-mentioned diseases and\/or conditions.","The present invention provides also combinations of at least one compound of Formula I and at least one other therapeutic agent mentioned above useful in treating a disease or disorder. \u201cCombinations\u201d for the purposes of the invention include:\n\n","The dosage of each agent of the combination can be selected with reference to the other and\/or the type of disease and\/or the disease status in order to provide the desired therapeutic activity. For example, the active agents in the combination can be present and administered in a fixed combination. \u201cFixed combination\u201d is intended here to mean pharmaceutical forms in which the components are present in a fixed ratio that provides the desired efficacy. These amounts can be determined routinely for a particular patient, where various parameters are utilized to select the appropriate dosage (e.g., type of disease, age of patient, disease status, patient health, weight, etc.), or the amounts can be relatively standard.","The amount of the administered active ingredient can vary widely according to such considerations as the particular compound and dosage unit employed, the mode and time of administration, the period of treatment, the age, sex, and general condition of the patient treated, the nature and extent of the condition treated, the rate of drug metabolism and excretion, the potential drug combinations and drug-drug interactions, and the like.","In another embodiment of the invention the compound of formula I is administered in combination with at least one further therapeutic agent in an amount that those of ordinary skill in the art can determine by their professional judgement.","The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is administered one or more, preferably up to three, more preferably up to two times per day. Preference is given to an administration via the oral route. With each administration the number of tablets or capsules taken in at the same time should not exceed two.","Nevertheless, it may in some cases be advantageous to deviate from the amounts specified, depending on body weight, individual behaviour toward the active ingredient, type of preparation and time or interval over which the administration is effected. For instance, less than the aforementioned minimum amounts may be sufficient in some cases, while the upper limit specified has to be exceeded in other cases. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the day.","The combination can comprise effective amounts of at least one compound of Formula I and at least one other therapeutic agent mentioned above, which achieves a greater therapeutic efficacy than when either compound is used alone. The combination can be useful to treat, prevent or manage pulmonary hypertension, where the therapeutic effect is not observed when the agents are used alone, or where an enhanced effect is observed when the combination is administered.","The relative ratios of each compound in the combination can also be selected based on their respective mechanisms of action and the disease biology. The relative ratios of each compound can vary widely and this invention includes combinations for treating, preventing or managing pulmonary hypertension where the amounts of the formula I compound and the other therapeutic agent can be adjusted routinely such that either is present in higher amounts.","The release of one or more agents of the combination can also be controlled, where appropriate, to provide the desired therapeutic activity when in a single dosage form, combination pack, kit or when in separate independent dosage forms.","Preference is given to a combination comprising a compound of formula I and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of phosphodiesterase V inhibitors, endothelin antagonists, prostacyclin analogues, kinase inhibitors and elastase inhibitors.

All materials dissolved over 5 min to yield a yellow solution. Anhydrous ether (30 ml) was added and stirring was continued for 5 minutes until solid began to precipitate. The resultant mixture was chilled with stirring in an ice\/water bath for 45 minutes and then the solid title product (Example 104) was collected by filtration, washed with ether and dried at 55\u00b0 C. in a vacuum oven until NMR analysis showed a lack of solvents (1.5 hours). Other compounds were prepared in a similar way by using a variety of acids rather than toluenesulfonic acid. Scale up and use of less methanol in the first step generally led to quicker precipitation of salts and a variety of solvents were used rather than ether, as indicated, to help crystallize the individual salts. In some cases the methanol was first removed by evaporation in vacuo. Final drying took between 1.5 hours and several days, depending on the quantity of material and the specific specific acid used.","Salts of Example 14 that were Prepared",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0326","num":"0388"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Scale:",{},"Characterization"]},{"entry":["Example #","Acid Used","(14 used, g)","Solvent Added","(melting point, \u00b0 C.)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["106",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00290","num":"00290"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00290","he":"17.19mm","wi":"24.81mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00290.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"1.5","Ether","167-168 with decomposition"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["107",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00291","num":"00291"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00291","he":"13.80mm","wi":"26.84mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00291.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.7","Ether","157-159"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["108",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00292","num":"00292"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00292","he":"5.42mm","wi":"13.63mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00292.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.6","Ether","180-182 with decomposition"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["109",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00293","num":"00293"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00293","he":"5.42mm","wi":"14.73mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00293.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.7","Ether","153-154"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["110","(HCl)*","1.5","Ether","128-131"]},{"entry":[{},"in Ether",{},{},"with decomposition"]},{"entry":["111","HBr","0.7","Most MeOH","137-139"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"evaporated, then","with decomposition"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"acetone\/benzene",{}]},{"entry":["112","HSO","0.6","Most MeOH","177-179"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"evaporated, then","with decomposition"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"acetone\/ether",{}]},{"entry":["113","HNO","0.5","Ether","135 (decomposed)"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"melted 150-152"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["114",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00294","num":"00294"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00294","he":"14.99mm","wi":"16.26mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00294.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"0.5","Ether, Prolonged drying, Hygroscopic","123-128"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["115",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00295","num":"00295"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00295","he":"13.04mm","wi":"19.98mm","file":"US08304406-20121106-C00295.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"4.5","Ether","148-149"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*The disalt with HCl was isolated rather than the 1:1 salt.

The left pulmonary arterial vessel is dissected and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer of following composition (in mmol\/l): NaCl 112, KCl 5.9, CaCl2.0 MgCl1.2, NaHPO1.2, NaHCO25, glucose 11.5 and optionally the compound\/combination to be tested in a concentration of 10to 10mol\/1.","For measurement of isometric tension, ring segments, 2 mm in length, are mounted in a small vessel chamber myograph. Two wires (40 \u03bcm diameter) are introduced through the lumen of the segments and mounted according to the method described by Mulvany and Halpern (Circulation Research 1977; 41:19-26). After a 30 min equilibration period in oxygenated KH solution at 37\u00b0 C. and pH=7.4, segments are stretched to their optimal lumen diameter for active tension development which is determined based on the internal circumference-wall tension ratio of the segments by setting their internal circumference to 90% of what the vessels would have if they are exposed to a passive tension equivalent to that produced by a transmural pressure of 30 mmHg.","Afterwards, segments are washed three times with KH solution and left to equilibrate for 30 min. Segment contractility is then tested by an initial exposure to a high K solution (120 mmol\/l K\u2014KH solution, which is identical to KH solution except that NaCl is replaced by KCl on an equimolar basis).","The vessels are than pre-contracted using K (50 mmol\/l) KH solution. When the contraction is stabilized, an accumulative dose response curve of the compound\/combination tested is constructed. The stabilized contraction induced by K (50 mmol\/l) KH solution is defined as 100% tension. The relaxation is expressed as percentage tension.","Pulmonary Artery Pressure in Monocrotaline Treated Rats","Male Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g) are treated with monocrotaline 60 mg\/kg subcutanously (=day 0). On day 14 after monocrotaline injection treatment the compound\/combination to be tested is administered. On day 28 hemodynamic parameters, i.e. right ventricular pressure, systemic blood pressure, heart rate, arterial and venous oxygen saturation are measured and compared with untreated control animals.","Results:","The mentioned monocrotaline (MCT) treated rats are randomized to receive example 14 [4-(4-chlorophenylamino)-7-(2-methylaminocarbonyl-4-pyridylmethoxy)furo-[2,3-d]pyridazine] 10 mg\/kg or vehicle by gavage once daily after the onset of moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension starting 14 days after the injection of MCT until the final hemodynamic measurement on day 28. In animals with MCT induced pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment with example 14 markedly decreases right ventricular systolic pressure, compared to vehicle treated animals (control: 25\u00b10.56 mmHg; example 14: 42.04\u00b13.21 mmHg vs. placebo: 71.02\u00b15.38 mmHg) (mean\u00b1SEM). This effect of example 14 is paralleled by an inhibition of right ventricular hypertrophy (right ventricle\/left ventricle+septum ratio control: 0.26\u00b10.01; example 14: 0.32\u00b10.02 vs. placebo: 0.54\u00b10.04)."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
