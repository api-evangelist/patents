{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention generally relates to the field of a computer user interface, and more specifically to a system and method for presenting a user interface control for usage in a computer user interface for monitoring the process of measuring and dosing operations.","Measuring and dosing elements are ubiquitous in production, particularly in process industries. A typical task involves measuring, dosing, and weighing predefined amounts of a specific element on a weighing instrument. Precision is important in measuring the quantity of an element to achieve accuracy and so is speed in order to achieve efficiency. For example, a chemical operator has the responsibility of measuring the proper dosage of acetylsalicylic acid and corn starch in order to meet predetermined specifications for batch production of aspirin in the pharmaceutical sector. Such a job requires accuracy in order to reach a target amount so that one may continue onward to the next production batch.","Measuring and dosing devices often provide visual assistance to facilitate the measurement and dosing process. A gauge bar is a frequent form of visual aid that is provided to display measurement values. Each gauge bar may have a target marker that is visible to indicate the target amount that is needed for the current process. As an element is added to a weighing instrument, a progress bar that tracks the process of measurement fills the gauge bar until the target amount has been reached. Once reaching the target amount the process in complete and another element is placed onto the weighing device for the next production batch.","Common measuring and dosing user interfaces use a two level gauge bar approach. A first scale is used to visually represent weight values and a second scale that may be located above the first scale is used to display a magnified portion of the first scale as the progress bar reaches a target value. This type of visualization is cumbersome as a user must focus on one location, while weighing and then shift focus to the second linear gauge to acquire the target value. Furthermore, the gauge bar has different linear scales resulting in a slow speed of the progress bar in the first scale and a faster speed of the progress bar in the second scale. Such scaling complicates the task at hand as it becomes much more difficult to acquire a precise target value and needs much space for displaying two progress bars. A single gauge bar may also be used to measure and dose elements, but this would be even more difficult as the scale factor would be too small to show the details of the target value, thus making it close to impossible to reach a precise target value.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for system and method to visualize measuring and dosing operations are described herein.","Described herein is a computer interface control for usage in a computer user interface to visualize measuring and dosing operations. In one aspect, a measurement scale and a pixel scale are configured. In yet another aspect, a mapping function is configured to map the measurement scale to a pixel scale. A mapped scale is retrieved from a configuration from the mapping function representing the measurement scale over the pixel scale.","In a further aspect, the computer user interface includes a gauge bar having a starting point value and an ending point value. In yet another aspect, the gauge bar includes a configurable target value, wherein the target value is represented as a target marker on the gauge bar. A primary minimum value and a primary maximum value are acceptable values and may also be configured and displayed on the gauge bar. A configuration of at least a secondary minimum value and a secondary maximum value may extend the range of acceptable weight values and are also displayed on the gauge bar. In a further aspect, a current value is indicative of a current measurement of an element displayed on the computer user interface. Contained within the gauge bar is a magnifier that magnifies a portion of the gauge bar. In one aspect, in response to weight, a progress bar increments or decrements according to the weight of an element on a weighing device. In one aspect, the progress bar fills with a first color, a second color, and a third color allowing a color representation when acquiring a target value of an element being weighed depending on the number of configured secondary minimum and secondary maximum values.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for system and method to visualize measuring and dosing operations are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","In various embodiments, the system and method to visualize measuring and dosing operations is a visual aid that allows achievement of get precise weight values of an element being weighed on a weighing device. In response to weight, a progress bar is used to measure progress of measurement to reach a target value of an element. Before the process of measuring begins, a set of primary minimum and a primary maximum values may be configured as a first set of acceptable measurement values. In addition, a set or a plurality set of secondary minimum and maximum values may be configured. A progress bar may be configured to fill specific colors as the progress bar passes the acceptable configured measurement ranges or may be configured to fill with one continuous color. During the process of measuring, the progress bar increments, passing the acceptable measurement ranges as it reaches a target value. As the progress bar nears the target value it enters a magnifier that magnifies a portion of the gauge bar, which in turn, offers a visual method for achieving an exact or close to exact target amount.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","118","104","106","102","120","122"]},"Displayed along the gauge bar are configurable markers for acceptable ranges of measurement when weighing an element. By default, the magnifier is positioned over the acceptable ranges of measurement. A target value  is an optimal measurement that can be achieved when weighing an element. A target value  may also be optional if other acceptable weight values are configured. A primary minimum value  is a minimum weight value that can be acceptable if the weight of the element is, for example, below the target value . A primary maximum value  is a maximum weight value that can be acceptable if the weight of the element is, for example, above the target value . Configuration of a secondary set of acceptable ranges of measurement may also be possible. A secondary minimum value  is a secondary acceptable minimum weight value if the weight of the element is below the primary minimum value  and a secondary maximum value  is a secondary maximum acceptable weight value if the weight of the element is above the primary maximum value . When detecting an element to be weighed, a progress bar  increments and is filled with a first color. The progress reaches a magnifier  that magnifies a portion of the gauge bar and passes the starting point threshold of the magnifier . The progress bar remains a first color until reaching the secondary minimum value .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","114","110","102","104","114","114","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","110","112","102","104","110","104","110","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","112","116","102","104","112","104","112","116"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","116","102","104","104","116"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["608","610","608","602","606","612","614","616","602","606","604","612","614","616","602","606","612","614","616","624"]},"In the graph example, the values between 0 and 25 of the mapped scale  are mapped to the first 225 pixels of the pixel scale  along the slope described by a mapping function, such as a quadratic mapping function . The quadratic mapping function  graphs a parabola that opens upwards and can be calculated, for example, using a general form y=ax+bx+c. Therefore, a progress bar increments of the element being weighed until the progress bar reaches the starting point of the magnifier at . The scale factor  may be used to configure the mapping function at the starting point of the magnifier at  and the ending point of the magnifier at  to match the slopes where the transition points occur when entering a magnifier  and exiting a magnifier .","The magnifier values of 25 and 27.5 are mapped to pixel values of 225 to 375 of the pixel scale using a mapping function, such as a linear mapping function  and can be calculated using a general form y=ex+\u0192, where e=2a, in the example. Adjusting the slopes of the mapping functions at the transition points allows the progress bar to achieve a smooth transition when entering the magnifier  and exiting the magnifier . Once the progress bar passes the ending point of the magnifier at  the progress bar speed decrements. Therefore, the progress bar actually increments, but at a slower pace as the mapped scale values 27.5 to 52.5 are mapped to the pixel scale values of 375 to 650 of the pixel scale  along the slope using a mapping function, such as a negative quadratic mapping function .","In one embodiment, scale factor of a progress bar can be further explained. A mapped scale may be mapped by any continuous function. For example a mapping function can be assigned a linear, non-linear, cubic, quadratic, or any continuous function. Additionally, non-linear scaling is always related to a mapping function, since the resulting mapped scale has a non-linear scale. In contrast, a scale factor function may have linear parts, as in the example of using a quadratic function. A target value, primary minimum and maximum values, and secondary minimum and maximum values are independent from the magnifier, but can be considered when configuring the magnifier to the various scales.","In one embodiment, speed of progress of a progress bar can be further explained. The mapped scale  in combination with pixels scale  determines the speed of progress of a progress bar. A speed of progress depends on the filling speed, as well as, the mapping function . It results from the configuration of the mapping function  and the changing measurement values, for example, when filling a container. Therefore, the speed of progress may increase or decrease along with the weight measured by the weighing device. Furthermore, due to the potential configuration options of the mapping function the speed of progress of a progress bar may be customized. Since a mapping function may be assigned any continuous function, the possibilities of defining a speed of progress of a progress can be numerous for when the progress reaches the starting point of the magnifier , when within the magnifier , and when exiting the ending point of the magnifier .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["100","100","102","606","102","702","604","610","106","608","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","824","826","808","820","810","822","812"]},"Non-linear graph  is an exemplary illustration representing a variable and a constant scale factor of a progress bar. A progress bar increments at a scale factor  in combination with the measurement  of the element being weighed. A progress bar increases scale factor at a variable rate  until the progress reaches the starting point of the magnifier . Once the progress bar is within the magnifier the scale factor is constant . As the progress bar passes the ending point of the magnifier  the progress bar decreases scale factor at a variable rate .","Non-linear graph  is an exemplary illustration representing a variable scale factor change. A progress bar increments at a scale factor  in combination with the measurement  of the element being weighed. A progress bar increases scale factor at a variable rate  until the progress reaches the starting point of the magnifier . The progress bar continues at a variable scale factor once the progress bar reaches the target value . After passing the target value at  the progress bar decreases scale factor at a variable rate  and continues to decrease at a variable rate as the progress bar passes the ending point of the magnifier . In each of the above described portions of the progress bar, the scale factor may increase or decrease along with the weight measured by the weighing device.","In various embodiments, a system and method to visualize measuring and dosing operations described herein may have a number of benefits. The use of the mapped scale based on a mapping function with properly adjusted scale factors allows an altered scale factor of the progress bar inside and outside the magnifier. Instead of having a fast speed change transition in the magnified area or a jump effect, a smooth changeover permits facilitating a precise and fast dosing of an element. The mapping function and a center focus of values, such as the target value, primary minimum value, and primary maximum value on the gauge bar may be set automatically by an application that drives the measuring and dosing process or may also be adjusted manually by the worker executing the measuring and dosing task.","The possibility of assigning a linear, non-linear, cubic, quadratic, and other continuous functions to a scale offers numerous possibilities of scaling and speed of a progress bar. Therefore, the scale factor and speed of progress may be customized to the specific process or choosing of the worker measuring an element. In addition, the ability to customize non-linear scaling of a progress bar is an advantage not only for weighing an element, but also for continuously filling of an element. For example, when filling a container, a worker can see the progress of a progress bar within the gauge bar as an element is continuously filled on the weighing device. This allows the worker to precisely determine the amount of an element that he or she need.","The introduction of the integrated magnifier is not only an instrument to perform a zoom in functionality, similar to a simple magnifying glass. The magnifier does not hide any portion of the gauge bar from view, but rather displays an even visual transition of measurement values as the gauge bar enters and exits the magnifier thresholds. Another benefit is the ability to integrate the magnifier within the gauge bar, thereby saving vertical screen space. This also allows a user to focus on a single point on the computer screen without changing focus as is the case when a magnifier is located separately of the gauge bar to show the details of the target value. Furthermore, a plurality of configurable secondary minimum values and secondary maximum values are possible to further increase the acceptable ranges when weighing an element.","Some embodiments of the invention may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions.
