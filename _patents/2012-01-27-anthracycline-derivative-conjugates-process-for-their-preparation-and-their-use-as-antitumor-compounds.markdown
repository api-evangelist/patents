No. 12\/502,433 filed on 14 Jul. 2009, and also claims the benefit under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

The invention also relates to new anthracycline derivatives and to their preparation.","Anthracyclines are antibiotic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic activity. Studies have indicated that anthracyclines may operate to kill cells by a number of different mechanisms including: 1) intercalation of the drug molecules into the DNA of the cell thereby inhibiting DNA-dependent nucleic acid synthesis; 2) production by the drug of free radicals which then react with cellular macromolecules to cause damage to the cells or 3) interactions of the drug molecules with the cell membrane [see, e.g., C. Peterson et al., \u201cTransport And Storage Of Anthracycline In Experimental Systems And Human Leukemia\u201d in ; N. R. Bachur, \u201cFree Radical Damage\u201d id. at pp. 97-102]. Because of their cytotoxic potential anthracyclines have been used in the treatment of numerous cancers such as leukemia, breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma and sarcomas [see e.g., P. H-Wiernik, in p 11]. Commonly used anthracyclines include doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and daunomycin.","In the recent years many new highly cytotoxic anthracyclines have been synthesized. For example nemorubicin, the anthracycline derivative bearing a substituted morpholino ring linked to the C-3\u2032 position of the sugar moiety has shown promising antitumor activity on experimental murine tumors [see: J. W. Lown, Bioactive Molecules (1988) vol 6:55-101] and is currently under clinical phase trials for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [see: C. Sessa, O. Valota, C. Geroni, Cardiovascular Toxicology (2007) 7(2):75-79]. Although these compounds may be useful in the treatment of neoplasm and other disease states wherein a selected cell population is sought to be eliminated, their therapeutic efficacy is often limited by the dose-dependent toxicity associated with their administration.","Attempts to improve the therapeutic effect of these compounds have been tried by linking the anthracycline to antibodies or to different carriers. An example of an anthracycline conjugated with antibodies is reported, for example, in EP 0328147 to Bristol Myers, in WO 9202255 to Farmitalia Carlo Erba or in U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,458 to Pharmacia & Upjohn.","Other interesting tricyclic morpholino anthracycline derivatives, characterized by high activity, were described and claimed in the International patent application WO 98\/02446 (1997) of M. Caruso et al. Among these derivatives, a particularly active compound is PNU-159682, described by Quintieri, L., Geroni, C. et al. in Clinical Cancer Research (2005) 11(4):1608-1617. Compound PNU-159682 has the formula (IIA) as defined herein below, and the following chemical names:\n\n","Antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer, immunological and angiogenic disorders (Carter, P. (2006) Nature Reviews Immunology 6:343-357). The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), i.e. immunoconjugates, for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer, targets delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, whereas systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Xie et al (2006) Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 6(3):281-291; Kovtun et al (2006) Cancer Res. 66(6):3214-3121; Law et al (2006) Cancer Res. 66(4):2328-2337; Wu et al (2005) Nature Biotech. 23(9):1137-1145; Lambert J. (2005) Current Opin. in Pharmacol. 5:543-549; Hamann P. (2005) Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 15(9):1087-1103; Payne, G. (2003) Cancer Cell 3:207-212; Trail et al (2003) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 52:328-337; Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as drug mechanism of action, drug-linking, drug\/antibody ratio (loading), and drug-releasing properties (McDonagh (2006) Protein Eng. Design & Sel.; Doronina et al (2006) Bioconj. Chem. 17:114-124; Erickson et al (2006) Cancer Res. 66(8):1-8; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852; Jeffrey et al (2005) J. Med. Chem. 48:1344-1358; Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070). Drug moieties may impart their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.","The anthracycline analog, doxorubicin (ADRIAMYCIN\u00ae) is thought to interact with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which unwinds DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin (DAUNOMYCIN) are prototype cytotoxic natural product anthracycline chemotherapeutics (Sessa et al (2007) Cardiovasc. Toxicol. 7:75-79). Immunoconjugates and prodrugs of daunorubicin and doxorubicin have been prepared and studied (Kratz et al (2006) Current Med. Chem. 13:477-523; Jeffrey et al (2006) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 16:358-362; Torgov et al (2005) Bioconj. Chem. 16:717-721; Nagy et al (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97:829-834; Dubowchik et al (2002) Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Letters 12:1529-1532; King et al (2002) J. Med. Chem. 45:4336-4343; U.S. Pat. No. 6,630,579). The antibody-drug conjugate BR96-doxorubicin reacts specifically with the tumor-associated antigen Lewis-Y and has been evaluated in phase I and II studies (Saleh et al (2000) J. Clin. Oncology 18:2282-2292; Ajani et al (2000) Cancer Jour. 6:78-81; Tolcher et al (1999) J. Clin. Oncology 17:478-484).","Morpholino analogs of doxorubicin and daunorubicin, formed by cyclization on the glycoside amino group, have greater potency (Acton et al (1984) J. Med. Chem. 638-645; U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,529; U.S. Pat. No. 4,672,057; U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,687). Nemorubicin is a semisynthetic analog of doxorubicin with a 2-methoxymorpholino group on the glycoside amino of doxorubicin and has been under clinical evaluation (Grandi et al (1990) Cancer Treat. Rew. 17:133; Ripamonti et al (1992) Brit. J. Cancer 65:703), including phase II\/III trials for hepatocellular carcinoma (Sun et al (2003) Proceedings of the American Society for Clinical Oncology 22, Abs1448; Quintieri (2003) Proceedings of the American Association of Cancer Research, 44:1st Ed, Abs 4649; Pacciarini et al (2006) Jour.

A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597.","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences.","An \u201cintact antibody\u201d herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses.\u201d There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.","An \u201cErbB receptor\u201d is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the ErbB receptor family which are important mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. The ErbB receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, HER1), HER2 (ErbB2 or p185), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). The ErbB receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an ErbB ligand; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may be a \u201cnative sequence\u201d ErbB receptor or an \u201camino acid sequence variant\u201d thereof. The ErbB receptor may be native sequence human ErbB receptor. Accordingly, a \u201cmember of the ErbB receptor family\u201d is EGFR (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4 or any other ErbB receptor currently known or to be identified in the future. Sequence identity screening has resulted in the identification of two other ErbB receptor family members; ErbB3 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,884; U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,968; Kraus et al (1989) PNAS (USA) 86:9193-9197) and ErbB4 (EP 599274; Plowman et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:1746-1750; and Plowman et al (1993) Nature 366:473-475). Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines. Anti-ErbB2 antibodies have been characterized (U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171; U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337; U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297; U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,464; U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213; U.S. Pat. No. 6,719,971; U.S. Pat.

(1997) Oncogene 15:1385-1394.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all, or substantially all, of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al (1986) Nature, 321:522-525; Riechmann et al (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta, (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596). Humanized anti-ErbB2 antibodies include huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (HERCEPTIN\u00ae, trastuzumab) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 expressly incorporated herein by reference; humanized 520C9 (WO 93\/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies.","The terms \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.","A \u201cdisorder\u201d is any condition that would benefit from treatment of the present invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include benign and malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies, in particular breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreatic, prostate or bladder cancer; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders. An exemplary disorder to be treated in accordance with the present invention is a solid, malignant tumor.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may: (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce the tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; and\/or (vi) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. In animal models, efficacy may be assessed by physical measurements of the tumor during the course following administration of the ADC, and by determining partial and complete remission of tumor. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A \u201ctumor\u201d comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (\u201cNSCLC\u201d), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","An \u201cErbB-expressing cancer\u201d is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell surface. An \u201cErbB2-expressing cancer\u201d is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of cells thereof, such that an anti-ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.","A cancer which \u201coverexpresses\u201d a receptor, e.g. an ErbB receptor, is one which has significantly higher levels of the receptor, such as ErbB2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the receptor protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of receptor-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO 98\/45479), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). Overexpression of the receptor ligand, may be determined diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand (or nucleic acid encoding it) in the patient, e.g., in a tumor biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the IHC, FISH, southern blotting, PCR or in vivo assays described above. One may also study receptor overexpression by measuring a shed antigen (e.g., ErbB extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,294; WO 91\/05264; U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,638; and Sias et al (1990) J. Immunol. Methods 132: 73-80). Aside from the above assays, various other in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g., a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g., by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.","The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At, I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, P, C, and radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer, regardless of mechanism of action.

P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process.

A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions.

The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety (D) and an antibody unit (Ab) to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of formula Ic. The linker (L) may be stable outside a cell, i.e. extracellular, or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity, hydrolysis, or other metabolic conditions. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol, or an amine, e.g. N-terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine, of the antibody (Ab) can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent, drug moiety (D) or drug-linker reagent (D-L).","Many positions on anthracycline derivative compounds may be useful as the linkage position, depending upon the type of linkage. For example, ester, amide, thioamide, thiocarbamate, or carbamate linkages may be formed from the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl ketone at C14; ketal and hydrazone linkages may be formed from the C13 carbonyl group on the drug moiety; amide, carbamate, and urea linkages may be formed from an amino group on the drug moiety D; and various alkyl, ether, thioether, disulfide, and acyl linkages may be formed from the phenyl and aryl rings on the drug moiety by Friedel-Crafts type alkylation and acylation reactions.","The linkers and spacers are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport or delivery into a cell, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is preferably stable and remains intact, i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will: (i) maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody; (ii) allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety; (iii) remain stable and intact, i.e. not cleaved, until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targetted site; and (iv) maintain a cytotoxic, cell-killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the anthracycline derivative drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy, HPLC, and the separation\/analysis technique LC\/MS.","Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker, and optional spacer, to have two reactive functional groups, i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties, such as peptides, nucleic acids, drugs, toxins, antibodies, haptens, and reporter groups are known, and methods have been described their resulting conjugates (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242).","In another embodiment, the linker or spacer may be substituted with groups which modulate solubility or reactivity. For example, a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety, or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab-L with D, or D-L with Ab, depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.","Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). US 2007\/0092940 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids.","In some embodiments, a Linker has a reactive nucleophilic group which is reactive with an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include, but are not limited to, aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydroxyl, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.","Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.","Spacers (Z) can be peptidic, comprising one or more amino acid units.

Chem. Int. Ed. 42:4490-4494; Amir et al (2003) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42:4494-4499; Shamis et al (2004) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126:1726-1731; Sun et al (2002) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12:2213-2215; Sun et al (2003) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 11:1761-1768; King et al (2002) Tetrahedron Letters 43:1987-1990). Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody, i.e. loading, which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus, where an antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group, a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic or branched linker.","Carrier","The carrier moiety of anthracycline derivative conjugates is derived from polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, proteins or peptides of natural or synthetic origin. Carrier compounds T-NH, T-COOH, T-CHO, T-SH, (V) or (VI) are suitable for conjugation with anthracycline derivative compounds. Carrier moieties may be derived from polyclonal antibodies raised against tumor associated antigens; or from monoclonal antibodies binding to antigens preferentially or selectively expressed on tumor cell populations; or from natural or recombinant peptides or proteins or growth factors preferentially or selectively binding to tumor cells; or from natural or synthetic polymeric carriers such as polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid and their analogues and derivatives, or such as dextran or other polymeric carbohydrate analogues and their derivatives; or from synthetic copolymers such as those derived from N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) see: J. Kopecek, Macromolecules. H. Benoit & P. Rempp, Ed.: 505-520 (1982) Pergamon Press. Oxford, England; or from poly(aminoacid) copolymers such as poly(GluNa, Ala, Tyr) which are useful as targetable drug-carriers for lung tissue R. Duncan et al., Journal of Bioactive and Compatible Polymers, Vol 4, July 1989. The carrier portion may be also derived from portions of the above mentioned peptides or proteins obtained through recombinant DNA techniques.","Antibodies","Representative examples of the above mentioned antibodies and of respective possible therapeutic applications are: anti-T-cell antibody T101 (Royston, I. et al., J. Immunol. 1980, 125:725); anti-CD5 antibody OKT1 (Ortho) ATCC CRL 8000 cronic lymphocytic leukemias); anti-CD20 antibody IgG1 ibritumomab, (Theuer, C. P. et al. Biotechnology Annual Review 2004 non-hodgkin's lymphoma); anti-CD33 antibody huCD33, (Drug of the future 2000 25(7):686 acute myeloid leukemia); anti-transferrin receptor antibody OKT9 (Ortho) ATCC CRL 8021 ovarian and other tumors; anti-melanoma antibody MAb 9.2.27 (Bumol, T. F. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1982, 79:1245 melanomas); anti-carcinoma markers antibody such as: anti-CEA 1116 NS-3d ATCC CRL 8019), anti-alpha-fetoprotein OM 3-1.1 ATCC HB 134 also hepatomas), 791T\/36 (Embleton, M. J. et al., Br. J. Cancer 1981, 43, 582 also osteogenic sarcoma), B 72.3 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,918 colorectal carcinomas and other tumors), anti-ovarian carcinoma antibody OVB 3 ATCC HB 9147, anti-breast carcinoma antibody HMGF antigen (Aboud-Pirak, E. et al., Cancer Res. 1988, 48:3188), anti-bladder carcinoma 1G3.10 (Yu, D. S. et al., Eur. J. Urol. 1987, 13:198), anti-CanAg antibody huC242 antibody (Olcher, Anthony W. et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology 2003, 21(2):211-222 colon, pancreas, gastric), anti-prostate antibody MLN591 (Henry, Michael D. et al., Cancer Research 2004 advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer).","Representative examples of the above mentioned growth factors and proteins of natural or recombinant origin are FGF, EGF, PDGF, TGF-ALPHA, ALPHA -MS, Interleukins, Interferons, TNF, melanotropin (MSH), Mcm2 etc. The carrier T-CHO is preferably derived from polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies having the carbohydrate moiety, preferentially located in the Fc region, selectively oxidized to aldehyde groups by means of chemical or enzymatic methods, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,958.","The antibody unit (Ab) of Formula IIc includes any unit, type, or class of antibody that binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor, antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target-cell population. An antibody can be any protein or protein-like molecule that binds to, complexes with, or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In one aspect, the antibody unit acts to deliver the anthracycline derivative drug moiety to the particular target cell population with which the antibody unit reacts. Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, large molecular weight proteins such as, full-length antibodies and antibody fragments. The antibodies of Formula I allow attaining high concentrations of active metabolite molecules in cancer cells. Intracellular targeting may be achieved by methods and compounds which allow accumulation or retention of biologically active agents inside cells. Such effective targeting may be applicable to a variety of therapeutic formulations and procedures.","In one embodiment, the ADC specifically binds to a receptor encoded by an ErbB gene, such as EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. The ADC may inhibit growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor.","In another embodiment, the antibody (Ab) of Formula IIc is a humanized antibody such as huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 or huMAb4D5-8 (trastuzumab).","The antibodies of the invention include cysteine-engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of any form of wild-type or parent antibody is replaced with a cysteine amino acid. The engineered cysteine amino acid is a free cysteine acid and not part of an intrachain or interchain disulfide unit. Any form, type, or variant of antibody may be so engineered, i.e. mutated. For example, a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a cysteine engineered Fab, referred to herein as \u201cThioFab.\u201d Similarly, a parent monoclonal antibody may be engineered to form a \u201cThioMab.\u201d It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered cysteine residue in a ThioFab, while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a ThioMab, due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. The cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention include monoclonal antibodies, humanized or chimeric monoclonal antibodies, antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, fusion polypeptides and analogs that preferentially bind cell-associated polypeptides.","Cysteine-engineered antibodies have been designed as Fab antibody fragments (thioFab) and expressed as full-length, IgG monoclonal (thioMab) antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541, the contents of which are incorporated by reference). ThioFab and ThioMab antibodies have been conjugated through linkers at the newly introduced cysteine thiols with thiol-reactive linker reagents and drug-linker reagents to prepare antibody-drug conjugates (Thio ADC), including anti-HER2 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541), anti-CD22 (US 2008\/0050310), and anti-steap1 (WO 2008\/052187), as well as other cysteine engineered antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates.","Antibodies comprising the antibody-drug conjugates of Formula IIc preferably retain the antigen binding capability of their native, wild type counterparts. Thus, antibodies of the invention are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to antigens. Such antigens include, for example, tumor-associated antigens (TAA), cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules, cell survival regulatory factors, cell proliferation regulatory factors, molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) tissue development or differentiation, lymphokines, cytokines, molecules involved in cell cycle regulation, molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) angiogenesis. The tumor-associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor (i.e., a CD protein). An antigen to which an antibody of the invention is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above-mentioned categories, wherein the other subset(s) of said category comprise other molecules\/antigens that have a distinct characteristic (with respect to the antigen of interest).","In one embodiment, the antibody of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of Formula IIc specifically binds to a receptor encoded by an ErbB gene. The antibody may bind specifically to an ErbB receptor selected from EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain (ECD) of the HER2 receptor and inhibit the growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor. The antibody of the ADC may be a monoclonal antibody, e.g. a murine monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, or a humanized antibody. A humanized antibody may be huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 or huMAb4D5-8 (trastuzumab). The antibody may be an antibody fragment, e.g. a Fab fragment.","Antibodies in Formula IIc antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can be prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type(s) of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non-cancerous cell(s). Often, such tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies.","Examples of TAA include, but are not limited to the Tumor-Associated Antigens (1)-(36) listed below. For convenience, information relating to these antigens, all of which are known in the art, is listed below and includes names, alternative names, Genbank accession numbers and primary reference(s), following nucleic acid and protein sequence identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Nucleic acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA (1)-(36) are available in public databases such as GenBank. Tumor-associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references, or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example, a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.","Tumor-Associated Antigens (1)-(36):","(1) BMPR1B (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-type IB, Genbank accession no.

In one embodiment, the anthracycline derivative conjugate compounds include an antibody conjugated, i.e. covalently attached by a linker, to an anthracycline derivative drug moiety where the drug when not conjugated to an antibody has a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect. The biological activity of the drug moiety is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention may selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity, i.e. a lower efficacious dose may be achieved.","In one embodiment, the bioavailability of the ADC, or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC, is improved in a mammal when compared to the corresponding PNU-159682, anthracycline derivative compound alone. Also, the bioavailability of the ADC, or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC is improved in a mammal when compared to the corresponding antibody alone (antibody of the ADC, without the drug moiety or linker).","In one embodiment, the anthracycline derivative drug moiety of the ADC is not cleaved from the antibody until the antibody-drug conjugate binds to a cell-surface receptor or enters a cell with a cell-surface receptor specific for the antibody of the antibody-drug conjugate. The drug moiety may be cleaved from the antibody after the antibody-drug conjugate enters the cell. The anthracycline derivative drug moiety may be intracellularly cleaved in a mammal from the antibody of the compound, or an intracellular metabolite of the compound, by enzymatic action, hydrolysis, oxidation, or other mechanism.","Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat.

It is well known that in malignant tumors there is a high rate of glycolysis compared to normal tissue, causing an increase in the production of lactate and thus a decrease of the pH in the tumor see: H. M. Rauen et al., Z. Naturforsch, Teil B, 23 (1968) 1461. The invention affords a two level specificity of action of the compounds, the first one consisting in a preferential localization of the conjugate in the tumor tissue by means of antigenic recognition, and the second one consisting in a preferential release of the drug in its active form in the tumor tissue by means of preferential acidic cleavage. While not limiting the scope or utility of the compositions or methods of the invention, the acid-sensitive acetal linkers described herein may be cleaved in vivo under localized or systemic acidic conditions, thus separating the targeting antibody from the drug moiety.","The conjugates produced according to the methods described are characterized following different chemical-physical methods. The retention of the original molecular weight and the lack of aggregate formation may be assessed by chromatographic gel filtration procedures (Yu, D. S. et al., J. Urol. 140, 415, 1988) with simultaneous and independent detection of anthracycline and antibody at different wavelengths, and by gel electrophoretic methods. The overall charge distribution of the compounds obtained may be assessed by chromatographic ion exchange methods. The anthracycline concentration may be assessed by spectrophotometric titration against a standard calibration curve obtained from the parent anthracycline. The protein concentration may be assessed by colorimetric assays such as the bicinchonic acid assay (Smith, P. K. et al., Anal. Biochem. 150, 76, 1985) or the Bradford dye assay (Bradford, M. M., (1976) Anal. Biochem. 72:248). The antigen binding activity retention of the antibodies, after the conjugation procedures, may be assessed by an ELISA method (Yu, D. S. et al., J. Urol. 140, 415, 1988) and by cytofluorimetric methods (Gallego, J. et al., Int. J. Cancer 33, 737, 1984). The acid sensitivity of the conjugate may be evaluated by chromatographic methods after incubation of the compounds in suitable buffered solutions.","Drug Loading","The drug loading is represented by p in an antibody-drug conjugate molecule of Formula I, the average number of anthracycline derivative drugs per antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per antibody (Ab), i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the antibody. Compositions of ADC of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, electrophoresis, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates.","Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. Additionally, the antibody must be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading (drug\/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.","Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the anthracycline derivative drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved and near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.","Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody.","Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more anthracycline derivative drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.","Preparation of Antibody-Drug Conjugates","The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker reagent D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of antibodies, drug moieties, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug conjugates of Formula I.","Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.). Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.","Antibody-drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852).

Formula I ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials.","Transgenic animals and cell lines are particularly useful in screening antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) that have potential as prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders involving overexpression of tumor-associated antigens and cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,979). Screening for a useful ADC may involve administering candidate ADC over a range of doses to the transgenic animal, and assaying at various time points for the effect(s) of the ADC on the disease or disorder being evaluated. Alternatively, or additionally, the drug can be administered prior to or simultaneously with exposure to an inducer of the disease, if applicable. Candidate ADC may be screened serially and individually, or in parallel under medium or high-throughput screening format. The rate at which ADC may be screened for utility for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders is limited only by the rate of synthesis or screening methodology, including detecting\/measuring\/analysis of data.","One embodiment is a screening method comprising (a) transplanting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line into a non-human animal, (b) administering an ADC drug candidate to the non-human animal and (c) determining the ability of the candidate to inhibit the formation of tumors from the transplanted cell line. The invention also concerns a method of screening ADC candidates for the treatment of a disease or disorder characterized by the overexpression of a receptor protein comprising (a) contacting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line with a drug candidate and (b) evaluating the ability of the ADC candidate to inhibit the growth of the stable cell line.","One embodiment is a screening method comprising (a) contacting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line with an ADC drug candidate and (b) evaluating the ability of the ADC candidate to induce cell death, induce apoptosis, block heregulin binding, block ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, or block ligand activation of HER2. Another embodiment the ability of the ADC candidate to is evaluated. In another embodiment the ability of the ADC candidate to is evaluated.","Another embodiment is a screening method comprising (a) administering an ADC drug candidate to a transgenic non-human mammal that overexpresses, e.g. in its mammary gland cells, a native human protein, e.g. HER2 or a fragment thereof, wherein such transgenic mammal has stably integrated into its genome a nucleic acid sequence encoding the native human protein or a fragment thereof having the biological activity of the native human protein, operably linked to transcriptional regulatory sequences directing its expression, and develops a tumor. Candidate ADC are screened by being administered to the transgenic animal over a range of doses, and evaluating the animal's physiological response to the compounds over time. Administration may be oral, or by suitable injection, depending on the chemical nature of the compound being evaluated. In some cases, it may be appropriate to administer the compound in conjunction with co-factors that would enhance the efficacy of the compound. If cell lines derived from the subject transgenic animals are used to screen for compounds useful in treating various disorders associated with overexpression of certain tumor-associated antigen proteins or cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2-overexpression. To identify growth inhibitory ADC compounds that specifically target HER2, one may screen for ADC which inhibit the growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cells derived from transgenic animals (U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171)","In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assay","Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is measured by: exposing mammalian cells having tumor-associated antigens or receptor proteins to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays may be used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC), cytotoxicity (EC), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the ADC. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,024; U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,670). This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay is conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.","The evaluation of the retention of cytotoxicity of conjugates in comparison with the parent drug may be assessed by a test based on the quantification of ATP. A2780 human ovarian and MCF7 human breast cancer cells (1250 cells\/well) were seeded in white 384 well-plates in complete medium (RPMI1640 or EMEM plus 10% Fetal bovine serum) and treated with compounds dissolved in 0.1% DMSO, 24 h after seeding. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2 and after 72 hours the plates were processed using CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instruction.","CellTiter-Glo is a homogenous method based on the quantification of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells. ATP is quantified using a system based on luciferase and D-luciferin resulting into light generation. The luminescent signal is proportional to the number of cells present in culture. Briefly, 25 \u03bcL\/well reagent solutions were added to each well and after 5 minutes shacking microplates were read by a luminometer. The luminescent signal is proportional to the number of cells present in culture.","The anti-proliferative effects of antibody-drug conjugates of Formula Ic (Table 6) were measured by the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay (Example 9) against the HER2 expressing tumor cell lines in  in 3 day continuous exposure studies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0533","num":"0535"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0534","num":"0536"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0535","num":"0537"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0536","num":"0538"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0537","num":"0539"},"figref":"FIG. 12","sub":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0538","num":"0540"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0539","num":"0541"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0540","num":"0542"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0541","num":"0543"},"figref":"FIG. 16","sub":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0542","num":"0544"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0543","num":"0545"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0544","num":"0546"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0545","num":"0547"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0546","num":"0548"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0547","num":"0549"},"figref":"FIG. 22","sub":"50 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0548","num":"0550"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0549","num":"0551"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0550","num":"0552"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0551","num":"0553"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0552","num":"0554"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0553","num":"0555"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0554","num":"0556"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 27"]},"Table 3 summarizes the ICvalues (ug\/ml) for inhibition of SK-BR-3, BT-474, MCF7, doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes), and doxorubicin-resistant (DoxRes) with verapamil cell proliferation of the test compounds of .

Pharmacol. 50:333-340) and according to Example 11. Toxicity of ADC is investigated by treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rats with the ADC and subsequent inspection and analysis of the effects on various organs. Based on gross observations (body weights), clinical pathology parameters (serum chemistry and hematology) and histopathology, the toxicity of ADC may be observed, characterized, and measured.","A multi-day acute toxicity study in adolescent female rats may be conducted by one or more doses of a candidate ADC, a control ADC, free anthracycline derivative compound (PNU-159682) and a control Vehicle (day 0). Body weight is measured periodically. Clinical chemistry, serum enzymes and hematology analysis is also conducted periodically; concluding with complete necropsy with histopathological assessment. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss, considering that weight loss, or weight change relative to animals dosed only with Vehicle in animals after dosing with ADC, is a gross and general indicator of systemic or localized toxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be measured by: (i) elevated liver enzymes such as AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (g-glutamyl transferase); (ii) increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures; and (iii) hepatocyte necrosis. Hematolymphoid toxicity is observed by depletion of leukocytes, primarily granuloctyes (neutrophils), and\/or platelets, and lymphoid organ involvement, i.e. atrophy or apoptotic activity. Toxicity is also noted by gastrointestinal tract lesions such as increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and degenerative entercolitis.","Administration of Antibody-Drug Conjugate Pharmaceutical Formulations","Therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, bolus, intratumor injection or epidural (Shire et al (2004) J. Pharm. Sciences 93(6):1390-1402). Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are typically prepared for parenteral administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers, in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.).","The ADC may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Any appropriate carrier or diluent may be used. Suitable carriers and diluents include physiological saline solution and Ringers dextrose solutions.","Acceptable parenteral vehicles, diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include: (i) buffers such as phosphate, citrate, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, and other organic acids; (ii) antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; (iii) preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; (iv) alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); (v) low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; (vi) hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; (vii) amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; (viii) monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, trehalose, sodium starch glycolate, sorbitol mannose, carboxymethylcellulose, or dextrins; (ix) chelating agents such as EDTA; (x) salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); (xi) non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG); (xii) glidants or granulating agents such as magnesium stearate, carboxymethylcellulose, talc, silica, and hydrogenated vegetable oil; (xiii) disintegrant such as crosprovidone, sodium starch glycolate or cornstarch; (xiv) thickening agents such as gelatin and polyethylene glycol; (xv) enteric coatings such as triethyl citrate; and\/or (xvi) taste or texture modifiers, antifoaming agents, pigments, and dessicants. For example, lyophilized anti-ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97\/04801, expressly incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary formulation of an ADC contains about 100 mg\/ml of trehalose (2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydropyran-2-yl]oxy-tetrahydropyran-3,4,5-triol; CHO; CAS Number 99-20-7) and about 0.1% TWEEN\u2122 20 (polysorbate 20; dodecanoic acid 2-[2-[3,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]-2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl ester; CHO; CAS Number 9005-64-5) at approximately pH 6.","Pharmaceutical formulations of a therapeutic antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) may contain certain amounts of unreacted drug moiety (D), antibody-linker intermediate (Ab-L), and\/or drug-linker intermediate (D-L), as a consequence of incomplete purification and separation of excess reagents, impurities, and by-products, in the process of making the ADC; or time\/temperature hydrolysis or degradation upon storage of the bulk ADC or formulated ADC composition. For example, a formulation of the ADC may contain a detectable amount of free drug. Alternatively, or in addition to, it may contain a detectable amount of drug-linker intermediate. Alternatively, or in addition to, it may contain a detectable amount of the antibody. The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacrylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","Formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared under sterile conditions and by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the ADC with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials (ADC) in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur. Subcutaneous (bolus) administration may be effected with about 1.5 ml or less of total volume and a concentration of about 100 mg ADC per ml. For ADC that require frequent and chronic administration, the subcutaneous route may be employed, such as by pre-filled syringe or autoinjector device technology.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of ADC administered per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day. For example, human patients may be initially dosed at about 1.5 mg ADC per kg patient body weight. The dose may be escalated to the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). The dosing schedule may be about every 3 weeks, but according to diagnosed condition or response, the schedule may be more or less frequent. The dose may be further adjusted during the course of treatment to be at or below MTD which can be safely administered for multiple cycles, such as about 4 or more.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are generally disfavored due to poor bioavailability due to limited absorption, hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut, formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Exemplary unit dosage formulations contain a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","Antibody-Drug Conjugate Methods of Treatment","Antibody-drug conjugates of the invention are useful as antitumor agents. A mammal, e.g. a human or animal, may therefore be treated by a method comprising administering thereto a pharmaceutically effective amount of a conjugate of formula I as hereinbefore defined. The condition of the human or animal may be ameliorated or improved in this way.","Formula I ADC may be used to treat various diseases or disorders in a patient, such as cancer and autoimmune conditions including those characterized by the overexpression of a tumor-associated antigen. Exemplary conditions or disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies; other disorders such as neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders. Cancer types susceptible to ADC treatment include those which are characterized by the overexpression of certain tumor associated antigens or cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2.","One method is for the treatment of cancer in a mammal, wherein the cancer is characterized by the overexpression of an ErbB receptor. The mammal optionally does not respond, or responds poorly, to treatment with an unconjugated anti-ErbB antibody. The method comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody-drug conjugate compound. The growth of tumor cells that overexpress a growth factor receptor such as HER2 receptor or EGF receptor may be inhibited by administering to a patient a Formula I ADC which binds specifically to said growth factor receptor and a chemotherapeutic agent wherein said antibody-drug conjugate and said chemotherapeutic agent are each administered in amounts effective to inhibit growth of tumor cells in the patient.","A human patient susceptible to or diagnosed with a disorder characterized by overexpression of ErbB2 receptor, may be treated by administering a combination of a Formula I ADC and a chemotherapeutic agent. Such excessive activation may be attributable to overexpression or increased production of the ErbB receptor or an ErbB ligand. In one embodiment, a diagnostic or prognostic assay will be performed to determine whether the patient's cancer is characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor. For example, ErbB gene amplification and\/or overexpression of an ErbB receptor in the cancer may be determined. Various assays for determining such amplification\/overexpression are available in the art and include IHC, FISH and shed antigen assays.","Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The ADC formulation is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of ADC is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical dosage regimen might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg\/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg\/kg of the ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful.","Combination Therapy","An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anti-cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.","The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, aromatase inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor, lipid kinase inhibitor, anti-androgen, antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme, gene therapy vaccine, anti-angiogenic agent and\/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin-forming inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.","Alternatively, or additionally, the second compound may be an antibody which binds or blocks ligand activation of tumor-associated antigen or receptor. The second antibody may be conjugated with a cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., a macrocyclic depsipeptide, an auristatin, a calicheamicin, or a 1,8 bis-naphthalimide moiety. For example, it may be desirable to further provide antibodies which bind to EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, or vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) in the one formulation or dosing regimen.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","In one embodiment, treatment with an ADC of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers's instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).","The ADC may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (EP 616812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer, the patient may previously have been subjected to anti-hormonal therapy and, after the cancer becomes hormone independent, the anti-ErbB2 antibody (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and\/or radiation therapy.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","Metabolites of the Antibody-Drug Conjugates","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products may be identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. C or H) ADC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds.","Metabolites include the products of in vivo cleavage of the ADC where cleavage of any bond occurs that links the drug moiety to the antibody. Metabolic cleavage may thus result in the naked antibody, or an antibody fragment. The antibody metabolite may be linked to a part, or all, of the linker. Metabolic cleavage may also result in the production a drug moiety or part thereof. The drug moiety metabolite may be linked to a part, or all, of the linker.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing ADC and materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, or blister pack. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an ADC. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer.","In one embodiment, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution, and a package insert indicating that the first and second compounds can be used to treat cancer. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","The compounds of the present invention, as prepared according to the following examples, were characterized by HPLC\/MS analytical data; HPLC\/MS data were collected following any one of methods 1, 2.","HPLC\/MS Analytic Method 1","Waters 2795 Alliance HT HPLC system equipped with a 2996 Waters PDA detector and Micromass mod.

The plates were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.","4. CellTiter-Glo Reagent (100 \u03bcl) was added.","5. The contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis.","6. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescence signal.","7. Luminescence was recorded and reported in graphs as RLU=relative luminescence units.","The disposition of antibody-drug conjugates in vivo is analyzed by measuring the serum concentrations of antibody and of drug conjugate after a single intravenous bolus dose into Sprague-Dawley rats. Concentrations of antibody-drug conjugates bearing at least one cytotoxic drug are measured with an ELISA that used a extracellular domain (ECD) protein for the capture and anti-anthracycline and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse Fc antibody for detection. Total antibody concentrations in serum were measured with an ELISA that uses ECD for capture and anti-human-Fc HRP for detection, measuring antibody, both with and without conjugated anthracycline derivative. The serum concentration-time data from each animal is analyzed using a two-compartment model with IV bolus input, first-order elimination, and macro-rate constants (Model 8, WinNonlin Pro v.5.0.1, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif.).","A 12 day acute toxicity study in adolescent female rats (100-125 gms) is conducted by a single injection of antibody-drug conjugate at about 1-10 mg\/kg, and a control Vehicle at day 1. Injection of test article is typically administered as an intravenous bolus. Body weight is measured daily. Clinical chemistry, serum enzymes and hematology analysis is conducted periodically. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss.","All animal studies were performed in compliance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Genentech.","Efficacy studies were performed using SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). The efficacy models for the studies exemplified in  were employed as described (Polson et al (2009) Cancer Res. 69(6):2358-2364; Phillips et al (2008) Cancer Res. 68(22):9280-9290; US 2008\/0050310; US 2005\/0276812), evaluating tumor volume after a single intravenous dose. Transplant models were developed using tumors excised from a mouse bearing an intraperitoneal tumor, then serially passaged into recipient mice. For example, cells for implantation were washed and suspended in HBSS (Hyclone) and inoculated subcutaneously into the flanks of female CB17 ICR severe combined immunodeficiency mice (7-16 weeks of age from Charles Rivers Laboratories), in a volume of 0.2 mL\/mouse. To test the efficacy of the antibody drug conjugates in vivo, approximately several million cells per SCID mouse were inoculated once and allowed to grow for about 10 to 60 days post-injection. When tumor volumes reached 150-200 mm(typically Day 14 to Day 21 after inoculation), the mice were segregated into sample groups of 9-10 mice per group and the tumor volume was determined in each mouse. When mean tumor size reached the desired volume, the mice were divided into groups of 8 to 10 mice with the same mean tumor size and dosed intravenously via the tail vein with samples: ADCs, antibodies, or Vehicle. ADC doses were either measured as the mass of the conjugated cytotoxic small molecule drug per surface area of the mouse, or as a constant mass of ADC per mass of the mouse (e.g., 5 mg of ADC\/kg mouse). In general, the drug loads on the antibodies in any given experiment were similar or normalized, so these two measures could be considered equivalent. Tumor volume was measured using calipers according to the formula: V (mm)=0.5A\u00d7B, where A and B are the long and short diameters, respectively. Mice were euthanized before tumor volume reached 3000 mmor when tumors showed signs of impending ulceration. Data collected from each experimental group were expressed as mean\u00b1SE."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 7","i":"d ","sup":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 32"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
