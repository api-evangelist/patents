{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A circuit design generally models a layout of a circuit having one or more devices, such as one or more transistors, OPAMPS, current-mode logic blocks, analog devices, cascade current mirrors, etc. Such devices are placed and sized within the circuit design according to various circuit topology properties or device parameters, such as channel widths, channel lengths, poly-to-poly spacing, poly density, or a variety of other parameters or constraints. The circuit design is generated according a process design type, such as a 90 nm processing environment.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of the claimed subject matter. It is evident, however, that the claimed subject matter can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","One or more systems and techniques for porting a circuit design from a first process design type to a second process design type are provided herein. A circuit design, such as an analog circuit comprising one or more components such as transistors, OPAMPS, current mode logic (CML), cascade current mirrors, etc., is designed according to a first process design type, such as a 90 nm processing environment. Structures of such components within the circuit design are placed and sized according to design constraints, size constraints, spacing constraint, or other design rules for the first process design type. The circuit design is ported from the first design process type to a second design process type, such as a 50 nm processing environment. However, satisfaction of the design rules for the first process design type does not guarantee that the circuit design will satisfy design rules for the second process design type. Accordingly, as provided herein, the circuit design is efficiently ported from the first process design type to the second design type such that transistor dimension resizing, performance analysis, area estimation, and generation of a new design and layout is straightforward and automated.","A method  of porting a circuit design from a first process design type to a second process design type is illustrated in . The circuit design is specified according to the first process design type. Components within the circuit design are placed, sized, or connected according to design rules for the first process design type. At , the circuit design is partitioned into one or more topology categories, such as a first topology category, a second topology category, or any other number or type of topology categories. In an embodiment, the first topology category comprises a current mirror topology and the second topology category comprises a differential pair topology.  illustrates one or more topology categories used to construct analog circuit structures. A cascade current mirror structure  is constructed of a first structure  formed according to the current mirror topology and a second structure  formed according to the current mirror topology. An OPAMP structure  is constructed of a first structure  formed according to the current mirror topology, a second structure  formed according to the differential pair topology, and a third structure  formed according to the current mirror topology. A current mode logic (CML) structure  is constructed of a first structure  formed according to the differential pair topology and a second structure  formed according to the current mirror topology.","At , a first ordered set of parameters for the first topology category and a second ordered set of parameters for the second topology category are determined. In an embodiment, one or more parameters are identified for the first topology category, such as an Rout parameter or a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter for inclusion within a current mirror topology category. In an embodiment, one or more parameters are identified for the second topology category, such as a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter, a transconductance (gm) parameter, or a current on to current off ratio (Ion\/Ioff) parameter for inclusion within a differential pair topology category.","Circuit topology behavior of the first topology category is simulated to identify first performance characteristics for the first ordered set of parameters. In an embodiment, an Rout parameter for the current mirror topology category is simulated utilizing a linear regression model and a device parameter lambda to determine a channel length for the current mirror topology category or a first performance characteristic for the channel length. Circuit topology behavior of the second topology category is simulated to identify second performance characteristics for the second ordered set of parameters.","The first ordered set of parameters is normalized based upon the first performance characteristics and the second ordered set of parameters is normalized based upon the second performance characteristics. A normalized parameter corresponds to a new parameter value, such as a new channel length having a new performance value, associated with the second process design type that satisfies an older parameter value associated with the first process design type, such as an old channel length having an old performance value. In an embodiment, if the old channel length of the first process design type has a performance value of 7.47, then the new channel length is selected as the normalized parameter such that the normalized parameter has a performance value of 7.47 or greater.","Parameters within the first ordered set of parameters and parameters within the second ordered set of parameters are ranked and ordered according to various criteria, such as a dimension ranking criteria. In an embodiment, a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter is ranked based upon a headroom criteria, an Rout parameter is ranked based upon an Id to Vds sensitivity criteria, a transconductance parameter is ranked based upon a voltage gain to current criteria, a current on to current off ratio (Ion\/Ioff) parameter is ranked based upon an output swing degradation criteria, etc. In an embodiment where the first topology category comprises a current mirror topology category, an Rout parameter is ordered before a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter within the first ordered set of parameters based upon the Rout parameter having a higher ranking than the voltage threshold (Vth) parameter for the current mirror topology category. In an embodiment where the second topology category comprises a differential pair topology category, a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter is ordered before a transconductance parameter within the second ordered set of parameters based upon the voltage threshold (Vth) parameter having a higher ranking than the transconductance parameter for the differential pair topology category. The transconductance parameter is ordered before a current on to current off ratio (Ion\/Ioff) parameter based upon the transconductance parameter having a higher ranking than the Ion\/Ioff parameter for the differential pair topology category.","At , one or more components, such as transistors, within the circuit design are resized based upon the first ordered set of parameters and the second ordered set of parameters to generate a ported circuit design specified according to the second design process type for the circuit design. In an embodiment where the first topology category comprises a current mirror topology category, an initial channel length selection is identified for a first component, such as a first transistor, based upon a first parameter within the first ordered set of parameters. In an embodiment, a channel length of  is selected based upon an Rout parameter because the channel length of  provides a performance value equal to or greater than a performance value of an old channel length of  used for the first process design type (e.g., ). The initial channel length selection is refined based upon a second parameter within the first ordered set of parameters. In an embodiment, a channel length of  is selected based upon a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter because the channel length of  is below a saturation threshold specified by the voltage threshold (Vth) parameter. A channel width is determined for the first component utilizing a current square law technique and the channel length. In this way, channel lengths, channel widths, or other device parameters are determined for resizing transistors within the ported circuit design for the second process design type.","In an embodiment where the second topology category comprises a differential pair topology category, a first initial channel size parameter selection is identified for a second component, such as a channel length or width for a second transistor, based upon a voltage threshold (Vth) parameter within the second ordered set of parameters. The first initial channel size parameter selection is refined based upon a transconductance (gm) parameter within the second ordered set of parameters to create a second initial channel size parameter selection. The second initial channel size parameter selection is refined based upon a current on to current off ration (Ion\/Ioff) parameter within the second ordered set of parameters to determine a channel size parameter for utilization in the ported circuit design. In this way, channel size parameters are determined for resizing transistors within the ported circuit design for the second process design type.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","302","302","300","304","304","302","304","302","306","308","300","310","310","306","312","310","308","314","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["304","302","354","356","310","354","358","310","354","358","1","2","310","356","358","1","2","3","302"]},"In an embodiment where a component for the differential pair topology  comprises an OPAMP, the parameter component  determines an ordered set of parameters for the OPAMP to comprise the voltage threshold (Vth) parameter and the transconductance (gm) parameter.
