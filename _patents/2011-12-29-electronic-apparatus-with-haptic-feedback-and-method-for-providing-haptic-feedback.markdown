{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Taiwan application Serial No. 100102168, filed Jan. 20, 2011, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Technical Field","The disclosure relates in general to an electronic apparatus, and more particularly to a portable device with haptic feedback.","2. Description of the Related Art","Portable devices, such as smart phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), and multimedia player, provide versatile functions to meet users' various needs. Whether a portable device provides a simple and friendly user interface to create pleasant user experience greatly or not affects a user's willingness of using this particular device.","Single or multi-touch user interface, which has become mainstream user interface, makes the portable device easier to use. The portable device with touch sensitive function still cannot satisfy the user's need for man-machine interaction, and therefore some manufacturers develop haptic feedback on electronic products to provide simple vibration function. However, the haptic feedback technology still has much to improve so as to bring the user better user experience.","The disclosure is directed to an electronic apparatus with haptic feedback and a method for providing haptic feedback. The haptic feedback function of the electronic apparatus of an embodiment has a dynamic range compression mechanism by which the haptic feedback generated from the electronic apparatus generates vibration effect to improve user experience. Thus, the electronic apparatus can simulate delicate and structured haptic feedback effect. Moreover, under certain circumstances, such as several different haptic commands being combined, the haptic command can avoid distortion which occurs when the control value is outside the dynamic range.","According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a method for providing haptic feedback is provided. The method includes the following steps. An actuation unit is provided to generate haptic feedback. In response to at least a haptic command, a control value is dynamically generated to control the actuation unit to generate haptic feedback, wherein dynamic range compression is applied to dynamically generate the control value so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range.","According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic apparatus with haptic feedback is provided. The electronic apparatus includes an actuation unit and a control unit. The actuation unit generates haptic feedback. The control unit is coupled to the actuation unit, and dynamically generates a control value to control the actuation unit to generate haptic feedback in response to at least a haptic command, wherein the control unit applies dynamic range compression to dynamically generate the control value so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range.","According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic apparatus with haptic feedback is provided. The electronic apparatus includes an actuation unit, a control unit, and a dynamic range compression unit. The actuation unit generates haptic feedback. The dynamic range compression unit is coupled to the control unit and the actuation unit, and dynamically generate a control signal to control the actuation unit to generate haptic feedback in response to at least a haptic command, wherein the dynamic range compression unit applies dynamic range compression to dynamically generate the control signal so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range.","The above and other aspects of the disclosure will become better understood with regard to the following detailed description of the non-limiting embodiment(s). The following description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","120","100","100"]},"To make the descriptions easy to understand, here below the haptic feedback generated by the actuation unit  is vibration perceivable to the user. For example, the wave pattern W of  denotes an example of haptic feedback perceivable to the user or the testing element, wherein the haptic feedback envelope curve C varies within a vibration range. For example, the envelope curve C is less than or equal to the maximum value MAX of the amplitude. The actuation unit can be realized by a vibration element of one or multiple devices disposed in the electronic apparatus , wherein the vibration element generates user perceivable vibration on the totality or part of apparatus, for example, the vibration is generated on the touch panel or the casing. A haptic command denotes or includes a command controlling the magnitude of haptic feedback. For the sake of description, haptic feedback is denoted by a corresponding envelope curve thereof.","Prior to the exemplification of applying dynamic range compression by the electronic apparatus , some situations of haptic feedback distortion that may occur to the electronic apparatus are exemplified first. For example, there may have more than two instances of haptic feedback (such as more than two instances of collision) concurrently occurring to the user interface  (such as the number key of an object B) disposed on the display  of the electronic apparatus  of . Meanwhile, the instances of haptic feedback corresponding to the two haptic commands will be combined. Distortion would occur when the haptic feedback corresponding to the combined instances of haptic feedback theoretically exceed the restriction on the analog or digital signal outputted by the circuit for implementing the haptic feedback function or the restriction on the haptic feedback that can be generated by the actuation unit . In practice, the above situations can be resolved by compulsory restriction or hard clipping method mechanism; that is, the value greater than the upper limit is substituted by the upper limit and\/or the value lower than the lower limit is substituted by the lower limit. However, such substitution probably results in perceivable non-linear distortion and generates annoying haptic feedback.","For example, the objects B and B of the user interface  respectively denote an explosion event and a shooting event. A program such as a game program executed by the electronic apparatus  generates two haptic commands in response to the two corresponding events of the two objects B and B for driving the actuation unit  to provide the user with haptic perception presented by the two objects B and B. As indicated in , suppose the envelope curves C and C are the waves (haptic feedback) corresponding to the two haptic commands and are both below the maximum value MAX. When adding the two envelope curves, since the time interval between time points tand tcorresponds to the shooting event (the envelope curve C) presented by the object B, in theory, the envelope curve C will exceed the maximum value MAX and reach the value K within this time interval. Due to the restriction on the circuit or digital processing, the haptic feedback between time points tand tcan only reach the maximum value MAX as indicated in . If the shooting event occurs between time point tand time , the above hard clipping method will make it even harder to differentiate between the corresponding effects of haptic feedback of the objects B and B after adding the two envelope curves C and C, and the user may be unable to perceive the corresponding haptic feedback of the latter event. If more shooting events or other events occur within or after the time interval between time points tto t, the haptic feedback corresponding to multiple haptic commands will be more obscure and harder to perceive. Thus, the user may consider the haptic feedback of the electronic apparatus  has poor effect and lacks vivid feeling of use.","Moreover, it is also possible that the corresponding haptic feedback of a haptic command may exceed the threshold value only within a certain time interval. For example, the envelope curve C of , which denotes the haptic feedback corresponding to a haptic command, is below the threshold value MAX and corresponds to a certain event, such as an event of a game program, wherein the event occurs 10 m away from the user. The distance of the event affects the magnitude of haptic feedback. Suppose the event occurs within 5 m to the user, the haptic feedback will be amplified. For example, the envelope curve C of  exceeds the threshold value MAX within a period of time. The above practice of compulsory restriction normally results in non-linear distortion and annoying haptic feedback.","The electronic apparatus  of the present embodiment has a mechanism of dynamic range compression mechanism which prevent the circuit for implementing the haptic feedback function from generating distortion due to the output restriction on the analog or digital signal of the circuit. Referring to , a system for providing haptic feedback according to an embodiment is shown. The haptic feedback system  realized by such as the aforementioned electronic apparatus  includes a control unit  and an actuation unit . The control unit  is such as a microprocessor. In , an application program  executed by the control unit  generates a haptic command HC, and the control unit  also executes command-to-control-value conversion and dynamic range compression (DRC) . In response to at least a haptic command HC (that is, a haptic command or a combination of a plurality of haptic commands), the command-to-control-value conversion and DRC processing  dynamically generates a control value CV. The control value CV is dynamically generated through dynamic range compression so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range. The control value CV denotes the amplitude value of the wave pattern of haptic feedback corresponding to the aforementioned at least a haptic command. For example, the amplitude value of the wave pattern W of  is a numeric series such as a discrete series. The control value CV can also denote one or multiple parameters related to the control of the magnitude of haptic feedback (such as the intensity and amplitude of haptic feedback) or other parameters related to the control of haptic feedback. The control value CV controls the magnitude of haptic feedback generated by the actuation unit . The command-to-control-value conversion and DRC processing  can be implemented by one or multiple program modules executed by the control unit  (such as a driving program or a system program module) or an application program interface used by an application program.","The haptic command HC can be generated by the application program , the hardware element or firmware of the electronic apparatus , or other software, wherein the software is such as an operating system, an application program or a driving program executed by the electronic apparatus , and examples of the software include game program, office program or any form of user interface. The haptic command HC corresponds to an object displayed on the user interface  of the electronic apparatus  of  or an interactive event. The haptic command may also correspond to at least a touch input received by the user interface  of the electronic apparatus . In response to the needs for the application program of system program, one or multiple haptic commands can be generated, so that the haptic feedback can be felt by the user or used for man-machine interaction. In addition, when the user grabs the electronic apparatus , the user interface  simulates and provides the hand H with a vivid feeling as if the hand were touching a real object and could feel the situations such as the object B descending or colliding with the object B.","The haptic command HC has several implementations. For example, the haptic command includes the information of amplitude indicating the magnitude of haptic feedback, frequency and duration. Or, the haptic command includes: an index denoting one of multiple haptic feedback patterns such as squared wave and sine wave, or the vibration pattern denoting flash, explosion or collision. For example, play effect  indicates the generation of a certain pattern of haptic feedback. In the present example, the command-to-control-value conversion and DRC processing  is executed, and, according to the haptic feedback pattern denoted by the haptic command, continuously outputs a control value corresponding to the pattern within a period of time to control the amplitude and frequency of the haptic. The haptic command includes other parameters such as the parameters related to the distance to the location of the event in the example of . The implementations of the haptic command are not limited to the above exemplifications. Regardless of what implementation is used, a haptic command or a combination of multiple haptic commands needs to be converted into or denoted as a control value controlling the actuation unit  to provide haptic feedback through command-to-control-value conversion and DRC processing .","A control value CV, which can be presented by a digital or analog control signal, is outputted to a digital or analog actuation unit . As indicated in , the control value CV is converted into a control signal SD by a conversion unit , and the control signal SD is then received by the actuation unit . The conversion unit  executes the control-value-to-control-signal conversion processing . In another example, if the actuation unit  can receive the control value CV, then the conversion unit  does not need to be used. In another example, when the actuation unit  receives a control signal of other forms, such as a voltage signal or a pulse width modulation signal, the conversion unit  can perform corresponding conversion according to the form of the control signal, and the implementation of the control value CV or the control signal is not limited to the above exemplifications.","In addition, an embodiment of a method for providing haptic feedback is provided. The method includes the following steps: (a) An actuation unit, such as the actuation unit  of the electronic apparatus of  , is provided to generate haptic feedback. (b) A control value is dynamically generated by such as the electronic apparatus of   in response to at least a haptic command to control the actuation unit to generate haptic feedback, wherein dynamic range compression is applied to dynamically generate the control value so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range.  shows a flowchart of a method for providing haptic feedback used in the electronic apparatus of  according to an embodiment of the invention. Referring to . In step S, a haptic command is received, wherein in the present example, multiple haptic commands can be received either concurrently or sequentially by such as the control unit . Step (b) of the method for providing haptic feedback is implemented in steps S-S. As indicated in step S, a control value is dynamically generated in response to at least a haptic command to control the actuation unit to generate haptic feedback. As indicated in step S, whether the initial corresponding value of the at least a haptic command is greater than a threshold value is dynamically checked with time. When the at least a haptic command denotes a haptic command, the initial corresponding value can be regarded as the amplitude value of the haptic command according to a certain haptic feedback pattern or the value of one or multiple parameters related to vibration. For example, the envelope curve C of  and the envelope curves C and C of  respectively correspond to the initial corresponding value of a haptic command within a certain period of time. When the at least a haptic command denotes multiple haptic commands, the initial corresponding value of at least a haptic command is the result of computation or a combination of the initial corresponding values of the haptic commands, wherein the computation or combination is a function operation such as weighted sum or linear combination of the initial corresponding values. As indicated in , the envelope curves C and C correspond to two initial corresponding values of haptic commands, and the envelope curve C corresponds to the initial corresponding values of two combined haptic commands such as the result of adding the two envelope curves C and C. In step S, if an initial corresponding value of at least a haptic command is substantially greater than a threshold value such as the threshold value MAX, then the method performs step S, dynamic range compression is applied to adjust the initial corresponding value so as to control magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range. If the determination in step S is negative, then the method returns to step S. Following step S, the method can return to the step S.","Dynamic range compression is applied in the step S. Dynamic range compression includes adjusting the initial corresponding value to generate a control value according to the at least a haptic command, the initial corresponding value and a gain, so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within vibration range. Moreover, in the course of adjusting the initial corresponding value to generate control value, the gain value may vary so as to implement various mechanisms of dynamic range compression such as attack mechanism, release mechanism, input-look-ahead mechanism or soft clipping method. In addition, the above mechanisms can have various combinations such as the combination of attack and release mechanism, and the combination of input-look-ahead and release mechanism. In addition, soft clipping method can be used in the above combinations.","Dynamic range compression of the step S is described with the examples of . Suppose the control value corresponding to the haptic command is proportional to the intensity of haptic feedback. The envelope curve denotes the dynamic variation in the control value of the haptic command with time. The situations of other implementations of haptic command can be obtained by analogy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 9"],"b":["330","40","340","1","41"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","1 ","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["330","340","42","1","2","42","40","42","40"],"sub":["1 ","2","2","3","2 ","3 ","2","2 ","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","sub":["1","1","2","1 ","A ","1 ","A ","1 ","A","A ","2","2","3"],"b":["43","44","44","44","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4D","b":"330"},"For example, the electronic apparatus  allows the haptic command to be delayed (for such as 100 ms). Thus, the initial corresponding value of the at least a haptic command is received and temporarily stored in the delay buffer, and the initial corresponding value is delayed and then outputted to the actuation unit. In step S, apart from the current initial corresponding value of the at least a haptic command, the delayed initial corresponding value of the delay buffer is also checked. Thus, the next processing situation as well as what type of dynamic range compression will be applied with respect to the delayed control value in step S can also be predicted. That is, when the current initial corresponding value (such as corresponding to time point t) exceeds the threshold value, dynamic range compression is performed on the current initial corresponding value and the delayed initial corresponding value (such as corresponding to time point tbeing prior to time point t) to generate a control value (such as the part of the envelope curve C between time points tto t) so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within the vibration range.","Referring to . In step S, the input-look-ahead feature can be used. When processing the initial corresponding value of the period before time point t, since it is predicted that the initial corresponding value of at least a haptic command at time point twill exceed the threshold value MAX, the initial corresponding value of at least a haptic command starts to be adjusted at time point tso as to generate the control value. For example, the initial corresponding value is multiplied by a diminishing value or a gain value G. If the gain value G starts to approach the value MAX\/K from the value 1 within the time interval between time points tto t, then the envelope curve C can be restricted to be below the threshold value MAX at time point t. According to the comparison between the envelope curves C and C at the time interval between time points tto t, when the envelope curve C exceeds the threshold value MAX around time point t, the control value corresponding to the envelope curve C already varies significantly, so the user can have a vivid feeling of haptic feedback.","After time point t, the envelope curve C is already less than the threshold value. Since the initial corresponding value of at least a haptic command is still multiplied by a coefficient less than 1, the haptic feedback signal will be too small. Meanwhile, release mechanism can be used to gradually increase the multiplied coefficient (that is, the gain). For example, the gain value G is increased to gradually approach 1 from the value MAX\/K. Release mechanism of the present example is similar to the method of , and the similarities are not repeated here.","With respect to two concurrent haptic commands, if the patterns denoting two default instances of haptic feedback are the haptic commands corresponding to the envelope curves C and C as indicated in , then the input-look-ahead effect can also be obtained by checking the two situations of the variation in the concurrent haptic commands. In practice, whether the haptic feedback pattern generated by the combination of two haptic commands between the windows within a time interval exceeds the threshold value MAX is checked according to the above example of using the delayed buffer, wherein the delay time is changed to a time interval, and the delayed buffer is changed to a buffer. Then, when generating a control value, the initial corresponding value of the envelope curve C is adjusted in the same manner as in the input-look-ahead method so as to achieve an effect similar to the time interval between time point tto tof . The above step (k) of dynamically checking with time whether the current initial corresponding value and the temporarily stored initial corresponding value are greater than the threshold value can also be regarded as the situation of checking the variation in the concurrent haptic commands. The magnitude of haptic feedback generated in this way can enhance the gap between the haptic feedback effect of the shooting event corresponding to the object B and the haptic feedback effect of the explosion event corresponding to the object B. Thus, the user can feel a structured, multi-layered effect of haptic feedback.","According to the above  and examples, the method for providing haptic feedback of the above embodiments effectively reduces distortion and enhances users' haptic experience.","Referring to , block diagrams of embodiments of an electronic apparatus with haptic feedback are shown. As indicated in , the electronic apparatus  with haptic feedback includes a control unit A, a dynamic range compression module , an amplifier  and an actuation unit . The control unit A, realized by such as a microprocessor of the electronic apparatus , receives a haptic command, wherein the generation and implementation of the haptic command can be realized in many different ways as disclosed above. The dynamic range compression module  is coupled to the control unit A and the actuation unit . In response to at least a haptic command, the dynamic range compression module  dynamically generate a control signal to control the actuation unit  to generate haptic feedback, wherein the dynamic range compression module  applies dynamic range compression to dynamically generate the control signal so as to control the magnitude of haptic feedback to be substantially within a vibration range. The dynamic range compression module , realized by such as a micro-controller, can be used to implement all or part of the functions of steps S to S of  in response to the received haptic command so as to dynamically generate a control value accordingly, wherein the control value can be presented in many different ways such as by a digital control signal or an analog control signal.

In another example, the control unit B outputs the control value by a digital communication interface such as IC, and the actuation unit  receives a voltage signal. A digital-to-analog conversion circuit, such as a pulse width modulation circuit can be disposed before the amplifier . Or, a micro-controller with pulse width modulation function is used to generate a pulse width modulation signal which is further converted into a suitable voltage signal by the amplifier . As indicated in , the implementation of the control value is not limited to the above exemplifications.","The embodiment of  shows the example of  combined with the circuit  of the electronic apparatus. The circuit  includes a microprocessor , a memory unit , a display unit  and an audio unit , wherein the microprocessor  implements the control unit B, and the coupling method between the units is based on actual needs and is not limited to the above exemplifications. Thus, the user can interact with the electronic apparatus through the user interface with audio, video and haptic feedback function. The actuation unit , which includes one to multiple actuation units, can be disposed in the electronic apparatus  for enabling the totality of the electronic apparatus  or the display, such as the display , of the display unit  to generate vibration. The display  realized by a touch panel provides the user interface  for touch input, and at the same time provides haptic feedback function. For example, the display  can simulate the press keys or multiple interface operation events and generate haptic feedback accordingly. The actuation unit can be realized by such as a motor, a piezoelectric element or other materials or devices capable of generating vibration, wherein the piezoelectric element provides prompt response time. In an embodiment, one or multiple actuation units are disposed at different positions of the electronic apparatus , and multiple amplifiers  are correspondingly used to generate vibration according to the haptic driving signal. Besides, the control unit can be implemented to generate corresponding haptic driving signals with respect to multiple actuation units to achieve different effects.","The dynamic range compression module , the dynamic range compression unit , the control unit B or other implementations can all be used for implementing the method for providing haptic feedback and the embodiment thereof as indicated in .

The method for attacking the gain and releasing the gain as indicated in the conversion processing of  can be added to step S or step S of the method of  so as to make the outputted value outside the target range to gradually approach the desired level. In , the curve  denotes the wave pattern of the original to-be-outputted haptic feedback, and after the dynamic range compression method of  is applied thereto, the result is the curve . At attack time and release time, the gain value is respectively decreased and increased gradually by different gain values, so as to improve the outputted haptic effect by adjusting attack and release time (such as between 1 to 100 ms) and attack gain and release gain (such as between \u221212 to 12 dB).","On the other hand, when applying dynamic range compression as indicated in , according to the principles of compressor, following the comparison between the control value of the inputted haptic command and the threshold value TH, the control value of the inputted haptic command can be adjusted by hard\/soft knee method so that the corresponding value of the input that exceeds the threshold value TH falls within the range between L and L.","In other embodiments, the implementation of the control unit and the implementation related to dynamic range compression such as the implementation of the compressor can be design according to many different methods.
