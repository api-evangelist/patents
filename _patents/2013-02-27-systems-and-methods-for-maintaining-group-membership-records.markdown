{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/407,748, filed 28 Feb. 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated, in its entirety.","In a group membership hierarchy maintained by an enterprise, user and group membership relationships may frequently change. Directory services, such as Active Directory, may enable administrators to identify direct relationship changes within a group membership hierarchy. However, such services may not enable administrators to identify indirect relationship changes within group membership hierarchies and\/or may not provide historical membership data. As a result, performing electronic discovery (and\/or any other type of audit) of information within a group membership hierarchy may be time and resource intensive, particularly within large organizations. For example, an electronic discovery application may take weeks to traverse an Active Directory with thousands of users. To complicate matters, traditional electronic discovery solutions for membership hierarchies may be unreliable due to run-time errors. What is needed, therefore, is a more efficient and effective mechanism for identifying, tracking, and\/or managing group information for membership hierarchies.","As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for maintaining group membership records. In one example, a computer-implemented method for maintaining group membership records may include 1) maintaining a record of group memberships for a membership hierarchy, the membership record identifying a direct relationship between a first object and a second object in the membership hierarchy, 2) receiving a membership update indicating that, as of a first point in time, a direct relationship between the second object and a third object changed, 3) updating the record of group memberships to reflect the change in the relationship between the second object and the third object, 4) deducing, based on the membership update and the record of group memberships, a change in an indirect relationship between the first object and the third object as of the first point in time, 5) using the record of group memberships, the updated change in the direct relationship between the second and third objects, and the deduced change in the indirect relationship between the first and third objects to provide a view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time, and 6) maintaining a historical record of group memberships as they existed before the first point in time.","In at least one embodiment, the method may further include creating the historical record such that the historical record indicates the second and third objects were directly related before the first point in time and the first and third objects were indirectly related before the first point in time. Additionally or alternatively, the membership hierarchy may include an Active Directory structure for an enterprise, the first object may include a user group, and receiving the membership update may include receiving an Update Sequence Number (USN) change list that indicates direct relationship changes within the Active Directory structure. In such embodiments, receiving the membership update may include querying an Active Directory service membership enumeration Application Programming Interface (API) for changes to direct relationships within the Active Directory structure, and the membership update may indicate only changes to direct relationships within the Active Directory structure.","According to various embodiments, the third object comprises a user profile. In some embodiments, the method may further include creating the historical record such that the historical record indicates the second and third objects were directly related before the first point in time and the first and third objects were indirectly related before the first point in time. In such embodiments, the method may further include receiving an electronic discovery request to provide current and historical group membership information for objects within the Active Directory structure. The method may also include, in response to the electronic discovery request, performing the providing of the view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time by providing the record of group memberships instead of recursively traversing the Active Directory structure to identify group membership information and by providing the historical record.","According to certain embodiments, providing the view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time may include updating the record of group memberships to reflect the change in the indirect relationship between the first and third objects.","In various embodiments, the method may include receiving a request to provide membership information for the membership hierarchy. The method may also include, in response to the request to provide membership information for the membership hierarchy, performing the deducing of the change in the indirect relationship between the first and third objects and performing the providing of the view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time.","According to some embodiments, maintaining the record of group memberships for the membership hierarchy may include performing a full synchronization of the membership hierarchy at a point in time prior to the first point in time by identifying and recording direct relationships for all objects within the membership hierarchy. In such embodiments, updating the record of group memberships to reflect the change in the relationship between the second object and the third object may include an incremental synchronization of the membership hierarchy that updates the record of group memberships to reflect all changes to the membership hierarchy identified at the first point in time.","In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include a group membership module programmed to maintain a record of group memberships for a membership hierarchy, the membership record identifying a direct relationship between a first object and a second object in the membership hierarchy. The system may also include an update module programmed to receive a membership update indicating that, as of a first point in time, a direct relationship between the second object and a third object changed and update the record of group memberships to reflect the change in the relationship between the second object and the third object. The system may further include a deduction module programmed to deduce, based on the membership update and the record of group memberships, a change in an indirect relationship between the first object and the third object as of the first point in time. The system may include at least one processor programmed to execute the group membership module, the update module, and the deduction module.","In some embodiments, the group membership module may be further programmed to use the record of group memberships, the updated change in the direct relationship between the second and third objects, and the deduced change in the indirect relationship between the first and third objects to provide a view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time. The group membership module may also be programmed to maintain a historical record of group memberships as they existed before the first point in time.","In some examples, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a non-transitory computer-readable-storage medium. For example, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to 1) maintain a record of group memberships for a membership hierarchy, the membership record identifying a direct relationship between a first object and a second object in the membership hierarchy, 2) receive a membership update indicating that, as of a first point in time, a direct relationship between the second object and a third object changed, 3) update the record of group memberships to reflect the change in the relationship between the second object and the third object, 4) deduce, based on the membership update and the record of group memberships, a change in an indirect relationship between the first object and the third object as of the first point in time, 5) use the record of group memberships, the updated change in the direct relationship between the second and third objects, and the deduced change in the indirect relationship between the first and third objects to provide a view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time, and 6) maintain a historical record of group memberships as they existed before the first point in time.","Features from any of the above-mentioned embodiments may be used in combination with one another in accordance with the general principles described herein. These and other embodiments, features, and advantages will be more fully understood upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","Throughout the drawings, identical reference characters and descriptions indicate similar, but not necessarily identical, elements.

However, the exemplary embodiments described herein are not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the instant disclosure covers all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the appended claims.","Embodiments of the instant disclosure may maintain direct, indirect, and\/or historical group membership records in a manner which reduces the time and\/or resources required to identify and track group membership information. For example, embodiments of the instant disclosure may retrieve one or more direct relationship changes in a membership hierarchy and may use the direct relationship changes to deduce indirect membership changes and to create historical records. Some embodiments may use direct relationship changes to determine indirect relationship changes in a single pass instead of propagating and incrementally calculating changes.","Embodiments of the instant disclosure may improve the effectiveness and speed of acquiring information about membership hierarchies. For example, systems and methods disclosed herein may provide current and historical group membership records in response to an electronic discovery request in a much more efficient and effective manner than prior solutions. For example, algorithms disclosed herein may robust and reliable and may not add inconsistent membership records even when rerun. Embodiments of the instant disclosure may also provide various other features and advantages.","The following will provide, with reference to , detailed descriptions of exemplary systems for maintaining group membership records.

For example, group membership module  in  (which may, as detailed above, represent a portion of computing device  in ) maintains a record of group memberships  for membership hierarchy . As discussed in greater detail below, group membership module  may maintain one or more of a variety of types of membership records.","Group membership module  may maintain a record of group memberships for a membership hierarchy in a variety of manners. For example, group membership module  may maintain a record of group memberships for membership hierarchy  by initially performing a full synchronization of membership hierarchy  and subsequently performing incremental synchronizations of membership hierarchy , as discussed in greater detail below. Group membership module  may perform a full synchronization of membership hierarchy  by identifying each object within membership hierarchy  and identifying each relationship between objects within membership hierarchy .","Group membership module  may identify various types of relationships between objects in a hierarchy. For example, group membership module  may identify direct relationships between two objects in a membership hierarchy. As used herein, the phrase \u201cdirect relationship\u201d generally refers to any relationship between two objects in which the objects are directly associated with each other without any other intervening objects being part of the association. For example, a direct relationship between a first object and a second object may be a relationship in which the second object is a child of the first object. In some embodiments, a direct relationship between a first object and a second object may be a one-to-one relationship between the objects. Alternatively, a direct relationship between two objects may be part of a one-to-many relationship.","Group membership module  may also identify indirect relationships between objects in a membership hierarchy. As used herein, the phrase \u201cindirect relationship\u201d generally refers to any relationship between a first object and a second object in which the first object is associated with a second object through a third object. In other words, a first object may be indirectly related to a second object by virtue of both the first and second objects being directly related to a third object.","Indirect relationships disclosed herein may be any suitable degree of distance apart. For example, if two objects are indirectly related via a single intervening object, the indirect relationship may be referred to as second degree relationship or a second degree indirect relationship. As another example, an object related to another object via connections through two other objects may be referred to as a third degree indirect relationship. A direct relationship between two objects may be referred to as a first degree relationship.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cmembership hierarchy\u201d generally refers to any hierarchy of groups and\/or other objects. For example, a membership hierarchy may include a directory structure, such as an Active Directory structure provided by WINDOWS domain networks. Alternatively, a membership hierarchy may include a file system structure, such as a set of interrelated directories and objects within the directories.","Objects within a membership hierarchy may be any suitable type or form of object. For example, objects within an Active Directory structure may include user groups and\/or user accounts. In a file system hierarchy, objects may include folders and\/or files.","Using  as examples, group membership module  may maintain a record of group memberships for hierarchy .  shows hierarchy  () before a change in a relationship within hierarchy  and hierarchy  () shows hierarchy  after a change. As shown in , hierarchy  may include a group , a group , and a group . Group  and group  may be children of group .  also show user  as a child of group  and user  as a child of group  in . Group membership module  may maintain one or more of a variety of types of lists, tables, and\/or other records that show group memberships for hierarchy . For example, group membership module  may identify group to group memberships in hierarchy  and may create a group-to-group membership record as show in table 1 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Group-to-Group Membership Record"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Group","Child Group"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Group 402","Group 406"]},{"entry":[{},"Group 402","Group 404"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Group membership module  may also identify direct group-to-user relationships within hierarchy  () and create a group-to-user membership record as shown in table 2 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Group-to-User Membership Record"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Group","User","Direct"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Group 406","User 412","True"]},{"entry":[{},"Group 404","User 410","True"]},{"entry":[{},"Group 404","User 412","True"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The information shown in tables 1 and 2 (e.g., the group-to-group and group-to-user records) may be used by group membership module  to prepare direct and indirect user-to-group membership information and to maintain a history of changes in membership in an optimized way, as discussed in greater detail below.

For example, in an Active Directory hierarchy, for each affected parent group (e.g., each parent group listed in a parent-group-child relationship record), an add list may include a list of direct users of all children of the parent group (including itself) less existing direct and indirect users for the parent group. A remove list may include, for each affected parent group (e.g., each parent group listed in a parent-group-child relationship record), a list of direct and indirect users of the parent group less direct users of all children of the parent group. As shown in the tables below, records from the remove list may be inserted into a historical record. Then, as reflected in the tables 14 and 16 above, records identified in the remove list may be deleted from an existing group-to-user membership table. Similarly, records from the add list may be added to existing group-to-user membership tables. While the examples shown above reflect relationships being removed from a membership hierarchy, the process described above also applies to adding relationships to a membership hierarchy (e.g., when new relationships, groups, and\/or users are added to an Active Directory).","According to various embodiments, direct and\/or indirect relationships for a membership hierarchy may be updated within membership records in a single shot. For example, deduction module  may update membership records for all updated relationships at the same time (i.e., without performing a recursive or iterative process to identify changes throughout a membership hierarchy). As another example, a change in a first degree relationship may affects one or more other second degree relationships, third degree relationships, nth degree relationships, etc. Deduction module  may propagate the change in the first degree relationship to one or more of the second degree relationships, third degree relationships, and\/or nth degree relationships in a single pass by updating membership records for the second, third, and\/or nth degree relationships. In other words, deduction module  may simultaneously update all indirect relationship changes (including second, third, and nth degree indirect changes in a chain of object relationships) caused by a direct relationship change without iterating through the membership hierarchy to identify the affected indirect relationships. Thus, if a change to a first degree relationship affects a second degree relationship, and a change in the second degree relationship affects a third degree relationship, the change to the third degree relationship may be deduced without first deducing the change in the second degree relationship (e.g., the changes in the second and third degree relationships may be deduced in a single pass).","At step  in , one or more of the systems described herein may use the record of group memberships, the updated change in the direct relationship between the second and third objects, and the deduced change in the relationship between the first and third objects to provide a view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time. Systems and methods described herein may also maintain a historical record of group memberships as the existed before the first point in time. For example, group membership module  may use record of group memberships , the updated change in the direct relationship between the second and third objects, and the deduced change in the relationship between the first and third objects to provide a view of object relationships within the membership hierarchy as they exist at the first point in time. Group membership module  may also maintain a historical record of group memberships.","Group membership module  may provide the view of object relationships within a membership hierarchy in a variety of manners.
