{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This patent application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/330,364 entitled \u201cSystems for Monitoring Computer Resources\u201d concurrently filed herewith and also assigned to Go Daddy Operating Company, LLC.","The present invention relates in general to monitoring computer resources.","A network is a collection of links and nodes (e.g., multiple computers and\/or other devices connected together) arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. Examples of networks include the Internet, the public switched telephone network, the global Telex network, computer networks (e.g., an intranet, an extranet, a local-area network, or a wide-area network), wired networks, and wireless networks.","The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks arranged to allow the easy and robust exchange of information between computer users. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to computers connected to the Internet via Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Content providers place multimedia information (e.g., text, graphics, audio, video, animation, and other forms of data) at specific locations on the Internet referred to as webpages. Websites comprise a collection of connected, or otherwise related, webpages. The combination of all the websites and their corresponding webpages on the Internet is generally known as the World Wide Web (WWW) or simply the Web.","For Internet users and businesses alike, the Internet continues to be more and more valuable. People are increasingly using the Web for everyday tasks such as social networking, shopping, banking, paying bills, and consuming media and entertainment. E-commerce is growing, with businesses delivering more services and content across the Internet, communicating and collaborating online, and inventing new ways to connect with each other.","Some Internet users, typically those that are larger and more sophisticated, may provide their own hardware, software, and connections to the Internet. But many Internet users either do not have the resources available or do not want to create and maintain the infrastructure necessary to host their own websites. To assist such individuals (or entities), hosting companies exist that offer website hosting services. These hosting providers typically provide the hardware, software, and electronic communication means necessary to connect multiple websites to the Internet. A single hosting provider may literally host thousands of websites on one or more hosting servers.","Websites may be created using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to generate a standard set of tags that define how the webpages for the website are to be displayed. Users of the Internet may access content providers' websites using software known as an Internet browser, such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, MOZILLA FIREFOX, or GOOGLE CHROME. After the browser has located the desired webpage, it requests and receives information from the webpage, typically in the form of an HTML document, and then displays the webpage content for the user. The user then may view other webpages at the same website or move to an entirely different website using the browser.","Browsers are able to locate specific websites because each computer on the Internet has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. Presently, there are two standards for IP addresses. The older IP address standard, often called IP Version 4 (IPv4), is a 32-bit binary number, which is typically shown in dotted decimal notation, where four 8-bit bytes are separated by a dot from each other (e.g., 64.202.167.32). The notation is used to improve human readability. The newer IP address standard, often called IP Version 6 (IPv6) or Next Generation Internet Protocol (IPng), is a 128-bit binary number. The standard human readable notation for IPv6 addresses presents the address as eight 16-bit hexadecimal words, each separated by a colon (e.g., 2EDC:BA98:0332:0000:CF8A:000C:2154:7313).","IP addresses, however, even in human readable notation, are difficult for people to remember and use. A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is much easier to remember and may be used to point to any computer, directory, or file on the Internet. A browser is able to access a website on the Internet through the use of a URL. The URL may include a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request combined with the website's Internet address, also known as the website's domain name. An example of a URL with a HTTP request and domain name is: http:\/\/www.companyname.com. In this example, the \u201chttp\u201d identifies the URL as a HTTP request and the \u201ccompanyname.com\u201d is the domain name.","Domain names are much easier to remember and use than their corresponding IP addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) approves some Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD) and delegates the responsibility to a particular organization (a \u201cregistry\u201d) for maintaining an authoritative source for the registered domain names within a TLD and their corresponding IP addresses. For certain TLDs (e.g., .biz, .info, .name, and .org) the registry is also the authoritative source for contact information related to the domain name and is referred to as a \u201cthick\u201d registry. For other TLDs (e.g., .com and .net) only the domain name, registrar identification, and name server information is stored within the registry, and a registrar is the authoritative source for the contact information related to the domain name. Such registries are referred to as \u201cthin\u201d registries. Most gTLDs are organized through a central domain name Shared Registration System (SRS) based on their TLD.","The process for registering a domain name with .com, .net, .org, and some other TLDs allows an Internet user to use an ICANN-accredited registrar to register their domain name. For example, if an Internet user, John Doe, wishes to register the domain name \u201cmycompany.com,\u201d John Doe may initially determine whether the desired domain name is available by contacting a domain name registrar. The Internet user may make this contact using the registrar's webpage and typing the desired domain name into a field on the registrar's webpage created for this purpose. Upon receiving the request from the Internet user, the registrar may ascertain whether \u201cmycompany.com\u201d has already been registered by checking the SRS database associated with the TLD of the domain name. The results of the search then may be displayed on the webpage to thereby notify the Internet user of the availability of the domain name. If the domain name is available, the Internet user may proceed with the registration process. Otherwise, the Internet user may keep selecting alternative domain names until an available domain name is found. Domain names are typically registered for a period of one to ten years with first rights to continually re-register the domain name.","An individual or entity's domain name is increasingly the anchor around which their online presence is maintained. For example, a company's website (www.companyname.com) and email system (john.doe@companyname.com) utilize the company's domain name as an integral part of their architecture. Similarly, many Internet users use their email address, and therefore their domain name, as a means of identification on social websites, which have proliferated in recent years. Social websites are social networking services that focus on building and verifying online social networks for communities of people who share interests and activities, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others, and which necessitates the use of software. Most social websites are Internet based and provide a collection of various ways for users to interact, such as chat, messaging, email, video, voice chat, personal information sharing, image sharing, video sharing, file sharing, status updates, blogging, discussion groups, commentary, etc. The main types of social networking services are those which contain directories of some categories (such as former classmates), means to connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and\/or recommendation systems linked to trust. Popular methods now combine many of these, with FACEBOOK, TWITTER, YOUTUBE, LINKEDIN, MYSPACE, BEBO, PHOTOBUCKET, SNAPFISH, WINDOWS LIVE PHOTOS, WEBSHOTS, and FLICKR being but a few examples.","Such social websites often post their members' public webpages for all Internet users to view, without authentication or login. Conversely, members' private webpages may only be accessed and viewed by the member. The private webpages generally require member authentication and provide the member with tools to manage his public webpage, communicate with other members, and\/or otherwise manage his social website membership.","Many social websites, typically those that receive or share sensitive information (as well as websites associated with banks, credit card companies, and online businesses), may require Internet users to login to the website with a secure username and password before accessing the website's content.","The username\/password system is a common form of secret authentication data used to control website access. The username\/password is kept secret from those not allowed access. Those wishing to gain access are tested on whether or not they have a valid (recognized) username and whether they know the associated password. Internet users are granted or denied access to websites accordingly.","Many social websites have different rules governing the creation of usernames and passwords. Some require passwords that include a complex combination of letters, numbers, and other characters. Others have no restrictions whatsoever. With the proliferation of login-access websites, Internet users often must remember dozens (or more) different username\/password combinations, one for each secure website they wish to access. This has resulted in what has come to be known as \u201cpassword fatigue.\u201d","Partly in response to these issues, the concept of the \u201cdigital identity\u201d has evolved. A digital identity is a set of characteristics by which a person or thing is recognizable or distinguished in the digital realm. Digital identity allows for the electronic recognition of an individual or thing without confusing it for someone or something else.","There are many applications for an Internet user's digital identity, including authenticating the user before permitting access to a website. One method for such authentication includes the use of a URL. URL-based digital identity systems (such as OPENID) utilize a framework based on the concept that any individual or entity can identify themselves on the Internet with a URL provided by a Digital Identity Provider (e.g., johndoe.openid.com). The Digital Identity Provider maintains an Identity Server on which a Digital Identity Database (a database of provided digital identity URLs and the corresponding authentication passwords) is stored.","Once obtained, the Internet user may utilize their digital identity URL to access various websites. For example, to login to an OpenID-enabled website, the user enters their OpenID (e.g., johndoe.openid.com) in the username box. The user is then momentarily redirected to the user's Digital Identity Provider's website (or an authentication window appears) to login using whatever password they have set up with their Digital Identity Provider. Once authenticated, the Digital Identity Provider sends the participating website an encrypted message (a token) confirming the identity of the person logging in. There are currently numerous Digital Identity Providers offering URL-based (OpenID) digital identity services, meaning they offer digital identity URLs and servers to authenticate them.","One of the problems facing companies doing business online is verifying that digital identity actually belongs to a real human being (person) and that this particular real human being is not impersonating somebody else. Most validation systems today do it by sending an email message to person's email address. The email message typically contains a unique link or code that person should provide back to the verifier (often via a verifier's website). These systems are not able to validate the real identity of a person because the systems only check whether the requester has control over the email account.","As previously discussed the hosting companies allow a variety of entities and individuals to host websites, email, and other Internet services on hosting computers and networks. Clients expect the hosting computers and networks to work fast and without interruptions. Larger companies may have their own \u201cin-house\u201d hosting computers and networks to host their websites. Again, fast and smooth operation of the hosting computers and networks is expected. Thus, monitoring of resources on computer servers and computer networks is desired.","Applicant hereby proposes novel systems and methods for monitoring computer resources.","The present invention will now be discussed in detail with regard to the attached drawing figures which were briefly described above. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth illustrating the Applicant's best mode for practicing the invention and enabling one of ordinary skill in the art of making and using the invention. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without many of these specific details. In other instances, well-known machines and method steps have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Unless otherwise indicated, like parts and method steps are referred to with like reference numerals.","Generally, it is desirable to achieve and maintain good computer (resources) performance in a hosting environment. Good computer performance may be characterized by short response time for a given task, high throughput (rate of processing a task), low utilization of computing resource(s), high availability of the computing system or application, fast (or highly compact) data compression and decompression, high bandwidth (or short data transmission time) and others.","Adaptive monitoring is a new approach to resource monitoring that employs advanced data collection and machine learning techniques to overcome some of the limitations inherent to traditional monitoring techniques.","Traditional monitors usually work by linking a target resource to some sort of predetermined pass\/fail test condition, e.g., CPU utilization <X % or total messages in queue <Y, and if the resource has been found to be exceeding those limits, an alert is generated.","Defining monitors in this manner can become challenging when dealing with many target resources in a large complex architecture. For example, message oriented architectures such as 4GH\u00ae provisioning system can utilize hundreds (or even thousands) of individual queues in need of monitoring. 4GH\u00ae is Go Daddy\u00ae Fourth-Generation Hosting. It is a flexible hosting platform that matches performance with demand. If customer site's traffic spikes, 4GH\u00ae responds by allocating more resources and keeping the site live. If customer site starts small, but is growing, 4GH\u00ae grows with it so customer doesn't have to manually upgrade and experience any unnecessary downtime.","4GH\u00ae \u201cpools\u201d the resources of many servers and customer site's content resides on multiple servers. This networked system helps achieve a high reliability, beyond 99.9%, for customer website because if one server shuts down, only a fraction of the total resources are lost. 4GH\u00ae has resources in reserve which are always available to allocate when necessary.","Identifying resources and metrics on a large complex architecture individually, and defining failure conditions for each resource and metric, can prove to be a daunting task, especially if the queue's behavioral patterns shift as the parent architecture evolves.","The adaptive monitor collects key metrics for a given resource, analyzes the collected data to determine typical usage patterns (independent of human interaction), and alerts when the resource has been found to be operating outside of these \u201clearned\u201d boundaries.","The systems and methods of the present invention envision developing a framework that supports the storage, retrieval, and analysis of various resource metrics. The collected data for all resources may be centrally located and managed by the framework, which may serve as a data access layer. Data archival tools may also be developed as the framework may need to be capable of supporting large volumes of data.","The framework may provide a whole host of tools designed to simplify data analysis. By peering into the data from multiple viewpoints the framework may be able to characterize the aggregate data and tell the users important information about the health and performance of the resources.","Various tools may be exposed to users via an API (application programming interface). A feature extraction may be one of the analysis tools exposed by the framework. Features may be identified by dissecting a dataset to find new data rows that can be used in combination to reconstruct the original dataset. These new data rows are individually weighted and directly correlate to the rows of the original dataset.","The features identified by the framework may point out anomalies in the data. For example, if a particular queue\u2014which normally holds less than ten messages\u2014is found to contain more than a hundred, the framework may identify a feature that directly correlates to that queue and polling interval. If the feature is found to be weighted heavily to only the most recent polling cycle then the message backlog must be atypical and an alert might be generated. On the other hand, if the same feature is found to be weighted evenly across multiple polling cycles, at regular intervals, then no alert is necessary as the feature simply represents a recurring spike in traffic.","Various metrics (e.g., Apache ActiveMQ\u2122 message queue) may be added for monitoring to the existing Monitor Service endpoints. The Monitor Services maybe implemented on Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE platform), Microsoft .Net environment, and may others.","An exemplary embodiment of a best mode method of present invention is shown in . The method comprises the steps of: collecting one or more resource-metric records from one or more resources on a computer network, wherein said one or more resource-metric records at least contain a resource-metric identifier, a metric's value, and a date-time value when said metric's value was obtained (Step ), saving said one or more resource-metric records to one or more electronic storage devices (Step ), retrieving a first set of records from said one or more resource-metric records for a first predetermined time interval from said one or more electronic storage devices (Step ), forming a first mathematical matrix containing one or more metric's values arranged on date-time and resource-metric axes (Step ), creating a second mathematical matrix containing one or more features and a third mathematical matrix containing one or more weights by applying a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to said first mathematical matrix, wherein multiplication of said second mathematical matrix and said third mathematical matrix produces said first mathematical matrix (Step ), building a feature relationship tree, wherein each feature in said one or more features is assigned a list of date-time values and date-time weights from said third mathematical matrix, and said feature is assigned a list of resource-metric identifiers and resource-metric weights from said second mathematical matrix (Step ), sorting said list of date-time values and date-time weights for said each feature by date-time weight in descending order in said feature relationship tree (Step ), sorting said list of resource-metric identifiers and resource-metric weights for said each feature by resource-metric weight in descending order in said feature relationship tree (Step ), sorting said features by highest date-time weight of said each feature in descending order in said feature relationship tree (Step ), pruning nodes in said list of date-time values and date-time weights by leaving top N1 nodes by date-time weights in said each feature and deleting nodes with sequential positions more than N1, wherein N1 is a first predetermined value (Step ), pruning nodes in said list of resource-metric identifiers and resource-metric weights by leaving top N2 nodes by resource-metric weights in said each feature and deleting nodes with sequential positions more than N2, wherein N2 is a second predetermined value (Step ), deleting features from said feature relationship tree if said features do not contain a node corresponding to a most recent date-time value in said first set of records retrieved from said one or more electronic storage devices (Step ), generating a predicted value for each resource-metric identifier and said most recent date-time value in said feature relationship tree via a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (Step ), determining a variance between said predicted value and said metric's value for said each resource-metric identifier as a normalized value between 0 and 1 using a Gaussian function for said each resource-metric identifier (Step ), and if said variance exceeds a predetermined alert threshold, then triggering an alert (Step ).","The resource-metric records may be collected from a variety of resources on the computer network. A sample set of resource-metric records is shown in Table 1. Optionally, Resources and Metrics may be separated into their own fields (columns) in the dataset. Resources, Metrics, and Resource-Metric may be represented by a name, a code, a numeric identifier, or any other identifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example of resource-metric records"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Resource-Metric","Date-Time Value","Metric Value"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Resource-Metric A","12\/6\/11 17:30:00","0"]},{"entry":["Resource-Metric B","12\/6\/11 17:30:00","50\u2002"]},{"entry":["Resource-Metric A","12\/6\/11 17:00:00","1"]},{"entry":["Resource-Metric B","12\/6\/11 17:00:00","8"]},{"entry":[". . .",". . .",". . ."]},{"entry":["Resource-Metric A","12\/6\/11 12:00:00","0"]},{"entry":["Resource-Metric B","12\/6\/11 12:00:00","9"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A resource may include a computer, a server, a storage device, a hard drive, a printer, a network node, a router, etc.","A metric may include speed, utilization, message queue length, availability, response time, channel capacity, latency, completion time, service time, bandwidth, throughput, relative efficiency, scalability, performance per watt, compression ratio, instruction path length, speedup (how much a parallel algorithm is faster than a corresponding sequential algorithm), instructions per second, FLOPS (number of floating-point operations per second), Giga-updates per second (a measure of how frequently the RAM can be updated), various CPU benchmarks, and many others.","The resource-metric records may be saved to and retrieved from a variety of electronic storage devices.
