Also, the present invention relates to the use thereof, that is, the use as e.g., a solid electrolytic capacitor using the conductive polymer as solid electrolyte and a conductive film made of the conductive polymer.","Because of high conductivity, a conductive polymer is used as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor such as tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor, niobium solid electrolytic capacitor and aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor.","In such applications, the example of a conductive polymer can be obtained by synthesis by means of oxidation polymerization of polymerizable monomers such as thiophene or its derivative.","Serving as a dopant in the oxidation polymerization of the polymerizable monomers such as thiophene or its derivative, and in particular in performing chemical oxidation polymerization of such monomers, an organic sulfonic acid is mainly used. In particular, it is said that an aromatic sulfonic acid is suitable. An oxidant is a transition metal as used. In particular, it is said that ferric compound is suitable. Usually, a ferric salt of an aromatic sulfonic acid is used as an oxidant and dopant agent in performing chemical oxidation polymerization of polymerizable monomers such as thiophene or its derivative.","Also, among the ferric salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, there are following reports: Particularly useful its ferric toluenesulfonate or ferric methoxybenzene sulfonate. In order to synthesize a conductive polymer using them, they are sued as a dopant and oxidant agent, and mixed with a polymerizable monomer such as thiophene or its derivatives. As a result, this technology is suitable to expand it as industrialization (Patent References Nos. 1-2).","However, when a conductive polymer is obtained by using ferric toluenesulfonic serving as an oxidant and dopant agent, it does not attain the characteristics that can fully satisfy the requirements of the initial resistance value and the heat resistance. Also, when a conductive polymer is obtained by using ferric methoxybenzene sulfonate as an oxidant dopant agent, it can attain satisfactory properties of lowered initial resistance value and improved heat resistance more than the conductive polymer obtained by using ferric toluenesulfonate; however, such characteristics cannot still reach complete satisfaction.","Also, when thereby obtained conductive polymer is used as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor, the following issues may have to be considered. That is, a conductive polymer obtained by means of a chemical oxidation polymerization method is usually not soluble in a solvent. Therefore, it is necessary to form a layer of the conductive polymer directly provided on an element; here, the element includes: a positive electrode of a porous body made of a valve metal such as tantalum, niobium and aluminum; and a dielectric layer made of an oxide film of such valve metal.","However, the direct formation of the conductive polymer on the element requires working under very complicated conditions. Therefore, its reproducibility was poor, and process control was very hard.","Under the situations above, a soluble conductive polymer has been positively researched (See Patent Reference No. 3). Patent reference No. 3 reports that a conductive polymer dispersion liquid can be obtained from mixture polystyrene sulfonate, ammonium persulfate, an iron salt, and ethylenedioxy thiophene, and then, cause a reaction. However, the conductive polymer as produced is considered to require further improvements in its conductivity in order to use it as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor.","Also, there is a report of a conductive polymer in which polyaniline is doped with phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin (See patent Reference Nos. 4-5). However, thereby obtained conductive polymer is also not enough in the conductivity, and therefore, further improvements are necessary to use it as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor.","Also, there is a report of a conductive polymer in which polyaniline is doped with solvent-soluble polyester sulfonic acid (See Patent Reference No. 6). However, the conductive polymer as obtained is still not enough in the conductivity, and therefore, further improvements are necessary to use it as solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor.","Furthermore, there is a report a polyethylenedioxy thiophene. Here, using polystyrene sulfonate or sulfonated polyester or phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin as a dopant, thiophene or its derivative can be polymerized by electrolytic oxidation in water or in an aqueous solution of a mixture of water and water-miscible solvent (See Patent Reference No. 7). There is also another report of polyethylenedioxy thiophene. Here, using a combination of polystyrene sulfonate with at least one kind of sulfonated polyester and phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin to serve as a dopant, thiophene or its derivative can be polymerized by oxidation polymerization in water or in an aqueous solution (See Patent Reference No. 8).","These polyethylenedioxy thiophenes are reported to have high conductivity and superior heat resistance, and therefore, solid electrolytic capacitors using them as solid electrolyte become lower ESR (equivalent series resistance) with reliability in a hot condition. However, as improving electronic equipment, it has been further demanded to develop a solid electrolytic capacitor in which the ESR is further lowered, the heat resistance is further improved to make it more reliable in a hot condition while it is less likely to cause leak current.","Patent Reference No. 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2003-160,647","Patent Reference No. 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-265,927","Patent Reference No. 3: Japanese Patent No. 2,636,968","Patent Reference No. 4: Japanese Patent No. 3,906,071","Patent Reference No. 5: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2007-277,569","Patent Reference No. 6: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. H08-41,321","Patent Reference No. 7: International Patent Publication No. 2009\/131,011","Patent Reference No. 8: International Patent Publication No. 2009\/131,012","The present invention has been accomplished in view of the circumstances as explained above. Therefore, its purpose is to provide a conductive polymer which is high in the conductivity and superior in the heat resistance, and thus, is suitable to be used as solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor. Using the conductive polymer as solid electrolyte, the purpose is also to provide a solid electrolytic capacitor in which its ESR is low (small) and its reliability in a hot condition is high, as well as leak current is less likely to occur.","In order to solve the problems as described above, the inventors of the present application have accomplished the present invention.

Using it as the solid electrolyte of the solid electrolytic capacitor, there can be provided a solid electrolytic capacitor having low ESR with high reliability at a hot condition, while it is likely to cause leak current. In addition, the conductive polymer above has high conductivity and excellent heat resistance as well as high transparency, and therefore, there can be provided a conductivity film having high conductivity, excellent heat resistance and high transparency.","The conductive polymer of the second aspect of the invention has the features of the conductive polymer of the first aspect of the invention. In addition, its conductivity can be further improved. Therefore, when it is used as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor, further improvement in lowering the ESR of the solid electrolytic capacitor can be accomplished. Also, a conductive film can be provided, having further improvement in the conductivity.","Also, the conductive polymer of the third aspect of the invention has the features of the first aspect of the invention. In addition, further improvement in the adhesion properties can be accomplished, compared with the conductive polymer of the first aspect of the invention. Therefore, using it as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor, further improvement in lowering the ESR of the solid electrolytic capacitor can be accomplished.","Also, the conductive polymer of the fourth aspect of the invention is provided with the features of the second aspect of the invention. In addition, further improvement in the adhesion properties can be accomplished compared with the conductive polymer of the second aspect of the invention. Therefore, using it as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor, further improvement in lowering the ESR of the solid electrolytic capacitor can be accomplished.","Also, the fifth aspect of the invention can attain the same effects as the third aspect of the invention. The sixth aspect of the invention can attain the same effects as the fourth aspect of the invention.","The first aspect of the invention includes the basic concept of the present invention, as described below. In synthesis of the conductive polymer, the following dopant is used. That is, it is a copolymer from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate. Therefore, a conductive polymer can be provided with a high conductivity and an excellent heat resistance, and thus, is suitable to be used as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor. Also, a conductive polymer can be provided which is suitable in producing a conductive film having a high conductivity and an excellent heat resistance. The reason why styrenesulfonic acid is used as an ingredient of the monomers in synthesizing the copolymer serving as dopant is because its sulfonic acid moiety can provide an anion. This anion is necessary to serve as a dopant, as well as to provide water-solubility of the copolymer.","Also, the counter monomer to copolymerize with the styrenesulfonic acid is at least one kind selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate. Here, styrenesulfonic acid is literally a sulfonic acid system monomer. By contrast, the counter monomer above is a non-sulfonic acid system monomer. The reason why the sulfonic acid system monomer is copolymerized with the non-sulfonic acid monomer is because thereby obtained copolymer is superior to the homopolymer of styrenesulfonic acid (i.e., polystyrene sulfonic acid) when used as a dopant. That is, a conductive polymer can be provided which is superior in the adhesion properties with various substrates, having a high conductivity and an excellent heat resistance. Therefore, a solid electrolytic capacitor which has a low ESR and high reliable in a hot condition can be obtained. Also, a conductive film having a high conductivity and an excellent heat resistance can be obtained. The styrenesulfonic acid is used not in a monomer state, but in a polymerized state. This is because when a conductive polymer is polymerized by using a polymer dopant, it becomes good dispersibility or solubility to water or a solvent, and also, is provided with a property to restrict the de-dedoping.","The following features are found in the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate. A mass ratio of 1:0.01 to 0.1:1 is preferable for the styrenesulfonic acid to said at least one kind of the non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate. In other words, as the ratio of the styrenesulfonic acid becomes less than the above range, the conductivity of the conductive polymer can be decreased, thereby increasing the ESR of the condenser. On the contrary, when the ratio of the styrenesulfonic acid becomes more than the above range, the heat resistance and the adhesion properties of the conductive polymer are decreased and the ESR of the condenser can be increased, and thereby deteriorating the heat resistance.","Also, the following feature is found in the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate. That is, it is preferable that the copolymer has a weight average molecular weight of around 5,000 to 500,000, in view of the water-solubility and dopant properties. It is further preferable that the weight average molecular weight is around 40,000 to 200,000. Namely, when the weight average molecular weight of the copolymer is smaller than the above range, the function as a dopant can be deteriorated, and therefore, it may be difficult to obtain a conductive polymer having a high conductivity and an excellent heat resistance. On the other hand, when the weight average molecular weight becomes larger than the range above, the water-solubility can be decreased, and therefore, the handling characteristics might be deteriorated.","As the methacrylate mentioned above, the followings can be exemplified. The examples thereof can include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, diphenylbutyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, sodium sulfohexyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, methylglycidyl methacrylate, hydroxyalkyl methacrylate (i.e., hydroxyalkyl methacrylate such as hydroxymethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxybutyl methacrylate, hydroxyhexyl methacrylate, and hydroxystearyl methacrylate), hydroxypolyoxyethylene methacrylate, methoxyhydroxypropyl methacrylate, ethoxyhydroxypropyl methacrylate, dihydroxypropyl methacrylate, and dihydroxybutyl methacrylate. In particular, preferable are hydroxymethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and hydroxymethyl methacrylate. The alkyl group of these hydroxyalkyl methacrylates has a carbon number of 1 to 4. It is preferable to exhibit characteristics serving as a dopant when it is copolymerized with styrenesulfonic acid. Also, the compounds such as glycidyl methacrylate and methylglycidyl methacrylate include glycidyl group. These compounds have a structure having hydroxyl group when opening the glycidyl group. Therefore, in the same reasons as the hydroxyalkyl methacrylate, a compound having a glycidyl group is also preferable in view of the characteristic serving as a dopant when it is copolymerised with styrenesulfonic acid.","As the acrylate mentioned above, the followings can be exemplified. The example thereof can include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, diphenylbutyl acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, diethylaminoethyl acrylate, sodium sulfohexyl acrylate, glycidyl acrylate, methylglycidyl acrylate, hydroxyalkyl acrylate, (i.e., hydroxylalkyl acrylate such as hydroxymethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, and hydroxybutyl acrylate) can be used. In particular, preferable are hydroxymethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and hydroxybutyl acrylate. The carbon number of these compounds has a carbon number of 1 to 4. It is preferable to exhibit a characteristic serving as a dopant when it is copolymerized with styrenesulfonic acid. Also, the compounds such as glycidyl acrylate and methylglycidyl acrylate include glycidyl group. These compounds have a structure having hydroxyl group when opening the glycidyl group. Therefore, in the same reasons as the hydroxyalkyl acrylate, a compound having a glycidyl group is also preferable in view of the characteristics serving as a dopant when it is copolymerized with styrenesulfonic acid.","As the unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate as mentioned above, the followings can be exemplified. The example thereof can include an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound and its hydrolysate such as 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyldimethylmethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyldimethylethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyltriethoxysilane, 3-acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane 3-acryloxymethyldimethoxysilane, 3-acryloxymethyldiethoxysilane, 3-acryloxytriethoxysilane, p-styryltrimethoxysilane, p-styryltriethoxysilane, p-styrylmethyldimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinylmethyldimethoxysilane, and vinyldimethylmethoxysilane. The hydrolysate of such an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound can be as follows. For example, if the unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound is 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, it can be a compound having a structure in which its methoxy group is hydrolyzed to become hydroxyl group (i.e., 3-methoacryloxytrihydroxysilane), or a compound having a structure in which silane groups are condensed each other to form an oligomer while its methoxy group that has not been involved in the reaction becomes hydroxyl group.","Also, as the unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound, favorable are 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethylsilane, 3-acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, p-styryltrimethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane in view of serving a dopant when copolymerized with styrenesulfonic acid.","In synthesizing a conductive polymer, when the copolymer serving as a dopant is a copolymer of styrenesulfonic acid and the unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound, the following change can be considered. That is, when it is actually used as a dopant for conductive polymer synthesis, a solvent of water system is used in the synthetic process of the conductive polymer. Here, the alkoxy group of the alkoxysilane compound in the copolymer is hydrolyzed, thereby a structure having hydroxyl group can be obtained.","As a dopant in the synthesis of the conductive polymer, useful can be the following amount of the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate. That is, with respect to thiophene or its derivative, its mass ratio can be preferably 1:0.01 to 1:20, and in particular, 1:0.1 to 1:2. Namely, with respect to the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate, if it is used at an amount less than the range above, the function to serve as a dopant for the copolymer might not be able to exhibit enough. Also, if the amount of the copolymer is used more than the range above, the effect by such increase can be hardly seen, but rather, the conductivity of the conductive polymer as produced might be deteriorated.","In the second aspect of the present invention, the dopant used is as follows. That is, it is a combination of component (I) (i.e., the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate), and component (II) (i.e., polystyrene sulfonic acid). Here, this polystyrene sulfonic acid has preferably a weight average molecular weight of 10,000 to 1,000,000.","Namely, when the weight average molecular weight of the polystyrene sulfonic acid above is smaller than 10,000, thereby obtained conductive polymer might have a low conductivity. By contrast, when the weight average molecular weight of the polystyrene sulfonic acid above is larger than 1,000,000, the dispersion liquid of the conductive polymer might have a high viscosity. Therefore, upon the preparation of the solid electrolytic capacitor, it might become hard to be used. In addition, among the range above, the weight average molecular weight of the polystyrene sulfonic acid can be preferably 20,000 or more, and in particular, 40,000 or more. Also, it can be preferably 800,000 or less, and in particular, 300,000 or less.","As described above, the dopant can be a combination as follows. That is, it is a combination of a copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate, with polystyrene sulfonic acid. Thereby, in addition to the property from the copolymer alone, further improvement of the conductivity of the conductive polymer can be accomplished. In the combination, the mass ratio of the copolymer to the polystyrene sulfonic acid can be preferably 1:0.01 to 0.1:1.","Also, when using the combination of the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate, together with polystyrene sulfonic acid, the amount to be used in total can be a mass ratio of preferably 1:0.01 to 1:20, and in particular, 1:0.1 to 1:2, with respect to that of thiophene or its derivative.","In the present invention, thiophene or its derivative is the polymerizable monomer to be used in synthesizing the conductive polymer by oxidation polymerization. Here, the derivative of thiophene can be as follows. That is, the example of the derivative can include 3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene, 3-alkylthiophene, 3-alkoxythiophene, 3-alkyl-1-alkoxythiophene, 3,4-alkylthiophene, 3,4-alkoxythiophene, and alkoxylated ethylenedioxy thiophene in which 3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene is modified with an alkyl group. The carbon number of the alkyl group and the alkoxy group can be preferably 1 to 16, and in particular, 1 to 4.","Further explanation is made for the alkylated ethylenedioxy thiophene in which 3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene is modified with an alkyl group. 3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene and the alkylated ethylenedioxy thiophene mentioned above correspond to a compound represented by the following formula (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"42.08mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09460860-20161004-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"In the formula (1) mentioned above, when R is hydrogen, it is 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene.

Also, using the combination of the copolymer and polystyrene sulfonic acid, thiophene or its derivative is polymerized by means of oxidation polymerization.

Therefore, the dispersion liquid of the conductive polymer including the impurities is applied to a dispersion machine such as an ultrasonic homogenizer, high-pressure homogenizer or planetary ball mill to disperse the impurities.

In this invention, a conductive polymer and a solid electrolytic capacitor can be obtained which have both the properties resulting from the use of the copolymer as a dopant, as well as the properties resulting from the use of the polymer anion as a dopant.","Also, the fourth aspect of the present invention has the features as explained before. That is, the component (I) is the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate).

The weight average molecular weight of the sulfonated polyesters can be preferably 5,000 to 300,000.","Namely, when the weight average molecular weight of sulfonated polyester is lower than 5,000, the conductive polymer as obtained might have a low conductivity. When the weight average molecular weight of the sulfonated polyester is larger than 300,000, the dispersion liquid of the conductive polymer might have a high viscosity, and therefore, it might become hard to handle in the preparation of a solid electrolytic capacitor. In addition, within the range mentioned above, the weight average molecular weight of the sulfonated polyester can be preferably 10,000 or more, and in particular, 20,000 or more.

Preferably, one with a repeat unit as shown above can be used. The phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin can be provided with a weight average molecular weight of 5,000 to 500,000.","Namely, when the weight average molecular weight of the phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin above is smaller than 5,000, thereby obtained conductive polymer might be low in the conductivity. By contrast, when the weight average molecular weight of the phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin above is larger than 500,000, the viscosity of the dispersion liquid of the conductive polymer becomes high, and therefore, it might be difficult to handle it in the production of a solid electrolytic capacitor. In addition, within the range mentioned above, the weight average molecular weight of the phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin can be preferably 10,000 or more. Also, it can preferably 400,000 or less, and in particular, 80,000 or less.","Also, using the polymer anion of at least one kind selected from the group consisting of sulfonated polyester and phenolsulfonic acid novolac resin, thiophene or its derivative is polymerized by means of oxidation polymerization. This oxidation polymerization can be carried out in a similar way to that using the copolymer made from styrenesulfonic acid, and at least one kind of a non-sulfonic acid monomer selected from the group consisting of methacrylate, acrylate, and an unsaturated hydrocarbon containing alkoxysilane compound or its hydrolysate, serving as a dopant. Therefore, it can be performed in water or an aqueous solution of a mixture of water and a water-miscible solvent. Similarly, either of chemical oxidation polymerization or electrolyte oxidation polymerization can be adopted. The conditions of the polymerization can be adopted in the same manner as those for the oxidation polymerization of thiophene or its derivative in the presence of the copolymer as a dopant.","The conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention can include a high boiling point organic solvent having a boiling point of 150\u00b0 C. or more, or a saccharide for the purpose of a conductive improver. In this way, when such a conductive improver is included in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid, the conductivity of a conductive polymer film made by drying the conductive polymer dispersion liquid can be improved. As a result, when preparing a solid electrolytic capacitor by using the conductive polymer as a solid electrolyte, its ESR can be lowered.","The improvements above are considered to be accomplished by the following reasons. To produce a solid electrolytic capacitor, a capacitor element is immersed in a conductive polymer dispersion liquid, and it is taken out and dried. At this time, the layer density in the thickness direction of the conductive polymer can be increased. As a result, a space between the conductive polymers becomes small. Therefore, a conductivity of the conductive polymer can be increased. Then, when this conductive polymer is used as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor, it is considered that the ESR of the solid electrolytic capacitor can be lowered.","Also, when the conductive improver is included in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention, the conductivity of the conductive polymer film made by drying the conductive polymer dispersion liquid can be improved. Therefore, the conductivity of the conductive film made from the conductive polymer above can be further improved.","The conductive improver above can be a high boiling point organic solvent having a boiling point of 150\u00b0 C. or more, or a saccharide. The example of the high boiling point organic solvent having a boiling point of 150\u00b0 C. or more can include dimethylsulfoxide, butanediol, \u03b3-butyrolactone, sulfolane, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfone, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and polyethlene glycol. Also, the examples of the saccharide include erythritol, glucose, mannose, and pullulan. As the conductive improver, dimethylsulfoxide and butanediol are particularly preferable. Here, as to the organic solvent having a boiling point of 150\u00b0 C. or more, its boiling point is under the ordinary pressure (that is, 1 atm=1013.25 hPa).","The conductive improver can be added at an amount below. It is preferable to add 5 to 3,000% by mass standard with respect to the conductive polymer in the dispersion liquid (namely, the conductive improver is added at 5 to 3,000 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the conductive polymer). In particular, it can be added at 20 to 700%. When the conductive improver is added at an amount less than the range above, the effects to improve the conductivity might not be exhibited enough. By contrast, when the conductive improver is added at an amount more than the range above, it might take additional time for drying of the dispersion liquid, as well as it might cause deterioration to reduce the conductive.","In addition, since the content of the conductive polymer in the dispersion liquid affects the handling properties in immersing the capacitor element therein and taking it out therefrom. Thus, it is usually preferable to adjust it at the level of 0.5 to 15 mass %. In other words, when the content of the conductive polymer is less than the range above, it might take additional time for drying. By contrast, when the content of the conductive polymer is more than the range above, the viscosity of the dispersion liquid is increased, and thereby, the handling properties in producing a solid electrolytic capacitor might be deteriorated.","The conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention is particularly suitable in using it in the preparation of the solid electrolytic capacitor. This is due to high conductivity and excellent heat resistance of the conductive polymer obtained by drying the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention. Therefore, when it is used as a solid electrolyte, a solid electrolytic capacitor can be prepared which has low ESR and is reliable in using it under a hot condition.","When using the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention to prepare a solid electrolytic capacitor, the dried form of the conductive polymer can be used as a solid electrolyte of the solid electrolytic capacitor. However, it can be also used in a state of dispersion liquid. In this case, a capacitor element is immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid, and then, it is taken out for drying, and thereby dried conductive polymer can be used as a solid electrolyte.","Also in the production, for the purpose to increase the adhesion properties between the conductive polymer and the capacitor element, a binder can be added in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid. The example of such a binder can include polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane, polyester, acrylic resin, polyamide, polyimide, epoxy resin, polyacrylonitrile resin, polymethacrylonitrile resin, polystyrene resin, novolac resin, sulfonated polyester, sulfonated polyallyl, sulfonated polyvinyl, sulfonated polystyrene, and a silane coupling agent. In particular, preferable are polyester, polyurethane, acrylic resin, sulfonated polyester, sulfonated polyallyl, sulfonated polyvinyl, and sulfonated polystyrene. In particular, when it has sulfone group in such a compound as sulfonated polyester, sulfonated polyallyl, sulfonated polyvinyl, and sulfonated polystyrene, the conductivity of the conductive polymer can be improved more favorably.","Next, the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention is described based on the examples to use it in the preparation of a solid electrolytic capacitor.","First, the explanation is made for the example when using the conductive polymer of the present invention in the preparation of tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor, niobium solid electrolytic capacitor, or laminated-type aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor. For example, there is provided a capacitor element having a positive electrode made of the porous body of a valve metal such as tantalum, niobium, and aluminum; and a dielectric layer made of an oxide layer of the valve metal. The capacitor element is immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention, and then, it is taken out and dried to form a layer of a solid electrolyte made of the conductive polymer. Also, if necessary, the steps of the immersing and the drying of the dispersion liquid can be repeated. As a result, a solid electrolyte layer made of the conductive polymer can be formed. Then, carbon paste and silver paste can be applied and dried, and then, an exterior package can be provided. Thereby, there can be producing tantalum solid electrolyte capacitor, niobium solid electrolytic capacitor, and laminated-type aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor.","Also, using an organic sulfonate of non-iron salt base as a dopant, the capacitor element above can be immersed in a liquid including a polymerizable monomer and an oxidant, and then, taken out for drying to polymerize. Then, it is immersed in water for washing, and then, taken out for drying. The process described above is, so-called, \u201con-site polymerization,\u201d to prepare a conductive polymer. Then, the step in which the capacitor element is immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention and then it is taken out for drying. The step can be repeated to form a solid electrolyte layer made of the conductive polymer of the present invention. It is also noted that the solid electrolyte layer can be prepared in a visa versa method (i.e., the capacitor element is first immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention and then it is taken out for drying; and second, the on-site polymerization is performed thereon.)","Then, thereby obtained capacitor element covered with the conductive polymer is then coated with carbon paste and silver paste. Then, an exterior package is provided. Thereby, there can be obtaining tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor, niobium solid electrolytic capacitor, and laminated-type aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor.","In addition, when the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention is used in the preparation of a winding-type aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor, the following process can be performed. For example, a surface of an aluminum foil is etched. Then, a conversion treatment is preformed to form a dielectric layer, and a lead terminal is attached to its positive electrode. Also, a lead terminal is attached to a negative electrode made of an aluminum foil. These positive and negative electrodes, each having a lead terminal, are wound with an intervention of a separator to provide a capacitor element. The capacitor element is immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention, and then, taken out for drying to prepare a solid electrolyte layer made of the conductive polymer. Alternatively, the steps of immersing in and drying of the dispersion liquid can be repeated, if necessary. After forming the solid electrolyte layer made of the conductive polymer, exterior material is applied to provide an exterior package to obtain a winding type aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor.","As described above, the conductive polymer obtained by drying the conductive polymer dispersion liquid of the present invention (which may be hereinafter simply referred to as \u201cconductive polymer of the present invention\u201d) can be featured as follows. That is, it has high conductivity and excellent heat resistance which can be suitably used as a solid electrolyte of a solid electrolytic capacitor. In addition, it has a high transparency, as well. Therefore, in addition to the use as such a solid electrolyte of solid electrolytic capacitors, it can be used in the preparation of a conductive film (antistatic film). Also, it can be used as a conductive body of antistatic material such as antistatic cloth and antistatic resin. Also in addition to the use above, using the characteristics above, the conductive polymer of the present invention can be used as positive electrode active material of batteries, and base resin of corrosion-resistant paints.","For example, when manufacturing a conductive film (antistatic film) using the conductive polymer of the present invention, the following process can be adopted. That is, the conductive polymer dispersion liquid can be applied to a basic sheet. Alternatively, a basic sheet is immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid, and then, it is taken out and dried to form a conductive film, which can be then removed from the basic sheet. However, rather than that the conductivity film formed on at least one surface of the basic sheet is removed from the basic sheet, there may be sometimes an occasion where the basic sheet can be suitably used as a support of the conductive sheet (antistatic seat). Also, when the conductive polymer of the present invention is used as a conductive material to manufacture antistatic cloth, the following process can be adopted. That is, the conductive polymer dispersion liquid is applied on a cloth, or alternatively, it may be immersed in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid, and taken it out for drying. When, manufacturing such a conductive sheet or antistatic cloth, a binder can be added in the conductive polymer dispersion liquid in the same manner as described before. In this case, the adhesion properties of the conductive polymer with the basic sheet or the cloth can be improved.","Next, the present invention is explained more in detail with reference to the Examples. The construction of the present invention, however, should not be limited to the Examples alone. It is noted that in the Examples, the indication of \u201c%\u201d for the concentration or content is mass % unless otherwise noted.","Prior to the explanation of the Examples, Production Examples 1 to 13 are explained.
