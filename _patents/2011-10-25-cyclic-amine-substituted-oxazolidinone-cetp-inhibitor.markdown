invention relates to chemical compounds that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and are expected to have utility in raising HDL-C, lowering LDL-C, and in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and peripheral vascular disease, represent a truly enormous burden to the health care systems of the industrialized world. In the United States alone, approximately 13 million patients have been diagnosed with CHD, and greater than one half million deaths are attributed to CHD each year. Further, this toll is expected to grow over the next quarter century as an epidemic in obesity and diabetes continues to grow.","It has long been recognized that in mammals, variations in circulating lipoprotein profiles correlate with the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD. The clinical success of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, especially the statins, in reducing coronary events is based on the reduction of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), levels of which correlate directly with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. More recently, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and atherosclerosis, leading to the conclusion that low serum HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk for CHD.","Metabolic control of lipoprotein levels is a complex and dynamic process involving many factors. One important metabolic control in man is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein that catalyzes the movement of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the apoB containing lipoproteins, especially VLDL (see Hesler, C. B., et. al. (1987) 262(5), 2275-2282)). Under physiological conditions, the net reaction is a heteroexchange in which CETP carries triglyceride to HDL from the apoB lipoprotein and transports cholesterol ester from HDL to the apoB lipoprotein.","In humans, CETP plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, the process whereby cholesterol is returned to the liver from peripheral tissues. Intriguingly, many animals do not possess CETP, including animals that have high HDL levels and are known to be resistant to coronary heart disease, such as rodents (see Guyard-Dangremont, V., et. al., (1998) 14 120(3), 517-525). Numerous epidemiologic studies correlating the effects of natural variation in CETP activity with respect to coronary heart disease risk have been performed, including studies on a small number of known human null mutations (see Hirano, K.-L, Yamashita, S, and Matsuzawa, Y. (2000) 11(6), 589-596). These studies have clearly demonstrated an inverse correlation between plasma HDL-C concentration and CETP activity (see Inazu, A., et. al. (2000) 11(4), 389-396), leading to the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of CETP lipid transfer activity may be beneficial to humans by increasing levels of HDL-C while lowering LDL-C.","Despite the significant therapeutic advance that statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin represent, statins only achieve a risk reduction of approximately one-third in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events. Currently, few pharmacologic therapies are available that favorably raise circulating levels of HDL-C. Certain statins and some fibrates offer modest HDL-C gains. Niacin provides an effective therapy for raising HDL-C but suffers from patient compliance issues, due in part to side effects such as flushing. Drugs that inhibit CETP (CETP inhibitors) have been under development with the expectation that they will effectively raise HDL cholesterol levels and also reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients. Torcetrapib was the first drug that was tested in a long-term outcomes clinical trial. The clinical trial of torcetrapib was terminated early due to a higher incidence of mortality in patients to whom torcetrapib and atorvastatin were administered concomitantly compared with patients who were treated with atorvastatin alone. The cause of the increased mortality is not completely understood, but it is not believed to be associated with the CETP inhibiting effects of the drug.","Two other drug candidates, dalcetrapib and anacetrapib, are currently being tested in Phase III clinical trials, including large scale outcomes trials. Data from the recently completed DEFINE Phase III trial of anacetrapib are promising. Patients who were treated with anacetrapib along with baseline statin therapy showed an increase of HDL-C of 138% and a decrease of LDL-C of 40% compared with patients who were treated with just a statin.

The compounds are therefore useful in treating mammalian patients, preferably human patients, having diseases and conditions that are treated by inhibition of CETP.","One aspect of the present invention provides a method for treating or reducing the risk of developing a disease or condition that may be treated or prevented by inhibition of CETP by administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I to a patient in need of treatment. The patient is a human or mammal, but is most often a human. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is the amount of compound that is effective in obtaining a desired clinical outcome in the treatment of a specific disease.","Diseases or conditions that may be treated with the compounds of this invention, or which the patient may have a reduced risk of developing as a result of being treated with the compounds of this invention, include: atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, obesity, endotoxemia, and metabolic syndrome.","The compounds disclosed herein are particularly effective in raising HDL-C and\/or increasing the ratio of HDL-C to LDL-C. The compounds may also be effective in reducing LDL-C, and may be effective in treating dyslipidemia. These changes in HDL-C and LDL-C may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or reversing the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, or preventing atherosclerosis. The compounds disclosed herein are thus expected to be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or reversing the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, and preventing atherosclerosis.","Likely indications for atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia using the compounds described herein are written below, where the drug product is titled \u201cCETP inhibitor:\u201d","Atherosclerosis.","In patients at high risk of cardiovascular events because of existing coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease, CETP inhibitor co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated to reduce the risk of coronary mortality, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedures, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death.","Dyslipidemia.","CETP inhibitor co-administered with a statin is indicated to reduce elevated LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), non-HDL-C, and total cholesterol; and increase HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) in patients with mixed or primary dyslipidemia.","Administration and Dose Ranges","Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of the compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably the compound of Formula I is administered orally.","When treating the diseases for which the compound of Formula I is indicated, generally satisfactory results are expected when the compound of the present invention is administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 1000 milligram in one dose daily or divided into more than one dose per day.","Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets. Examples of doses in tablets include 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 110 mg, 120 mg, 130 mg, 140 mg, 150 mg, 160 mg, 170 mg, 180 mg, 190 mg, 200 mg, 210 mg, 220 mg, 230 mg, 240 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg, 400 mg, 450 mg, 500 mg, and 1000 mg. Other oral forms can also have the same dosages (e.g. capsules). A preferred dose is in the range of 50-200 mg.","Pharmaceutical Compositions","Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise the compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered. A pharmaceutical composition may also consist essentially of the compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, without other therapeutic ingredients.","Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated to be suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.","In practical use, the compound of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.","Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compound can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.","The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.","Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.","The Compound of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of the compound can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.","The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.","Combination Therapy","The compound of Formula I, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which the compound of Formula I is useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with the compound of Formula I. When the compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered concomitantly, on the same or different schedules.","When oral formulations are used, the drugs may be combined into a single combination tablet or other oral dosage form, or the drugs may be packaged together as separate tablets or other oral dosage forms. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.","Examples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a compound of this invention (e.g. Formula I), and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to, other compounds which improve a patient's lipid profile, such as (i) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, (which are generally statins, including simvastatin and lovastatin which are marketed as ZOCOR\u00ae and MEVACOR\u00ae in lactone pro-drug form and function as inhibitors after administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of dihydroxy open ring acid HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atorvastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in LIPITOR\u00ae), rosuvastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in CRESTOR\u00ae), pravastatin (particularly the sodium salt sold in PRAVACHOL\u00ae), and fluvastatin (particularly the sodium salt sold in LESCOL\u00ae); rivastatin, pitavastatin, and other statins), (ii) bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives of a cross-linked dextran, Colestid\u00ae, LoCholest\u00ae, (iii) niacin and related compounds, such as nicotinyl alcohol, nicotinamide, and nicotinic acid or a salt thereof, (iv) PPAR\u03b1 agonists, such as gemfibrozil and fenofibric acid derivatives (fibrates), including clofibrate, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and etofibrate, (v) cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as stanol esters, beta-sitosterol, sterol glycosides such as tiqueside; and azetidinones, such as ezetimibe, (vi) acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, such as avasimibe and melinamide, and including selective ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 inhibitors and dual inhibitors, (vii) phenolic anti-oxidants, such as probucol, (viii) microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)\/ApoB secretion inhibitors, (ix) anti-oxidant vitamins, such as vitamins C and E and beta carotene, (x) thyromimetics, (xi) LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor inducers, (xii) platelet aggregation inhibitors, for example glycoprotein IIIb\/IIIa fibrinogen receptor antagonists and aspirin, (xiii) vitamin B12 (also known as cyanocobalamin), (xiv) folic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, such as the sodium salt and the methylglucamine salt, (xv) FXR and LXR ligands, including both inhibitors and agonists, (xvi) agents that enhance ABCA1 gene expression, and (xvii) ileal bile acid transporters.","Preferred classes of therapeutic compounds that can be used with the compounds of this invention for uses described above, such as improving a patient's lipid profile (i.e. raising HDL-C and lowering LDL-C) and for treating, preventing, or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, include one or both of statins and cholesterol absorption inhibitors.

Then compounds at varying concentrations were incubated with 15 nM CETP (reagent production group, In Vitro Pharmacology, MRL Rahway) and 50 ug\/ml of the biotinylated LDL in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction was started by adding H-cholesterol ester high density lipoprotein (HDL) (American Radiochemicals Corp) at a concentration of \u02dc0.6 nM. The reaction proceeded for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C., after which time it was quenched by the addition of 12% acetic acid. PVT streptavadin-coated scintillation proximity beads, which had been brought to room temperature, were then added at a concentration of 4 mg\/ml. The assay was then mixed and counted after one half hour in a Microbeta plate reader.","In Vitro Radioactive Assays of CETP-Catalyzed CE and TG Transfer (RTA Assay)","Reagents and sources are: [3H] cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK.886), [3H] Triolein (Perkin-Elmer NET-431), Butylated hydroxyl toluene (Aldrich, #D4740-4), DOPC (Sigma, #P6354), Sodium Bromide (Fisher scientific #5255-500), PEG 8000 (Fisher, #BP233-1), and human HDL (Intracel Corp #RP-036).","An in vitro assay for determining IC's to identify compounds that inhibit CETP transfer activity is performed based on a modification of a published method (Morton and Zilversmit, (1981) A plasma inhibitor of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer activities, J. Biol. Chem. 256(23), 11992-11995). The ability of inhibitors to alter CETP activity is performed using two different assays: one using recombinant CETP and one using an edogenous plasma source of CETP. Both assays measure the transfer of [3H] cholesteryl oleate or [3H]triolein from exogenous LDL to HDL.","Radiolabeled donor particles are generated by first combining 100 \u03bcl of 200 \u03bcM butylated hydroxyl toluene in CHCl, 216 \u03bcL of 21.57 mM DOPC in EtOH, and either 500 \u03bcCi [3H]-triolein (Perkin Elmer #NET-431) or 500 \u03bcCi [3H]-cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK886) in a glass tube. Reagents are mixed, dried under nitrogen, and then resuspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris, 27 \u03bcM EDTA at pH 7.4. After a brief vortex, the solution is sonicated until clear and mixed with 20 mL of fresh human serum. The mixture is incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The [3H] labeled LDL substrate is separated at 1.063 g\/ml density by sequential ultracentrifugal flotation in NaBr according to the method by (Havel, Eder et al. 1955; Chapman, Goldstein et al. 1981). Once isolated the particles are dialyzed 3\u00d7 in CETP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Human HDL is purchased from Intracel and used as the acceptor particles.","Transfer assays are performed in a 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plate. For the RTA using recombinant CETP (2% RTA), an assay cocktail is prepared with the final concentrations 128 \u03bcg\/mL HDL, 20 nM rCETP, 2% human serum, and 1\u00d7CETP buffer. 1 \u03bcL of each test compound diluted in DMSO is added to 47 \u03bcL of assay cocktail per well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. To initiate the transfer reaction, 2 \u03bcL radiolabeled LDL is added. After an additional 60 min of incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the transfer action is terminated by precipitation of LDL with an equal volume of 20% W\/V PEG 8000. The plates are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. A 40 \u03bcL aliquot of the HDL-containing supernatant is transferred to a Packard Optiplate with 200 \u03bcL of MicroScint 20. After mixing, plates are counted by liquid scintillation. Counts present in the supernatant for blanks (wells containing only HDL acceptor, CETP buffer and DMSO) are subtracted from those containing test compounds and used to correct for non-specific transfer.","For the transfer assay using endogenous CETP from serum (95% RTA), the same procedure is used except that human serum is added such that a final concentration of serum of 95% of the total assay volume is achieved, yielding a concentration of approximately 15 nM endogenous CETP in the assay. This is then combined with HDL and CETP buffer and the reaction proceeds as above and is terminated as described.","Comparison of the counts of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited (DMSO only) positive control yield a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration, fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation is used to calculate IC50.","The table below provides data using the assays described herein. The data were obtained using the RTA assay in 2% human serum. In a few cases (Examples 142, 170 and 277), the RTA assays were carried out in 95% human serum. These measurements are labeled with an asterisk(*). Examples which are marked \u201cN\/A\u201d were selected based on the assays, but the actual IC50's are not available in the databases. The IC50's for these examples are believed to be less then 1000 nM.
