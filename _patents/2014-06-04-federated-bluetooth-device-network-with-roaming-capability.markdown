{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION","DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIONS"],"p":["A variety of protocols exist which enable the remote use of speakers, mics, and displays by devices. The Bluetooth wireless protocol provides a convenient way for cell phones to use external microphones and speakers without any cable attachment. Bluetooth is pervasively available on most cellphones, in most new cars, and in many headset products. The Airplay wireless procotol provides a convenient way for PCs, mobile devices, or other devices to render their audio and video output on a remote display. A similar protocol called Miracast performs the same function, as does DLNA.","Small devices (sometimes called \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices) with cameras, mics, and speakers are becoming very cheap, and a wide variety of products are becoming available. It is reasonable to expect that a typical house or office may have tens or hundreds of devices with mics and speakers. As speaker\/microphone devices become very cheap, there might be one in every room in a house, or even many in a room. Speakers and microphones may become embedded in many other commonly installed devices\u2014TVs, PCs, tablets, etc. And in the office environment, there may be one in every room, and conference rooms may have many inexpensive speakers and mics.","While these devices could work as remote Bluetooth mics and speakers or Airplay speakers, the Bluetooth and Airplay protocols are awkward for this scenario. A user would have to explicitly pair their phone with many mics and speakers, and continually link and unlink to the closest mic and speaker. Additionally, if many users want to use the devices as Bluetooth mics and speakers, the constant linking and unlinking is complicated to manage, with many possibilities for collision and contention.","\u2018Sensor\u2019 in this context refers to a device or composition of matter that responds to a physical stimulus (as heat, light, sound, pressure, magnetism, or a particular motion) and transmits a resulting impulse (as for measurement or operating a control).","\u2018Microphone\u2019 in this context refers to an acoustic-to-electric transducer or sensor that converts sound into an electrical signal. Many microphones use electromagnetic induction (dynamic microphone), capacitance change (condenser microphone), piezoelectric generation, or light modulation to produce an electrical voltage signal from mechanical vibration.","\u2018Camera\u2019 in this context refers to a device that records images and\/or video, either as analog or as digital information signals.","\u2018Stereo\u2019 in this context refers to sound reproduction that creates directionality and audible perspective by using two or more independent audio channels through a configuration of two or more speakers in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing.","\u2018Speaker\u2019 in this context refers to an electroacoustic transducer that produces sound in response to an electrical or optical audio signal input.","\u2018Motion detector\u2019 in this context refers to a device that detects moving objects, often people.

Signals between the devices between establishment of the session and the end of the session are not part of the session. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is sometimes stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parts needs to save information about the session establishment or history in order to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication comprises independent requests with responses and no requirement of stored state to maintain communication.","\u2018Database\u2019 in this context refers to an organized collection of data (states of matter representing values, symbols, or control signals to device logic), structured typically into tables that comprise \u2018rows\u2019 and \u2018columns\u2019, although this structure is not implemented in every case.","\u2018Application (logic)\u2019 in this context refers to logic that causes a computer to perform tasks beyond the basic operation of the computer itself.

The operating system is a vital component of many devices, such as computers and mobile phones. Application logic usually requires an operating system in order to function. Operating systems typically manage utilization of device resources, such as I\/O devices, displays, processor utilization, memory, mass storage, and printing. The operating system acts as an intermediary between applications and the hardware resources, although applications are often (though not always, in the case of virtual machines) executed directly by the device hardware (e.g., one or more CPUs) and will frequently make system calls to the operating system, or be interrupted by it. Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a programmable processor or controller, from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.","\u2018Distributed (logic)\u2019 in this context refers to logic that cooperatively executes on multiple different devices, separated in space and each capable of operating independently of the others.

Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted. As per the OSI model Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer.","\u2018Z-Wave\u2019 in this context refers to a wireless communications protocol designed for home automation, specifically to remotely control applications in residential and light commercial environments.

An RSS document (which is called a \u201cfeed\u201d, \u201cweb feed\u201d, or \u201cchannel\u201d) may include full or summarized text, plus metadata such as publishing dates and authorship.","\u2018Cloud (Network)\u2019 in this context refers to device resources delivered as a service over a network (typically the Internet).","References to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although they may. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u201ccomprise,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d Words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number respectively, unless expressly limited to a single one or multiple ones. Additionally, the words \u201cherein,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cbelow\u201d and words of similar import, when used in this application, refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application. When the claims use the word \u201cor\u201d in reference to a list of two or more items, that word covers all of the following interpretations of the word: any of the items in the list, all of the items in the list and any combination of the items in the list, unless expressly limited to one or the other.","\u201cLogic\u201d refers to machine memory circuits, machine readable media, and\/or circuitry which by way of its material and\/or material-energy configuration comprises control and\/or procedural signals, and\/or settings and values (such as resistance, impedance, capacitance, inductance, current\/voltage ratings, etc.), that may be applied to influence the operation of a device. Magnetic media, electronic circuits, electrical and optical memory (both volatile and nonvolatile), and firmware are examples of logic.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that logic may be distributed throughout one or more devices, and\/or may be comprised of combinations memory, media, processing circuits and controllers, other circuits, and so on. Therefore, in the interest of clarity and correctness logic may not always be distinctly illustrated in drawings of devices and systems, although it is inherently present therein.","The techniques and procedures described herein may be implemented via logic distributed in one or more computing devices. The particular distribution and choice of logic will vary according to implementation.","Devices and a system are described which enable a network of monitoring devices to be federated and act as a single rendering device for multiple concurrent users; these devices are designated \u201chost\u201d devices, as they host the federated rendering service and collectively form the \u2018federated device\u2019. Devices, such as cell phones requesting the rendering service, are designated \u201cclient\u201d devices. Client devices may request rendering services from the federated device via a \u201crendering protocol\u201d such as Bluetooth, Airplay, DLNA, or any other protocol which permits remote rendering.","In one embodiment the system is enabled by a collection of devices, each of which has sensors, including but not limited to cameras, microphones, motion sensors, accelerometers, and proximity sensors. The devices may also incorporate a variety of outputs, including but not limited to video, audio, speakers, and LED lights. The devices will have network connectivity of some sort, and may utilize AC or battery power. The devices may be standalone devices or integrated into other electric and electronic devices, and may be stationary, movable, or even mobile (drones). The devices can be used alone or in groups. More detail on exemplary logic for the devices that form the federated network is described in Appendix A, \u201cExemplary Host Device\u201d.","Each host device comprises logic to federate rendering activity. There may be an additional service that runs on a central server or network service to coordinate and manage the host devices, or this responsibility may be distributed across the host devices (peer-to-peer).","Each host device presents its availability as a rendering device via the mechanisms of the particular rendering protocol. A client device, such as a cell phone, pairs and links with the federated device at any one of the host devices via the rendering protocol. Each host device responds on demand to any request for rendering service, and provides a virtual device name to a cell phone or other client device requesting service. The host devices maintain a shared database of client devices and connection status. One sequence embodiment of operations for the host device is as follows:","Host device receives request from client for rendering service","Host device checks client ID against database of known client devices","If client has never connected","Create a new client entry in the db","Create a connection with client","Update connection status in db","Else","Create a connection with client","Update connection status in db","The host devices communicate between themselves to keep the shared database synchronized using off-the-shelf database synchronization solutions. Multiple users can pair their client devices with host devices. To each cell phone or client device, at a protocol level, the network of host devices appears as a single device\u2014a single Bluetooth device, or a single Airplay device, etc. If the client device moves, the host devices cooperate to hand link responsibility off between one another. To the client device, this is transparent as each host device presents itself as the same virtual paired device. As a client device moves from an area serviced by host device A to that serviced by host device B, the handoff occurs as follows:","Host device B detects that client is near","Host device gets connection status from db","Host device B sends request to host device A to drop connection","If host device A responds positively","Host device B creates connection with client","Host device B updates connection status in db","As a user moves through the space covered by the participating host devices, the user's location is tracked. This may happen via motion tracking, via voice recognition, via electronic detection of the user's phone or logins, via integration with the user's calendar, by some explicit action on the user's part, or by any other mechanism available, and by any combination of these mechanisms. The location of the closest host device is noted in the shared database.","When the client device wishes to render content to the host device nearest the user, the host devices cooperate to route the content to the correct host device. For instance, when an inbound call arrives, the user's phone notifies the a host device of the federated device, e.g. host device A, that it is currently linked with via the Bluetooth protocol that a call has arrived. Host device A reads the user's current location from the shared database, and retrieves the address of the host device serving that user, host device B. Host device A establishes a connection with host device B and sends the call information to host device B, and host device B presents an inbound call alert\u2014ringing, voice announcement, on-screen alert, or other mechanism. The user can accept the call by voice command, gesture, or other method of interaction with host device B. Host device B updates the shared database, and notifies host device A to complete the call. Incoming audio is then routed from the phone, over the Bluetooth connection to host device A, then over the IP network to host device B, and then rendered at the speaker at that device. Outgoing audio follows the reverse path.","The user can create \u201cdo not disturb\u201d rules by time and location. These are noted in the shared database, and the host devices will respect these rules and only attempt to complete calls if permitted. Outbound calls are initiated by voice, gesture, or other means. Outgoing audio is then picked up by the mic at host device B, routed over the IP network to host device A, sent to the phone over the Bluetooth connection, and then out on the carrier network using the standard telephony services. Incoming audio follows the reverse path.","As the user moves, their location is tracked. Audio for the current call is handed off to closest device continuously.","Host device C detects that user is near","Host device gets connection status from db","Host device C sends request to host device B to drop connection","If host device B responds positively","Host device C creates connection with host device A","Host device C updates connection status in db","As a refinement, this handoff may happen gradually, and rendering may happen simultaneously at both device B and device C for a period of time or within an overlapping service boundary of B and C. The user can also expand or move rendering to additional devices via gesture or other interface. For instance, if the user wants audio to be broadcast over 5 devices, the user can indicate the 5 devices via some interface (e.g., an inclusive gesture to a camera federated with the host devices), and audio will be broadcast over all these.","Multiple users may utilize the system simultaneously. Their phones (or other devices) can each independently pair with a host device, and each user will be tracked, and audio can be routed to each user's location. If two users enter the same area for a call, they can optionally merge their calls into a single conference call. A host device that is currently engaged with rendering a call for user  can detect that user  has entered the area serviced by the host. The users can then indicate by gesture or some other interface that they wish to merge the calls. If the calls are merged, the rendering host:\n\n","If the users choose not to merge the calls, then rendering of the newly arrived user's call will either:\n\n","The system allows a caller to easily use many disparate microphones and speakers for their calling, without the burden of constantly pairing.

If an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a hardware and\/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a solely software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations may involve optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood as notorious by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. Several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in standard integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and\/or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies equally regardless of the particular type of signal bearing media used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing media include, but are not limited to, the following: recordable type media such as floppy disks, hard disk drives, CD ROMs, digital tape, and computer memory.","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201ccircuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201ccircuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and\/or circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment).","Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and\/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use standard engineering practices to integrate such described devices and\/or processes into larger systems. That is, at least a portion of the devices and\/or processes described herein can be integrated into a network processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation.","The foregoing described aspects depict different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality.","Exemplary Host Device(s)","A monitoring device.
