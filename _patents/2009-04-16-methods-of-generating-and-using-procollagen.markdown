The contents of the above Applications are all incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to compositions which comprise procollagen and uses of same in promoting wound healing, treating fibrosis and promoting angiogenesis.","The rapid response of the mammalian body to initiate the healing response to prevent life threatening bleeding and infection has evolved to ensure survival, often at the expense of efficient regeneration of the damaged tissue. The wound healing process entails different stages, some being sequential, while others concomitant. However, all stages are carefully orchestrated at the damaged tissue site to regenerate a tissue with normal functionality. The sequence of events involves clotting, inflammation, tissue deposition (migration and proliferation) and finally tissue remodeling.","At the time of tissue injury, blood is released from damaged vessels leading to the formation of a fibrin fiber mesh with platelets entrapped within. The mesh functions as a scaffold for recruited cells to migrate towards and throughout. The activated platelets degranulate and release chemotactic agents including cytokines and growth factors such as transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), resulting in recruitment of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Several days after injury the fibroblasts begin to replace the damaged tissue by depositing new collagen matrices. Collagen fibers gradually increase in thickness and align along the stress line of the wound. In normal scar formation, collagen fibers typically align in parallel to the epidermis. This newly formed granulation tissue is eventually organized and contracted into a more dense structure by myofibroblasts.","Scars usually form as a result of the normal progression of the wound healing response and are composed of connective tissue deposited during the healing process. Most scars exhibit a certain degree of both abnormal organization (as seen in scars of the skin) and amounts of connective tissue (as seen in scars of the central nervous system). However, alterations in the normal tissue production cascade result in less than optimal wound healing with excessive deposit of scarring tissue resulting in keloid and hypertrophic scar formation, also termed fibrosis. Hypertrophic scars are characterized by excessive collagen deposition, altered collagen remodeling and contraction and differ from keloid scars in that they are defined within the boundaries of the wound site.","Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) plays an important role in these healing processes and has been reported to mediate the transition of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. This fibroblast subtype is characterized by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and is involved in wound contraction. TGF-\u03b21 induces collagen deposition by upregulation of both mRNA stability and expression of procollagen. In addition, it reduces collagen degradation rates by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) while inducing the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).","Aside from the MMP\/TIPMP balance, the accessibility of a collagen molecule to such enzymatic activity is also a central factor in determining collagen degradation rates. This accessibility is primarily determined by the organizational state of the collagen (helical monomers versus monomers organized into fibrils) and the extent of crosslinking between collagen triple helices.","Types I and III collagen are fibril-forming collagens, which constitute the bulk of the dermal extracellular matrix. Collagen is synthesized as a procollagen precursor, in which three collagen polypeptides coil into each other, forming the triple helix. These helices are subsequently linked together at the final step of collagen fibril biosynthesis. Type I procollagen consists of two alpha 1 collagen chains and a single alpha 2 chain. Type III is composed of three alpha 1 chains.","In all of the fibrillar collagen molecules, the three polypeptide chains are constructed from a repeating Gly-X-Y triplet, where X and Y can be any amino acid but are frequently the imino acids proline and hydroxyproline. An important feature of fibril forming collagens is that they are synthesized as precursor procollagens containing globular N- and C-terminal extension propeptides.","Each procollagen molecule assembles within the rough endoplasmic reticulum from its three constituent polypeptide chains. As the polypeptide chain is co-translationally translocated across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the Gly-X-Y repeat region. Once the polypeptide chain is fully translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the three pro-alpha chains associate via their C-propeptides to form a trimeric molecule allowing the Gly-X-Y repeat region to form a nucleation point at its C-terminal end, ensuring correct alignment of the chains. The Gly-X-Y region then folds in a C-to-N direction to form a triple helix.","The C-propeptides, and to a lesser extent the N-propeptides, maintain procollagen solubility during its passage out of the cell [Bulleid et al., Biochem Soc Trans. 2000; 28(4):350-3]. Following or during secretion of procollagen molecules into the extracellular matrix, propeptides are typically cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteinases, thereby triggering spontaneous self-assembly of collagen molecules into fibrils [Hulmes, 2002 J Struct Biol. 137(1-2):2-10].","Removal of the propeptides by procollagen N- and C-proteinases dramatically lowers the solubility of procollagen and is necessary to initiate the self-assembly of collagen into fibers at 37\u00b0 C. Crucial to this assembly process are the short non triple-helical peptides called telopeptides which are the remnants of the N- and C-terminal propeptides following digestion with N\/C proteinases. These peptides act to ensure correct covalent registration of the collagen molecules within the fibril structure via their crosslinkable aldehydes by lowering the critical concentration necessary for self-assembly (Bulleid et al., 2000, supra).","To date, animal-derived collagen is the major source of collagen for medical applications. Animal-purified collagen is fully processed containing crosslinked telopeptides which render it highly insoluble. Solubilization of animal-purified collagen is typically effected using an extraction method which involves proteolytic removal of the telopeptide region with proteloytic enzymes such as trypsin, yielding atelocollagen which can be solubilized (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,934,852; 3,121,049; 3,131,130; 3,314,861; 3,530,037; 3,949,073; 4,233,360 and 4,488,911 for general methods for preparing purified soluble collagen). Atelocollagen undergoes fibrillogenesis under physiological conditions, to form fibers. Such fibers are relatively stable structures, resistant to proteolysis by MMPs. However, these fibers lack the molecular domains found in procollagen, essential to natural wound healing processes and to the natural formation of collagen structures.","As mentioned, alterations in the normal tissue production cascade during the process of wound healing may lead to excessive deposition of scarring tissue resulting in fibrosis.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,448,278 and references therein describe specific procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) inhibitors for the treatment of various medical conditions associated with unregulated production of collagen, including pathological fibrosis or scarring.","Zhang Y et al., 1999, 13(1):51-4 teach direct stimulation of procollagen I (alpha 1) gene expression by administration of platelet-derived wound healing factor (PDWHF).","Saggers, et al., [Wounds 13(2):66-71, 2001] reported that acid-soluble collagen isolated from rat tail tendons inhibits types I and III procollagen mRNA expression in human dermal fibroblasts grown on collagen-coated dishes. The anabolic steroid, oxandrolone, antagonized such collagen substrate inhibition of procollagen mRNA expression. These findings suggest that oxandrolone may directly enhance wound healing by increasing the expression of procollagen mRNA in fibroblasts associated with a collagen matrix analogous to the healing wound.","U.S. Patent App. Nos. 20030199441 and 20050282737 teach medicaments for treating or preventing fibrotic diseases. They describe application of a (poly) peptide with antifibrotic activity, comprising at least one N-terminal procollagen (III) propeptide and a C-terminal procollagen (III) propeptide, or a fragment of the (poly) peptide.","According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method of promoting wound healing, treating fibrosis and\/or promoting angiogenesis comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a procollagen, thereby promoting wound healing, treating fibrosis and\/or promoting angiogenesis in the subject.","According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided use of a procollagen for promoting wound healing, treating fibrosis and\/or promoting angiogenesis.","According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided an article of manufacture comprising a packaging material which packages as active ingredients procollagen and an agent for promoting wound healing, treating fibrosis and\/or promoting angiogenesis.","According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient procollagen and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method of purifying procollagen, the method comprising:","(a) providing a procollagen preparation; and","(b) purifying the procollagen from the procollagen preparation.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the purifying is effected by a method selected from the group consisting of, gel filtration, salting-out and anion exchange chromatography.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the packaging material comprises at least two separate containers separately packaging the procollagen and the agent for promoting wound healing and\/or treating fibrosis.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the article of manufacture of, further comprises instructions for use in promoting wound healing and\/or treating fibrosis.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the administering is effected into a tissue area which comprises the wound or a fibrotic tissue.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the administering is effected prior to fibroblast recruitment to the wound.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the procollagen comprises human procollagen.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the procollagen is derived from Type I or Type III collagen.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the procollagen is produced in plant cells.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the procollagen is degradable by collagenase.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the wound is related to a fibrotic condition selected from the group consisting of systemic or localized scleroderma, liver fibrosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis, veno-occlusive disease, idiopathic interstitial fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, acute pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, perimuscular fibrosis, pericentral fibrosis, dermatofibroma, kidney fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, keloids, hypertrophic scars, joint adhesions, arthrosis, myelofibrosis, corneal scaring, cystic fibrosis, muscular fibrosis, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, esophageal stricture, retroabdominal scaring, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atherosclerotic alterations, pulmonary hypertension, angiopathy of the arteries and veins, aneurysms of large vessels or are induced or initiated by scar revisions, plastic surgeries, glaucoma, cataract fibrosis, corneal scaring, graft vs. host disease, tendon surgery, nerve entrapment, Dupuytren's contracture, OB\/GYN adhesions, pelvic adhesions, peridural fibrosis, diseases of the thyroid gland or the parathyroids, metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma and restenosis.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the wound is an acute wound.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the wound is a chronic wound.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the wound is inflicted by diabetes.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the wound is selected from the group consisting of an ulcer, a burn and a surgical wound.","According to some embodiments of the invention, the procollagen comprises monomeric procollagen.","Unless otherwise defined, all technical and\/or scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments of the invention, exemplary methods and\/or materials are described below. In case of conflict, the patent specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and are not intended to be necessarily limiting.","The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to compositions and methods for use in wound healing and treatment of fibrosis.","It is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.","Although the formation of collagen fibrils is essential to morphogenesis and to healing of wounds and bone fractures in the adult, excessive formation of fibrous collagenous ECM causes much morbidity in the general population. These conditions include keloids (excessive skin scarring), surgical adhesions, and deep-seated fibroses of organs including lungs, liver and kidneys. The deep-seated fibroses are particularly ominous, as the replacement of parenchymal tissue by scar tissue composed essentially of fibrous collagenous ECM destroys organ function.","Whilst reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors discovered that in sharp contrast to fibrillar collagen, procollagen, as well as acid-soluble atelocollagen or telopeptide-containing collagen isolated by recombinant techniques or from animal tissues can be advantageously used to promote wound healing and prevent scar formation.","Procollagen, as compared to collagen is a nonfibrous, highly soluble substance due to the presence of the C- and N-terminal extensions, herein termed propeptides. Provision of procollagen early in the wound healing process, prior to massive recruitment of fibroblasts provides a readily available soluble substrate to collagenase already present in the wound site resulting in the production of chemotactic collagen fragments, which in turn recruits fibroblasts enhancing the healing process.","Furthermore, procollagen added to the wound site should be readily recognized by natural wound healing elements such as C-propeptide proteinase and N-propeptide proteinase, yielding telopeptide-containing collagen. Telopeptide-containing collagen can be readily incorporated into tissues by natural tissue forming mechanisms which require the presence of the telopeptide region to generate correctly organized collagen deposits. Telopeptide-containing collagen produced by natural elements in the wounded tissue may form tissues with a fiber orientation more closely resembling intact tissues and thus prevent or reduce scar tissue formation. In addition, the released N- and C-propeptides may serve to regulate de-novo synthesis of procollagen thereby preventing fibrosis and scarring.","Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of promoting wound healing. The method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a procollagen, thereby promoting wound healing in the subject.","The term \u201cwound\u201d as used herein refers broadly to injuries to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone and deep sited organs or connective tissue, initiated in any one of a variety of ways (e.g., pressure sores from extended bed rest, trauma-induced wounds, surgery-related wounds and the like) and with varying characteristics.","As used herein, \u201cwound healing\u201d or \u201ctissue regeneration\u201d refers to the reconstitution of a functional tissue (e.g., skin tissue, bone tissue or mucouos membrane), with minimal or complete absence of fibrous tissue capable of compromising tissue functionality.","Examples of wounds which are the subject of the present teachings include, but are not limited to, bruises, scrapes, burn wounds, sunburn wounds, incisional wounds, excisional wounds, surgical wounds, necrotizing fascitis, ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers, aphthous ulcers, scars, alopecia greata, dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, berloque dermatitis, diaper dermatitis, dyshidrotic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, erythema, warts, anal warts, angioma, cherry angioma, athlete's foot, atypical moles, basal cell carcinoma, Bateman's purpura, bullous pemphigoid, candida, chondrodermatitis helicis, Clark's nevus, cold sores, condylomata, cysts, Darier's disease, dermatofibroma, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, nummular eczema, atopic eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, hand eczema, Multiforme Erythema Nodosum, Fordyce's Condition, Folliculitis Keloidalis Nuchae, Folliculitis, Granuloma Annulare, Grover's Disease, heat rash, herpes simplex, herpes zoster (shingles), Hidradenitis Suppurativa, Hives, Hyperhidrosis, Ichthyosis, Impetigo, Keratosis Pilaris, Keloids, Keratoacanthoma, Lichen Planus, Lichen Planus Like Keratosis, Lichen Simplex Chronicus, Lichen Sclerosus, Lymphomatoid Papulosis, Lupus of the Skin, Lyme Disease, Lichen Striatus, Myxoid Cysts, Mycosis Fungoides, Molluscum Contagiosum, Moles, Nail Fungus, Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum, Nummular Dermatitis, Onychoschizia, Onychomycosis, Pityriasis Lichenoides, Pityriasis Rosea, Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris, Plantar Warts, Poison Ivy, Poison Oak, Pompholyx, Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, Pruritus Ani and Pityriasis Alba.","Wounds are typically classified into one of four grades depending on the depth of the wound: (i) Grade I: wounds limited to the epithelium; (ii) Grade II: wounds extending into the dermis; (iii) Grade III: wounds extending into the subcutaneous tissue; and (iv) Grade IV, also known as full-thickness wounds: wounds wherein bones are exposed (e.g., a bony pressure point such as the greater trochanter or the sacrum).","The term \u201cpartial thickness wound\u201d used herein refers to wounds that encompass Grades I-III; examples of partial thickness wounds include burn wounds, pressure sores, venous stasis ulcers, and diabetic ulcers.","The term \u201cfull thickness wound\u201d used herein is meant to include both Grade III and Grade IV wounds.","The term \u201cchronic wound\u201d used herein refers to a wound that has stalled and that has not healed within thirty days.","As mentioned, the procollagen of the present invention may be useful for treating wounds in the bone. It will be appreciated however that the procollagen may also be useful for treating other bone disorders including, but not limited to osteoporosis (including postmenopausal osteoporosis, male and female senile osteoporosis and corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis), osteoarthritis, Paget's disease, osteomalacia, prolonged bed rest, chronic disuse of a limb, anorexia, microgravity, exogenous and endogenous gonadal insufficiency, bone fracture, non-union, defect, prosthesis implantation and the like.","As explained in detail in the background section, formation of fibrotic tissue is an integral part of wound healing. However, in some cases during the healing process or in patients with fibrotic conditions or diseases, collagen production may be qualitatively altered or mislocalized to the extracellular space. In such diseases, the fibrotic tissue becomes rigid, firm and nonelastic.","Thus, according to further embodiments of this aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating fibrosis.","As used herein, the term \u201ctreating\u201d includes abrogating, substantially inhibiting, slowing or reversing the progression of a condition, substantially ameliorating clinical or aesthetical symptoms of a condition or substantially preventing the appearance of clinical or aesthetical symptoms of a condition.","As used herein, the phrase \u201cmedical conditions associated with fibrosis\u201d refers to medical conditions which result from fibrosis or in which fibrosis occurred during the progression of the disease or syndrome.","Fibrotic diseases are induced or initiated by scar revisions, plastic surgeries, glaucoma, cataract fibrosis, corneal scaring, graft vs. host disease, tendon surgery, nerve entrapment, Dupuytren's contracture, OB\/GYN adhesions, pelvic adhesions, infertility, peridural fibrosis, diseases of the thyroid gland or the parathyroids, metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, or restenoses.","Specific examples of medical conditions associated with fibrosis include, but are not limited to, systemic or localized scleroderma, liver fibrosis of various etiologies, alcoholic cirrhosis, e.g. alcoholic liver cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis of viral or other origin, veno-occlusive disease, idiopathic interstitial fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, acute pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, perimuscular fibrosis, pericentral fibrosis, dermatofibroma, kidney fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, keloids, hypertrophic scars, joint adhesions, arthrosis, myelofibrosis, corneal scaring, cystic fibrosis, muscular fibrosis, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, esophageal stricture, retroabdominal scaring, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atherosclerotic alterations, pulmonary hypertension, angiopathy of the arteries and veins, aneurysms of large vessels.","The procollagen of the present invention may also be useful for promoting angiogenesis (e.g. at a site of a wound, during tissue remodeling, following ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease and gastrointestinal lesions).","The term \u201cangiogenesis\u201d as used herein, refers to the de novo formation of vessels such as that arising from vasculogenesis as well as those arising from branching and sprouting of existing vessels, capillaries and venules.","The term \u201cprocollagen\u201d as used herein, refers to a collagen molecule (e.g. human) that comprises either an N-terminal propeptide, a C-terminal propeptide or both. Exemplary human procollagen amino acid sequences are set forth by SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 7, 8 and 12 and 13.","Procollagen may comprise polypeptides of any fibril-forming collagens (types I, II, III, V, and XI), networks forming collagens (types IV, VIII, and X), collagens associated with fibril surfaces (types IX, XII, and XIV), collagens which occur as transmembrane proteins (types XIII and XVII), or collagens which form 11-nm periodic beaded filaments (type VI). According to embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, the procollagen comprises an alpha 1 and\/or 2 chain of type I collagen {e.g., [\u03b1(I)]\u03b1(I); [\u03b1(I)]3)} or collagen (III) homotrimers [\u03b1(III)]3","According to some embodiments of this aspect of the present invention, the procollagen is provided in a monomeric form (due to steric hindrance that the propeptides form, and as such is an intrinsic property of the procollagen molecule).","Although the use of collagenase-catalyzed procollagen fragments is advantageous as a source for signaling, application of genetically modified forms of procollagen may be preferred when attempting to recruit fibroblasts to a particular tissue or to establish functional tissue architecture. More specifically, collagenase-resistant collagens and the like may be preferred for such purposes [Wu et al., Proc Natl. Acad Sci, Vol. 87, p. 5888-5892, 1990].","The recombinant human procollagen may be expressed in any cell, including but not limited to prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria), plant cells and other eukaryotic cells such as yeast and fungus, as long as the procollagen is not subject to the activity of N and\/or C proteinases.","Recombinant synthesis of procollagen in yeast has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,859, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Recombinant synthesis of procollagen in plants has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,617,431, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Plants in which the human procollagen may be produced (i.e. expressed) may be any lower (e.g. moss and algae) or higher (vascular) plant, and can include tissues or isolated cells and extracts thereof (e.g., of a cell suspension). Preferred plants are those which are capable of accumulating large amounts of collagen chains, collagen and\/or the processing enzymes described herein below. Such plants may also be selected according to their resistance to stress conditions and the ease at which expressed components or assembled collagen can be extracted. Examples of plants in which human procollagen may be expressed include, but are not limited to tobacco, maize, alfalfa, rice, potato, soybean, tomato, wheat, barley, canola, carrot, lettuce and cotton.","Production of recombinant human procollagen is typically effected by stable or transient transformation with an exogenous polynucleotide sequence encoding human procollagen.","Exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding human procollagen are set forth by SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4.","The stability of the triple-helical structure of collagen requires the hydroxylation of prolines by the prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H) enzyme to form hydroxyproline residues within the collagen chain. Although plants are capable of synthesizing hydroxyproline-containing proteins, the prolyl hydroxylase responsible for synthesis of hydroxyproline in plant cells exhibits relatively loose substrate sequence specificity as compared with mammalian P4H and thus, production of collagen with hydroxyproline only at the Y position of Gly-X-Y triplets requires co-expression of collagen and human or mammalian P4H genes.","Thus, according to one embodiment, the procollagen is expressed in a subcellular compartment of a plant that is devoid of endogenous P4H activity so as to avoid incorrect hydroxylation thereof. As is used herein, the phrase \u201csubcellular compartment devoid of endogenous P4H activity\u201d refers to any compartmentalized region of the cell which does not include plant P4H or an enzyme having plant-like P4H activity. According to one embodiment, the subcellular compartment is a vacuole.","Accumulation of the expressed procollagen in a subcellular compartment devoid of endogenous P4H activity can be effected via any one of several approaches.","For example, the expressed procollagen can include a signal sequence for targeting the expressed protein to a subcellular compartment such as the apoplast or an organelle (e.g. chloroplast). Examples of suitable signal sequences include the chloroplast transit peptide (included in Swiss-Prot entry P07689, amino acids 1-57, SEQ ID NO: 10) and the Mitochondrion transit peptide (included in Swiss-Prot entry P46643, amino acids 1-28, SEQ ID NO: 11).","Alternatively, the sequence of the procollagen can be modified in a way which alters the cellular localization of the procollagen when expressed in plants.","Some embodiments of the present invention therefore contemplate genetically modified cells co-expressing both human procollagen and a P4H, capable of correctly hydroxylating the procollagen alpha chain(s) [i.e. hydroxylating only the proline (Y) position of the Gly-X-Y triplets]. P4H is an enzyme composed of two subunits, alpha and beta as set forth in Genbank Nos. P07237 and P13674. Both are needed to form an active enzyme while the beta subunit also possesses chaperon and protein disulfide isomerase function.","The P4H expressed by the genetically modified cells of the present invention is preferably a human P4H which is encoded by, for example, SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6. In addition, P4H mutants which exhibit enhanced substrate specificity, or P4H homologues can also be used. A suitable P4H homologue is exemplified by an oxidoreductase identified by NCBI accession NP179363.","Since P4H is required to co-accumulate with the expressed procollagen chain, the coding sequence thereof is preferably modified accordingly (e.g. by addition or deletion of signal sequences such as for vacuolar targeting).","In mammalian cells, collagen is also modified by Lysyl hydroxylase, galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase. These enzymes sequentially modify lysyl residues at specific positions to hydroxylysyl, galactosylhydroxylysyl and glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysyl residues. A single human enzyme, Lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3), as set forth in Genbank No. 060568, can catalyze all three consecutive steps in hydroxylysine linked carbohydrate formation [Wang et al. Matrix Biol. 2002 November; 21(7):559-66].","Thus, the genetically modified cells of the present invention may also express mammalian LH3. An LH3-encoding sequence such as that set forth by SEQ ID NO: 9 can be used for such purposes.","The procollagen(s) and modifying enzymes described above can be expressed from a stably integrated or a transiently expressed nucleic acid construct which includes polynucleotide sequences encoding the procollagen alpha chains and\/or modifying enzymes (e.g. P4H and LH3) positioned under the transcriptional control of functional promoters. Such a nucleic acid construct (also termed herein as an expression construct) can be configured for expression throughout the whole organism e.g. plant, defined tissues or defined cells, or at defined developmental stages of the organism. Such a construct may also include selection markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance), enhancer elements and an origin of replication for bacterial replication.","It will be appreciated that constructs including two expressible inserts (e.g. two alpha procollagen chain types, or an alpha chain and P4H) preferably include an individual promoter for each insert, or alternatively such constructs can express a single transcript chimera including both insert sequences from a single promoter. In such a case, the chimeric transcript may include an IRES sequence between the two insert sequences such that the downstream insert can be translated therefrom.","Numerous functional expression promoters and enhancers which can be either tissue specific, developmentally specific, constitutive or inducible can be utilized by the constructs of the present invention, some examples are provided hereinunder.","As used herein in the specification, the phrase \u201cplant promoter\u201d or \u201cpromoter\u201d includes a promoter which can direct gene expression in cells (including DNA containing organelles) of plants, fungus and yeast. Such a promoter can be derived from plant, bacterial, viral, fungal or animal origin. Such a promoter can be constitutive, i.e., capable of directing high levels of gene expression in a plurality of tissues, tissue-specific, i.e., capable of directing gene expression in a particular tissue or tissues, inducible, i.e., capable of directing gene expression under a stimulus, or chimeric, i.e., formed of portions of at least two different promoters.","Thus, the plant promoter employed can be a constitutive promoter, a tissue-specific promoter, an inducible promoter or a chimeric promoter.","Examples of constitutive promoters include, without being limited to, CaMV35S and CaMV19S promoters, FMV34S promoter, sugarcane bacilliform badnavirus promoter, CsVMV promoter, ACT2\/ACT8 actin promoter, ubiquitin UBQ1 promoter, barley leaf thionin BTH6 promoter, and rice actin promoter.","Examples of tissue-specific promoters include, without being limited to, bean phaseolin storage protein promoter, DLEC promoter, PHS promoter, zein storage protein promoter, conglutin gamma promoter from soybean, AT2S1 gene promoter, ACT11 actin promoter from , napA promoter from and potato patatin gene promoter.","The inducible promoter is a promoter induced by a specific stimulus such as stress conditions comprising, for example, light, temperature, chemicals, drought, high salinity, osmotic shock, oxidative conditions or pathogenic-related stress and include, without being limited to, the light-inducible promoter derived from the pea rbcS gene, the promoter from the alfalfa rbcS gene, the promoters DRE, MYC and MYB active in drought; the promoters INT, INPS, prxEa, Ha hsp17.7G4 and RD21 active in high salinity and osmotic stress, and the promoters hsr203J and str246C active in pathogenic stress.","The promoter utilized in the present invention should preferably be a strong constitutive promoter such that overexpression of the construct inserts is effected following transformation.","It will be appreciated that any of the construct types used in the present invention can be co-transformed into the same cells using same or different selection markers in each construct type. Alternatively the first construct type can be introduced into a first organism e.g. plant while the second construct type can be introduced into a second isogenic plant, following which the transgenic plants resultant therefrom can be crossed and the progeny selected for double transformants. Further self-crosses of such progeny can be employed to generate lines homozygous for both constructs.","A number of vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters can be used for transforming yeast cells.

Alternatively, vectors which promote integration of foreign DNA sequences into the yeast chromosome can be used.","There are various methods of introducing nucleic acid constructs into both monocotyledonous and dicotyledenous plants (Potrykus, I., Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol., Plant. Mol. Biol. (1991) 42:205-225; Shimamoto et al., Nature (1989) 338:274-276). Such methods rely on either stable integration of the nucleic acid construct or a portion thereof into the genome of the plant, or on transient expression of the nucleic acid construct in which case these sequences are not inherited by progeny of the plant.","In addition, several methods exist in which a nucleic acid construct can be directly introduced into the DNA of a DNA-containing organelle such as a chloroplast.","There are two principle methods of effecting stable genomic integration of exogenous sequences such as those included within the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention into plant genomes:","(i) -mediated gene transfer: Klee et al.

USA (1986) 83:715-719.","The system includes the use of plasmid vectors that contain defined DNA segments that integrate into the plant genomic DNA. Methods of inoculation of the plant tissue vary depending upon the plant species and the delivery system. A widely used approach is the leaf disc procedure which can be performed with any tissue explant that provides a good source for initiation of whole plant differentiation (Horsch et al. in Plant Molecular Biology Manual A5, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht (1988) p. 1-9). A supplementary approach employs the delivery system in combination with vacuum infiltration. The system is especially viable in the creation of transgenic dicotyledenous plants.","There are various methods of direct DNA transfer into plant cells. In electroporation, protoplasts are briefly exposed to a strong electric field. In microinjection, the DNA is mechanically injected directly into the cells using very small micropipettes. In microparticle bombardment, the DNA is adsorbed on microprojectiles such as magnesium sulfate crystals, tungsten particles or gold particles, and the microprojectiles are physically accelerated into cells or plant tissues.","Following transformation plant propagation is exercised. The most common method of plant propagation is by seed. Regeneration by seed propagation, however, has the deficiency that due to heterozygosity there is a lack of uniformity in the crop, since seeds are produced by plants according to the genetic variances governed by Mendelian rules. Basically, each seed is genetically different and each will grow with its own specific traits. Therefore, it is preferred that the transformed plant be produced such that the regenerated plant has the identical traits and characteristics of the parent transgenic plant. Therefore, it is preferred that the transformed plant be regenerated by micropropagation which provides a rapid, consistent reproduction of the transformed plants.","Transient expression methods which can be utilized for transiently expressing the isolated nucleic acid included within the nucleic acid construct of the present invention include, but are not limited to, microinjection and bombardment as described above but under conditions which favor transient expression, and viral mediated expression wherein a packaged or unpackaged recombinant virus vector including the nucleic acid construct is utilized to infect plant tissues or cells such that a propagating recombinant virus established therein expresses the non-viral nucleic acid sequence.","Viruses that have been shown to be useful for the transformation of plant hosts include CaMV, TMV and BV. Transformation of plants using plant viruses is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,237 (BGV), EP-A 67,553 (TMV), Japanese Published Application No. 63-14693 (TMV), EPA 194,809 (BV), EPA 278,667 (BV); and Gluzman, Y. et al., Communications in Molecular Biology: Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, pp. 172-189 (1988). Pseudovirus particles for use in expressing foreign DNA in many hosts, including plants, is described in WO 87\/06261.","Construction of plant RNA viruses for the introduction and expression of non-viral exogenous nucleic acid sequences in plants is demonstrated by the above references as well as by Dawson, W. O. et al., Virology (1989) 172:285-292; Takamatsu et al. EMBO J. (1987) 6:307-311; French et al. Science (1986) 231:1294-1297; and Takamatsu et al. FEBS Letters (1990) 269:73-76.","When the virus is a DNA virus, the constructions can be made to the virus itself. Alternatively, the virus can first be cloned into a bacterial plasmid for ease of constructing the desired viral vector with the foreign DNA. The virus can then be excised from the plasmid. If the virus is a DNA virus, a bacterial origin of replication can be attached to the viral DNA, which is then replicated by the bacteria. Transcription and translation of this DNA will produce the coat protein which will encapsidate the viral DNA. If the virus is an RNA virus, the virus is generally cloned as a cDNA and inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is then used to make all of the constructions. The RNA virus is then produced by transcribing the viral sequence of the plasmid and translation of the viral genes to produce the coat protein(s) which encapsidate the viral RNA.","Construction of plant RNA viruses for the introduction and expression in plants of non-viral exogenous nucleic acid sequences such as those included in the construct of the present invention is demonstrated by the above references as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,931.","A technique for introducing exogenous nucleic acid sequences to the genome of the chloroplasts is known. This technique involves the procedures as described below. First, the exogenous nucleic acid is introduced via particle bombardment into the cells with the aim of introducing at least one exogenous nucleic acid molecule into the chloroplasts. The exogenous nucleic acid is selected such that it is integratable into the chloroplast's genome via homologous recombination which is readily effected by enzymes inherent to the chloroplast. To this end, the exogenous nucleic acid includes, in addition to a gene of interest, at least one nucleic acid stretch which is derived from the chloroplast's genome. In addition, the exogenous nucleic acid includes a selectable marker, which serves by sequential selection procedures to ascertain that all or substantially all of the copies of the chloroplast genomes following such selection include the exogenous nucleic acid. Further details relating to this technique are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,945,050; and 5,693,507 which are incorporated herein by reference. A polypeptide can thus be produced by the protein expression system of the chloroplast and become integrated into the chloroplast's inner membrane.","Regardless of the technique used for transformation, once procollagen-expressing progeny are identified, such plants are further cultivated under conditions which maximize expression thereof. Progeny resulting from transformed plants can be selected, by verifying presence of exogenous mRNA and\/or polypeptides by using nucleic acid or protein probes (e.g. antibodies). The latter approach enables localization of the expressed polypeptide components (by for example, probing fractionated plants extracts) and thus also verifies a potential for correct processing and assembly.","Following cultivation of such plants, the procollagen is typically harvested. Plant tissues\/cells are preferably harvested at maturity, and the procollagen molecules are isolated using any biochemical method known in the art.","Thus, embodiments of the present invention further provide for a method of purifying procollagen.","The method comprising providing procollagen preparation and purifying the procollagen.","Procollagen may be generated using any method known in the art (for example those described above).","Procollagen may be fully purified or partially purified using any protein purification technique known in the art. These methods are typically based on size, charge or binding affinity purification.","According to one embodiment, the procollagen is comprised in a procollagen-containing composition, in which at least 0.1%, at least 0.25%, at least 0.5%, at least 1%, at least 2.5%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 99% or 100% is procollagen. Other components comprised in the procollagen composition may include but are not limited to collagen, hyaluronic acid, alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, oxidized cellulose, cellulose whiskers, and starch.","As used herein, \u201cpurifying\u201d refers to the isolation of the protein from its natural environment or site of accumulation within the recombinant host. Separation from small molecules is typically effected by dialysis such as using cellulose membranes. Gel-filtration chromatorgraphy is typically used as a more discriminative technique. Alternatively or additionally, salting-out is used, such as with ammonium sulfate which is typically used for protein purification e.g., to precipitate fibrinogen. Yet alternatively or additionally, ion exchange chromatography is used to separate procollagen on the basis of net charge. Affinity chromatography is another powerful approach for isolation of proteins of interest. More specifically, antibodies can be used or affinity-binding methods based on the protein's natural attractive forces to certain chemical groups.","Exemplary methods of purifying or semi-purifying procollagen of the present invention are described in detail in the Examples section which follows.","Regardless of the method of production, once the procollagen is at hand it can be administered to the subject per se or in a pharmaceutical composition.","As used herein, a \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a preparation of the active ingredients described herein with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients.

However, the present invention also envisages administering the procollagen at any other stage of healing.","For any preparation used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. In addition, a dose can be formulated in tissue culture systems or in animal models to achieve a desired concentration or titer. Animal models may be used in order to establish criteria for administration. For example, a diabetic rat or mouse wound model may be used [Galeano et al., Diabetes. (2004) 53(9):2509-17].

Detailed protcols of how the procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated into collagen matrices are provided in Example 2, herein below.","The procollagen of the invention may be included in biodegradable acellular matrix components. An acellular matrix component generally fulfils a structural role. For example, it may fill in a defect, hole, space or cavity in tissue and provide an environment in which injected or implanted cells can adhere to the matrix or surrounding tissue and grow and produce other factors (e.g., chemotactic factors) resulting from the growth of new tissue. In many instances, the gap-filling function of the matrix is temporary and only lasts until the implanted and\/or host cells migrate into the area and form new tissue. Preferably, the acellular matrix is biodegradable. The matrix is preferably a solid or semi-solid substance that is insoluble under physiological conditions. Such compositions are suitable for injection or implantation into a subject to repair tissue that has degenerated.","The term \u201cbiodegradable\u201d as used herein refers to a composition that is not biologically harmful and can be chemically degraded or decomposed by natural effectors (e.g., weather, soil bacteria, plants, or animals). Examples of matrices that can be used in the present invention include, without limitation, acellular matrices containing autologous and non-autologous proteins, and acellular matrices containing biodegradable polymers.","The procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated into any of a number of biodegradable acellular matrices containing non-autologous proteins. Examples of biodegradable acellular matrices include matrices containing any type of collagen (e.g., bovine, porcine, human, or bio-engineered collagen), or any type of collagen with glycosaminoglycans (GAG) cross-linked with, for example, glutaraldehyde. Matrices containing collagen include, without limitation, absorbable collagen sponges, collagen membranes and bone spongiosa. Useful types of collagen include, for example, bovine collagen, porcine collagen, marine collagen, human cadaver collagen bioengineered collagen, and autologous human collagen.","Absorbable collagen sponges can be purchased from, for example, Sulzer Calcitek, Inc. (Carlsbad, Calif.). These collagen sponge dressings, sold under the names COLLATAPE\u2122, COLLACOTE\u2122 and COLLAPLUG\u2122 are made from cross-linked collagen extracted from bovine deep flexor (Achilles) tendon, and GAG. These products are soft, pliable, nonfriable, and non-pyrogenic. Greater than 90% of a collagen sponge typically consists of open pores.","The biodegradable acellular matrices to which procollagen may be incorporated may contain collagen (e.g., bovine or porcine collagen type I) formed into, for example, a thin membrane. One such membrane is manufactured by Sulzer Calcitek and is marketed as BIOMEND\u2122. Another such membranous matrix is marketed as BIO-GIDE\u2122 by Geistlich Sohne AG (Wolhusen, Switzerland), and is made of porcine type I and type III collagen. BIO-GIDE\u2122 has a bilayer structure, with one surface that is porous and allows the ingrowth of cells, and a second surface that is dense and prevents the ingrowth of fibrous tissue.","Other suitable matrices containing collagen to which the procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated include COLLAGRAFT\u2122 manufactured by NeuCell, Inc. (Campbell, Calif.), and OSTEOSET\u2122 calcium sulfate alpha hemi-hydrate pellets sold by Wright Medical Technology (Arlington, Term.).","Biodegradable acellular matrices to which the procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated also can be made from bone spongiosa formed into granules or blocks. This material consists of animal (e.g., human, non-human primate, bovine, sheep, pig, or goat) bone from which substantially all organic material (e.g., proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small organic molecules such as vitamins and non-protein hormones) has been removed. This type of matrix is referred to herein as an \u201canorganic matrix\u201d. One such matrix, which is marketed as BIO-OSS\u2122 spongiosa granules and BIO-OSS\u2122 blocks, is manufactured by Geistlich Sohne AG. This company also manufactures a block-type matrix (BIO-OSS\u2122 collagen) that contains anorganic bone and additionally contains approximately 10% collagen fibers by weight.","Demineralized bone can be combined with the procollagen of the present invention to produce a matrix in the form of a sponge, block, or membrane. An exemplary matrix made from demineralized human bone, for example, is formed into small blocks and marketed as DYNAGRAFT\u2122 by GenSci Regeneration Laboratories, Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), TUTOPLAST\u2122 by Tutogen Medical, Inc. (Clifton, N.J.), or GRAFTON\u2122 Demineralized Bone Matrix by Osteotech, Inc. (Eatontown, N.J.). Other useful biodegradable acellular matrices to which the procollagen may be incorporated are those which contain gelatin, cat gut, anorganic bone, coral, glycosaminoglycans such as mucopolysaccharide or hyaluronic acid or hydroxyapatite, or mixtures of these substances.","In addition, synthetic polymers made from one or more monomers can be used to make biodegradable acellular matrices to which the procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated. Such synthetic polymers include, for example poly(glycolic acid), poly(lactic acid), and poly(glycolicacid)-poly(lactic acid). Synthetic polymers also can be combined with any of the above-mentioned substances to form matrices. Different polymers forming a single matrix can be in separate compartments or layers. For example, W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (Flagstaff, Ariz.) manufactures a porous biodegradable acellular matrix (GORE RESOLUT XT Regenerative Material). This matrix is composed of a synthetic bioabsorbable glycolide and trimethylene carbonate copolymer fiber into which cells can migrate, attached to an occlusive membrane that is composed of a synthetic bioabsorbable glycolide and lactide copolymer that does not permit ingrowth of cells. Other examples of suitable biodegradable matrices can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,829, for example.","It will be appreciated that the matrices to which the procollagen of the present invention is incorporated may be coated with one or more attachment molecule known in the art so as to enhance the ability of cells to attach to the biodegradable acellular matrices. These attachment molecules include natural molecules (e.g., extracellular matrix factors such as laminin and fibronectin) and synthetic molecules (e.g., peptides containing the binding sites of fibronectin and\/or laminin). Example of useful agents are, without limitation, basement membrane components, gelatin, gum Arabic, collagen types I XII, fibronectin, laminin, thrombospondin, entactin, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and mixtures thereof. Other appropriate attachment molecules include simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, asialoglycoproteins, lectins, growth factors, low density lipoproteins, heparin, poly-lysine, poly-ornithine, thrombin, vitronectin, and fibrinogen. Use of attachment molecules and methods for linking them to biodegradable acellular matrices are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,095,148.","The procollagen of the invention may also be included in biodegradable acellular filler materials (i.e., bulking agents). Such compositions may be suitable for injection into a subject in order to repair tissue that has degenerated. A filler material generally fulfils a structural function. For example, it may fill in a defect, hole, space or cavity in tissue and provide an environment in which injected cells can adhere to the surrounding tissue and grow and produce other factors (e.g., chemotactic factors) resulting from the growth of new tissue. In many instances, the gap-filling function of the filler is temporary and only lasts until the implanted and\/or host cells migrate into the area and form new tissue. Preferably the filler is biodegradable. Fillers are typically provided and used as a viscous solution or suspension.","According to one embodiment, the filler to which the procollagen is incorporated is a dermal filler.","As used herein, the term \u201cdermal filler\u201d refers to a type of tissue augmentation material which is generally used in the dermis area, such as below the epidermis or above the hypodermis, and as such may be injected subcutaneously, hypodermically or intradermally, or some combination.","Numerous types of biodegradable, acellular injectable fillers can be used together with the procollagen of the present invention. The filler can consist of autologous proteins, including any type of collagen obtained from a subject. An example of such a filler is AUTOLOGEN\u2122, formerly produced by Collagenesis Corp. (Beverly, Mass.). AUTOLOGEN\u2122 is a dispersion of autologous dermal collagen fibers from a subject, and therefore does not elicit even a minimal immune response when readministered to the subject. In order to obtain AUTOLOGEN\u2122, a specimen of tissue (e.g., dermis, placenta, or umbilical cord) is obtained from a subject and forwarded to Collagenesis Corp., where it is processed into a collagen-rich dispersion. Approximately one and a half square inches of dermal tissue can yield one cubic centimeter (cc) of AUTOLOGEN\u2122. The concentration of AUTOLOGEN\u2122 can be adjusted depending upon the amount required to correct defects or augment tissue within the subject. The concentration of AUTOLOGEN\u2122 in the dispersion can be, for example, at least about 25 mg\/L (e.g., at least about 30 mg\/L, at least about 40 mg\/L, at least about 50 mg\/L, or at least about 100 mg\/L).","An acellular injectable filler material can also contain non-autologous proteins, including any type of collagen, such as those described herein below.","An exemplary dermal filler matrix to which the procollagen may be incorporated is that manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (EVOLENCE\u2122) which includes a porcine-derived collagen, as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

ZYDERM\u2122 is prepared from bovine skin and is composed of reconstituted atelopeptide collagen in saline with a small amount of local anesthetic. ZYDERM\u2122 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,949,073. ZYPLAST\u2122 is a lightly crosslinked preparation of bovine collagen and is processed by cross-linking with 0.25% glutaraldehyde, followed by filtration and mechanical shearing through fine mesh. The methodologies involved in the preparation and clinical utilization of this material are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,640 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,117.","COSMODERM\u2122 and COSMOPLAST\u2122 are dermal fillers approved for the correction of facial wrinkles, acne scars and other soft tissue contour deficiencies, as well as for the restoration of the lip border. The collagen in COSMODERM\u2122 and COSMOPLAST\u2122 is purified from human dermal tissue that is grown under controlled conditions.","The present invention also conceives incorporating the procollagen of the present invention to microsphere-based dermal fillers such as ARTEFILL1\u2122. ARTEFILL\u2122 is a unique combination of precision filtered synthetic microspheres (20%) evenly suspended in Ultra-Purified Collagen\u2122 (80%). After ARTEFILL\u2122 is injected, the microscopic spheres stimulate the body's own natural collagen production to replace the purified collagen.

No. 5,344,452.","ISOLAGEN\u2122 is another dermal filler product to which it may be useful to incorporate the procollagen of the present invention. ISOLAGEN\u2122 (manufactured by Isolagen Inc.) comprises cultured autologous fibroblasts. This dermal filler is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,444 and 6,432,710.","HUMALLAGEN\u2122, manufactured by Albiorex International is a human collagen derived from the placenta for dermal fill injections to correct facial wrinkles. This dermal filler is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,071.","The procollagen of the present invention may also be incorporated into DERMALOGEN\u2122 (Angiotech Pharmaceuticals). This product is an injectable collagen matrix derived from human skin after removal of the non-collagenous proteins and is used as an off-the-shelf allogeneic implant material.","The procollagen of the present invention may also be incorporated into FASCIAN\u2122 (Fascian Biosystems). This is an injectable human implant material made from fascia.","Other examples of useful filler materials to which the procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated include, but are not limited to, solubilized gelatin, polyglycolic acid (e.g., solubilized polyglycolic acid or particles of polyglycolic acid), or cat gut sutures. A particular gelatin matrix implant, for example, is sold under the mark FIBRIL\u2122. This filler contains equal volumes of (1) a mixture of porcine gelatin powder and o-aminocaproic acid dispersed in a 0.9% (by volume) sodium chloride solution, and (2) an aliquot of plasma from the subject. Other substances useful as fillers include hyaluron, hyaluronic acid, restalyn, and parleane.","According to another embodiment, the procollagen of the present invention can be incoporated into a matrix for use in a spinal fusion procedure. Spinal fusion procedures are indicated in the management of spinal degenerative disc disease, a common cause of low back pain.","Thus, for example the procollagen of the present invention may be incorporated into a sponge such as INFUSE\u2122 (a sponge made from bovine Type 1 collagen), manufactured by Medtronic.

This is a synthetic epidermal layer that is biocompatible and protects the wound surface from infection. It is semi-permeable, allowing fluid and gas exchange. The inner layer of TRANSCYTE\u2122 is created by culturing human newborn foreskin-derived fibroblasts onto a silicon and nylon net. Freezing procedures destroy the fibroblasts leaving a solid product of growth factors behind, including essential human structural and provisional matrix proteins, glycosaminoglycans and growth factors known to facilitate healing. The inner layer, containing the dermal components known to promote healing of the burn, adheres quickly to the wound surface. The patient's epithelial cells proliferate and migrate across the wound resulting in rapid wound healing.","BIOBRANE\u2122 (Smith and Nephew, Netherlands) is a biosynthetic bandaging product consisting of nylon fabric partially embedded in silicon film. Collagen is chemically bound to the complex three-dimensional structure of the tri-filament thread.

Wright Medical (Memphis, Tenn.) markets a product known as GRAFTJACKET\u2122, which is manufactured by Lifecell Corporation (Branchburg, N.J.) from human cadaver skin. The skin undergoes a process that removes the epidermis and dermal cells. This process allows the body to accept the matrix and reduces the rejection response. The processing steps that yield the GRAFTJACKET\u2122 Matrix sufficiently preserve the human dermal tissue, including its native protein, collagen structure, blood vessel channels and essential biochemical composition, to allow cellular repopulation and revascularization through the body's natural healing process.","After implantation, the body's natural repair process revascularizes and repopulates the GRAFTJACKET\u2122 Matrix with cells and allows the body to convert the GRAFTJACKET\u2122 Matrix into living tissue, e.g., skin.

All the genes were N\u2032 terminally fused to a vacuolar transit signal MAHARVLLLALAVLATAAVAVASSSSFADSNPIRPVTDRAASTLA (SEQ ID NO: 14). This sequence originates from the targeting signal within the sequence encoding a plant vacuolar thiol protease (accession number P05167, GI:113603). Vacuolar-signal-fused collagen type I \u03b11 chain and collagen type I \u03b1chain were cloned in expression cassettes composed of a Chrysanthemum rbcS1 promoter and 5\u2032 UTR together with a Chrysanthemum rbcS1 3\u2032UTR and terminator (Outchkourov et al., 2003). The complete expression cassettes were cloned in a multiple cloning site of the pBINPLUS plant transformation vector (van Engelen et al., 1995, Transgenic Res. 4: 288-290).

The pellet thus formed was resuspended in buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.65) at a ratio of 20 ml buffer per gr AMS-saturated pellet. The resuspended pellets were centrifuged (13000 rpm, 10 minutes, 5\u00b0 C.) and the procollagen-containing supernatants were collected and filtered through a 12 layer gauze to eliminate large particle debris. Thereafter, the gauze-filtered supernatant was diluted five fold with 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.65) and loaded onto an anion exchange column (XK 26\/20 GE Healthcare) containing 20 ml of CaptoQ resin (GE Healthcare), and later eluted with an NaCl gradient (20 column volumes, 0-50% NaCl, flow rate 20 ml\/min). Procollagen eluted primarily in the 170-250 mM NaCl fractions. The eluted procollagen-containing fractions (, fractions 14-20) were pooled and then further purified via one of the two techniques described below. The pooled anion exchange fractions were concentrated with a 100 kDa cut-off centricone (Vivaspin, Vivascience).

Similar bands were evident in the crude extract (, lanes A) and supernatant post-centrifugation in 15% AMS (, lanes B), but were not detected in supernatants post-centrifugation in 25% AMS (, lanes C). Procollagen enrichment was clearly achieved in precipitates of the 25% AMS treatment (, lanes D), as further confirmed by SDS PAGE Instant Blue staining. Increased corresponding band intensity was demonstrated, as well as a reduction of the noncollagen, native tobacco-related bands especially those with molecular weights below 105 kDa. Thus, this added AMS-based precipitation step enriches procollagen sample purity.","Anion exchange chromatography showed that the bulk of procollagen eluted in fractions 14-24 (), equivalent to 170-250 mM NaCl, as measured by sample conductivity.

The gel filtration chromatogram () showed a resolution-defined peak eluting between 7.5-9.1 ml, before elution of the remainder of the proteins (elution peaks: 10-18 ml). Silver staining () and Western blot analyses () demonstrated significant procollagen elution in fractions 3 and 4. The <1 ml discrepancy in definition of the elution volume at which the procollagen peaked, as determined by the absorbance curves vs. gel analysis, is a standard result of the tubing volume between the detector and collecting tube. Fractions 3 and 4 were then concentrated 10-fold in a 30 kDa cut-off centricone (Vivaspin, Vivascience) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which clearly confirmed procollagen isolation at a high degree of purity ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0293","num":"0292"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"]},"Collagen is often the material of choice to act as a depot for the release of therapeutically active compounds such as bone morphogenic proteins, growth factors, antibiotics etc. [Meaney Murray M., Rice K., Wright R J, Spector M.

The formed hydrogel is concentrated to 10-20 mg\/ml by centrifugation and cast into an aluminum mold. The mold is incubated (2 hr, \u221230\u00b0 C.) and transferred to \u221280\u00b0 C. for an additional 30 minutes, followed by a 24 hour lyophilization step. The collagen matrix is then immersed (2-6 hr, 28\u00b0 C.) in a crosslinking solution containing 10-50 mM EDC prepared in 90% ethanol. Unbound EDC is washed away three times with DDW. Access to single-bound EDC molecules is quenched with a 10 mM aspartic acid solution. Following extensive washings, the sample is incubated (2 hr, \u221230\u00b0 C.) and then transferred to \u221280\u00b0 C. for an additional 30 minutes, followed by a 24 hour lyophilization step. The collagen matrix is sterilized by ethylene oxide (ETO) or gamma irradiation. Half an hour prior to matrix implantation, the matrix is immersed in a recombinant procollagen solution to allow for its absorption into the matrix. The procollagen-enriched matrix is then affixed to the wound site.","Protocol No. 2","A fibrillar matrix is assembled by mixing soluble recombinant or animal-derived collagen suspended in 10 mM HCl with recombinant procollagen at ratios (w\/w) ranging from 95:5 to 80:20 and incubation (4-16 hrs, 25-37\u00b0 C., pH 7.4).
