{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a headrest support structure, and more particularly to a headrest support structure suitably applied to a headrest supported on an upper end of a seat back.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, a headrest support structure has headrest stays projecting downward from the headrest, which a inserted into headrest supports fitted in tubular members (square pipes) buried in an upper side portion of a seat back. The headrest support structure is adapted to support the headrest stays while regulating the height of the headrest by height regulating mechanisms in the tubular members. Each of the height regulating mechanisms is formed by providing height regulating engagement portions by forming recesses in a side surface of the relative headrest stay, and providing at an upper end of the relative tubular member with a height regulating locking member retractable with respect to the height regulating engagement portions. Each of the height regulating portions is a recess provided at an upper part thereof with a flat surface perpendicular to the axis of the headrest stay, and at the part of the recess on the lower side of the same flat surface with an inclined surface extending toward an outer circumference of the headrest stay.","The height regulating locking member is given a force in a normal condition toward the headrest stay owing to a resilient member, and can be moved back from the headrest stay by pressing an operating button provided on the tubular member and thereby exerting a rearward force on the height regulating locking member. When the headrest stay in this structure is inserted downward into the relative headrest support, the height regulating locking member is engaged with any one of the plural height regulating engagement portions, and the headrest stay is thereby supported. When the operating button is pressed to disengage the height regulating locking member from the height regulating engagement portion, the user can regulate the height of the headrest to an arbitrary level.","In the headrest stay, an engagement portion formed in a reversely directed state with respect to the other engagement portions is provided below the engagement portion in the lowermost position, by which a slip-off of the headrest can be prevented. This reversely directed engagement portion is a recess provided at a lower part thereof with a flat surface perpendicular to the axis of the relative headrest stay, and at the part of the recess on the upper side of the flat surface with an inclined surface extending toward an outer circumference of the headrest stay. Therefore, when the headrest stay is pulled out upward with the headrest stay inserted in the headrest support, the height regulating locking member engages the flat surface of this engagement portion, and a slip-off of the headrest stay can be prevented.","The above-described conventional headrest support structure has the following problems. That are, the height regulating locking member is given a force in a normal condition toward the headrest stay, so that the headrest stay can be prevented from slipping off. However, this locking member is formed such that the locking member can be moved forward and rearward when the operating button is pressed. Accordingly, when a user presses this operating button, the headrest stay can be pulled out easily from the tubular member. So, the withdrawing of the headrest is attended with danger, and it is inconvenient that the headrest stay is left behind or lost.","The invention is made with the intention of providing a headrest support structure capable of solving these problems, preventing the headrest stays from slipping off from the support members, and withdrawing the headrest stays from the support members as occasion demands.","To achieve this object, an invention (1) provides a headrest support structure including:","headrest stays projecting from a headrest, each of which has a plurality of height regulating engagement portions in an outer circumference thereof so that the engagement portions are arranged in the axial direction, and a first slip-off preventing engagement portion below the height regulating engagement portions,","tubular members provided in a frame of a seat, and adapted to receive the headrest stays, which are inserted therein, and support the same,","first locking member operating units each of which is provided on an upper portion of the relative tubular member and adapted to give a force to the relative first locking member, which engages with one of the relative height regulating engagement portions and a first slip-off preventing engagement portion, toward the relative headrest stay by a first resilient member and exerts a reverse force to the first locking member by a first locking member pressing operation carried out outside, the first locking member being thereby rendered capable of being moved forward and rearward in the direction of a line of action of a force,","second slip-off preventing engagement portions each of which is provided in the headrest stay and\/or tubular member,","second locking members each of which engages with the second slip-off preventing engagement portion, and adapted to restore the shape thereof by being given a force from one side toward the other by a second resilient member or by a self-resetting action, and","engagement releasing mechanisms each of which is adapted to release the engaged condition of the second locking member and second slip-off engagement portion by exerting a reverse force on the second locking member.","According to the invention (1) formed as described above, the headrest is supported on the headrest stays, which are inserted and supported in the tubular members buried in the support members. Each of the headrest stays is selectively engaged at the first locking member with one of the plural height regulating engagement portions, and the height of the headrest can thereby be regulated to a desired level. The first locking member is given a force toward the headrest stay. Therefore, when one of the height regulating engagement portions reaches the position of the first locking member while the quantity of insertion of the headrest stay is regulated, the first locking member and the height regulating engagement portion are engaged automatically with each other, so that the headrest stay is locked. Furthermore, a reverse force can be exerted on the first locking member by the first locking member operating unit. This enables the engaged condition mentioned above to be released by pressing the first locking member operating unit, and the height of the headrest stay to be regulated again.","In the headrest stay, the first slip-off preventing engagement portion is provided on the lower side of the height regulating engagement portions, and the first locking member are urged toward the headrest stay. Therefore, when the first slip-off engagement portion reaches the position of the first locking member while the quantity of insertion of the headrest stay is regulated, the first slip-off engagement portion and first locking member are automatically engaged with each other. Therefore, even when the user merely raises the headrest stay with the intention of pulling out the headrest stay from the tubular member, the slip-off thereof can be prevented by the engagement of the first slip-off engagement portion with the first locking member. However, this engagement can be released easily when the first locking member operating unit is pressed. This invention is formed for the purpose to prevent the headrest stay from being easily pulled out, i.e., the invention is formed such that the headrest stay cannot be pulled out even when the first locking member operating unit is operated.","For the same purpose, the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member are provided. The second engagement portion are provided in either the headrest stay or tubular member, or in a combination thereof, and give a force from one to the other. Therefore, when the second slip-off preventing engagement portion reaches the position of the second locking member while the quantity of insertion of the headrest stay is regulated, the engagement portion and locking member are automatically engaged with each other. In consequence, the slip-off of the headrest stay is prevented. Moreover, since the engaged condition of the second locking member and second slip-off preventing engagement portion can be released by exerting a reverse force on the second engagement portion by engagement releasing mechanism, the slip-off of the headrest stay is not completely inhibited but the mere pressing of the first locking member operating unit does not cause the headrest stay to slip off. Accordingly, the headrest stay can be pulled out as occasion demands while preventing the headrest stay from being slipped off easily.","The headrest support structure according to the present invention can be applied to various types of headrests. The headrest support structure can be applied to, for example, a headrest using a seat back in a vehicle as a support member, and armrests of a legless chair utilized indoors. The headrest stays have only to have a structure in which the headrest stays supported in tubular members can support a headrest, and in which the headrest stays have such outer circumferential surfaces that permit the headrest stays to be inserted into the tubular members. Accordingly, it is preferable that, for example, both the tubular members and headrest stays be made cylindrical. However, the shapes of these parts are not limited. The stay portions may be made columnar. When the tubular members have square inner circumferential surfaces, the stay portions are desirably made squarely columnar and rectangularly cylindrical.","The height regulating engagement portions supports the headrest stays while retaining the quantity of insertion (height) thereof by engaging with the first locking members. Therefore, the shape of the height regulating engagement portions is not specially limited. Each of the first locking members is made of a flat member substantially perpendicular to the axis of the headrest stay, while the height regulating engagement portions are made of recesses the upper portions of which constitute flat surfaces substantially perpendicular to the axis of the headrest stay with inclined surfaces, which are directed toward the outer circumference of the headrest stay, formed on the lower side of the flat surfaces. Therefore, when the headrest stays are moved in the headrest stay withdrawing direction in this arrangement, the headrest stays are not locked up but rendered freely movable, and, when each of the headrest stays is moved down, the first locking member can be engaged with the flat surface mentioned above. This enables the regulation of the height of the headrest to be made easily.","The first slip-off engagement portion prevents the slip-off of the headrest stay by engaging with the first locking member. The shape of the first slip-off engagement portion is not specially limited. When the first locking member is made of a flat member substantially perpendicular to the axis of the headrest stay, and the first slip-off preventing engagement portion made of a recess the shape of which is vertically opposite to that of the recesses of the height regulating engagement portions are provided, this prevents the headrest stays from slipping off, and eliminates the impossibility of the headrest stays of moving in the direction of the insertion thereof into the headrest supports, so that the user can regulate the height of the headrest again. The relation between the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member is identical with that between the first slip-off preventing engagement portion and first locking member. Namely, the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member may work so as to prevent the slip-off of the headrest stay, and the shapes of the engagement portion and locking member are not limited. When the shape of the recesses is designed as mentioned above, the regulation of the height of the headrest can be made again as the prevention of the slip-off of the headrest stay is carried out. The first resilient member may work so as to exert a force to the first locking member, and the second resilient member to the second locking member. The concrete shapes of these resilient members and the materials of which these resilient members are made are not limited. These resilient members can be employed in various structures, for example, metal and plastic springs, plate springs and structures adapted to exert stress on predetermined bent portions.","An invention (2) including a concrete example of the second locking member and in accordance with the headrest support structure of the invention (1) above is provided with a second locking member which is supported such way that the second locking member can be moved forward and rearward substantially parallel to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit is moved forward and rearward, and which is formed such way that the second locking member is given a force toward the headrest stay by the second resilient member. Namely, the second locking member can be moved forward and rearward substantially parallel to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit is moved forward and rearward. Therefore, even when the second locking member and first locking member operating unit are arranged close to each other, or formed so as to move in slide contact with each other, the paths of forward and rearward movements thereof do not interfere with each other. Further, since the second locking member is given a force by the second resilient member, the exerting of the force on the second locking member is done independently of the first locking member operating unit and first locking member, the second locking member can be moved toward and away from the second slip-off preventing engagement portion independently, irrespective of the condition of the first locking member operating units. Even when the second resilient member is supported on the first locking member operating unit, an independent slip-off preventing operation can be carried out, of course, irrespective of the condition of the first locking member.","The engagement releasing mechanism works to exert a reverse force to the second locking member, and thereby allows the engaged condition of the second locking member and second slip-off preventing engagement portion to be released, and can be employed in 0various types of structures. An invention (3) including a concrete example of such structures and in accordance with the headrest support structure of the invention (2) above, in which the engagement releasing mechanism is provided with an insertion hole formed between the second locking member and tubular member, an elongated member being inserted via the insertion hole and engaged at a front end thereof with either the second resilient member or the second locking member, or a combination thereof to thereby enable a reverse force to be applied to the second locking member.","The second locking member is enclosed with the tubular member, and when the elongated member is inserted through the insertion hole from the outside, the free end of the elongated member can reach the second locking member and second resilient member. Accordingly, when the free end of this elongated member is engaged with either the second resilient member or the second locking member, or a combination thereof to cause the elongated member to be moved in the direction opposite to the direction of the line of action of the force, a reverse force (the force in the reverse direction) can be applied to the second resilient member or second locking member. When a reverse force is applied to either one of the second locking member or second resilient member, the second locking member is moved away from the second slip-off preventing engagement portion, and the engaged condition can be released.","In this embodiment, so far as the elongated member is formed to be capable of engaging at the free end thereof with either the second resilient member or the second locking member, or a combination thereof to exert a reverse force thereto, the shape of the elongated member is not specially limited. When the free end portion of the elongated member is bent, the elongated member engages various shapes of second resilient members and second locking members easily, and a preferable effect is obtained. When the elongated member of such a shape is engaged with either the second resilient member or the second locking member, a reverse force can be exerted thereon easily, whatever the second resilient member is made of a spring or a bent member of a flexible resin. When the second locking member is provided with a recess or a hole, on an edge of which the free end of the elongated member can be hung, a reverse force can be exerted easily on the second resilient member or the second locking member.","An invention (4) provides a headrest support structure in accordance with any one of the inventions (2) and (3), is which a tapering portion is provided on an inserting end of each headrest stay, the tapering portion being adapted to exert a reverse force on the second locking member during the headrest stay inserting operation and thereby retract the second locking member from an insertion path. Namely, the second locking member in a normal condition is urged toward the headrest stay. Therefore, when the headrest stay having a flat, free insertion end is inserted into the tubular member, the headrest stay interferes with the second locking member. However, when a tapering portion is provided on the free insertion end as in this invention, the headrest stay can have the second locking member retracted from the insertion path during an operation of inserting the same, so that the insertion of the headrest stay can be carried out easily.","An invention (5) provides a headrest support structure as another construction example for preventing an easy slip-off of a headrest stay, this support structure being in accordance with that of the invention (1) above, in which the headrest stay is made of a tubular member, the second slip-off preventing engagement portion including a locking hole made in a circumferential wall of the tubular member, and an engagement portion provided on an inner circumference of the tubular member so that the engagement portion is opposed to the locking hole when the headrest stay is in a position of a predetermined height, the second locking member being made of a flexible member and fitted into the interior of the tubular member as the second locking member is bent, the second locking member being inserted at a part thereof through a locking hole, which is provided in the circumferential wall of the tubular member and thereby rendered capable of engaging the engagement portion provided in an inner circumference of the tubular member.","The second locking member is of a flexible member, and the flexibility allows the locking member to work as a second resilient member. The headrest stay is formed into a tubular member, in a circumferential wall of which an engagement hole is provided. An engagement portion is provided in an inner circumferential surface of the tubular member into which the headrest stay is inserted. The second locking member is thereby provided in the interior of the headrest stay and engaged at a part thereof with the engagement portion via the locking hole. Accordingly, what should be changed in a structure like a related art headrest support structure are only the construction for providing the locking hole and engagement portion, and, when a second locking member made of another member is merely added to the resultant structure, this invention can be formed. As a result, this invention can be obtained in practice at a very low cost.","Since the second locking member is provided in the interior of the headrest stay, the engaged condition thereof cannot be changed easily from the outside thereof. An invention (6) having a construction example for releasing this engaged condition is in accordance with the headrest support structure of the invention (5) above, in which the engagement releasing mechanism is provided in a circumferential wall of the headrest stay with an insertion hole, through which a rod member bent substantially at right angles is inserted. The second locking member is pressed by a free end of the rod member in the interior of the headrest stay, and the releasing of the engaged condition is thereby made possible.","Since the second locking member is fitted in the interior of the headrest stay, the insertion hole is made in the circumferential wall of the headrest stay so that the rod member reaches the second locking member. As a result, it becomes possible to insert the rod member bent substantially at right angles into the headrest stay, to thereby press the second locking member with the free end of the rod member. In this case, since the second locking member has a flexibility and is fitted in the headrest stay, the second locking member is bent by the force to cause the engaged condition to be released. Although the structure is therefore formed so that the engaged condition cannot be released easily, a user having the will of releasing the engaged condition can release the engaged condition and pull out the headrest stay. The rod member used in this invention may have any shape as long as the same member can press the second locking member and disengage the same. The shape of the rod member is not limited.","Since the second locking member is a member separated from the headrest stay, so that this locking member is dropped off when the engaged condition is released by the above-described structure. Therefore, it is preferable to prevent the second locking member from being dropped off, and from being left in the interior of the support member of the headrest stay. An invention (7) including a concrete example of such a structure provides a headrest support structure in accordance with that of either the invention (5) or the invention (6) above, in which the portion of the headrest stay which is under the locking hole thereof is provided with a second locking hole. The second locking member is engaged with the second locking hole after the engagement of the second locking member with the former locking hole is released. The second locking member is thereby prevented from dropping off.","Namely, even when the second locking member is dropped from the locking hole, the second locking member is then engaged with the second locking hole, so that the second locking member does not fall from the headrest stay. Accordingly, the second locking member is not left in the interior of the support member in which the headrest member is supported. The headrest stay can be pulled out to the outside of the support member with the second locking member left engaged with a lower portion of the headrest stay.","The second locking member and headrest stay are connected together by the string-like member, so that, even when the engagement of the second locking member is released to cause the second locking member to fall, the second locking member is hung down from the headrest stay via the string-like member and does not fall away. Therefore, the second locking member is not left in the interior of the support member on which the headrest stay is supported, and the headrest stay can be pulled out easily to the outside of the support member.","As described above, the present invention can provide a headrest support structure capable of pulling out headrest stays from the support members as occasions demands while preventing the headrest stays from falling easily from the support members. According to the invention (2) above, a structure for moving the second locking member forward and rearward with respect to the second slip-out preventing engagement portion independently, irrespective of the condition of the first locking member, can be employed easily. According to the invention (3) above, the second locking member can be disengaged easily by using predetermined member while preventing the headrest from easily falling. According to the invention (4) above, the headrest stay can be inserted easily into the support member.","According to the invention (5) above, the invention can be formed by merely adding the second locking member of an independent member, and obtained in practice at a very low cost. According to the invention (6) above, the second locking members can be disengaged easily by using a predetermined member while preventing the headrest stay from easily falling. According to the invention (7) above, the second locking member is not left in the interior of the support member in which the headrest stay is supported. According to the invention (8) above, the second locking member is not left in the interior of the support member in which the headrest stay is supported.","The modes of embodiment of the present invention will be hereinafter described in the following order.","(1) Support Structure for Headrest Stay, (2) Height Regulating Structure, (3) First Slip-off Preventing Structure, (4) Second Slip-off Preventing Structure, (5) Second Mode of Embodiment, (6) Third Mode of Embodiment, (7) Fourth Mode of Embodiment, (8) Fifth Mode of Embodiment, (9) Sixth Mode of Embodiment, (10) Seventh Mode of Embodiment, (11) Eighth Mode of Embodiment, (12) Ninth Mode of Embodiment, and (13) Tenth Mode of Embodiment.","(1) Support Structure for Headrest Stay:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","12","10","10","21","21","20","30","30","12","12","11","30","30"]},"Each of the parallel-arranged headrest stays ,  is provided on a side surface thereof with height regulating engagement portions, a first slip-off preventing engagement portion and a second slip-off preventing engagement portion. The headrest support  into which one headrest stay  is inserted is formed as shown in , by a cylindrical portion  generally constituting the headrest support, and a first locking member operating unit  supported on an upper end of the cylindrical portion . The cylindrical portion  is provided with a vertically extending through hole , and a first locking member operating unit retaining hole opened at an upper end thereof so as to face in the right-angled direction with respect to the axis of the cylindrical portion . The first locking member operating unit  is inserted into the relative retaining hole from the right side thereof, while the headrest stay  is inserted into and retained in the through hole .  is a sectional view taken along the line A\u2014A in  and showing the condition of the first locking member operating unit  inserted into the relative retaining hole ","The first locking member operating unit  is provided with a substantially flat base member having a hole in a central portion thereof, and a button member on which a user exerts a force. The first locking member operating unit  is formed so that a first metal locking member and a second metal locking member are fixed thereto for regulating the height of the headrest and preventing a slip-off of the headrest stay respectively. The first locking member is a flat member having a projection at one longitudinal side thereof, a recess at the other longitudinal side thereof, and holes in edge portions at shorter sides thereof. The base member is provided with projections  on an upper surface thereof at the corner on the opposite side of the button member , a pair of locking members  being projected from the portions of the same upper surface which are at the rear side of the projections .","Accordingly, when the projections  are inserted into the holes of the first locking member with the projection of the first locking member disposed between the projections , the first locking member can be supported on the base member while preventing play from occurring on the first locking member . The first locking member operating unit  is inserted into the first locking member operating unit retaining hole with a first resilient member interposed between the first locking member operating unit  and headrest support . Accordingly, the first locking member operating unit  is urged in a normal condition toward the opening of the first locking member operating unit retaining hole , and the recess of the first locking member toward the same.","On the other hand, the headrest stay  is provided at one side thereof with both a plurality of height regulating engagement portions and a first slip-off preventing engagement portion arranged in the axial direction thereof as shown in . These height regulating engagement portions and first slip-off preventing engagement portion face in a rearward direction with respect to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit  is inserted into the hole . When a quantity of insertion of the headrest stay  into the headrest support  is regulated, the height regulating engagement portions and first slip-out preventing engagement portion are opposed to the recess of the first locking member . Since the recess of the first locking member is given a force toward the opening of the first locking member operating unit retaining hole , this recess engages in a normal condition the height regulating engagement portions and first slip-off preventing engagement portion when the recess faces these engagement portions , .  shows a simplified headrest stay not provided with a first slip-off preventing engagement portion.","The present invention attains the prevention of the slip-off of the headrest stay independently of the engagement of the slip-off preventing engagement portion and first locking member with each other. Namely, the headrest stay  is provided with a second slip-off engagement portion in the portion of the outer surface thereof which is on the opposite side of the height regulating engagement portions and first slip-off preventing engagement portion, to allow the second locking member and second slip-off engagement portion to engage them with each other.  is a partially cutaway top view of the first locking member operating unit . Referring to this drawing, the second locking member is a flat member formed in such a shape that an intermediate portion of one longer side of a rectangular plate and both corner portions of the other longer side thereof are cut off. An outwardly arcuate projection  is provided at an intermediate portion of the both-corner cut-off side, and a circular hole  on the inner side portion of the arcuate projection.","On the inner side of the button member of the first locking member operating unit , a second resilient member is molded so as to be integral with the first locking member operating unit. The second resilient member is projected in substantially the same plane as the base member from an inner peripheral side of a central hole of the base member at substantially right angles to the insertion direction of the first locking member operating unit , and bent at substantially 180 degrees so that the second resilient member comes to have a substantially U-shaped body. The portion of this second resilient member which is close to a free end thereof is bent, and contacts the arcuate projection .","Therefore, when the second locking member is provided in the plane of the base member with the bent portion at the free end of the second resilient member and the arcuate projection  engaged with each other, the second locking member is urged in the insertion direction of the first locking member operating unit  owing to a resilient force of the second resilient member . Accordingly, a force independent of that of the first resilient member is exerted on the second locking member , and the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member are engaged with each other by regulating the quantity of insertion of the headrest stay  with respect to the headrest support .","(2) Height Regulating Structure:","The present invention has a structure for carrying out adequate height regulating operations and slip-off preventing operations by utilizing the above-described force for urging each locking member and the shape of each engagement portion.  is a sectional view taken along the line A\u2014A in  and showing the condition of the height regulating engagement portion and first locking member engaged with each other. As shown in this drawing, each of the height regulating engagement portions is formed as a recess having at an upper part thereof a flat surface perpendicular to the axis of the headrest stay , and inclined at the part thereof which is under this flat surface toward an outer circumference of the headrest stay . The headrest stay  is inserted into the through hole and moved up. The first locking member operating unit  is moved toward the headrest stay  by a force of the first resilient member in a position in which one of the height regulating engagement portions. The first locking member is engaged with each other as shown in the drawing.","Since the height regulating engagement portions have a flat surface at the upper part thereof as mentioned above, the headrest stay  cannot further be moved down in a normal condition, so that this engaged condition is maintained. When the headrest stay  in the condition shown in  is moved up, the inclined sections provided at the lower parts of the height regulating engagement portions exert a reverse force to the first resilient member to cause the first locking member to be moved back to the opposite side of the headrest stay . Therefore, the height regulating engagement portions do not obstruct the upward movement of the headrest stay .","Even in the engaged condition shown in , it is possible for a user to press the button member and exert a reverse force to the first resilient member , and thereby move back the first locking member to the opposite side of the headrest stay . Therefore, in height adjustment, when a user lowers the headrest  after he regulates the height of the headrest  by moving upward the headrest stay  to a desired position, one of the height regulating engagement portions and first locking member are engaged with each other, so that the headrest  is locked in a position of a predetermined height. Conversely, when the headrest  is in a high position and needed to be shifted to another position, it becomes possible to regulate the position thereof again by lowering the headrest stay  again by pressing the button member . Accordingly, the position of the headrest  can be freely regulated.","(3) First Slip-off Preventing Structure:","The slip-off preventing structure includes two mechanisms, i.e. a first mechanism capable of being released easily when a user presses the button member , and a second mechanism capable of being released by using other member. The first mechanism carries out the prevention of the slip-off of the headrest stay by engaging the first slip-off preventing engagement portion and first locking member with each other.  is a sectional view taken along the line A\u2014A in  and showing the first slip-off preventing engagement portion and first locking member engaged with each other. The first slip-off preventing engagement portion is formed as a recess provided below the height regulating engagement portions , having at a lower part thereof a flat surface perpendicular to the axis of the headrest stay  as shown in the drawing, and inclined at the part thereof which is on the upper side of the flat surface toward an outer circumference of the headrest stay .","When the headrest stay  is inserted into the through hole and moved up, the first locking member operating unit  is moved toward the headrest stay , by the force of the first resilient member , into a position in which the first slip-off preventing engagement portion and first locking member are opposed to each other. Thus, the first slip-off preventing engagement portion and first locking member are engaged with each other. Since the first slip-off preventing engagement portion has a flat surface at the lower part thereof as mentioned above, the engagement portion in a normal condition cannot further move up the headrest stay , and works as a slip-off preventing member. When the headrest stay  in the condition shown in  is moved down, the inclined part, which is provided in the upper section of the first slip-off preventing engagement portion , exerts a reverse force on the first resilient member to cause the first locking member to move back to the opposite side of the headrest stay . Accordingly, even when the headrest stay  is in a slip-off preventing condition, the headrest stay  can be moved down.","(4) Second Slip-off Preventing Structure:","It is, of course, possible even in the engaged condition shown in , to move back the first locking member the opposite side to the headrest stay  by exerting a reverse force on the first resilient member through a user's operation for pressing the button member . Therefore, the user can release the slip-off preventing condition easily, so that, in this structure, the headrest  falls easily from the seat back . A second slip-off preventing structure is then provided so as to prevent the falling of the headrest  from the seat back .","In the second mechanism, a slip-off preventing operation is carried out by engaging the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member with each other.  is a sectional view taken along the line A\u2014A in  and showing the engaged condition of the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member . The second slip-off preventing engagement portion is provided in the portion of the headrest stay  which is further below and on the opposite side of the first slip-off preventing engagement portion . The shape of the recess constituting the engagement portion is identical with that of the engaging portion . When the headrest stay  is moved up with the slip-preventing engaged condition released by the first mechanism, the second locking member is moved toward the headrest stay  by a force of a second resilient member from a position in which the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member are opposed to each other. The second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member are then engaged with each other as shown in the drawing.","Since the second slip-off preventing engagement portion has a flat surface at the lower part thereof as mentioned above, the engagement portion cannot further move up the headrest stay , and works as a slip-off preventing member. Furthermore, when the headrest stay  in the condition shown in  is moved down, the inclined section provided at the upper part of the second slip-off preventing engagement portion exerts a force on the second resilient member to cause the second locking member to be moved back to the opposite side of the headrest stay . As shown in , the headrest stay  is provided at the portion of a lower end thereof which is on the same side of the second locking member with a tapering portion , by which the second locking member is moved back when the headrest stay  is inserted into the cylindrical portion . Accordingly, a free end of the headrest stay  and second locking member do not interfere with each other.","Even when in this condition the button member of the first locking member operating unit  is pressed, the first locking member operating unit cannot be moved rearward any more since a free end on the rear side of the first  locking member operating unit  contacts with an inner wall of the headrest support . Moreover, even when a user tries to pull out the button member , the button member cannot be pulled out since the first locking member and an outer circumference of the headrest stay  contacts each other. Therefore, a reverse force cannot be exerted on the second resilient member by the button member , so that the slip-off preventing condition cannot be released by the button member ","In this mode of embodiment, an engagement releasing mechanism capable of releasing by a special tool the engagement of the second locking member and second slip-off preventing engagement portion with each other is formed. In a lower portion of the first locking member operating unit , a tool inserting passage  for having a free end of the special tool reach the second locking member is provided.  is a left side view of an upper portion of the headrest support . Referring to the drawing, the tool inserting passage  has an opening a cross-sectional shape of which is substantially a combination of a part of an elliptic shape cut off in parallel with a shorter radius thereof and an elongated rectangular shape joined to the partial ellipse in parallel with the shorter radius of the ellipse. The tool inserting passage  extends substantially in the direction of insertion of the first locking member operating unit , and communicates with the through hole ","The special tool  has an elongated member a free end portion of which is bent at substantially right angles. As shown in , the member is inserted into the opening of the tool inserting passage , and it is possible to have the free end thereof reach the second locking member . As shown in the same drawing, it is possible that the free end of the member be disposed just under the hole  of the locking member with the free end of the special tool  inserted into a rear portion of the passage  so that the free end of the member contacts an outer circumferential surface of the headrest stay . Moreover, the diameter of the free end portion of the member is substantially equal to that of the hole  of the second locking member , and the hole  is provided at a lower part thereof with a tapering portion so that the diameter of the hole increases in the downward direction thereof. Accordingly, when the special tool  is moved up in the condition shown in , the free end portion of the member can be smoothly inserted into the hole .","When the special tool  is drawn in the direction opposite to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit  is inserted into the headrest stay with the free end portion of the member inserted into the hole , a reverse force is exerted on the second resilient member as shown in , and the second locking member is moved in the direction opposite to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit is inserted into the headrest stay. As a result, the engagement of the second locking member  and second slip-off preventing engagement portion with each other is released, and it becomes possible to pull out the headrest stay  in the upward direction. As a structure for smoothly inserting the member into the hole of the second locking member , various modes of structures other than that of the structure shown in  can be employed.","It is possible to employ a structure in which the free end portion of the member can be smoothly inserted into the hole  with a projection  provided on the free end of the member as shown in, for example, a sectional view of  inserted into the tool inserting passage  by the special tool  and brought into contact at the projection  with the outer circumferential surface of the headrest stay .  is a sectional view of a headrest support  employing still another structure. In the headrest support  shown in this drawing, the construction of a rear side portion of a tool inserting passage  is different from that of the corresponding passage in the above-described structure.","Namely, the tool inserting passage  extends to a rear side in the direction in which a first locking member operating unit  is inserted into a headrest stay. The passage  is provided with a projecting portion so that the passage  does not communicate with a through hole . The projecting portion can be engaged at the rearmost portion of the tool inserting passage  with the special tool  a free end portion of which is bent at right angles. When the free end of the special tool  and projecting portion are contacted each other with the outer circumferential surface of the headrest stay  and second locking member contacted each other as shown in , the free end portion of the special tool  is positioned just under the hole .","The inner diameter of the hole  is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the special tool , and this hole  is provided at a lower part thereof with a tapering portion so that an opening of the hole becomes wide. Accordingly, the hole  is formed so that the dimensional errors of each member can be absorbed. The free end portion of the special tool  can be inserted smoothly into the hole  with the second locking member and second slip-off preventing engagement portion not engaged with each other and with the outer circumferential surface of the headrest stay  and second locking member contacted each other as shown in the drawing.","In this condition, there is a small space around the second resilient member shown in the drawing. Namely, the second resilient member is not completely contracted, and can be further contracted by pulling the special tool . Although there is a little play between the outer diameter of the headrest stay  and the inner diameter of the through hole the second locking member can be moved back reliably by pulling the special tool . Therefore, the headrest stay  can be moved up and pulled out in the upward direction without causing the second locking member and second slip-out preventing engagement portion to interfere with each other.","As described above, in the second slip-off preventing structure in the present invention, the special tool  can be used with the second locking member and second slip-off preventing engagement portion engaged with each other as shown in  and . The special tool  can also be used with the same parts not engaged with each other as shown in . Various kinds of structures can be employed. Namely, no matter what condition the headrest stay  is in, the slip-off preventing condition can be released by using the special tool . As a result, a structure capable of preventing the headrest stay  from slipping off from the headrest support , and pulling out the headrest stay as occasion demands can be provided.","(5) Second Mode of Embodiment:","As described above, the present invention provides a structure in which the shape of recesses of the first slip-off preventing engagement portion and height regulating engagement portions is set suitable, the regulation of the height of the headrest and the prevention of the slip-off of the headrest stay being carried out by moving the first locking member forward and rearward with respect to these engagement portions. In this structure, the prevention of the slip-off of the headrest stay is attained by a mechanism other than this mechanism, and released by the special tool , an easy fall of the headrest  being thereby prevented. However, the mechanism for preventing such an easy fall of the headrest  is not limited to the above-described mechanism but various types of structures can be employed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 15","FIG. 15"],"b":"320","i":"d "},"The second locking member is an integral, molded member having projections ,  which extend outward from both ends of a cross-sectionally substantially U-shaped body thereof. The second locking member has a flexibility since it is made of a resin. The second locking member can be bent in the linear direction connecting the projections ,  together, in such a manner that the two projections are displaced toward and away from each other. Therefore, the projection  is a hemispherical projection extending toward the outside of the second locking member , while the projection  is a substantially square projection which extends toward the outside of the second locking member , and is provided with a tapering portion on one surface thereof.","The headrest stay  is provided with height regulating engagement portions (not shown) and a first slip-off preventing engagement portion (not shown) arranged in the axial direction of a wall thereof in the same manner as in the first mode of embodiment, and a insertion hole is provided below the slip-off preventing engagement portion . Below the insertion hole , engagement holes , ,  are provided in an opposed state. The engagement hole  is a hole with which the projection  of the second locking member is engaged, and the engagement holes ,  holes with which the projection  of the second locking member is engaged.","The part of the first locking member operating unit  which is on the side of the headrest support  is provided with a first locking member for carrying out the regulation of the height of the headrest and a first slip-off preventing operation by the height regulating engagement portion and first slip-off preventing engagement portion , and a structure relating to the first locking member is identical with that of the same member in the first mode of embodiment. However, since the second slip-off preventing operation is carried out by the second locking member , the structure of the above-mentioned second locking member is not employed, and such a space in the second embodiment that corresponds to the space, in which such parts are held in the first embodiment, is filled with a resin. Namely, as shown in , the resin is packed so that an edge thereof substantially contacts an outer circumferential surface of the headrest stay  with the first locking member and the outer circumferential surface of the headrest stay  in a contacting state.","Below a position of the insertion of the first locking member operating unit , such a cushion  for a square pipe that is provided in a headrest support  as well in a related art headrest support structure is formed. The cushion  for a square pipe is a cylindrical member of a substantially elliptic cross section the axis of which extends substantially parallel to the direction of insertion of the first locking member operating unit . The cushion  constitutes a hole communicating the outer circumferential surface of the headrest support  with the through hole . Since this cushion  for the square pipe is made of a resin, the cushion has an elastic force in its cylindrical body crushing direction. Accordingly, when the headrest support  is inserted into the square pipe  in the seat back , the headrest support  contacts an upper end surface of the square pipe  and is slightly crushed. As a result, a downward elastic force is exerted on the square pipe , so that the headrest support  can be supported without causing play to occur between the square pipe  and headrest support .","Since this cushion  for the square pipe is a communicating hole, the cushion is opened in the through hole as well, and the cushion  faces the engagement hole  in the condition in which the headrest stay  is inserted into the headrest support  by a predetermined quantity. The quantity of projection of the projection  is larger than the wall thickness of the headrest stay , and, as shown in , it is possible that the projection  passes through the engagement hole  and engages the opening of the cushion  for the square pipe which is on the side of the headrest stay .","Even when an attempt to merely pull out the headrest stay  upward is made in this engaged condition, the headrest stay cannot be moved up higher than the position shown in the drawing since an upper surface of the projection  is flat. The projection  works as a slip-off preventing member. Since the projection  is provided with a tapering portion on a lower surface thereof, a free end portion of the headrest stay  can be inserted smoothly into the through hole with the projection  of the second locking member engaged with the engagement hole  and with the projection  engaged with the engagement hole . Namely, when the headrest stay  is lowered with the free end portion thereof inserted into the through hole , the tapering portion of the projection  contacts an edge of an upper opening of the through hole , and is moved to the inner side of the headrest stay . As a result, the headrest stay  can be lowered with the projection  retracted as shown in .","When the projection  faces the opening of the cushion  for the square pipe during a downward movement of the headrest stay , the projection  self-returns as shown in , to engage the opening of the cushion  for the square pipe. In order to further move down the headrest stay , a force for retracting the projection  toward the headrest stay  is exerted thereon through an induction operation of the tapering portion to release the engagement of the projection  with the cushion  for the square pipe, and enable the headrest stay  to be moved down. Even when an attempt to move up the headrest stay  again is made at this time, the projection  and opening of the cushion  are engaged with each other, and the headrest stay  is not moved up any more unless a special tool is used.","Namely, even in this mode of embodiment, an easy fall of the headrest  is prevented. In order to carry out a disengagement operation for the purpose of pulling out the headrest stay , a special tool  is used. The insertion hole is a hole into which the special tool  is to be inserted. In this mode of embodiment, a free end of the special tool  is pressed against the second locking member in the interior of the headrest stay , and the engagement of the second locking member with the cushion  for the square pipe is thereby released.","As shown in , the special tool  has a rod type member , a part of which is bent at substantially right angles so as to enable the rod type member to be inserted from the free end portion thereof into the insertion hole . It is possible in the interior of the headrest stay  to have the free end of the rod type member reach the second locking member , and have the free end press the second locking member . When the second locking member is pressed by the free end of the rod type member , the second locking member is bent, and the projection  and projection  come close to each other to cause the projection  and engagement hole  to be disengaged from each other. Therefore, the headrest stay  becomes able to move up, thereafter and can be pulled out from the headrest support .","When the projection  and engagement hole  are disengaged from each other by the free end of the rod type member , the locking member moves down. An engagement hole  is provided below the engagement hole , and, during a lowering movement of the second locking member , the projection  engages the engagement hole  as shown in . The second locking member is made of a resin, and a bending force for opening a U-shaped portion thereof outward works thereon, so that the second locking member engages the engagement hole . As a result, the second locking member in the condition shown in  is maintained in the same condition without falling. Accordingly, the second locking member is not left in the seat back  after falling from the headrest stay .","In this mode of embodiment, the second locking member has only to be an elastic member exerting a bending force on the inner circumferential surface of the headrest stay , and is not limited to the substantial U-shape. For example, a hemispherical locking member can also be formed. The structure for disengaging the projection  and engagement hole  from each other is not limited to a structure using the above-mentioned specially shaped tool. Namely, although the cushion  for the square pipe is buried in an upper side of the seat back  if a small hole  is made as shown in  and a passage which communicates this small hole and an opening in the outer circumferential wall of the headrest support  in the cushion  for the square pipe are provided, the insertion of a free end portion of a special tool  having a bent, elongated member into the small hole  in the upper side of the seat back  enables the above-mentioned engaged condition to be released.","The hole for engaging this projection  therewith is not limited to the cushion  for the square pipe either, and the projection  may be formed so as to be engaged with a hole , which is provided in a portion of the headrest support  as shown in . A structure for preventing a fall of the second locking member  is not limited to the engagement hole , either. For example, when the second locking member and headrest stay  are connected together by a string-like member, a fall of the second locking member can be prevented by this string-like member.","(6) Third Mode of Embodiment:","Furthermore, in a minute part of the present invention, a structure different from that in the above-described modes of embodiment can also be employed. For example, various types of structures can be employed for the second resilient member.  is a sectional view of the condition in which a headrest stay is inserted into a support member in the third mode of embodiment, and  is a partially cutaway top view of a first locking member operating unit in the third mode of embodiment. In the third mode of embodiment, a spring is employed as a second resilient member, and the construction of the other parts is identical with that of the corresponding parts of the first mode of embodiment.","As shown in the drawing, a second resilient member is a spring, and an insertion member  into which the second resilient member is inserted is provided in the first locking member operating unit. The second resilient member is inserted and supported in the first locking member operating unit, and the axis thereof is set in the direction of the second locking member . Accordingly, an end portion of the second resilient member contacts the second locking member and a resilient force is exerted thereon, so that the second resilient member is urged toward the insertion direction of the first locking member . Therefore, a force independent of that of the first resilient member can also be exerted on the second locking member in this structure.","The hole  used to insert the free end portion of the special tool  thereinto is not limited to the above-mentioned circular hole, either, and the hole  may be rectangular instead as shown in . Even a rectangular hole  serves the purpose as long as the free end portion of the special tool  can be inserted thereinto. When the special tool  is pulled with the same free end portion inserted into the hole , in the direction opposite to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit  is inserted into the headrest stay, a reverse force is exerted on the second resilient member . Therefore, the second locking member is moved in the direction opposite to the direction in which the first locking member operating unit  is inserted into the headrest stay, and the second locking member and second slip-off preventing engagement portion can be disengaged from each other.","(7) Fourth Mode of Embodiment:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 24"],"b":["322","32","322","1","332","322","32","1"],"i":["d ","d","f","f ","d ","d"]},"That is, the bent portion  is bent substantially perpendicularly to a side surface of the flat body of the second locking member , and the resilient portion  is further bent substantially to the shape of the letter \u201cU\u201d, the second locking member being generally shaped as shown in . Therefore, when the second locking member is disposed in the plane of the base member with one side of the resilient portion contacted with the inner surface of the first locking member operating unit, the second locking member is urged toward the insertion direction of the first locking member operating unit  owing to the resilient force of the second elastic member . Accordingly, the second slip-off preventing engagement portion and second locking member are engaged with each other by exerting a force independent of that of the first elastic member on the second locking member , and regulating the quantity of insertion of the headrest stay  into the headrest support .","(8) Fifth Mode of Embodiment:","Another example of the second locking member - shown in  will now be described. This first locking member operating unit  is provided with the second locking member -. This second locking member - is provided with paired crescent holes of substantially analogous relation. The crescent holes (having a shape of a petal in plan) are formed so as to be engaged with paired guide pins (These guide pins are provided in different phases. Providing a pair of guide pins constitutes an example of the arrangement thereof, which enables a reliable and smooth movement of the second locking member - to be made.) provided in the first locking member operating unit . The second locking member - is moved substantially arcuately along a circumference of a headrest stay  and around the paired guide pins .

The second locking member - is provided with a second resilient member , which is brought into contact with a curved surface portion  (that is, the largely curved surface portion of the inner surface R of the locking member operating unit) in the interior of the first locking member operating unit . Accordingly, this second resilient member is moved along a curved surface portion  of the first locking member operating unit . This movement of the second resilient member is made by a force of the operating member  provided in a hole formed in the first locking member operating unit  or a releasing force, and a repellent force of the second resilient member ","The crescent holes and\/or guide pins are not limited to these examples, and there are other following examples. For example, each of the crescent holes is provided with a linear portion - with the intention of making forward and rearward movements of the second locking member - smoothly, or securing a smooth movement of the headrest stay . As shown in , a structure in which guide pins are provided in crescent holes with clearances (tolerance) left therebetween so as to allow the second locking member - to slidingly move around the headrest stay  is employed. In order to secure a reliable return of this second locking member -, it is possible to set an angle of a curved portion  as shown in , i.e., form a return slope (which will be described later); change (not shown) the repellent force and shape of, for example, the second resilient member ; provide other spring; and provide a stopper additionally. As shown in , the second locking member - is formed so as to move (turn) along the curved portion  and secure a quantity L of return eccentricity with respect to the center of the headrest stay , a reliable and smooth return of the second locking member being thereby secured. The construction of the second locking member - is not limited to that of the illustrated examples.
