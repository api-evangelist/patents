title: Image searching with recognition suggestion
abstract: Image management applications allow users to upload, modify, organize, search, and/or share images. Unfortunately, current image management applications may have separate search modes and tagging modes. Accordingly, one or more systems and/or techniques for providing a user with a seamlessly integrated search, view, and/or tag experience are disclosed herein. Search results comprising tagged images and untagged images may be provided in response to a user search query. The untagged images may be contextually relevant to features of the tagged images and/or the user search query. Tagging suggestions for untagged images may be presented that allow a user to confirm or deny a tagging suggestion for an untagged image. Additionally, confirmable thumbnails corresponding to the untagged images may be presented. A confirmable thumbnail may allow a user to confirm or deny tagging a corresponding untagged image.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Image management applications allow users to upload, modify, organize, tag, and\/or share images. In one example, a photo application may allow a user to organize, search, and tag thousands of photos in a single user interface. In another example, a social network may allow users to upload, modify, tag, and share personal photos with other users of the social network. Current image management applications may provide a specific tagging mode that allows a user to tag images (e.g., tag a person and a building within an image). To aid a user in tagging images, an image management application may provide object recognition functionality while in a tagging mode. The object recognition functionality may allow the image management application to provide tagging suggestions to users while in the tagging mode. In one example of tagging an image, a user may tag an individual, a monument, a car, a location, and\/or a variety of other object within images by assigning textual labels for the tagged objects. Tags provide contextual information about images that may be useful when organizing, search, and sharing images. For example, in response to a user searching for images of \u201cDoug\u201d, an image management application may present the user with tagged images having tags corresponding to \u201cDoug\u201d.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Among other things, one or more systems and\/or techniques for presenting search results are disclosed herein. In particular, a user search query may be received. In one example, the user search query may be received while a user is within a search\/view mode, as opposed to a tagging-centric mode of an image management application. The user search query may be a textual string or information associated with an image tile. The user search query may be matched to tagged information of images and\/or features of untagged images.","Tagged search result images corresponding to the user search query may be determined. That is, tagged images having previously tagged information matching the user search query may be determined as tagged search results images. For example, a tagged image of a building tagged \u201cThe Tower\u201d, a tagged image of an outdoor scene tagged \u201cTower\u201d, and\/or other tagged images may be determined as tagged search results images corresponding to a user search query \u201cThe Tower\u201d.","Untagged image recognition suggestions may be determined based upon untagged images corresponding to recognized features of one or more tagged search result images and\/or the user search query. It may be appreciated that an untagged image recognition suggestion may be interpreted as an untagged image contextually relevant to a user's current search. Image recognition techniques may be utilized to determine features of untagged images that are similar to features of tagged images. In this way, untagged images may be assigned features and\/or grouped into recognition suggestion groups based upon feature recognition matching. In one example, untagged images may be determined as untagged image recognition suggestions based upon untagged images having features corresponding to features of tagged search result images and\/or the user search query. In another example, untagged images within a recognition suggestion group corresponding to features of tagged search result images and\/or the user search query may be determined as untagged image recognition suggestions.","Search results comprising one or more untagged image recognition suggestions and\/or one or more tagged search result images may be presented. It may be appreciated that in one example, the search results may be presented to a user engaged in an image search\/view mode. Additionally, tagging suggestions for untagged image recognition suggestions within the search results may be presented to the user. That is, even though the user may be in a search\/view mode, the user may confirm, deny, or create tagging information for untagged images represented by untagged image recognition suggestions within the presented search results. Additionally, confirmable thumbnails may be presented to the user. A confirmable thumbnail may correspond to one or more untagged image recognition suggestions. In this way, a user may confirm, deny, or create tagging information for untagged images represented by confirmable thumbnails.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Current image management applications allow users to upload, modify, organize, search, and\/or share images (e.g., digital photos, digitally generated images, etc.). Many image management applications may provide a search\/view mode that allows a user to search and browse images. In addition, image management applications may provide a tagging mode that allows users to tag images. Unfortunately, users are not provided with a single seamless experience when search, viewing, and tagging images because there is a lack of integration between search\/view features and tagging feature. For example, a user may enjoy searching and view photos. However, the user may have to switch into a specific tagging-centric mode to perform the task of tagging images. Switching into the tagging mode may be a disruptive and intimidating experience for users who have rarely tagged images before. The task off tagging hundreds or thousands of images may be daunting to a user to a point that the user rarely tags images. It may be advantageous to provide a user with a seamless search\/view\/tag experience that provides contextually relevant tagging suggestions so that users may tag untagged images while searching and\/or viewing tagged images.","Accordingly, one or more systems and\/or techniques for presenting search results are provided herein. In particular, tagging suggestions may be provided to a user as part of a seamless user experience, such that the user may search, view, and tag images without having to venture in to a specific tagging-centric mode to tag images. This allows a user to search\/view\/tag images without changing workflow between searching\/viewing tagged images and tagging untagged images utilizing feature recognition suggestions. For example, untagged images having features relating to a search task may be presented as untagged image recognition suggestions for the user to confirm or deny. In this way, the user is presented with untagged images contextually relevant to currently searched\/viewed tagged images.","One embodiment of presenting search results is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method begins. At , a user search query is received. In one example, the user search query may be received from a user engaged with an image management application while in a non-tagging exclusive mode (e.g., a mode that allows a user to search and view tagged images, a mode that allows a user to edit images, etc.). At , tagged search result images corresponding to the user search query may be determined. It may be appreciated that one or more images may be associated with tagged information (e.g., a user tags an image as \u201cMy Vacation\u201d, a user tags a person as \u201cDoug\u201d and another person as \u201cColleen\u201d within an image, etc.). The user search query may be used to locate tagged images having tagged information corresponding to the user search query (e.g., text matching between the user search query and tagged information).","At , untagged image recognition suggestions corresponding to recognized features of one or more tagged search result images and\/or the user search query may be determined. It may be appreciated that an untagged image recognition suggestion may be interpreted as an untagged image, which may be suggested to a user for tagging. In particular, features of untagged images may be determined using feature recognition technology (e.g., facial recognition technology). In one example, untagged images may be grouped into recognition suggestion groups of untagged images having similar features. In this way, untagged images and\/or recognition suggestion groups of untagged images having features corresponding to recognized feature of tagged search result images and\/or the user search query may be retrieved as untagged image recognition suggestions. It may be appreciated that a variety of recognition techniques and\/or grouping techniques are contemplated as falling within the scope of the claimed subject matter.","At , search results comprising one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions and\/or one or more of the tagged search result images may be presented. For example, tagged images and untagged images may be presented within a single search\/view window to a user engaged in a default mode, a search mode, a view mode, and\/or modes other than a mode dedicated exclusively to tagging images. Tagging suggestions for untagged image recognition suggestions may be presented. A tagging suggestion may comprise a suggested tag label, a confirmation input, and a denial input. User input to confirm or deny a tagging suggestion may be received. If the user input confirms the tagging suggestion, then an untagged image represented by the untagged image recognition suggestions may be tagged. If the user input denies the tagging suggestion, then the untagged image recognition may be removed from the presented search results. It may be appreciated that an object recognition component and\/or technique may be trained based upon the user input (e.g., a user denying a tagging suggestion may indicate features of the corresponding untagged image recognition suggestion do not correspond to the user search query and\/or features of the tagged search result images).","It may be appreciated that tagging an untagged image recognition suggestion may be interpreted as tagging the untagged image represented by the untagged image recognition suggestion.","Confirmable thumbnails corresponding to one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions may be presented. In one example, confirmable thumbnails may be presented in paged groups comprising a subset of the untagged image recognition suggestions. For example, a search result may comprise 500 untagged image recognition suggestions. Confirmable thumbnails may be presented in paged groups of 15\/500. In this way, the user may find the task of tagging images less daunting than having the 500 images presented at one time. An untagged image of an untagged image recognition suggestion corresponding to a confirmable thumbnail may be tagged based upon receiving user confirmation of the confirmable thumbnail. In contrast, a confirmable thumbnail may be removed from the presented confirmable thumbnails and\/or a corresponding untagged image recognition suggestion may be removed from the presented search results based upon receiving a user denial for the confirmable thumbnail.","In one example, a confirmable thumbnail may comprise a rescaled\/resized version of an untagged image represented by an untagged image recognition suggestion (e.g., a zoomed in view of an individual's face, a scaled down view of an entire image). To aid in recognition and provide context of a zoomed in untagged image, an untagged image recognition suggestion corresponding to a confirmable thumbnail may be presented when a user interacts with the confirmable thumbnail. For example, the user may \u201cmouse over\u201d a confirmable thumbnail of a person's face. An untagged image from which the person's face was extracted may be presented (e.g., an untagged image of the person playing with a dog in a yard). In this way, a user may tag images based upon tagging suggestions and\/or confirmable thumbnails of untagged images contextually related to a search\/view task, while search and\/or viewing tagged images.","In another example of presenting search results, a user search query of a person's name may be received. Tagged search result images having a tagged name corresponding to the person's name may be determined. Untagged image recognition suggestions having facial features corresponding to the recognized facial features of the tagged search result images may be determined. Search results comprising one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions and\/or one or more of the tagged search results images may be presented within a single search\/view window. Tagging suggestions for the one or more untagged image recognition suggestions within the search results may be presented. Additionally, confirmable face shot thumbnails corresponding to one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions may be presented. Tagging suggestions may be presented for the confirmable fact shot thumbnails.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","218","200","202","204","210","202","214","212","214"]},"The search result component  may be configured to receive a user search query . In one example, a user may input a textual search for related images. In another example, a user may select an image tile corresponding to a tagged image as the user search query . If an image tile of a tagged image is selected, then the user search query  may be interpreted as tagged information of the tagged image. The user may refine the user search query  by limiting the search to images stored within a particular folder.","The search result component  may be configured to determine tagged search result images  corresponding to the user search query . Tagged search result images  may comprise tagged images having tagged information matching the user search query . For example, an image tagged as \u201cThe Tower\u201d may be determined as a tagged search result image where the user search query is \u201cTower\u201d.

It may be appreciated that, an untagged image recognition suggestion may relate to an untagged image having features corresponding to features of the tagged search result images  and\/or the user search query . In one example, untagged image recognition suggestions  may comprise untagged images within a recognition suggestion group having features corresponding to features of the tagged search result images  and\/or the user search query . In this way, the search result component  may determine tagged images and untagged images corresponding to the user search query .","The tagging presentation component  may be configured to present search results  comprising one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions  and\/or one or more of the tagged search result images .

The tagging presentation component  may be configured to receive user input to confirm or deny a tagging suggestion. If the user input denies the tagging suggestion, then the tagging presentation component  may remove the untagged image recognition suggestion from the presented search results. If the user input confirms the tagging suggestion, then the tagging presentation component  may tag an untagged image represented by the untagged image recognition suggestion.","The tagging presentation component  may be configured to present confirmable thumbnails corresponding to one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions . The tagging presentation component  may be configured to tag an untagged image represented by an untagged image recognition suggestion corresponding to a confirmable thumbnail based upon a user confirmation confirming the confirmable thumbnail. The tagging presentation component  may be configured to remove a confirmable thumbnail from the presented confirmable thumbnails and\/or a corresponding untagged image recognition suggestion from the presented search results based upon a user denying the confirmable thumbnail. The tagging presentation component may be configured to receive user interaction with a confirmable thumbnail. In response to the user interaction, the tagging presentation component may present an untagged image recognition suggestion corresponding to a confirmable thumbnail.","In one example of presenting confirmable thumbnails, a first set of confirmable thumbnails corresponding to one or more of the untagged image recognition suggestions may be presented. A user may deny one or more of the confirmable thumbnails within the first set of confirmable thumbnails. The tagging presentation component  may be configured to remove the one or more confirmable thumbnails based upon the user denial. Subsequently, the user may confirm the remaining confirmable thumbnails within the first set of confirmable thumbnails using a single user input (e.g., a confirm all button). The tagging presentation component  may tag the remaining confirmable thumbnails based upon the user confirmation. Because the confirmable thumbnails within first set of confirmable thumbnails were denied or confirmed, the tagging presentation component  may present a second set of confirmable thumbnails different from the first set of confirmable thumbnails.","It may be appreciated that one or more the recognition suggestions groups may be updated. In particular, a recognition suggestion group may be updated based upon an untagged image recognition suggestion and\/or a confirmable thumbnail being confirmed (tagged) or denied (removed). In one example, a user may confirm a confirmable thumbnail. An untagged image recognition suggestion corresponding to the confirmable thumbnail may be removed from a recognition suggestion group because the untagged image recognition suggestion is now tagged. In another example, a user may deny a tagging suggestion for an untagged image recognition suggestion. Because the tagging suggestion was incorrect, the untagged image recognition suggestion and\/or other related untagged images within a recognition suggestion group may be ungrouped and\/or regrouped into different recognition suggestion groups. In this way, the recognition component  may \u201clearn\u201d based upon user confirmation\/denial of tagging suggestions and\/or confirmable thumbnails.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308","306"]},"It may be appreciated that a tagged image may be tagged with more than one tag. For example, an image may have a person next to a car. The image may be tagged with a first tag \u201cDoug\u201d and a second tag \u201cSports Car X\u201d.","It may be advantageous to provide untagged images along with the tagged search result images. The untagged images may have features (e.g., visual features, textual features, and\/or other descriptive features) that may be used to compare with recognized features of tagged images. Thus, when a tagged image is returned as a tagged search result image, untagged images having similar features as the tagged image may also be returned. In this way, a user may search, view, and tag images contextually relevant to a user search query without switching into a tagging-centric mode.","It may be appreciated that an untagged image may have more than one feature. For example, an untagged image may have a first feature of a person's face and a second feature of a car body style.
