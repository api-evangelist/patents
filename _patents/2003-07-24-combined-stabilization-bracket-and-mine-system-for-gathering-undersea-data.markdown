title: Combined stabilization bracket and mine system for gathering undersea data
abstract: A combination stabilizer system and cylindrical-shaped undersea package improves validity of data collected from ambient sea by orienting the package in an upright attitude and eliminating motion or rocking due to wave action and/or sea currents. An outrigger base assembly has a flat base surface to rest on the sea floor and is provided with upper surfaces having semi-circular cross-sectional configurations to contiguously fit adjacent to round outer contours of an undersea package. The outrigger base assembly also has laterally extending outrigger portions extending the flat base surface for increased stability. First and second case clamps have curved surfaces with semi-circular cross-sectional configurations that extend above the outrigger base assembly. The first and second clamps clamp the curved surfaces and upper surfaces onto the round contours and secure the undersea package in an upright orientation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/042,842, filed Jan. 11, 2002, now abandoned, entitled \u201cAttachable stabilization Bracket for Versatile Mine System\u201d and assigned to the Government of the United States of America.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a stabilizer for a mine emulation system deployed underwater. More particularly, the stabilizer bracket of this invention can be quickly mounted on a cylindrically-shaped underwater mine emulation system to stabilize and orient it in a predetermined fixed attitude to improve the quality of gathered data.","Acoustic\/seismic, magnetic, and pressure data is collected underwater by numbers of different sensors that usually are contained in one or more housings. The housings are commonly made in cylindrical shapes to protect the sensors and interconnected processing modules from the effects of the ambient water during the long periods of time that sometimes must be spent to collect meaningful amounts of data. The housings additionally must be stable and not move since random or uncompensated motion can compromise the quality, or even the validity of the gathered data.","One technique currently used to stabilize the cylindrical-shaped housings is to put a dense, heavy weight on one side of the housing. This side that is weighted would nominally be considered the underside since the force of gravity would bring it to rest on the ocean bottom. However, because the cylindrical shape defines a curved outer surface, the housing is still prone to move, or rock due to wave action and\/or sea currents. It has been noted that noise was present in the magnetic data, and this noise was created by sea currents\/wave action rocking the housing about its cylindrical, or longitudinal axis.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an effective means that can be easily connected to a cylindrical-shaped housing to stabilize and orient it on the ocean floor.","An object of the invention is to stabilize and orient a cylindrical-shaped housing for sensors on the ocean floor.","Another object is to provide a stabilization structure for the cylindrical-shaped mine emulation system to eliminate movement caused by wave action and\/or sea currents.","Another object is to provide stabilization structure that is easily attached and removed by simple tools.","Another object is to provide a stabilization structure having an outrigger design to create a flat bottom for a cylindrical instrumentation housing to enhance its ability to remain stable in high sea states and in strong currents.","Another object is to provide a cost-effective stabilizing structure for a cylindrical housing made from materials resistant to the harsh marine environment.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the invention stabilizes a cylindrical-shaped undersea package on the sea floor. An outrigger base assembly has a flat base surface to rest on the sea floor and an upper surface having a semi-circular cross-sectional configuration to contiguously fit adjacent to round outer contours of the undersea package. The outrigger base assembly has outrigger portions to laterally extend the flat base surface. First and second case clamps have curved surfaces with semi-circular cross-sectional configurations to extend above the outrigger base assembly. The first and second clamps clamp the curved surfaces onto the round contours of the undersea package and the upper surface of the outrigger base assembly onto the round contours of the undersea package. The first and second case clamps secure the undersea package in an upright orientation and resist tendencies for motion by waves and\/or currents.","Referring to , stabilizer system  of the invention is installed on an undersea instrumentation package, for example a versatile exercise mine system (VEMS) . VEMS  is shown on the bottom, or sea floor  of a body of water  after it has been dropped or otherwise deployed such as by cable (not shown) from a surface vessel or aircraft. On sea floor  VEMS  will power-up and collect acoustic\/seismic, magnetic, and pressure data and emulate various real mines.","VEMS  can be an exercise mine, for example the elongate, cylindrical-shaped MARK  VEMS of the U.S. Navy, that is designed to be placed into the ocean and rest on the floor, where it will power up and collect acoustic\/seismic, magnetic, and pressure data and emulate various real mines. By emulating the mines, VEMS  will retrieve data from its sensors and, via software, analyze the data to determine if the mine VEMS  is emulating would have actuated from the signals received.","Heretofore, VEMS  has been internally weighted so that the force of gravity would cause one rounded contour  of its rounded, cylindrically-shaped housing  to come to rest on bottom  and tend to stay in this orientation. However, practical experience indicates that VEMS  is sensitive to wave action and\/or sea currents that push against its sides and cause it to rock back and forth on rounded contour . This rocking motion affects triaxial magnetic sensors in VEMS , since they then move relative to the earth's background magnetic field. To these sensors, the rocking motion can appear as fluctuating background noise levels (fluctuations occur at frequencies associated with the frequencies of the back and forth motions of VEMS ). This background noise level can be mistaken as emulations of a mine run by the VEMS  as a potential target, or the background noise level could mask a low level target so that VEMS  does not recognize it as a target. By stabilizing VEMS  with stabilization system , the magnetic sensors will not move, and consequently the earth's background magnetic field should appear to the sensors to be stable.","Referring also to , in accordance with this invention stabilization system  secures an outrigger base assembly  to VEMS  by a pair of stabilizing case clamps  and  wrapped around and engaging VEMS . Stabilizing case clamps  and  extend parallel with respect to one another and are longitudinally separated from each other along VEMS . Typically, stabilization system  is mounted on VEMS  in an assembly area prior to deployment by placing a flat base surface of outrigger base assembly  on a flat surface  beneath VEMS  that has been raised by an overhead crane (not shown). The overhead crane lowers VEMS  onto outrigger base assembly , and after proper orientation of VEMS  has been verified, the two stabilizing case clamps  and  are placed across the top of VEMS . Case clamps  and  are secured to outrigger base assembly  by bolts  and , respectively.  shows bolts  extending through holes  in case clamp , to engage mating threaded bores  in assembly . Although not shown, it is understood that like bolts , bolts  also extend through similar holes in clamp  to engage similar threaded bores in assembly . Tightening bolts  and  in their respective bores causes case clamps  and  and outrigger base assembly  to securely grip, or clamp onto and engage VEMS . Installation of stabilizer system  on VEMS  is now complete. Disassembly is the reverse procedure of this process of assembly.","Outrigger base assembly  has upper surfaces  being essentially semi-circular cross-sectional shaped to fit contiguously adjacent to the essentially circular cross-sectional shape of the outer contours of VEMS  and has laterally extending outrigger portions  that extend flat base surface . Stabilizing case clamps  and  extend above outrigger base assembly  between outrigger portions  to clamp VEMS  to outrigger base assembly  and securely orient VEMS  in an upright, or other fixed orientation with respect to sea floor . Stabilizing case clamps  and  do this when bolts  and  are tightened to cause a firm gripping engagement on outer contours of VEMS  along curved surfaces  and  that each has an essentially semi-circular cross-sectional shape. Thus, the orientation of VEMS  with respect to sea floor  (or the relative angle between outrigger base assembly  and VEMS  or another external reference) is fixed and does not change throughout the period of an operational deployment while data is being gathered.","The design and construction of the stabilizer system  are uncomplicated to lower construction costs. Outrigger base assembly  and stabilizer base clamps  and  can be suitably constructed of strong aluminum, stainless steel, or other materials that can handle the expected loads induced by water entry and coming to rest against bottom , and bear the weight of VEMS . The materials are chosen to be non-corrosive, or corrosion resistant so as not to be affected by salt water. Stabilizer system  is not intended to be a lifting mechanism or hard point for deployment of VEMS . Other hard points and\/or connecting structure (not shown) associated with VEMS  are used for deployment to sea floor . Outrigger base assembly  is built to be sufficiently strong to support the weight of VEMS  on sea floor  with the attached stabilizer system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["27","27","27","25","22","20","15","20","25","15","20","25","15","21","26","16","30","20","25","15","30","15","20","25","30","15","30","15","10","30","30"],"i":["a","b ","a","a","a "]},"Having the teachings of this invention in mind, different applications, modifications and alternate embodiments of this invention may be adapted. Stabilizer system  can be made in larger or smaller sizes and in a multitude of different shapes, and could be made from a wide variety of materials. In other words, the design and construction of stabilizer system  allows for accommodation of different underwater systems other than the cylindrical shape of VEMS  by substituting differently dimensioned and shaped components. Stabilizer system  of the invention can easily be removed and reinstalled if necessary, and simple tools are all that are required to perform this operation. Optionally, the reliable, uncomplicated and cost effective design of stabilizer system  can permit its non-recyclable use to stabilize undersea packages. Other modifications could be made as will be apparent to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Stabilizer system  of this invention is an effective improvement that can be readily connected or disconnected to enable its addition or removal from VEMS  without undue effort. Therefore, stabilizer system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention.
