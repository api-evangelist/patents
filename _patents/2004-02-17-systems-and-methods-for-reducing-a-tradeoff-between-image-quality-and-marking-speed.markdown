title: Systems and methods for reducing a trade-off between image quality and marking speed
abstract: To reduce the trade-off between image quality and marking speed, high-resolution data for an image is evaluated, and an output value is created based on the evaluation of the high-resolution data. The output value has a larger output spacing than the high-resolution data, and approximates an edge of a solid defined by the high-resolution data, but within an output area defined by the larger output spacing.

Field of Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods for improving marking device speed and\/or resolution.","2. Description of Related Art","A common design problem in the field of printing devices is how to increase printing speed without sacrificing image resolution or contrast. Typically, to increase the speed of a printing device, the image resolution of the printing device is lowered. This allows the print head to travel more quickly across each scan line because it does not have to eject ink or toner at as many locations along that scan line. Another conventional method for increasing the speed of a printing device is to decrease the number of times a print head must pass over the same scan line. For instance, when a conventional printing device is utilizing what is popularly called the draft mode, the print head only makes a single pass per scan line, increasing the output speed, but decreasing the image contrast due to the lower amount of ink on the page.","Conventional printing systems utilizing four-color printing (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) have approached the output speed design problem of increasing black and white printing speed by utilizing \u201cfour-color black\u201d printing. In four-color black printing, an amount of cyan, magenta, and yellow are first ejected by the print head and then covered with black. By printing cyan, magenta, and yellow under black, conventional four-color printing systems are able to increase the density of ink ejected in a single scan line pass of the print head. Because the ink is ejected in layers, image defects that result from merely ejecting a large amount of a single color at once do not occur. In this manner, conventional four-color black printing utilizes the increase in output speed that results from single scan line pass printing without sacrificing image contrast.","However, following the above-described development of four-color black printing, the only remaining method to further increase the speed of black and white printing was to reduce output image resolution. Unfortunately, the resolution can only be lowered so far without the resulting printed image being unsuitable as a final product.","Therefore, various exemplary embodiments of this invention provide systems and methods for reducing the conventional trade-off between output speed and output image resolution in a marking system.","Various exemplary embodiments of this invention provide systems and methods that utilize higher resolution data to adjust the amount of ink, toner or other marking material that will be printed at the edges of solids.","Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods for increasing the image quality of a marked image and\/or increasing marking speed according to this invention input higher resolution data than that which will be output in order to approximate the higher resolution edges of output solids while maintaining the printing speed of lower resolution output. A \u201csolid\u201d is a marked area of substantially uniform color or shade. Accordingly, when the edge of a solid exists on a high-resolution center, i.e., the edge of the solid is between pixels according to the higher resolution input data, but is within an output area according to the output spacing, an amount of marking material is deposited on an adjacent output area according to the output spacing, such that when the marking material is transferred and\/or fused to a receiving medium it is spread partially into the output area containing the high-resolution edge. The spread marking material causes the transition from the marked area to the non-marked area to shift, thereby approximating the edge of the solid according to the higher resolution input data.","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in, or are apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.","Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention input higher resolution data, e.g., data having a smaller output spacing than the output spacing of the data that will be output. By outputting data with a larger output spacing, a significant increase in output speed is possible. Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention utilize the high-resolution input data to adjust the amount of marking material output to imitate higher resolution output. In this manner, the output speed may be increased while reducing conventional loss of output quality. Because the effects of poor resolution are most apparent along the edges of solids, the various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention utilize the input high-resolution data to imitate high-resolution output along the edges of solids.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-10","FIGS. 1-10"]},"In various exemplary embodiments, the amount of marking material is measured as drops ejected from a print head. For example, for some edge transitions the amount of marking material could be chosen so that the final rendered output contains one black and one color drop where that color drop is any one of the primary colors (or a total of 2 drops). Alternatively, a simple fraction (e.g. an average of 1\u00bd or 1\u2154 drops per pixel) may be used. Rendering to drops may be done by methods well known in art such as halftoning or error diffusion and preferably a method that considers all colors together such as vector halftoning or vector error diffusion. It should further be appreciated that various exemplary embodiments may also utilize gray or color outputs.","For ease of explanation, this exemplary embodiment utilizes input high-resolution data that has decreased output spacing, in a direction parallel to a marking device's scan line (for example, the output data is 300 dpi\u00d7300 dpi and the input high-resolution data is 600 dpi\u00d7300 dpi). However, it should be appreciated that in other exemplary embodiments high-resolution data that has decreased output spacing in either or both directions may be used.","In all of , the pixels , , , , , and  represent the high-resolution input data. For ease of explanation, the high-resolution pixels , , , , , and  are grouped according to the lower resolution output spacing. As discussed above, various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention increase output speed by increasing the output spacing. Therefore, according to this embodiment, marking material is only output for each group of high-resolution pixels. Group  represents the previous output spacing, group  represents the current output spacing, and group  represents the next output spacing. In this context \u201ccurrent\u201d refers to the group for which an output value is currently being created, \u201cprevious\u201d refers to a group adjacent to one side of the current group, and \u201cnext\u201d refers to the group adjacent to an opposite side of the current group. Furthermore, in , a black high-resolution pixel indicates that, according to the input data, that high-resolution pixel should be black and a white high-resolution pixel indicates that, according to the input data, that high-resolution pixel should be white. The crosshatched pixels are high-resolution pixels that are not considered by this embodiment of the method according to this invention, because they are not relevant to the analysis.","It should be appreciated that other embodiments may consider one or more input high-resolution pixels before the previous output spacing and after the next output spacing therefore enabling identification of additional cases such as 3 and 4 high-resolution pixel wide lines and transition adjustments that are more than one output spacing wide. In addition, the consideration of input high-resolution pixels in previous or subsequent scan lines could enable identification of corners and steps in an edge, which could then be handled as different cases requiring differing amounts of marking material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2"},"As such, when the input high-resolution data indicates that pixel  is white, pixel  is black, and pixel  is white, as shown in , this embodiment determines that a high-resolution line exists on pixel . Because marking material will be output at a spacing that does not allow pixel  to be individually printed according to conventional methods, this embodiment reduces the amount of marking material output at the spacing directly over group  so that the marked area, although shifted slightly to the left, will be thinner and lighter, thereby approximating a line printed at a higher resolution according to conventional methods.","Similarly, as shown in , when the input high-resolution data indicates that pixel  is white, pixel  is white, pixel  is black, and pixel  is white, this embodiment determines that a high-resolution line exists on pixel . Again, because marking material will be output at a spacing that does not allow pixel  to be individually printed according to conventional methods, this embodiment reduces the amount of marking material output at the spacing directly over group  so that the marked area, although shifted slightly to the right, will be thinner and lighter, thereby approximating a line printed at a higher resolution according to conventional methods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["120","210","220","310","200","200"]},"When the input high-resolution data indicates that pixel  is white, pixels  and  are black, and pixel  is white, as shown in , this embodiment determines that a single line at a resolution corresponding to the output spacing of this embodiment exists between the spacing directly over group  and the spacing directly over group . Because marking material will be output at a spacing that does not allow pixel  and  to be individually printed according to conventional methods, this embodiment outputs an amount of marking material at the spacing directly over group  necessary to define a line. As such, a line at a resolution corresponding to the output spacing may be output, although shifted slightly to the left, thereby approximating a line output at the same resolution over pixels  and  according to conventional methods. As in the example of , the amount of marking material used to define a line may be an amount either greater than or less than that used for the interior of a solid in order to darken the line and enhance the contrast between the line and the background or to lighten the line and preserve fine detail, respectively.

The spread marking material causes the transition from the marked area to the non-marked area to shift, thereby approximating the edge of the solid according to the higher resolution input data.

Alternatively, it may come in a page description language (PDL) format and later processed to create a high-resolution raster image. Furthermore, the above described exemplary embodiments may be implemented on the whole raster image or only on certain types of objects such as text or graphics as identified by the PDL or other algorithms known in the art for identifying objects from a raster image.","The output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  evaluates the high-resolution data and, depending on the results of the evaluation, creates adjusted output data with a greater output spacing than the high-resolution data. For instance, if for a certain group of high-resolution pixels that constitute an output area according to the output spacing of the output data, according to the low-resolution data, the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  determines that the first high-resolution pixel within the output area is white, the next high-resolution pixel within the output area is black, and the first high-resolution pixel in the next output area is white, (e.g., as shown in ), then the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  creates output data wherein the amount of marking material output at will result in output that is thinner and lighter, thereby approximating a line printed at a higher resolution according to conventional methods.","Similarly, the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  may create output data wherein the amount of marking material output for the output area is thinner and lighter when, as shown in , the first high-resolution pixel and the next high-resolution pixel of the previous output area according to the output spacing are white, the first high-resolution pixel of the output area is black, and the next high-resolution pixel of the output area is white.","Furthermore, the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  may create output data to define a line at a location corresponding to the output spacing and a resolution corresponding to the output spacing, when it determines that, as shown in , a second high-resolution pixel within a previous output area is white, both high-resolution pixels within a current output area are black, and a first high-resolution pixel within a next output area is white.","Similarly, the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  may create output data to define a line at a location corresponding to the output spacing and a resolution corresponding to the output spacing, when it determines that, as shown in , a first high-resolution pixel of a previous output area according to the output spacing is white, a next high-resolution pixel of the previous output area is black, a first high-resolution pixel of a current output area is black, and a next high-resolution pixel of a current output area is white.","The output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  may create output data to define an edge at a location corresponding to the area between output areas according to the output spacing, when it determines that, as shown in , either the second high-resolution pixel of a previous output area is white, both high resolution pixels of a current output area are black, and both high resolution pixels of a next output area are black, or both high resolution pixels of a previous output area are black, both high resolution pixels of a current output area are black, and the first high-resolution pixel of a next output area is white.","The output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  may create output data to define an edge at a location corresponding to the area between two high resolution pixels that are within the same output area according to the output spacing, when it determines that, as shown in , either a first high-resolution pixel of a previous output area is white, a second high-resolution pixel of a previous output area is black, and both high resolution pixels of a current output area are black, or both high resolution pixels of a current output area are black, a first high-resolution pixel of a next output area is white, and a second high-resolution pixel of a next output area is black.","Finally, the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  will create output data reflecting an interior area when, as shown in , a first and next high-resolution pixel of a previous output area are black, a first and next high-resolution pixel of a current output area are black, and a first and next high-resolution pixel of a next output area are black.","The final output data consists of an amount of each color to be deposited for the group of high-resolution pixels that make up each output area according to the output spacing. The amount could be, for example, a single unit for each color or multiple units per color depending on the details of the marking process. Again, it should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments, the amount of marking material is measured as drops ejected from a print head. Rendering to drops may be done by methods well know in art such as halftoning or error diffusion and preferably a method that considers all colors together such as vector halftoning or vector error diffusion.","After the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  has evaluated the input high-resolution data and created output data, the input high-resolution data and output data, under control of the controller , are respectively returned to the input data portion  and the output data portion  of the memory . Then, under control of the controller , the output data is output to the input\/output interface, across the link , to the data sink . Alternatively, the output data may be output, under control of the controller , directly from the output adjusting circuit, routine, or application  to the input\/output interface, across the link , to the data sink .","It should be appreciated that, depending on cost or other design constraints, one or more of the above-described elements of the system  may be combined into a single element or divided into multiple elements where appropriate.","It should also be appreciated that the above-described system may be incorporated into a marking engine such as a solid or liquid ink-jet printer, a facsimile machine, a digital copier, or any other now-known or later-developed device for marking an image using liquid or solid marking ink.","Furthermore, it should be appreciated that even though, for the sake of simplicity, the above-described embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention were described using high-resolution data that is finer only in a direction parallel to the scan line, high-resolution data may be used that is finer in each direction.","It should be appreciated that, for the sake of simplicity, the above-described embodiments have been described by using high-resolution data that is twice as fine as the output area (i.e., two high-resolution pixels per output area). However, the same principle may be applied to high-resolution data wherein more high-resolution pixels exist within an output area. In such a situation, the difference would be a larger number of output values with varying amounts of marking material. For instance, a line that is two high-resolution pixels wide within a five pixel wide output area would be approximated by a smaller amount of marking material than a line that is three high-resolution pixels wide within a five pixel wide output area. Similarly, a larger amount of marking material would be output on an output area to approximate an edge of a solid that is three high-resolution pixels within an adjacent five-pixel-wide output area, than to approximate an edge of a solid that is only two high-resolution pixels wide within an adjacent five-pixel-wide output area.","Still further, although the above-described embodiments create output data to approximate the high-resolution input data at a larger output spacing, many more adjustment values may be used. For instance, when it is determined that the current low-resolution pixel is a corner pixel, a known adjustment value may be used. Similarly, when it is determined that the current low-resolution pixel is part of a diagonal line, another known adjustment value may be used.","It should be appreciated that although, for ease of explanation, the above-described embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention have been described using pixel values of either black or white, various exemplary embodiments may consider various grey or non-neutral color values as well. For instance, rather than determining whether a pixel is black or white, it would be determined whether a pixel is lighter or darker than an adjacent pixel. Furthermore, the various adjustment values could be determined based on the difference between two adjacent colors. When two solids of very different colors (i.e., one very dark and one very light) are adjacent to one another, the adjustment values would be skewed to provide a substantial amount of edge differentiation (e.g., more ink for improved contrast and high-resolution approximation). When two solids of closer shades of grey are adjacent to one another, the adjustment values would be skewed to provide less edge differentiation (e.g., less ink since less contrast and high-resolution approximation is necessary). Below a certain threshold, difference between the colors there would be no enhancement. The enhancement in the simplest form would be linearly scaled from the threshold to the maximum enhancement (when the colors are black and white), though other functional forms could also be used.","It should also be appreciated that the resolutions of the different inks could be different. For example, ink jet systems often have higher resolution black capabilities than they do in the individual colors. Thus, the amount of color ink can be determined based on high-resolution data similar to the example above, while the black ink is actually printed according to high-resolution data.","It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention are not limited to creating data that will be immediately output (e.g., that will immediately be used to determine an amount of marking material to be output), but rather may be saved as values for later rendering.","Finally,  is an enlarged view of text printed by a conventional four-color printing system.  is an enlarged view of the same text printed by a four-color printing system according to this invention.","While this invention has been described in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments outlined above, various alternatives, modifications, variations, and\/or improvements may be possible. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention, as set forth above, are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Various changes may be without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various exemplary embodiments of systems and methods according to this invention will be described in detail, with reference to the following figures, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 and 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 13"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
