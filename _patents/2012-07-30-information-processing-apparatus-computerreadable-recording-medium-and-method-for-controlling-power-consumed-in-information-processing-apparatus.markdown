{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-184194, filed on Aug. 25, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The embodiments discussed herein are related to an information processing apparatus, an information control program, and a method for controlling information.","When a peripheral device such as wireless communication or a Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, power consumption significantly increases. In order to extend the life of a battery of the mobile terminal, for example, a technique has been disclosed in which an Operating System (OS) and middleware have a function of permitting use of a peripheral device when an application prepares an Application Programming Interface (API) for declaring the beginning and the end of use of the peripheral device and uses the API. For example, there has been a technique in which a system monitors the operation of an application and detects the beginning and the end of access to a peripheral device.","In the above-described techniques, because both the OS and the application are to be corrected, it is difficult to additionally introduce the techniques to some of terminals that allow a user to freely download and install various applications, such as smartphones. It is also difficult to revise the format of each application package in such a way as to add, to each application package, a definition as to which peripheral device is to be used by the application package. When the operation of an application is continuously monitored, the application and an API are not corrected because the system detects use of a peripheral device by the application. However, when the operation of an application is continuously monitored, the system load increases due to the monitoring, thereby increasing the power consumption of the terminal and deteriorating the response of the system.","Examples of the related art include Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 11-73255 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2009-93295.","According to an aspect of the embodiments, an information processing apparatus includes a processor that executes a plurality of application programs, a display that displays results of the execution of the plurality of application programs, and a storage that stores a first table in which the plurality of application programs and a plurality of pieces of operation information corresponding to the plurality of application programs are associated with each other and recorded, and a second table in which the plurality of application programs and order determined on the basis of power to be consumed by the processing unit to execute the plurality of application programs are associated with each other and recorded, wherein when the processor detects a certain piece of operation information, the processor refers to the first table to detect an application program corresponding to the certain piece of operation information and refers to the second table to detect a place of the detected application program in the order, and when the processor detects that a remaining amount of electric charge of a power supply that supplies power to the information processing apparatus has become lower than a threshold, the processor terminates, in accordance with the order, application programs among the plurality of application programs that are being executed other than an application program whose result of execution is displayed on the display.","The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","Information processing systems according to embodiments will be described hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"The information processing apparatus  includes a central processing unit (CPU) , a main memory , an auxiliary memory , a clock supply circuit , a voltage supply circuit , a radio frequency (RF) unit , an antenna , and a battery  as hardware modules. The information processing apparatus  also includes a power supply circuit , a camera module , a Bluetooth (registered trademark) interface , a GPS module , a liquid crystal display (LCD) , sensors , and an external feeding unit  as hardware modules.

The RF unit  also has a function of a receiver that converts a high-frequency signal received by the antenna  into a baseband signal and outputs the baseband signal to the CPU .","The battery  supplies power to the power supply circuit . The battery  may be realized, for example, by a battery such as a lithium-ion battery, an integrated circuit (IC) for protecting the battery, and the like. The power supply circuit  supplies power supplied from the battery  to each hardware module in the information processing apparatus .

The sensors  may include, for example, an acceleration sensor, a gyro sensor, an illumination sensor, a geomagnetic sensor, an inclination sensor, a pressure sensor, an approach sensor, and a temperature sensor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"304"},"Users of smartphones download, from networks, paid and free application packages provided by application developers around the world and use the application packages by installing the application packages on terminals. Therefore, for security purposes, access permission information indicating whether or not to execute data communication, whether or not to use a wireless LAN, whether or not to execute high-accuracy location using a GPS, whether or not to read personal information regarding a user, and the like, is attached to the application packages. The user refers to the access permission information and judges whether or not to actually use a particular application package, and if the application package tries to execute an operation that is not permitted in the access permission information attached to the application package, the system stops the execution. Therefore, in the case of smartphones, the access permission information attached to the application packages is saved to the terminals when the application packages are installed.","The application package  includes an application program, a setting file, attached data, and access permission information. An application management unit  manages various applications. The application management unit  stores the application program, the setting file, and the attached data in storage .

There is already access permission information corresponding to these operations that cause power consumption to increase.","By reading access permission information regarding all applications that have been installed on a smartphone, it is possible without executing applications to judge whether or not the individual applications execute any of the operations that cause power consumption to increase, and, if any of the operations is executed, to identify which operation is executed.","A terminal manufacturer judges how much power a certain peripheral device consumes and how much power a CPU consumes when a terminal continues to operate without sleeping. The relationship between the amounts of power consumption when these operations are performed remains the same regardless of the types of terminals. Therefore, a third party (for example, a developer of an application that terminates itself in accordance with the remaining amount of electric charge of a battery) other than the terminal manufacturer also provides this information.","In the first embodiment, by referring to the above-described two types of information, a group of applications created on the basis of the operations that cause power consumption to increase is arranged in order of the amount of power consumption.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["510","510","511","512","510"]},"In the first embodiment, applications are classified in accordance with the amounts of power consumption when the CPU  has executed the applications.
