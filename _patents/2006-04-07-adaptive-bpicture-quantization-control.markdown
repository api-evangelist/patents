title: Adaptive B-picture quantization control
abstract: The present application is directed to techniques and tools for adapting the quantizer as well as the quantization step size used during video encoding. For example, a video encoder uses a non-uniform quantizer (having a relatively large dead zone ratio) for B-picture types, but uses a uniform quantizer for other types of pictures. In many encoding scenarios, this helps the encoder control bit rate for the B-picture types instead of resorting to higher quantization step sizes, which improves overall quality for the B-picture types.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["With the increased popularity of DVDs, music delivery over the Internet, and digital cameras, digital media have become commonplace. Engineers use a variety of techniques to process digital audio, video, and images efficiently while still maintaining quality. To understand these techniques, it helps to understand how the audio, video, and image information is represented and processed in a computer.","I. Representation of Media Information in a Computer","A computer processes media information as a series of numbers representing that information. For example, a single number may represent the intensity of brightness or the intensity of a color component such as red, green or blue for each elementary small region of a picture, so that the digital representation of the picture consists of one or more arrays of such numbers. Each such number may be referred to as a sample. For a color image, it is conventional to use more than one sample to represent the color of each elemental region, and typically three samples are used. The set of these samples for an elemental region may be referred to as a pixel, where the word \u201cpixel\u201d is a contraction referring to the concept of a \u201cpicture element.\u201d For example, one pixel may consist of three samples that represent the intensity of red, green and blue light necessary to represent the elemental region. Such a pixel type is referred to as an RGB pixel. Several factors affect quality of media information, including sample depth, resolution, and frame rate (for video).","Sample depth is a property normally measured in bits that indicates the range of numbers that can be used to represent a sample. When more values are possible for the sample, quality can be higher because the number can capture more subtle variations in intensity and\/or a greater range of values. Resolution generally refers to the number of samples over some duration of time (for audio) or space (for images or individual video pictures). Images with higher resolution tend to look crisper than other images and contain more discernable useful details. Frame rate is a common term for temporal resolution for video. Video with higher frame rate tends to mimic the smooth motion of natural objects better than other video, and can similarly be considered to contain more detail in the temporal dimension. For all of these factors, the tradeoff for high quality is the cost of storing and transmitting the information in terms of the bit rate necessary to represent the sample depth, resolution and frame rate, as Table 1 shows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Bit rates for different quality levels of raw video"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Bit Rate"]},{"entry":["Bits Per Pixel","Resolution","Frame Rate","(in millions"]},{"entry":["(sample depth times","(in pixels,","(in frames","of bits per"]},{"entry":["samples per pixel)","Width \u00d7 Height)","per second)","second)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20028 (value 0-255,","160 \u00d7 120","7.5","1.2"]},{"entry":"monochrome)"},{"entry":["24 (value 0-255, RGB)","320 \u00d7 240","15","27.6"]},{"entry":["24 (value 0-255, RGB)","640 \u00d7 480","30","221.2"]},{"entry":["24 (value 0-255, RGB)","1280 \u00d7 720\u2002","60","1327.1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Despite the high bit rate necessary for storing and sending high quality video (such as HDTV), companies and consumers increasingly depend on computers to create, distribute, and play back high quality content. For this reason, engineers use compression (also called source coding or source encoding) to reduce the bit rate of digital media. Compression decreases the cost of storing and transmitting the information by converting the information into a lower bit rate form. Compression can be lossless, in which quality of the video does not suffer but decreases in bit rate are limited by the complexity of the video. Or, compression can be lossy, in which quality of the video suffers but decreases in bit rate are more dramatic. Decompression (also called decoding) reconstructs a version of the original information from the compressed form. A \u201ccodec\u201d is an encoder\/decoder system.","In general, video compression techniques include \u201cintra\u201d compression and \u201cinter\u201d or predictive compression. For video frames, intra compression techniques compress individual frames, typically called I-frames or key frames. Inter compression techniques compress frames with reference to preceding and\/or following frames, and inter-compressed frames are typically called predicted frames, P-frames, or B-frames.","II. Inter Compression in Windows Media Video, Versions 8 and 9","Microsoft Corporation's Windows Media Video, Version 8 [\u201cWMV8\u201d] includes a video encoder and a video decoder. The WMV8 encoder uses intra and inter compression, and the WMV8 decoder uses intra and inter decompression. Windows Media Video, Version 9 [\u201cWMV9\u201d] uses a similar architecture for many operations.","A. Intra Compression",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","105","115","115","115"]},"The encoder then quantizes  the DCT coefficients, resulting in an 8\u00d78 block of quantized DCT coefficients . Quantization is lossy. Since low frequency DCT coefficients tend to have higher values, quantization results in loss of precision but not complete loss of the information for the coefficients. On the other hand, since high frequency DCT coefficients tend to have values of zero or close to zero, quantization of the high frequency coefficients typically results in contiguous regions of zero values. In addition, in some cases high frequency DCT coefficients are quantized more coarsely than low frequency DCT coefficients, resulting in greater loss of precision\/information for the high frequency DCT coefficients.","The encoder then prepares the 8\u00d78 block of quantized DCT coefficients  for entropy encoding, which is a form of lossless compression. The exact type of entropy encoding can vary depending on whether a coefficient is a DC coefficient (lowest frequency), an AC coefficient (other frequencies) in the top row or left column, or another AC coefficient.","The encoder encodes the DC coefficient  as a differential from the DC coefficient  of a neighboring 8\u00d78 block, which is a previously encoded neighbor (e.g., top or left) of the block being encoded. ( shows a neighbor block  that is situated to the left of the block being encoded in the frame.) The encoder entropy encodes  the differential.","The entropy encoder can encode the left column or top row of AC coefficients as a differential from a corresponding left column or top row of the neighboring 8\u00d78 block. This is an example of AC coefficient prediction.  shows the left column  of AC coefficients encoded as a differential  from the left column  of the neighboring (in reality, to the left) block . The differential coding increases the chance that the differential coefficients have zero values. The remaining AC coefficients are from the block  of quantized DCT coefficients.","The encoder scans  the 8\u00d78 block  of quantized AC DCT coefficients into a one-dimensional array  and then entropy encodes the scanned AC coefficients using a variation of run length coding . The encoder selects an entropy code from one or more run\/level\/last tables  and outputs the entropy code.","B. Inter Compression","Inter compression uses block-based motion compensated prediction coding followed by transform coding of the residual error.  illustrates motion estimation for a predicted frame .","In , the encoder computes a motion vector for a macroblock  in the predicted frame . To compute the motion vector, the encoder searches in a search area  of a reference frame . Within the search area , the encoder compares the macroblock  from the predicted frame  to various candidate macroblocks in order to find a candidate macroblock that is a good match. The encoder outputs information specifying the motion vector (entropy coded) for the matching macroblock. The motion vector is differentially coded with respect to a motion vector predictor.","After reconstructing the motion vector by adding the differential to the motion vector predictor, a decoder uses the motion vector to compute a prediction macroblock for the macroblock  using information from the reference frame , which is a previously reconstructed frame available at the encoder and the decoder.","The prediction is rarely perfect, so the encoder usually encodes blocks of pixel differences (also called the error or residual blocks) between the prediction macroblock and the macroblock  itself. The encoder encodes the residual blocks by performing a DCT on the residual blocks, quantizing the DCT coefficients and entropy encoding the quantized DCT coefficients.","III. Lossy Compression and Quantization","The preceding section mentioned quantization, a mechanism for lossy compression, and entropy coding, also called lossless compression. Lossless compression reduces the bit rate of information by removing redundancy from the information without any reduction in fidelity. For example, a series of ten consecutive pixels that are all exactly the same shade of red could be represented as a code for the particular shade of red and the number ten as a \u201crun length\u201d of consecutive pixels, and this series can be perfectly reconstructed by decompression from the code for the shade of red and the indicated number (ten) of consecutive pixels having that shade of red. Lossless compression techniques reduce bit rate at no cost to quality, but can only reduce bit rate up to a certain point. Decreases in bit rate are limited by the inherent amount of variability in the statistical characterization of the input data, which is referred to as the source entropy.","In contrast, with lossy compression, the quality suffers somewhat but the achievable decrease in bit rate is more dramatic. For example, a series of ten pixels, each being a slightly different shade of red, can be approximated as ten pixels with exactly the same particular approximate red color. Lossy compression techniques can be used to reduce bit rate more than lossless compression techniques, but some of the reduction in bit rate is achieved by reducing quality, and the lost quality cannot be completely recovered. Lossy compression is often used in conjunction with lossless compression\u2014in a system design in which the lossy compression establishes an approximation of the information and lossless compression techniques are applied to represent the approximation. For example, the series of ten pixels, each a slightly different shade of red, can be represented as a code for one particular shade of red and the number ten as a run-length of consecutive pixels. In general, an encoder varies quantization to trade off quality and bit rate. Coarser quantization results in greater quality reduction but allows for greater bit rate reduction. In decompression, the original series would then be reconstructed as ten pixels with the same approximated red color.","According to one possible definition, quantization is a term used for an approximating non-reversible mapping function commonly used for lossy compression, in which there is a specified set of possible output values, and each member of the set of possible output values has an associated set of input values that result in the selection of that particular output value. A variety of quantization techniques have been developed, including scalar or vector, uniform or non-uniform, and adaptive or non-adaptive quantization.","A. Scalar Quantizers","According to one possible definition, a scalar quantizer is an approximating functional mapping x\u2192Q[x] of an input value x to a quantized value Q[x].  shows a \u201cstaircase\u201d I\/O function () for a scalar quantizer. The horizontal axis is a number line for a real number input variable x, and the vertical axis indicates the corresponding quantized values Q[x]. The number line is partitioned by thresholds such as the threshold (). Each value of x within a given range between a pair of adjacent thresholds is assigned the same quantized value Q[x]. For example, each value of x within the range () is assigned the same quantized value (). (At a threshold, one of the two possible quantized values is assigned to an input x, depending on the system.) Overall, the quantized values Q[x] exhibit a discontinuous, staircase pattern. The distance the mapping continues along the number line depends on the system, typically ending after a finite number of thresholds. The placement of the thresholds on the number line may be uniformly spaced (as shown in ) or non-uniformly spaced.","A scalar quantizer can be decomposed into two distinct stages. The first stage is the classifier stage, in which a classifier function mapping x\u2192A[x] maps an input x to a quantization index A[x], which is often integer-valued. In essence, the classifier segments an input number line or data set. shows a generalized classifier () and thresholds for a scalar quantizer. As in , a number line for a real number variable x is segmented by thresholds such as the threshold (). Each value of x within a given range such as the range () is assigned the same quantized value Q[x]. shows a numerical example of a classifier () and thresholds for a scalar quantizer.","In the second stage, a reconstructor functional mapping k\u2192\u03b2[k] maps each quantization index k to a reconstruction value \u03b2[k]. In essence, the reconstructor places steps having a particular height relative to the input number line segments (or selects a subset of data set values) for reconstruction of each region determined by the classifier. The reconstructor functional mapping may be implemented, for example, using a lookup table. Overall, the classifier relates to the reconstructor as follows:\n\nQ[x]=\u03b2[A[x]]\u2003\u2003(1).\n","In common usage, the term \u201cquantization\u201d is often used to describe the classifier stage, which is performed during encoding. The term \u201cinverse quantization\u201d is similarly used to describe the reconstructor stage, whether performed during encoding or decoding.","The distortion introduced by using such a quantizer may be computed with a difference-based distortion measure d(x\u2212Q[x]). Typically, such a distortion measure has the property that d(x\u2212Q[x]) increases as x\u2212Q[x] deviates from zero; and typically each reconstruction value lies within the range of the corresponding classification region, so that the straight line that would be formed by the functional equation Q[x]=x will pass through every step of the staircase diagram (as shown in ) and therefore Q[Q[x]] will typically be equal to Q[x]. In general, a quantizer is considered better in rate-distortion terms if the quantizer results in a lower average value of distortion than other quantizers for a given bit rate of output. More formally, a quantizer is considered better if, for a source random variable X, the expected (i.e., the average or statistical mean) value of the distortion measure =E{d(X\u2212Q[X])} is lower for an equal or lower entropy H of A[X]. The most commonly-used distortion measure is the squared error distortion measure, for which d(|x\u2212y|)=|x\u2212y|. When the squared error distortion measure is used, the expected value of the distortion measure ( ) is referred to as the mean squared error.","B. Non-uniform Quantizers","A non-uniform quantizer has threshold values that are not uniformly spaced for all classifier regions. According to one possible definition, a dead zone plus uniform threshold quantizer [\u201cDZ+UTQ\u201d] is a quantizer with uniformly spaced threshold values for all classifier regions except the one containing the zero input value (which is called the dead zone [\u201cDZ\u201d]). In a general sense, a DZ+UTQ is a non-uniform quantizer, since the DZ size is different than the other classifier regions.","A DZ+UTQ has a classifier index mapping rule x\u2192A[x] that can be expressed based on two parameters.  shows a staircase I\/O function () for a DZ+UTQ, and shows a generalized classifier () and thresholds for a DZ+UTQ. The parameter s, which is greater than 0, indicates the step size for all steps other than the DZ. Mathematically, all sare equal to s for i\u22600. The parameter z, which is greater than or equal to 0, indicates the ratio of the DZ size to the size of the other steps. Mathematically, s=z\u00b7s. In , z is 2, so the DZ is twice as wide as the other classification zones. The index mapping rule x\u2192A[x] for a DZ+UTQ can be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"A","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"x"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"sign","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mi":"max","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":",","mrow":{"mo":["\u230a","\u230b"],"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"x"},"mi":"s"},{"mi":"z","mn":"2"}],"mo":["-","+"],"mn":"1"}}}}}],"mo":"*"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sign","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"X"}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"+","mn":"1"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["for","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"\u2265","mn":"0"},"mo":","}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["for","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"<","mn":"0."}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 3"],"i":["b ","a","b "],"b":["650","4","4"]},"C. Reconstruction Rules","Different reconstruction rules may be used to determine the reconstruction value for each quantization index. Standards and product specifications that focus only on achieving interoperability will often specify reconstruction values without necessarily specifying the classification rule. In other words, some specifications may define the functional mapping k\u2192\u03b2[k] without defining the functional mapping x\u2192A[x]. This allows a decoder built to comply with the standard\/specification to reconstruct information correctly. In contrast, encoders are often given the freedom to change the classifier in any way that they wish, while still complying with the standard\/specification.","Numerous systems for adjusting quantization thresholds have been developed. Many standards and products specify reconstruction values that correspond to a typical mid-point reconstruction rule (e.g., for a typical simple classification rule) for the sake of simplicity. For classification, however, the thresholds can in fact be adjusted so that certain input values will be mapped to more common (and hence, lower bit rate) indices, which makes the reconstruction values closer to optimal.","In many systems, the extent of quantization is measured in terms of quantization step size. Coarser quantization uses larger quantization step sizes, corresponding to wider ranges of input values. Finer quantization uses smaller quantization step sizes. Often, for purposes of signaling and reconstruction, quantization step sizes are parameterized as multiples of a smallest quantization step size.","D. Perceptual Effects of Quantization","As mentioned above, lossy compression tends to cause a decrease in quality. For example, a series of ten samples of slightly different values can be approximated using quantization as ten samples with exactly the same particular approximate value. This kind of quantization can reduce the bit rate of encoding the series of ten samples, but at the cost of lost detail in the original ten samples. In some cases, quantization also can produce visible artifacts that tend to be more artificial-looking and visually distracting than simple loss of fine detail. For example, smooth, un-textured content is susceptible to contouring artifacts\u2014artifacts that appear between regions of two different quantization output values\u2014because the human visual system is sensitive to subtle differences (particularly luma differences) between adjacent areas of flat color.","Another perceptual effect of quantization occurs when average quantization step sizes are varied between frames in a sequence. Although the flexibility to change quantization step sizes can help control bit rate, an unpleasant \u201cflicker\u201d effect can occur when average quantization step sizes vary too much from frame to frame and the difference in quality between frames becomes noticeable.","IV. Signaling Quantization Parameters in VC-1","In some systems, an encoder can use different quantizers and different quantization step size parameters (\u201cQPs\u201d) for different sequences, different frames, and different parts of frames.","For example, a VC-1 encoder specifies a quantizer used for a video sequence. The encoder sends a 2-bit bitstream element (\u201cQUANTIZER\u201d) at sequence level in a bitstream syntax to indicate a quantizer type for the sequence. QUANTIZER indicates that the quantizer for the sequence is specified as being uniform or non-uniform at frame level, that the encoder uses a non-uniform quantizer for all frames, or that the encoder uses a uniform quantizer for all frames. Whether the encoder uses a uniform quantizer or non-uniform quantizer, the encoder sends a frame-level bitstream element, PQINDEX, to indicate a default frame QP (\u201cPQUANT\u201d). If QUANTIZER indicates an implicitly specified quantizer, PQINDEX also indicates whether the quantizer used is uniform or non-uniform. If QUANTIZER indicates an explicitly specified quantizer, the frame-level bitstream element PQUANTIZER is sent to indicate whether the quantizer for the frame is uniform or non-uniform. PQINDEX is present, and PQUANTIZER is present if required, in all frame types.","Table 2 shows how PQINDEX is translated to PQUANT for the case where QUANTIZER=0 (indicating the quantizer is implicit and hence specified by PQINDEX).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Implicit quantizer translation in a WMV encoder"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Quan-",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["PQINDEX","PQUANT","tizer","PQINDEX","PQUANT","Quantizer"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","Reserved","NA","16","13","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["1","1","Uni-","17","14","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["2","2","Uni-","18","15","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["3","3","Uni-","19","16","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["4","4","Uni-","20","17","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["5","5","Uni-","21","18","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["6","6","Uni-","22","19","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["7","7","Uni-","23","20","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["8","8","Uni-","24","21","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":["9","6","Non-","25","22","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":["10","7","Non-","26","23","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":["11","8","Non-","27","24","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":["12","9","Non-","28","25","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":["13","10","Non-","29","27","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":["14","11","Non-","30","29","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":["15","12","Non-","31","31","Non-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"uni-",{},{},"uniform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"form"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"If the quantizer is signaled explicitly at the sequence or frame level (signaled by syntax element QUANTIZER=01, 10 or 11), then PQUANT is equal to PQINDEX for all nonzero values of PQINDEX.","V. Other Standards and Products","Numerous international standards specify aspects of video decoders and formats for compressed video information. Directly or by implication, these standards also specify certain encoder details, but other encoder details are not specified. Some standards address still image compression\/decompression, and other standards address audio compression\/decompression. Numerous companies have produced encoders and decoders for audio, still images, and video. Various other kinds of signals (for example, hyperspectral imagery, graphics, text, financial information, etc.) are also commonly represented and stored or transmitted using compression techniques.","Standards typically do not fully specify the quantizer design. Most allow some variation in the encoder classification rule x\u2192A[x] and\/or the decoder reconstruction rule k\u2192\u03b2[k].","The use of a DZ ratio z=2 or greater has been implicit in a number of encoding designs. For example, the spacing of reconstruction values for predicted regions in some standards implies use of z>2. Reconstruction values in these examples from standards are spaced appropriately for use of DZ+UTQ classification with z=2 and mid-point reconstruction. Altering thresholds to increase optimality for the specified reconstruction values (as described above) results in an even larger DZ ratio (since the DZ requires fewer bits to select than the other levels).","Designs based on z=1 (or at least z<2) have been used for quantization in several standards. In these cases, reconstruction values are equally spaced around zero and away from zero.","Given the critical importance of video compression to digital video, it is not surprising that video compression is a richly developed field. Whatever the benefits of previous video compression techniques, however, they do not have the advantages of the following techniques and tools.","The present application is directed to techniques and tools for adapting the quantizer as well as the quantization step size used during video encoding. For example, a video encoder uses a non-uniform quantizer (having a relatively large dead zone ratio) for B-picture types, but uses a uniform quantizer for other types of pictures. In many encoding scenarios, this helps the encoder control bit rate for the B-picture types instead of resorting to higher quantization step sizes, which improves overall quality for the B-picture types.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In one aspect, a video encoder selects a picture type (e.g., a B-picture type) for a current picture and uses the selected picture type when selecting between multiple available quantizers for the current picture. Each of the multiple available quantizers has a different dead zone ratio. The selected quantizer for the current picture (e.g., a non-uniform quantizer) has a larger dead zone ratio than one or more other quantizers among the multiple available quantizers. The encoder applies the selected quantizer to the current picture and outputs encoded data for the current picture. The larger dead zone ratio of the selected quantizer for the current picture applies for AC coefficients but not for DC coefficients. For example, the larger dead zone ratio results in larger dead zone regions that each have a size that is a function of a quantization step size (QP). For AC coefficients, and the size can be approximately 0.8*QP on each side of zero for each QP of the selected quantizer, and for DC coefficients, the size can be equal to 0.5*QP on each side of zero for each QP of the quantizer.","In another aspect, if a current picture is a P-picture or an I-picture, an encoder selects a uniform quantizer with uniform dead zone for AC coefficients for the current picture, and applies the selected uniform quantizer to the current picture. If the current picture is a B-picture, the encoder selects a non-uniform quantizer with a non-uniform dead zone for AC coefficients for the current picture, where the non-uniform dead zone is larger than the uniform dead zone of the uniform quantizers.","In another aspect, an encoder comprises a frequency transformer for frequency transforming plural blocks of spatial domain information into plural blocks of transform coefficients, a quantizer for quantizing the transform coefficients, an entropy encoder for entropy encoding the quantized transform coefficients, an inverse quantizer for inverse quantizing the quantized transform coefficients, and a controller for selecting (e.g., by using picture type) quantizers (e.g., uniform or non-uniform quantizers) and quantization step sizes for the quantizing. The controller chooses between plural available quantizers, each of the plural available quantizers having a different dead zone ratio. The controller implements a first path for increasing dead zone ratio while decreasing quantization step size for a given level of rate-distortion performance, and a second path for decreasing dead zone ratio while increasing quantization step size for the given level of rate-distortion performance. The controller can follow the first path if a current picture is a B-picture type and otherwise follow the second path. For a current picture, the encoder can select a first quantizer from among the plural available quantizers if the current picture has a B-picture type and otherwise select a second quantizer from among the plural available quantizers. The encoder can further comprise a motion estimator for estimating motion in predicted pictures from reference pictures, a motion compensator for applying the estimated motion, and one or more reference picture buffers for storing the reference pictures.","The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.","The present application relates to techniques and tools for efficient compression of video.

These terms are high-level abstractions for operations performed by a computer, and should not be confused with acts performed by a human being. The actual computer operations corresponding to these terms vary depending on implementation.","II. Generalized Video Encoder",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","805","895"]},"The encoder  processes video pictures. The term picture generally refers to source, coded or reconstructed image data. For progressive video, a picture is a progressive video frame. For interlaced video, a picture may refer to an interlaced video frame, the top field of the frame, or the bottom field of the frame, depending on the context. The encoder  is block-based and uses a 4:2:0 macroblock format for frames. As shown in , macroblock  includes four 8\u00d78 luminance (or luma) blocks (Y through Y) and two 8\u00d78 chrominance (or chroma) blocks (U and V) that are co-located with the four luma blocks but half resolution horizontally and vertically, following the conventional 4:2:0 macroblock format. For fields, the same or a different macroblock organization and format may be used. The 8\u00d78 blocks may be further sub-divided at different stages, e.g., at the frequency transform and entropy encoding stages. The encoder  can perform operations on sets of samples of different size or configuration than 8\u00d78 blocks and 16\u00d716 macroblocks. Alternatively, the encoder  is object-based or uses a different macroblock or block format.","Returning to , the encoder system  compresses predicted pictures and intra-coded, key pictures. For the sake of presentation,  shows a path for key pictures through the encoder system  and a path for predicted pictures. Many of the components of the encoder system  are used for compressing both key pictures and predicted pictures. The exact operations performed by those components can vary depending on the type of information being compressed.","A predicted picture (e.g., progressive P-frame or B-frame, interlaced P-field or B-field, or interlaced P-frame or B-frame) is represented in terms of prediction (or difference) from one or more other pictures (which are typically referred to as reference pictures or anchors). A prediction residual is the difference between what was predicted and the original picture. In contrast, a key picture (e.g., progressive I-frame, interlaced I-field, or interlaced I-frame) is compressed without reference to other pictures.","If the current picture  is a predicted picture, a motion estimator  estimates motion of macroblocks or other sets of samples of the current picture  with respect to one or more reference pictures, for example, the reconstructed previous picture  buffered in the picture store . If the current picture  is a bi-predictive picture, a motion estimator  estimates motion in the current picture  with respect to up to four reconstructed reference pictures (for an interlaced B-field, for example). Typically, a motion estimator estimates motion in a B-picture with respect to one or more temporally previous reference pictures and one or more temporally future reference pictures, but B-pictures need not be predicted from different temporal directions. The encoder system  can use the separate stores  and  for multiple reference pictures.","The motion estimator  can estimate motion by full-sample, \u00bd-sample, \u00bc-sample, or other increments, and can switch the precision of the motion estimation on a picture-by-picture basis or other basis. The motion estimator  (and compensator ) also can switch between types of reference picture sample interpolation (e.g., between bicubic and bilinear) on a per-frame or other basis. The precision of the motion estimation can be the same or different horizontally and vertically. The motion estimator  outputs as side information motion information  such as differential motion vector information. The encoder  encodes the motion information  by, for example, computing one or more predictors for motion vectors, computing differentials between the motion vectors and predictors, and entropy coding the differentials. To reconstruct a motion vector, a motion compensator  combines a predictor with differential motion vector information.","The motion compensator  applies the reconstructed motion vector to the reconstructed picture(s)  to form a motion-compensated current picture . The prediction is rarely perfect, however, and the difference between the motion-compensated current picture  and the original current picture  is the prediction residual . During later reconstruction of the picture, the prediction residual  is added to the motion compensated current picture  to obtain a reconstructed picture that is closer to the original current picture . In lossy compression, however, some information is still lost from the original current picture . Alternatively, a motion estimator and motion compensator apply another type of motion estimation\/compensation.","A frequency transformer  converts the spatial domain video information into frequency domain (i.e., spectral) data. For block-based video pictures, the frequency transformer  applies a DCT, variant of DCT, or other block transform to blocks of the sample data or prediction residual data, producing blocks of frequency transform coefficients. Alternatively, the frequency transformer  applies another conventional frequency transform such as a Fourier transform or uses wavelet or sub-band analysis. The frequency transformer  may apply an 8\u00d78, 8\u00d74, 4\u00d78, 4\u00d74 or other size frequency transform.","A quantizer  then quantizes the blocks of spectral data coefficients. The quantizer applies uniform, scalar quantization to the spectral data with a step-size that varies on a picture-by-picture basis or other basis (e.g., a macroblock-by-macroblock basis). Alternatively, the quantizer applies another type of quantization to the spectral data coefficients, for example, a non-uniform, vector, or non-adaptive quantization, or directly quantizes spatial domain data in an encoder system that does not use frequency transformations. Techniques and tools relating to quantization in some implementations are described in detail below.","In addition to adaptive quantization, the encoder  can use frame dropping, adaptive filtering, or other techniques for rate control.","The encoder  may use special signaling for a skipped macroblock, which is a macroblock that has no information of certain types (e.g., no differential motion vectors for the macroblock and no residual information).","When a reconstructed current picture is needed for subsequent motion estimation\/compensation, an inverse quantizer  performs inverse quantization on the quantized spectral data coefficients. An inverse frequency transformer  then performs the inverse of the operations of the frequency transformer , producing a reconstructed prediction residual (for a predicted picture) or a reconstructed key picture. If the current picture  was a key picture, the reconstructed key picture is taken as the reconstructed current picture (not shown). If the current picture  was a predicted picture, the reconstructed prediction residual is added to the motion-compensated current picture  to form the reconstructed current picture. One or both of the picture stores ,  buffers the reconstructed current picture for use in motion compensated prediction. In some embodiments, the encoder applies a de-blocking filter to the reconstructed frame to adaptively smooth discontinuities and other artifacts in the picture.","The entropy coder  compresses the output of the quantizer  as well as certain side information (e.g., motion information , quantization step size (QP)). Typical entropy coding techniques include arithmetic coding, differential coding, Huffman coding, run length coding, LZ coding, dictionary coding, and combinations of the above. The entropy coder  typically uses different coding techniques for different kinds of information (e.g., DC coefficients, AC coefficients, different kinds of side information), and can choose from among multiple code tables within a particular coding technique.","The entropy coder  provides compressed video information  to the multiplexer (\u201cMUX\u201d) . The MUX  may include a buffer, and a buffer level indicator may be fed back to a controller. Before or after the MUX , the compressed video information  can be channel coded for transmission over the network. The channel coding can apply error detection and correction data to the compressed video information .","A controller (not shown) receives inputs from various modules such as the motion estimator , frequency transformer , quantizer , inverse quantizer , entropy coder , and buffer . The controller evaluates intermediate results during encoding, for example, estimating distortion and performing other rate-distortion analysis. The controller works with modules such as the motion estimator , frequency transformer , quantizer , and entropy coder  to set and change coding parameters during encoding. When an encoder evaluates different coding parameter choices during encoding, the encoder may iteratively perform certain stages (e.g., quantization and inverse quantization) to evaluate different parameter settings. The encoder may set parameters at one stage before proceeding to the next stage. Or, the encoder may jointly evaluate different coding parameters. The tree of coding parameter decisions to be evaluated, and the timing of corresponding encoding, depends on implementation.","The relationships shown between modules within the encoder  indicate general flows of information in the encoder; other relationships are not shown for the sake of simplicity. In particular,  usually does not show side information indicating the encoder settings, modes, tables, etc. used for a video sequence, picture, macroblock, block, etc. Such side information, once finalized, is sent in the output bitstream, typically after entropy encoding of the side information.","Particular embodiments of video encoders typically use a variation or supplemented version of the generalized encoder . Depending on implementation and the type of compression desired, modules of the encoder can be added, omitted, split into multiple modules, combined with other modules, and\/or replaced with like modules. For example, the controller can be split into multiple controller modules associated with different modules of the encoder. In alternative embodiments, encoders with different modules and\/or other configurations of modules perform one or more of the described techniques.","III. Adaptive B-Picture Quantization Control","When encoding video, overall coding quality can be improved if fewer bits are allocated to B-pictures than to I-pictures and P-pictures. Bits saved in B-pictures can be used to improve the quality of I-pictures and P-pictures. Unlike I-pictures and P-pictures, B-pictures are generally not used as reference pictures for other pictures in motion compensation. For this reason, slightly reducing the quality of B-pictures (e.g., by increasing a quantization step size) will not affect the quality of other frames. In addition, the quality gain from spending more bits in B-pictures (e.g., by using smaller quantization step sizes) is not as significant as the gain from spending bits in I-pictures and P-pictures.","Although the flexibility to change quantization for different picture types can help control bit rate and improve quality, an unpleasant \u201cflicker\u201d effect can occur when quantization step sizes vary too much and the difference in quality between frames becomes noticeable. Thus, if quantization step size is increased too much for B-pictures relative to other pictures in a sequence, unpleasant perceptual effects can occur.","Accordingly, described techniques and tools are directed to a rate control scheme for B-pictures that combines quantization step size control with adaptive dead zone control. Using adaptive dead zone control in a B-picture can save bits more efficiently than simply raising quantization step size. It also reduces visual artifacts.","Suppose an encoder needs to encode a B-picture with n bits, and that the encoder evaluates two quantization options. With the first option, the encoder uses a high quantization step size and quantizer with a smaller dead zone ratio. With the second option, the encoder uses a lower quantization step and quantizer with a larger dead zone ratio. The wider dead zone of the second option tends to introduce more distortion than the smaller dead zone of the first option. The overall mix of distortion from the wider dead zone and lower quantization step size (second option) is often less perceptible, however, than the distortion from the higher quantization step size (first option).","In one implementation, an encoder uses an explicit quantization mode to signal various decisions in a bitstream relating to quantization for B-pictures. Tests have shown noticeable visual improvement over an implicit quantization mode.","For example, an encoder that uses either uniform or non-uniform quantization in a sequence sets the dead zone to 1.2*QP (0.6*QP on each side of zero) for uniform quantization and sets the dead zone to 1.6*QP (0.8*QP on each side of zero) for non-uniform quantization. For B-pictures, the encoder always uses non-uniform quantization, so all B-pictures use a dead zone of 1.6*QP. The specific calculations for dead zone thresholds can vary depending on implementation, and the dead zone thresholds can be the same as or different (e.g., wider) than the mid-points between zero and the first reconstruction points according to reconstruction rules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"],"b":["1000","800","1000"]},"At , an encoder selects a picture type for a current picture. The encoder can use various criteria for selecting picture types, although the encoder may have to follow certain rules for selecting picture types in order to be compliant with a decoder (e.g., encoding a picture as an I-picture at required intervals, etc.). In this example, the encoder encodes pictures as I-pictures, P-pictures or B-pictures.","At , the encoder selects a quantizer for the current picture based at least in part upon the selected picture type. For example, the encoder selects a quantizer having a larger dead zone for a B-picture. The encoder can switch between a uniform quantizer and non-uniform quantizer, or can switch between other and\/or additional available quantizers having different dead zone ratios. The encoder can consider additional criteria such as region smoothness, picture complexity and\/or rate constraints when selecting a quantizer.","At , the encoder applies the selected quantizer to the current picture. The encoder performs quantization for the current picture using the selected quantizer and one or more quantization step sizes selected for the picture. In this way, for a B-picture, the encoder can save bits for the current picture relative to other picture types, without increasing quantization step sizes relative to other picture types. The encoder can then similarly process other pictures ().","Using a larger dead zone for B-pictures can save bits more efficiently than simply raising the quantization step size. In some cases, the dead zone that is increased applies only to AC coefficients; the dead zone for DC coefficients remains the same. For example, for AC coefficients, the dead zone is 1.6*QP; for DC coefficients, the dead zone is fixed at .*QP (0.5*QP on each side of zero). Since the increase in dead zone size only affects AC coefficients, the quality of smooth regions is often better preserved since DC coefficients are no more likely to be \u201czeroed-out\u201d than when using quantizers with smaller dead zones. Since humans are perceptually sensitive to quality degradation in smooth regions, visual quality in video with prominent smooth regions can be improved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 8"],"b":["1100","800","1100"]},"At , an encoder selects a picture type for a current picture, for example, as described with reference to .","At , the encoder determines whether or not the current picture is a B-picture. At , if the current picture is a B-picture, the encoder selects a non-uniform quantizer for the current B-picture, where the dead zone for AC coefficients at each QP is equal to 1.6*QP. At , if the current picture is not a B-picture, the encoder selects a uniform quantizer for the current picture, where the dead zone for AC coefficients at each QP is equal to 1.2*QP. With the non-uniform quantizer, the dead zone for AC coefficients is greater than those used for other picture types, but the dead zone for DC coefficients remains the same.","At , the encoder applies the selected quantizer to the current picture, for example, as described with reference to . The encoder can then process other pictures in the sequence ().","Alternatively, an encoder performs adaptive B-picture quantization in other ways. For example, dead zones can be increased for both AC coefficients and DC coefficients. Dead zone ratios can be larger or smaller for different ranges of QPs. The size of dead zones can be larger or smaller relative to QP size. Dead zones can be calculated not as a function of specific QPs, but in some other way.","Example Implementation","In one implementation, an encoder uses an explicit quantization signaling mode. The signaling in the bitstream is different for B-pictures and I-pictures and P-pictures.","First, the encoder signals a 2-bit Quantizer Specifier (QUANTIZER) in a sequence header. QUANTIZER indicates the quantizer used for the sequence. The quantizer types are represented according to Table 3 below. To use an explicit signaling mode, the encoder sets QUANTIZER to 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Signaling quantizer type"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Value","Meaning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","Quantizer implicitly specified at frame level"]},{"entry":["1","Quantizer explicitly specified at frame level"]},{"entry":["2","Non-uniform quantizer used for all frames"]},{"entry":["3","Uniform quantizer used for all frames"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In each frame header, the encoder specifically signals whether uniform or non-uniform quantization is used with bitstream element PQUANTIZER. If PQUANTIZER=0, the non-uniform quantizer is used for the frame. If PQUANTIZER=1, the uniform quantizer is used. In this implementation, for B-pictures, the encoder always signals PQUANTIZER=1 because the encoder always uses a non-uniform quantizer in order to increase the dead zone size. For other picture types, the encoder signals PQUANTIZER=0. Or, the encoder switches between PQUANTIZER=0 and PQUANTIZER=1 for other picture types, depending on selection criteria such as region smoothness, picture complexity, or rate constraints.","In explicit mode, whether PQUANTIZER=0 or PQUANTIZER=1, the quantization step size parameter (PQUANT) for a frame is the same value as the frame quantizer index (PQINDEX) for the frame. (The quantization step size can be further varied within a frame for different macroblocks or areas of the frame.)","Using a non-uniform quantizer for B-pictures is more efficient than other quantization settings in many scenarios. In testing, example video sequences were encoded using a non-uniform quantizer for B-pictures, with explicit quantizer signaling. The results were compared to an implicit quantization mode (see Table 2, above) where B-picture dead zones were selected and signaled using the same mechanisms as for I-pictures and P-pictures. For the I-pictures and P-pictures in the testing, PQUANT values and quantizers from the implicit quantization mode were re-used but explicitly signaled. The tests showed noticeable improvement for explicit signaling (and increased B-picture dead zones) over implicit quantization.","Alternatively, an encoder signals encoder decisions in some other way. For example, quantization decisions indicated above as being signaled at a particular syntax level can instead be signaled at some other level.
