{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The invention claimed herein was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement between Piramed Limited and Genentech, Inc.","This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/795,048 that was filed on 26 Apr. 2006. The entire content of this provisional application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives and their use as inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).","Phosphatidylinositol (hereinafter abbreviated as \u201cPI\u201d) is one of a number of phospholipids found in cell membranes. In recent years it has become clear that PI plays an important role in intracellular signal transduction. In the late 1980s, a PI3 kinase (PI3K) was found to be an enzyme which phosphorylates the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (D. Whitman et al, 1988, Nature, 332, 664).","PI3K was originally considered to be a single enzyme, but it has now been clarified that a plurality of subtypes are present in PI3K. Each subtype has its own mechanism for regulating activity. Three major classes of PI3Ks have been identified on the basis of their in vitro substrate specificity (B. Vanhaesebroeck, 1997, Trend in Biol. Sci, 22, 267). Substrates for class I PI3Ks are PI, PI 4-phosphate (PI4P) and PI 4,5-biphosphate (PI (4,5)P2). Class I PI3Ks are further divided into two groups, class Ia and class Ib, in terms of their activation mechanism. Class Ia PI3Ks include PI3K p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b4 subtypes, which transmit signals from tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors. Class Ib PI3K includes a p110\u03b3 subtype activated by a G protein-coupled receptor. PI and PI(4)P are known as substrates for class II PI3Ks. Class II PI3Ks include PI3K C2\u03b1, C2\u03b2 and C2\u03b3 subtypes, which are characterized by containing C2 domains at the C terminus. The substrate for class III PI3Ks is PI only.","In the PI3K subtypes, the class Ia subtype has been most extensively investigated to date. The three subtypes of class Ia are heterodimers of a catalytic 110 kDa subunit and regulatory subunits of 85 kDa or 55 kDa. The regulatory subunits contain SH2 domains and bind to tyrosine residues phosphorylated by growth factor receptors with a tyrosine kinase activity or oncogene products, thereby inducing the PI3K activity of the p110 catalytic subunit which phosphorylates its lipid substrate. Thus, the class Ia subtypes are considered to be associated with cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.","There continues to be a need for class I PI3 kinase inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The PI3 kinase\/Akt\/PTEN pathway is thus an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation, reverse the repression of apoptosis and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agents in cancer cells. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been reported (Yaguchi et al (2006) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 98(8):545-556; U.S. Pat. No. 6,608,056; U.S. Pat. No. 6,608,053; U.S. Pat. No. 6,838,457; U.S. Pat. No. 6,770,641; U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,320; U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,588; WO 2004017950; US 2004092561; WO 2004007491; WO 2004006916; WO 2003037886; US 2003149074; WO 2003035618; WO 2003034997; US 2003158212; EP 1417976; US 2004053946; JP 2001247477; JP 08175990; JP 08176070). Wortmannin analogs have PI3 kinase activity in mammals (U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,414; WO 97\/15658).","It has now been found that a novel class of fused pyrimidine compounds are effective inhibitors of PI3K with drug-like physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The compounds exhibit selectivity for class Ia PI3Ks over class Ib, in particular for the p110\u03b1 subtype.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound which is a fused pyrimidine of formula (Ia) or (Ib):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"72.98mm","wi":"56.05mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2 ","3 "]},"Another aspect of the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a thienopyrimidine or furanopyrimidine compound of Formulas Ia or Ib and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of the invention, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","A \u201cliposome\u201d is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and\/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug (such as the PI3 kinase inhibitors disclosed herein and, optionally, a chemotherapeutic agent) to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","An alkyl group is a straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radical which is unsubstituted or substituted. Typically it is C-Calkyl, for instance C-Calkyl, such as C-Calkyl. C-Calkyl is typically C-Calkyl.

Specific examples of the group Z include \u2014OH, \u2014CHOH, F, Cl, 1-hydroxyethyl, \u2014NHS(O)Me, \u2014NC(O)Me, \u2014S(O)NHMe and \u2014C(O)Me.","When the phenyl ring B is substituted it typically comprises, in addition to group Z, one or more substituents selected from halo, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, CN, NO, OR\u2032, SR\u2032, NR\u2032, C(O)R\u2032, SOR\u2032, SOR\u2032, SONR\u2032, NC(O)R\u2032 and COR\u2032, wherein each R\u2032 is independently H or C-Calkyl.","In definition (b) for Rthe heteroaryl group is unsubstituted or substituted. It is typically selected from indazole, indole, pyridine, pyrimidine, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, imidazole and pyrazole, each of which is linked via any available ring C or N atom. For instance, an indazole group may be linked as indazol-4-yl, indazol-5-yl or indazol-6-yl. Pyrimidine may be linked as pyrimidin-1-yl, pyrimidine-2-yl, pyrimidin-3-yl or pyrimidin-4-yl. Pyridine may be linked as pyridin-1-yl, pyridine-2-yl, pyridine-3-yl or pyridine-4-yl. Benzimidazole may be linked via N as benzimidazol-1-yl. Quinoline may be linked as quinolin-3-yl or quinolin-4-yl. Isoquinoline may be linked as isoquinolin-3-yl or isoquinolin-4-yl. Imidazole may be linked via N as imidazol-1-yl","If the heteroaryl group is substituted it may be substituted by one or more substituents selected from a group Z, Ras defined above, alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by a Ras defined above, any group specified above as an additional substituent on the phenyl ring B, and an oxo group (\u2550O). Typically, if substituted, the heteroaryl group is substituted by OH, OMe, NH, NMe, F or Cl. In one embodiment the heteroaryl group is unsubstituted.","In definition (c) for Rthe benzene ring is unsubstituted or substituted. If it is substituted it may be substituted by one or more substituents selected from a group Z, Ras defined above, alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by Ras defined above, and any of the groups specified above as an additional substituent on the phenyl ring B. The heteroaryl group to which the benzene ring is fused is itself unsubstituted or substituted, for instance by a group Z, Ror alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by a group Ras defined above; by any group specified above as an option for an additional substituent on the phenyl ring B; or by an oxo group (\u2550O). In one embodiment both the benzene ring and the heteroaryl group are unsubstituted.","Groups included in definitions (b) and (c) for Ras defined above include the following

contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention.","In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional-isomers. For example, if a Formula Ia and Ib compound incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures thereof, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers are also within the scope of the present invention.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined. The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.","The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (H) and carbon-14 (C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","The compounds of the invention may exist in the form of geometrical isomers or tautomers depending on the kinds of substituent groups, and these isomers in separated forms or mixtures thereof may be used in the present invention. Where the compounds have asymmetric carbon atoms, optical isomer forms may exist based on such carbon atoms. All of the mixtures and the isolated forms of these optical isomers may be used in the present invention.","A suitable synthetic strategy for producing compounds of the invention as defined above employs the precursor carboxaldehyde of formula (IIa) or (IIb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0167"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00198","num":"00198"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00198","he":"72.98mm","wi":"57.57mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00198.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"2 "},"(a) treating a compound of formula (IIa) or (IIb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0169"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00199","num":"00199"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00199","he":"72.98mm","wi":"57.57mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00199.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2 ","3","15","3 ","15 ","15 "],"sub":["2","1","6 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0170"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00200","num":"00200"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00200","he":"72.98mm","wi":"58.08mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00200.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2 ","3 ","4","5 ","4 ","5 "]},"(b) treating a compound of formula (IIa) or (IIb) as defined above with an amine of formula NHRRwherein Rand Rare as defined above, in the presence of a suitable reducing agent; and treating the resulting compound of formula (IVa) or (IVb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0162","num":"0172"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00201","num":"00201"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00201","he":"77.05mm","wi":"60.71mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00201.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2","4 ","5 ","3","15","3 ","15 ","15 "],"sub":["2","1","6 "]},"Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing a compound of the invention as defined above, which process comprises treating a compound of formula (IIIa) or (IIIb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0174"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00202","num":"00202"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00202","he":"72.98mm","wi":"58.08mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00202.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2 ","3 ","4","5 ","4 ","5 "]},"The process may further comprise producing the compound of formula (IIIa) or (IIIb) by treating a compound of formula (IIa) or (IIb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0176"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00203","num":"00203"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00203","he":"72.98mm","wi":"57.57mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00203.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2 ","3","15","3 ","15 ","15 "],"sub":["2","1","6 "]},"The invention further provides a process for producing a compound of the invention as defined above, which process comprises treating a compound of formula (IVa) or (IVb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0178"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00204","num":"00204"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00204","he":"77.05mm","wi":"60.71mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00204.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2","4 ","5 ","3","15","3 ","15 ","15 "],"sub":["2 ","1","6 "]},"The process may further comprise producing the compound of formula (IVa) or (IVb) by treating a compound of formula (IIa) or (IIb):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0170","num":"0180"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00205","num":"00205"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00205","he":"72.98mm","wi":"57.57mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00205.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2 ","4","5 ","4 ","5 "]},"Both the amination step and the Pd-mediated cross-coupling step take place under conventional conditions.

The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention.","Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, aspartic acid and glutamic acid.","Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate \u201cmesylate\u201d, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include, but are not limited to, organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.","Typically the salt is a mesylate, a hydrochloride, a phosphate, a benzenesulphonate or a sulphate. Most typically the salt is a mesylate or a hydrochloride.","The salts, for instance salts with any of the inorganic or organic acids mentioned above, may be mono-salts or bis-salts. Thus, for example, the mesylate salt may be the mono-mesylate or the bis-mesylate.","A fused pyrimidine of the invention and its salts may exist as a solvate or a hydrate. A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.","Biological Activity","Compounds of the present invention have been found in biological-tests to be inhibitors of PI3 kinase. Determination of the activity of PI3 kinase activity of a compound of the present invention is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were prepared, characterized, and assayed for their PI3K binding activity (Example 7). Certain exemplary compounds of the invention had PI3K binding activity ICvalues less than 50 uM.","The compounds of the present invention may inhibit p110 catalytic subunit isoforms including alpha, beta, gamma, and delta as pan inhibitors. Certain compounds of the invention may be p110 isoform selective inhibitors by selectively inhibiting one of one of the p110 isoforms; alpha, beta, gamma, or delta. A p110 selective inhibitor may mitigate the risk of toxicity due to potential toxicities associated with inhibiting the other p110 isoforms. Certain compounds of the invention may be p110 isoform pan inhibitors by possessing significant binding to two or more of the p110 isoforms.","Binding of compounds of the invention from above Tables 1a and 1b to purified preparations of p110 isoforms alpha, beta, delta, and gamma was measured by a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) to determine binding activity (IC\u03bcMol) and selectivity of binding of beta, delta, and gamma isoforms relative to alpha (Example 8). These values are expressed in Table 2.","A compound of the present invention may be used as an inhibitor of PI3 kinase, in particular of a class Ia PI3 kinase. The compounds are typically selective for class Ia kinases over class Ib and typically exhibit a 20-fold selectivity for class Ia over class Ib PI3 kinases. In particular the compounds are selective for the p110alpha isoform.","Accordingly, a compound of the present invention can be used to treat a disease or disorder arising from abnormal cell growth, function or behaviour. Such abnormal cell growth, function or behaviour is typically associated with PI3 kinase. Examples of such diseases and disorders are discussed by Drees et al in Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2004) 14(5):703-732. These include cancer, immune disorders, cardiovascular disease, viral infection, inflammation, metabolism\/endocrine disorders and neurological disorders. Examples of metabolism\/endocrine disorders include diabetes and obesity.","Examples of cancers which the present compounds can be used to treat include leukaemia, brain tumours, renal cancer, gastric cancer and cancer of the skin, bladder, breast, uterus, lung, colon, prostate, ovary and pancreas. A human or animal patient suffering from an immune disorder, cancer, cardiovascular disease, viral infection, inflammation, a metabolism\/endocrine disorder or a neurological disorders may thus be treated by a method comprising the administration thereto of a compound of the present invention as defined above. The condition of the patient may thereby be improved or ameliorated.","Diseases and conditions treatable according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, cancer, stroke, diabetes, hepatomegaly, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, viral disease, autoimmune diseases, atherosclerosis, restenosis, psoriasis, allergic disorders, inflammation, neurological disorders, a hormone-related disease, conditions associated with organ transplantation, immunodeficiency disorders, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, conditions associated with cell death, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), liver disease, pathologic immune conditions involving T cell activation, and CNS disorders in a patient. In one embodiment, a human patient is treated with a compound of Formula Ia or Ib and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle, wherein said compound of Formula Ia or Ib is present in an amount to detectably inhibit PI3 kinase activity.","Cancers which can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, genitourinary tract, esophagus, larynx, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, stomach, skin, keratoacanthoma, lung, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bone, colon, adenoma, pancreas, adenocarcinoma, thyroid, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, seminoma, melanoma, sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, liver carcinoma and biliary passages, kidney carcinoma, myeloid disorders, lymphoid disorders, hairy cells, buccal cavity and pharynx (oral), lip, tongue, mouth, pharynx, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's and leukemia.","Cardiovascular diseases which can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, restenosis, cardiomegaly, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure.","Neurodegenerative disease which can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury, glutamate neurotoxicity and hypoxia.","Inflammatory diseases which can be treated according to the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and delayed hypersensitivity reactions.","In addition to possessing biochemical potency a compound of the invention exhibits physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties which makes it particularly well adapted for drug use. This is shown for instance in the results of the biological assays described in Example 5 which follows. In particular the compound possesses high aqueous solubility at physiological pH; the solubility is greater than 100 \u03bcM. High solubility at physiological pH is desirable since it promotes bioavailability.","The compound also possesses high metabolic stability, as shown in particular by the hepatocyte clearance assay described in Example 2 in which the compound was shown to have low hepatocyte clearance. Low hepatocyte clearance correlates with a low rate of liver metabolism. It can therefore be seen that the compound of the present invention possess improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties whilst retaining biochemical potency as an inhibitor of PI3 kinase.","A compound of the present invention can be administered in a variety of dosage forms, for example orally such as in the form of tablets, capsules, sugar- or film-coated tablets, liquid solutions or suspensions or parenterally, for example intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously. The compound may therefore be given by injection or infusion.","The dosage depends on a variety of factors including the age, weight and condition of the patient and the route of administration. Daily dosages can vary within wide limits and will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. Typically, however, the dosage adopted for each route of administration when a compound is administered alone to adult humans is 0.0001 to 50 mg\/kg, most commonly in the range of 0.001 to 10 mg\/kg, body weight, for instance 0.01 to 1 mg\/kg. Such a dosage may be given, for example, from 1 to 5 times daily. For intravenous injection a suitable daily dose is from 0.0001 to 1 mg\/kg body weight, preferably from 0.0001 to 0.1 mg\/kg body weight. A daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or according to a divided dose schedule.","Typically a dose to treat human patients may range from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of a compound of the invention. A typical dose may be about 100 mg to about 300 mg of the compound. A dose may be administered once a day (QID), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.","A compound is formulated for use as a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition also comprising a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or diluent. The compositions are typically prepared following conventional methods and are administered in a pharmaceutically or veterinarily suitable form. The compound may be administered in any conventional form, for instance as follows:","A) Orally, for example, as tablets, coated tablets, dragees, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, liquid solutions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.","Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, dextrose, saccharose, cellulose, corn starch, potato starch, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, maize starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; lubricating agents, for example silica, magnesium or calcium stearate, stearic acid or talc; effervescing mixtures; dyestuffs, sweeteners, wetting agents such as lecithin, polysorbates or lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Such preparations may be manufactured in a known manner, for example by means of mixing, granulating, tableting, sugar coating or film coating processes.","Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is present as such, or mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.","The said aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","Oily suspension may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol.","Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by this addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids an hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan mono-oleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. In particular a syrup for diabetic patients can contain as carriers only products, for example sorbitol, which do not metabolise to glucose or which only metabolise a very small amount to glucose.","Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and coloring agents;","B) Parenterally, either subcutaneously, or intravenously, or intramuscularly, or intrasternally, or by infusion techniques, in the form of sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing of wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic paternally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol.","Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables;","C) By inhalation, in the form of aerosols or solutions for nebulizers;","D) Rectally, in the form of suppositories prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and poly-ethylene glycols;","E) Topically, in the form of creams, ointments, jellies, collyriums, solutions or suspensions.","F) Vaginally, in the form of pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","Sustained-release preparations of a compound of the invention may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","A compound of the invention may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of the invention is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of the invention such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of the invention, in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The invention will be further described in the Examples which follow:","The following general procedures A, B and C are referred to in the subsequent Examples and Reference Examples:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0239"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00210","num":"00210"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00210","he":"149.35mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08802670-20140812-C00210.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Substituted 2-chloro-4-morpholinothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine or 2-chloro-4-morpholinothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine was combined with 1.5 equivalents of 4-(4,4,5,5-tertamethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)1H-indazole (alternatively, a variety of boronic acids or boronic esters can be used in place of the indazole boronic ester indicated) and dissolved in 3.0 equivalents of sodium carbonate as a 1 molar solution in water and an equal volume of acetonitrile.

Assessment of compound permeability was subsequently conducted. The compounds were applied to the apical surface (A) of cell monolayers and compound permeation into the basolateral (B) compartment was measured. This was performed in the reverse direction (B-A) to investigate active transport. A permeability coefficient value, P, for each compound, a measure of the rate of permeation of the compound across the membrane, was calculated. Compounds were grouped into low (P<\/=1.0\u00d710cm\/s) or high (P>\/=1.0\u00d710cm\/s) absorption potential based on comparison with control compounds with established human absorption.","For assessment of a compound's ability to undergo active efflux, the ratio of basolateral (B) to apical (A) transport compared with A to B was determined. Values of B-A\/A-B>\/=1.0 indicated the occurrence of active cellular efflux. All of the compounds tested through the Caco-2 permeability screen had Pvalues >\/=1.0\u00d710cm\/s. One compound assessed through the bidirectional assay, PI540, had an B-A\/A-B asymmetry index of less than 1.0, indicating that the compound does not undergo active cellular efflux.","(iv) Hepatocyte Clearance","Suspensions of cryopreserved human hepatocytes were used. Incubations were performed at compound concentration of 1 mM or 3 \u03bcM at a cell density of 0.5\u00d710viable cells\/mL. The final DMSO concentration in the incubation was 0.25%. Control incubations were also performed in the absence of cells to reveal any non-enzymatic degradation. Duplicate samples (50 \u03bcL) were removed from the incubation mixture at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes (control sample at 60 minutes only) and added to methanol\u2014containing internal standard (100 \u03bcL)\u2014to terminate the reaction. Tolbutamide, 7-hydroxycoumarin, and testosterone were used as control compounds. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants at each time point pooled for analysis by LC-MSMS. From a plot of ln peak area ratio (parent compound peak area\/internal standard peak area) against time, intrinsic clearance (CL) was calculated as follows: CL(\u03bcl\/min\/million cells)=V\u00d7k, where k is the elimination rate constant, obtained from the gradient of ln concentration plotted against time; V is a volume term derived from the incubation volume and is expressed as uL 10cells.","Compounds were classified with low (CL<\/=4.6 \u03bcL\/min\/10cells), medium (CL>\/=4.6; <\/=25.2 \u03bcl\/min\/10cells) and high (>\/=25.2 \u03bcl\/min\/10cells) clearance.

Probe substrates for CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were added for 30 minutes and 1 hour before the end of the incubation. At 72 hours, cells and media were removed and the extent of metabolism of each probe substrate quantified by LC-MS\/MS. The experiment was controlled by using inducers of the individual P450s incubated at one concentration in triplicate. The compounds of the invention assessed in this assay showed negligible effects on induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes.","(vii) Plasma Protein Binding","Solutions of test compound (5 um, 0.5% final DMSO concentration) were prepared in buffer and 10% plasma (v\/v in buffer). A 96 well HT dialysis plate was assembled so that each well was divided in two by a semi-permeable cellulose membrane. The buffer solution was added to one side of the membrane and the plasma solution to the other side; incubations were then conducted at 37\u00b0 C. over 2 hours in triplicate. The cells were subsequently emptied, and the solutions for each batch of compounds were combined into two groups (plasma-free and plasma-containing) then analysed by LC-MSMS using two sets of calibration standards for plasma-free (6 points) and plasma-containing solutions (7 points). The fraction unbound value for each compound was calculated: highly protein bound compounds (>\/=90% bound) had an Fu<\/=0.1.

Cells were prepared in medium containing RbCl and were plated into 96-well plates and grown overnight to form monolayers. The efflux experiment was initiated by aspirating the media and washing each well with 3\u00d7100 \u03bcL of pre-incubation buffer (containing low [K]) at room temperature. Following the final aspiration, 50 \u03bcL of working stock (2\u00d7) compound was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. 50 \u03bcL of stimulation buffer (containing high [K+]) was then added to each well giving the final test compound concentrations. Cell plates were then incubated at room temperature for a further 10 minutes. 80 \u03bcL of supernatant from each well was then transferred to equivalent wells of a 96-well plate and analysed via atomic emission spectroscopy.
