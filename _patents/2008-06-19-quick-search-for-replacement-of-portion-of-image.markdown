The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software, data, and\/or screenshots that may be illustrated below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright\u00a9 2008, Adobe Systems Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and, in one specific example, the manipulation of images.","Images may be easily manipulated using anyone of a number of image editing software applications. These image editing applications may allow for a user to resize an image, change the color in an image, or perform any one of a number of operations on an image. These image editing applications may be stand alone applications that do not require network connectivity to operate.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of an example embodiment of the present invention. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention will be practiced without these specific details.","In some example embodiments, a system and method is illustrated for augmenting an image with an additional image or portion thereof (collectively an image) to create an augmented image. This augmentation may be facilitated through the searching and retrieval of an image that includes characteristics (e.g., data) similar to the characteristics in the image that is being augmented. A characteristic may include color histograms, an image pattern, a bit value and associated codec, or macro-block matching. A color code may be included in the characteristic(s), where a color code is a hexadecimal representation of a color. For example, a first image of a bridge (e.g., a characteristic, or collection of characteristics) may be augmented with a second image of the same bridge, where the second image shows aspects of the bridge that a user would like to include in the first image. The image may be a photo that is a two-dimensional artifact. The first image and second image may be formatted using a Joint Photographic Experts Group Format (JPEG), a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), a Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), or some other suitable file format. These file formats may be referenced below as codecs.","In some example embodiments, the system and method is shown for augmenting an image with an additional image using pixel values to denote a portion of the image to augment. In one example embodiment, selection input may be received denoting a portion of an image that is to be augmented with an additional image. Augment may mean to increase, to replace, to add, or to create. A search may be conducted using the selection input such that the potion of the image may be searched for in a native database, or within a network environment. Search may be based upon characteristics of an image, or some other suitable basis.","In some example embodiments, the system and method is shown for augmenting an image with an additional image using computers organized in a client-server arrangement. A client computer may have a web browser or other suitable Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), or eXtensible Markup Language (XML) interpreter, and client engine operatively coupled to the web browser. The client engine may be a FLASH\u2122, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), ACTIVE X\u2122, a SILVERLIGHT\u2122, MOONLIGHT\u2122, or Java client engine. This client engine is referenced herein as a plug-in. One or more devices may act as a client computer. A server computer may be an application server, web server, or some combination of an application server and a web server. An image editing server, or social networking server may be a server computer. An image editing server may be a server that allows for a client computer to augment an image with an additional image. A social networking server may be a server that executes software to build online social networks for communities of people (e.g., natural persons or legal entities such as corporations) who share interests and activities or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others.","In some example embodiments, the system and method is shown for augmenting an image with an additional image that may include the image editing server retrieving an image to augment another image. The augmentation itself may be executed by the plug-in. In one example embodiment, the client computer receives the additional image as an image search result that may be manipulated by a user. Further, the client computer receives input to manipulate the image received as part of the search result into a position in a GUI. A result of this manipulation, the image is augmented with the additional image to create an augmented image.","In some example embodiments, the system and method is shown for posting the augmented image (e.g., as a modified image with a search result) on a social networking web page for a particular user. A social network server may provide the functionality to request and augment an image with an additional image. This functionality may be accessed by the client computer, such that the social networking server may act as an intermediary (see below figures) between the client computer and the image editing server.","In some example embodiments, augmenting may include the alignment of two more images based upon the continuity of bit values. For example, an image may be augmented with an additional image where the characteristics represented in each image is similar. Similarity may be based upon using a probability algorithm to determine if the characteristic is present in both images. This similarity may be based upon bits values, or metadata and the similarity between the bit values in the image and the additional image.","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","103","108","103","108","103","104","105","106","131","103","107","107","108","108"]},"In some example embodiments, the search request  is transmitted across a network  to be received by an image editing server .

In this, the case of a database using cubes and MDX, a database using Multidimensional On Line Analytic Processing (MOLAP), Relational On Line Analytic Processing (ROLAP), Hybrid Online Analytic Processing (HOLAP), or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. The tables or cubes made up of tables, in the case of, for example, ROLAP, are organized into an RDS or Object Relational Data Schema (ORDS), as is known in the art. These schemas may be normalized using certain normalization algorithms so as to avoid abnormalities such as non-additive joins and other problems. Additionally, these normalization algorithms may include Boyce-Codd Normal Form or some other normalization, or optimization algorithm known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2300","2301","2302","2302","2303","2304","2302","2306","2301","2305"]},"Component Design","Some example embodiments may include the above-illustrated operations being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components can be implemented into the system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), or Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)), or other suitable technique. These components are linked to other components via various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and then compiled into one complete server and\/or client application. The method for using components in the building of client and server applications is well known in the art. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above-illustrated components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is located remotely from a second computer system including an interface level (e.g., a GUI). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The various levels can be written using the above-illustrated component design principles and can be written in the same programming language or in different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various levels and the components included therein to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, an operation written in C++ using Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) can communicate with another remote module written in Java\u2122. Suitable protocols include SOAP, CORBA, and other protocols well-known in the art.","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may utilize the OSI model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three-tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also includes port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet, LAN, WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":"2400"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a CPU, a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
