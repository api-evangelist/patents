title: Ranking results of multiple intent queries
abstract: Techniques and systems are disclosed providing improved ranking of results to an online search-based query. One or more user types are identified for a search-based query, and may correspond to a number of user relevant results, and which user results are selected. A user profile can be determined for the respective user types for the search-based query, which may identify a proportion of the users that belong to that type, and how many results are relevant to that type. A set of relevant results can be identified for the respective user types for the search-based query, based on a number of results used by the user type. An improved ranking of the results can be determined for the search-based query, from the one or more sets of relevant results, based on user profiles and a desired user satisfaction metric for a desired number of users.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/473,376, filed on May 28, 2009, entitled \u201cRANKING RESULTS OF MULTIPLE INTENT QUERIES\u201d, at least some of which may be incorporated herein.","The Internet is often used to find content of particular interest to users, such as relevant news articles, research topics, videos, and other content. When a user searches for content (e.g., they do not know an exact location for the desired content) they typically utilize web-based search engines, situated on search-based websites. Search engines index web-content and return results, such as links to content-based websites, to users based on a query posed by a user. Often, the user's query is broken down into keywords and the search-engine's index is searched for documents, such as web-pages, that may contain one or more of the keywords. Commonly, certain queries are posed by a plurality of users over and over again. Search-engines can collect data for the respective queries, such as which results the user selected, how many results the user selected, and which positions were the results that the user selected. This information can be stored and used to analyze user use patterns for search-engines, and the queries that are posed.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","While a plurality of disparate users may pose a same or similar query, such as to a search-engine, an intent for that query may not be the same for the respective users. For example, even a fairly non-ambiguous query term, such as \u201cHong-Kong,\u201d can have multiple intents, such as travel to Hong-Kong, attractions in Hong-Kong, maps for Hong-Kong, business in Hong-Kong, and much more. A preferred query results ranking system may be able to provide results for the respective major intents for a query. Further, a preferred ranking can provide quick reference and satisfaction for a majority of the users.","Prior ranking techniques utilize document content comparison with keywords matches from the query. For example, where a document (e.g., web-page) has ten references to \u201cHong-Kong,\u201d it may be ranked higher than one that only has five references to \u201cHong-Kong.\u201d However, content does not equate to intent. Further, preferences have been inferred and re-ranked based on user clicks, from data collected by a search-engine. However, these prior techniques assume that different users have a same preference for the resulting web-pages returned, that is, they have a same intent for the query.","Techniques and systems are disclosed that provide for an improved re-ranking of results for a query, that cover a desired portion of intents of the query (e.g., optimized for a majority of users), and can mitigate efforts by respective users of the query in finding the results that satisfy their needs. For example, where one type of user of the query is merely looking for one web-page that covers their content needs, a higher ranking of this result can lessen the time needed for the user to scan and select the result.","In one embodiment, where improved ranking of results to an online search-based query can be provided, one or more user types are identified for a search-based query, for example, where a user type corresponds to a number of relevant results selected and which ones are selected for the query. Further, a user profile can be determined for the respective user types, for example, which helps identify a proportion of the users that belong to that type, along with how many results are relevant to that type. Additionally, a set of relevant results can be identified for the respective user types for the query, which can be based on a number of results used by the user type to complete their intended task, for example. An improved ranking of the results can be determined for the query, from the one or more sets of relevant results, which may be based on the user profiles and a desired (e.g., optimized) user satisfaction metric for a desired number (e.g., majority) of users.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that provides for providing a ranking of results for queries that may have multiple intents, such as \u201ccardinals\u201d, which could refer to baseball, football, catholic church, birds, or an ordering of numbers. A position of respective results, for example, can attempt to satisfy a desired number of users (e.g., most) in a desired amount of time (e.g., quickest).  is a flow-chart diagram of an exemplary method  for providing an improved ranking of results to an online search-based query.","The exemplary method  begins at  and includes identifying one or more user types for a search-based query, at , such as a user query on a web-based search-engine. In one embodiment, there can exist a plurality of types of users, respectively interested in some subset of search results returned from a query. For example, when a query is made a user's intent for the query is often not known. In this example, one type of users may select merely one result and be satisfied, while others may select two or more until they are satisfied.","In one embodiment, user types may be characterized by a type and\/or amount of results they select. In this embodiment, users can be grouped into types by how many results the user selects to perform their desired task for the query, and\/or which results the user selects to perform their desired task for the query. For example, user types for a query may include, but are not limited to, \u201conly click\u201d where a user selects merely one result (e.g., merely a fourth result selected); \u201cfirst-click\u201d where the user selects a first result in a ranking of results (e.g., also second-click, third-click, etc.); and \u201clast-click\u201d where a user type can be characterized not only by the result selected that meets their needs (e.g., last results selected), but also a number of results selected until they reached the \u201clast-click\u201d (e.g., three total results selected with the fifth ranked result being the last one selected).","At , in the exemplary method , a user profile is determined for the respective user types for the query. In one embodiment, the respective user types can have a non-negative profile vector, which may be determined based on a number of relevant results that the user selects to perform their desired task (e.g., one user type may select three results).","In another embodiment, the profile vector may also be based on a probability distribution for the user type, where the probability distribution represents a proportion of users of that user type in the population of users for the query (e.g., twenty-percent of the users are \u201cfirst-click\u201d users). For example, a user profile vector may be weighted by the probability distribution for the user type, and have a length equivalent to the number of results selected by the user type.","At , in the exemplary method , a set of relevant results for the query is identified for the respective user types, which is based on a number of results utilized by the user type. In one embodiment, the number of relevant results for a user type can be based on the user profile, which identifies how many results the users of that type utilize in order to complete their task.","For example, a query may return ten results from an online search-engine. In this example, of the ten results, merely those results that the users selects until they are satisfied (e.g., relevant results) can be assigned to the set for that user type (e.g., where a user types selects a first, third and fourth result, these results can be assigned to the user-type set of relevant results). In this embodiment, the set of relevant results comprises a subset of the results returned for the query.","At , in the exemplary method , a ranking of results is determined for the query, comprised of the relevant results from the one or more sets of relevant results (e.g., the user-type sets, which are subsets of results returned for the query). In this exemplary method, the determination is based on the user profiles for the respective user types and a desired user satisfaction metric for a desired number of users. For example, for a query having multiple intents (e.g., a query for \u201cgiant\u201d may refer to a bicycle company, a food store chain, a movie, or other references) the results ranking can provide results for a large portion of those common intents for the users, in an order that allows the users from the respective user types to perform their desired tasks in satisfactory manner (e.g., optimized to allow a largest proportion of users to select their relevant results in a fastest time).","In one embodiment, the user profiles can facilitate determining the results rankings by using their respective weights, as a function of a proportion of users that select a result to perform their desired task for the query. For example, where a first result may be relevant to forty-percent of the users, and a second result may be relevant to thirty-percent of the users, the first result may be ranked higher than the second result.","In another embodiment, a user satisfaction metric can be used to determine the results rankings, where the satisfaction metric measures a satisfaction weight for the users. In this embodiment, the satisfaction weight can be a function of a desired number of users selecting a result to perform their desired task for the query in a desired amount of time. For example, where a third result is a \u201clast-click\u201d selection (e.g., a last selection of the respective relevant results from the user-type set) for twenty-percent of the users, and a fourth result is the \u201clast-click\u201d selection for fifteen-percent of the users, the third result may be ranked higher than the second result.","Having determined the ranking of the results for the search-based query, the exemplary method , of , ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","204","202","204","202","204","206","202","206","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","350","302","352"]},"As an example, in the exemplary environment  of , a plurality of users may pose a same (or similar) query  to the search engine , and a set of same (or similar) results  may be returned for that query . Various users of the query may select a variety of results, for example, based on their intent, such as to complete a desired task. A first group of users may merely select result one in the rank , and be satisfied (e.g., finish using the search engine for that query); a second group of users may select result two and four; a third group of users may merely select results one, four, and eight, while a fourth group of users may select each of the ten results.","In this example, the user types can comprise: type A, a \u201cfirst-click\u201d\/\u201conly-click\u201d type, having selected only result one; type B, a \u201ctwo-click\u201d\/\u201clast-click result four\u201d type, having selected two results with result four as the last one selected; type C, an \u201cthree-click\u201d\/\u201clast-click result eight\u201d type; and type D, an \u201call-click\u201d\/\u201clast-click result ten\u201d type. At , in , relevant results  can be selected for the user types . For example, a set of relevant results  for type A may comprise merely result one in the rankings , of , while type B's set  can comprise results two and four, etc.","Further, the user types  can comprise data that identifies how many users belong to the respective user types. At , in , the proportions of user for the user-types can be determined. For example, type A may comprise forty-percent of the users, type B may comprise thirty-percent, type C may comprise twenty-percent, and type D may comprise ten-percent of the users that used the query.","At , the proportions for the user types can be used to determine a user profile vector  for the user type. In one embodiment, as described above, the proportions can be used to weight the respective user profile vectors, for example, by giving more weight to user types that comprise a larger portion of the users of the query. In another embodiment, as described above, the profile vector can also have a length that is determined by a number of results selected by a user type. For example, type A may have a profile vector of length one, having a forty-percent weight; type two may have a profile vector of length two, having a weight of thirty-percent; etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","358","354","356","400","404"]},"For example, as described above, a user-profile vector can comprise a weight factor corresponding to a proportion of users in that type, and a length factor corresponding to a number of relevant results in the set of result for that type. In one embodiment, the weighted spread of proportions for the user types can correspond to the respective vector lengths from low to high. For example, as described above in , a weighted spread of proportions can comprise the user types: type A, of vector length one; type B of vector length two; type C, of vector length three; and type D, of vector length ten. Accordingly, the proportion spread can be: type A, forty-percent; type B, thirty percent; type C, twenty percent; and type D, ten percent.","At  in the exemplary embodiment , if the weighted proportion spread is non-decreasing, as in the above example (e.g., going from forty-percent down to ten percent across the weighted spread), the relevant results  for the respective user-types can be ranked. At , a satisfaction metric can be determined for the respective results. In one embodiment, as described above, the satisfaction metric can be based on a user satisfaction weight that is a function of a desired number of users selecting a result to perform their desired task for the query in a desired amount of time.","For example, as described above in , result one was selected by types A, C, and D; result four was selected by user-types B, C, and D; result two was selected by types B and D; result eight was selected by types C and D, and the remaining results were merely selected by type D. Further, a proportion of users that selected the result can also be assigned to the result, for example, where seventy-percent of the users (e.g., type A, forty-percent; type C, twenty-percent; and type D, ten-percent) have result one in their set of relevant results.","Further, the satisfaction metric provides for a desired number of users selecting a result to perform their desired task for the query in a desired amount of time. In one embodiment, the user satisfaction weight can be a function of the respective user types to be able to complete their desired tasks, for example, where type A selects one result, and type D selects all ten results. Therefore, type A may be satisfied after merely selecting result one, whereas type ten may not be satisfied until all ten results are selected. In this embodiment, the users being able to complete their tasks (e.g., having the respective results in their user-type set ranked) can be combined with the proportion of users for which the result is relevant, can determine a satisfaction weight for the result.","A  in the exemplary embodiment , the result having a desired (e.g., optimal or highest) satisfaction metric is selected to be ranked next. A first time through the - loop can yield a first ranked result, while a second time through can yield a second ranked result, etc. As an example, if forty-percent of the users are satisfied after result one is selected (type A), along with some of the needs for thirty-percent of the remaining users (types C and D), result one ( in ) may have a desired satisfaction metric (e.g., highest) and be ranked first.","At , a next result is ranked, looping back to . A satisfaction metric can be determined for the results that have not yet been ranked, at . For example, none of the remaining results (in ) can complete a set of relevant results for a user-type; therefore, a next-best result can be determined by the satisfaction metrics. While result two is relevant to forty-percent (types B and D) of the user, result four is relevant to sixty-percent of the users (types B, C, and). In this example, result four may have a higher satisfaction metric that result two, so it can be selected, at . In one embodiment, a type of weight-reduction greedy algorithm may be applied in the - loop that selects respective results based on weights, as described above.","If the proportion spread is determined to be non-decreasing, at , a plurality of results rankings can be created for results, at . In one embodiment, the results can be put in the respective potential orders for a number of relevant results. For example, if there are ten relevant results, there may be 10potential orders of the results. At , a satisfaction metric can be determined for the respective rankings, as described above, and the ranking having a desired (e.g., optimal) satisfaction metric can be selected, at .","If the proportion spread is determined to be arbitrary (e.g., having no particular order of increasing or decreasing, etc.), at , the user-profile vectors can be adjusted to spread their ranking weights in a non-uniform manner, at . In one embodiment, an interpolation vector can be produced that approximates the user-profile vector, which can produce values that can be fed into the greedy weight reduction algorithm, for example. After the vectors are adjusted the adjusted vector can be fed into the - loop for determining a ranking of results.","In this exemplary embodiment , the portion of the method can take the inputs  (e.g., from ) and produce a ranking of the relevant results  for the search-based query.  is an illustration of one embodiment  where relevant results have been ranked in accordance with the methods and systems described herein. In this example, a search-engine may have yielded a set of results for a query  (e.g.,  in ) having a certain rank (e.g.,  in ). In exemplary embodiment , the results  for the query  can be re-ranked  based on the user-profiles and a satisfaction metric, as described above.","In this example, referring back to the discussion of , the results are ranked  based on a proportion of users that utilize the respective results in their relevant user-type set of results, and that sue them to complete their desired task. For example, result one is selected by types A, C and D, comprising seventy-percent of users, forty-percent of which complete their desired task by selecting result one. This means that forty-percent of users will be satisfied by selecting the first result.","Results four and two are ranked second and third, respectively, as result four comprises a selection for sixty-percent of the users, and thirty-percent of the users can be satisfied after selecting result two, which takes care of seventy-percent of all users, for example. Result eight is ranked fourth , as another twenty-percent of the users can be satisfied by selecting this result. Therefore, for example, ninety-percent of all users can be satisfied in the first four results ranked , thereby accounting for them in a very short-amount of time (e.g., time taken to find and select a result). The remaining results can be ranked  to account for the remaining ten-percent of users who have all ten results in their set of relevant results.","A system can be devised that uses search-based results selection data to provide a re-ranking of results.  is a component block diagram of an exemplary system  for providing an improved ranking of results to an online search-based query. A user-type identification component  identifies one or more user types corresponding to a search-based query, for example, by collecting query result selection data from a search-engine . A user profile determination component  determines a user profile for the respective user types identified by the user type identification component .","A results identifier  identifies a set of relevant results for the respective user types identified by the user type identification component , where a number of results in the set of relevant results may be determined by the user type. A results ranking component  determines a ranking of results  for the search-based query, from the one or more sets of relevant results from the results identifier . To determine the result ranking , the results ranking component  uses a function of the user profiles for the respective user types and a function of a desired user satisfaction metric for a desired number of users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","602","750","602","752","750","602","752"]},"The user profile determination component  has a vector determiner  that determines a user profile vector  for a number of relevant results for the user type . The vector determiner  determines a probability distribution for the user type  that identifies a proportion distribution of users of that user type in the population of users of the search-based query. The results ranking component  determines sets of relevant results  for the respective user types , as described above.","The results ranking component  has a weight reduction component  that determines a ranking of the results  by selecting the result  that yields a desired user satisfaction metric for the desired number of users, where the vector is non-increasing over the distribution of user types for the number of selected results. The results ranking component  also has a linear programming relaxation component  that determines a ranking of results  by selecting a results ranking that has a desired satisfaction metric for the desired number of users, where the vector is non-decreasing over the distribution of user types for the number of selected results.","Further, the results ranking component  has a harmonic interpolation component  that is operably coupled to the weight reduction component . The harmonic interpolation component  adjusts the vectors  to spread a ranking weight of the respective vectors  in a non-uniform manner where the vectors are neither non-increasing nor non-decreasing.
